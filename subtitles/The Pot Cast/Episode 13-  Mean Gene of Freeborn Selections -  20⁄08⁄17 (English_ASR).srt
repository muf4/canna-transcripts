24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,879
experience with cannabis well I mean

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,700
there's different there there's layers

26
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:19,869
to that one my first experience with

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:23,770
cannabis and memory was actually being a

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:27,909
really little kid and and seeing seeing

29
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:29,409
cannabis growing at my house you know

30
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:33,700
when I was like 2 years old or something

31
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:37,509
and uh I remember like 1982 or something

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,760
my mom getting arrested for it the

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,530
roommate had a had her roommate had an

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,420
argument with the landlord or something

35
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,310
the landlord called called the cops and

36
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,129
yeah there's six plants on the back

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:52,299
porch or something like that you know

38
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:55,060
but as far as smoking I'd say I was

39
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,469
probably about I don't know I was a kid

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,600
man I was probably like eight years old

41
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:00,399
and I had a buddy who always you know he

42
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:04,538
had older brothers and they always had a

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,179
lot of weed and um whatever they were

44
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,868
totally house is for a crazy contraband

45
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:12,849
of all types

46
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:14,289
oh and I I remember you know them being

47
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,849
around and being like you know smoked

48
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:17,919
the joint smoked the joint was staying

49
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,599
the night at my friend's house and you

50
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,459
know I took a couple hits off the joint

51
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,150
and I didn't feel anything nothing

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,030
happened

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,860
and you know I probably didn't really it

54
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,409
probably didn't go past my mouth and I

55
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,390
was like you know okay cool well this

56
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,818
was nothing all right then I stayed away

57
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:39,250
from it and then you know a couple a few

58
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:41,530
years later I I smoked and I actually

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,039
felt it and I thought okay this is what

60
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,740
it was like

61
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:51,939
and then I think maybe I was 12 or 13

62
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:54,159
and I was with my buddy Jody and Jody

63
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:56,379
had this weed that he got from this dude

64
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,259
that lived in Napa and for whatever

65
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,759
reason that time I think it was probably

66
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,818
because of the way we smoked it we had

67
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,158
like this little

68
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:06,919
was like a little bottle with a little

69
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,748
down stem into it and a little tube that

70
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:13,309
came back up out of it like it was like

71
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:17,030
a miniature bong or a miniature chalice

72
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,639
you know and I remember I smoked that

73
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,199
with him and I remember telling him you

74
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,030
know this isn't wheat there's something

75
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,068
else in here you know that dude he gave

76
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,259
you he gave you weed that was laced and

77
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:29,208
you know those guys out Napa that I

78
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,218
don't know man they laced the weed and I

79
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,959
was so gone and I remember thinking oh

80
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:35,259
I'm gonna be in trouble my mom's gonna

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,359
show up and he's like dude it's like

82
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:40,429
1:30 in the afternoon and I'm like yeah

83
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,750

84
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,099

85
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,780

eight hours bro just have fun you know

89
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,109
and I just remember being like honestly

90
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,810
like probably like half blacked out

91
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,340
almost of being in and out of really

92
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,318
known what was going on I remember like

93
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,799
running around in circles by this pond

94
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,628
at the hog farm and just kind of like

95
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,790
falling down chasing him through the

96
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:10,429
through the water and the edge and just

97
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:14,120
like you know playing like kids do but

98
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,949
just high as a kite man and um that was

99
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,439
um that was the first time I remember

100
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:21,079
getting really like really going okay so

101
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,699
you can get this high awful wheat before

102
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,949
that it was like I thought I was getting

103
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,930
high but I realized that I was I was

104
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:29,538
just kind of you know dabble in and

105
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,389
tasted it and whatever so and what

106
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:34,069
strain do you think that was geez I

107
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,408
don't know man but I wish I had it now

108
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,089
because it was killer I mean I had

109
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:40,009
smoked a lot of weed before that before

110
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:41,929
that I had smoked Northern Lights I'd

111
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,310
smoked different like Afghani and

112
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,610
different crosses at different stuff

113
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,800
that was around you know like turn of

114
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,930
the 90s weed I probably that first time

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,418
I tried weed when I was probably like 88

116
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,400
didn't-didn't really just kind of smoked

117
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,978
it to not get made fun of you know and

118
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,810
then probably you know later on then

119
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:03,949
smoking like really killer weed but not

120
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,918
not smoking it so much but getting high

121
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:09,379
and then man I smoked that weed from

122
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,990
Napa and whatever that weed was it was

123
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,848
some major stuff because I imagine was

124
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,459
probably like hash plan or

125
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:18,498
something really potent um it just it

126
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,348
knocked me you know and I didn't get

127
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:24,860
that high again even smoking for maybe

128
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:26,538
another year or something and then then

129
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,610
I that was the first time that I smoked

130
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:30,348
a lot of Keef and that was the first my

131
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,809
first experience with a concentrated

132
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:35,149
smoke and and that really got me to but

133
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:36,529
strain wise man it'd be hard to it'd be

134
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:41,028
hard to say really what that would have

135
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:44,028
been but some bomb 1990 to whatever the

136
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:46,249
hell was there you know and nobody would

137
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:48,168
would really know back then you would

138
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,969
have just said oh this is this is either

139
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:54,678
this is either good leader bad weed you

140
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:56,658
know so yeah okay and so from that point

141
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:58,758
how did you then transition into growing

142
00:05:56,658 --> 00:06:00,438
was it the type of thing where from

143
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,538
these experiences it was just implanted

144
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,919
in your mind like I've got to do this or

145
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,509
was it more of the type of thing where

146
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,799
everyone around you is doing it so you

147
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,629
even even might make a conscious

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,389
decision to start growing it just it was

149
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:12,769
just like oh I just started doing it

150
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,538
well that was going on and people who

151
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:16,519
were older than me of course everybody

152
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:19,158
in the area was kind of growing but at

153
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:22,579
my age when I first started growing it

154
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:25,308
was more like um you know I used to work

155
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,629
with the family and you know like when I

156
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:29,569
remember being a little kid and like

157
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:32,449
transplanting some pansies or like some

158
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:34,789
little flowers for the yard and um you

159
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:37,069
know like supposed to water the water

160
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:40,550
the trees in the front yard and half

161
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:42,348
acid and and then at a certain point

162
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,269
just being like oh I want to grow one of

163
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:46,399
those plants you know and they were like

164
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:48,439
alright well you you know here this

165
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,869
one's yours this is your baby plant go

166
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,028
ahead and you know put this stuff in the

167
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,039
dirt and stick this in and you're gonna

168
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:58,278
water it and if you take care of it you

169
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,709
know you can have it and I was like ten

170
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:06,050
years old it was a Northern Lights plant

171
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:08,449
and that was kind of that was kind of my

172
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,309
introduction to it and then I you know I

173
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,129
I don't remember growing any other

174
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:18,289
plants until maybe I was probably like

175
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:20,929
14 that was 94 and you know I got some

176
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:23,538
killer seeds and I planted them and I

177
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:25,549
grew them in in in a big garden and I

178
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:26,689
just had my my few little plants I had

179
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,949
like whatever 10

180
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:33,199
sir ate plants and you know that the

181
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,849
weed that came off of that was you know

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,199
that was like basically my second try

183
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,000
that without weed was as good as

184
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,699
anything I've ever grown or still grow

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,029
to this day it was just a really good

186
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,860
place to grow and that was down in

187
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,439
Sonoma County it was a really good place

188
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,600
to grow I had the knowledge that you

189
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:54,040
know you should use all nice organic

190
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:59,930
stuff kind of you know

191
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:01,910
minimal handling slow cure slow dry and

192
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,819
great genetics you know so it really

193
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,460
came out and that was um you know it I

194
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,110
think anybody who really ever tries it

195
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,489
the first time that they get some good

196
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,350
weed in their hands from trying it

197
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,790
they're gonna go oh god I got to do this

198
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,820
I want to do this some more I want to

199
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,550
learn more aspects of this you know yeah

200
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:22,009
with that doubt and so what was the

201
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,650
catalyst for your first breeding project

202
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,060
was it accidental was it intentional and

203
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,909
a question I haven't asked anyone so far

204
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,220
did you stop breeding because you were

205
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,870
particularly inspired by someone or just

206
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,050
because you kind of wanted to just have

207
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,299
a crack at it I mean I'd say what

208
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,639
happened was probably that time like 94

209
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,769
I got some strains one of them

210
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,039
there was an Afghani called dirt that my

211
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:48,889
buddy had see money he had this um he

212
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,569
had this dirt plant and it was this

213
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,279
earthy Afghani so they called it dirt

214
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,250
and it came from a crew of people who

215
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,220
were big old-school growers back in the

216
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,610
day and this guy Randy brought it back

217
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,800
to the branch Kamaria which is in

218
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,600
Mendocino County he brought that back in

219
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:11,750
like 83 or 84 and so he gave me some

220
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,820
seeds that were across there was a dirt

221
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,779
cross big bud and dirt cross the thing

222
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,640
that they call purp out there and so

223
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,860
basically they were they were Afghani

224
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,720
crosses I had those I had some other

225
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,649
different stuff and then what happened I

226
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,269
think 95 or 96 my buddy said oh I took

227
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,069
that dirt purp and I crossed it with

228
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,509
Mark stuff from down the road you know

229
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,910
there's this guy named Mark he had

230
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,409
really killer Afghan ease we called his

231
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:39,459
stuff Mark's red because it always had

232
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:43,929
like more red hairs than than most

233
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:49,050
not not a not more abundant but that

234
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:51,729
they were at a more true red color and

235
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:54,250
so he told me hey you know I got the

236
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,409
this dirt purp cross marks red and he

237
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,200
gave me those seeds and he only gave me

238
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:01,028
a few maybe a six pack of seeds so I had

239
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,180
already had the dirt purp grown him

240
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:05,889
cloned them had a really good clone out

241
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:09,879
of the dirt purp at really good clones

242
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:11,620
out of the dirt big bud and so I said

243
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,269
well you know I wish I would have kept

244
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,980
the males when I cloned those plants

245
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:19,778
before you know a year or two ago so uh

246
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,930
97 I went ahead and I took those seeds

247
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:24,129
and I planted them in in one pot and I

248
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:27,669
let him grow up and they were just

249
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:29,559
little like knee-high plants and I let

250
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:32,349
him do a little open pollination and

251
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,028
then I got those seeds and then after

252
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,560
growing those you know I was I was

253
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:37,838
hooked because I started off with this

254
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,088
nice stuff and I wound up with a bunch

255
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,010
of seeds that were you know just as good

256
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,850
and a bigger number of them so I found

257
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:47,379
even better ones in there and you know

258
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,899
then the same then the first year that I

259
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:54,039
really got to grow those out in quantity

260
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,689
I think was probably two years later and

261
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,639
I grew out a bunch and I made a bunch

262
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,140
more seeds and I made it some different

263
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:04,179
out crosses and uh so that was kind of

264
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,819
you know really this really the start

265
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:08,739
and it wasn't the inspiration I would

266
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,240
say kind of came from those guys like

267
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,730
from from steve-o and c-money and these

268
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,528
guys who were who gave me the seeds and

269
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,300
I saw that Wow ok they gave me these

270
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:22,750
seeds and I got this and now I made

271
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:25,419
these seeds and I got this so it just

272
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,309
made sense to keep making seeds and try

273
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:30,789
to do selections and improve and

274
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:32,889
recombine and you know I had read High

275
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:34,509
Times since I was like 10 years old and

276
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,699
I saw the stuff from the cannabis cops

277
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:39,519
and you know people with seed companies

278
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,220
and it just all seemed really cool you

279
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,059
know to be able to like make your own

280
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,889
types of weed and keep around good ones

281
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:51,669
that were that your liked you know got

282
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,990
more seeds yeah so I mean just fast

283
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,088
forwarding to

284
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,850
20:15 for a moment when you got your

285
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,680
first first place with cherry lime at

286
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,629
the Emerald cup what was that like you

287
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,939
know to go from the guy reading the

288
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,708
magazines to now being the guy in the

289
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,560
magazines taking the first base type

290
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:11,588
thing well it was a trip it was kind of

291
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:16,689
surreal you know like um you think okay

292
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:18,399
was like all right I 2000-2006 my buddy

293
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,459
enters a plant that I gave him and he

294
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,379
wins second place of the Emerald cup

295
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,879
2007 I go okay well I got more stuff

296
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,500
from those same lines I'm gonna grow

297
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,519
some and enter it and see if I can do

298
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,528
okay the next year there's almost twice

299
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,240
as many entries and I still did 6th

300
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:37,990
place and I saw I was pretty excited

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:43,240
about that and then then that was 2007

302
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:48,250
and so then you know the next year hit

303
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,950
and in in autumn that year one of my

304
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,259
really good friends passed away and it

305
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,480
set me back like I was like not in the

306
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,129
mine state of going okay well I'm gonna

307
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,289
go ahead and and get this get these

308
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:01,269
entries together and do this stuff and

309
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:07,870
so I just kind of stopped doing it and

310
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:09,610
then 2000 2012 I went up and I entered

311
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,259
some stuff and I kind of my entries

312
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,120
weren't entered right I entered big

313
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,799
chunks of weed they had to pop them

314
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,659
apart for the judges so the judges

315
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,958
didn't get to see my trim job or

316
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:20,980
anything I might have done good all

317
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,389
right you know I might have still not

318
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,579
placed but I didn't do anything that

319
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:27,309
year so then the next year I go up I

320
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:29,588
kind of have some more idea like okay

321
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:31,328
the judges only get two grams only on or

322
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,790
two grand pleat pieces or they're gonna

323
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:35,588
pop your stuff apart they want to trim

324
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:37,929
really really tight which i think

325
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,850
usually makes really pretty we'd kind of

326
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:43,239
featureless so I don't usually I like to

327
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,860
show the features a little bit so I

328
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,509
realized okay well they don't care about

329
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,070
that they're just gonna take it crunch

330
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,629
it up and they're not gonna pull out

331
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,010
leaves or stems they're just gonna

332
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,980
crunch it up and smoke it so I better

333
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:57,458
make it like as close to a good you know

334
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,440
ready for smoking as possible and so you

335
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,059
know I improved it in that way and then

336
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,089
I took third and then the next year I

337
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:06,069
entered again I took second and then you

338
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,529
know when I won I took first so it was

339
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,028
kind of

340
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:11,328
weird to me because it was like I read

341
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:14,568
it at third I did second and went well

342
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:16,549
it would be you know it's not realistic

343
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:19,370
to think I'm gonna do third second and

344
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:24,078
that first so when I won first I just

345
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,970
kind of low is like okay and I mean you

346
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,289
can look at the video and look it up and

347
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,028
you can see when I'm up there I'm like

348
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:35,838
hey okay I just I just won the Emerald

349
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:37,429
cup so all right I didn't even know what

350
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,589
to do really it was it was a weird

351
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:42,349
surreal thing and I remember it didn't

352
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:46,459
really soak in until you know that night

353
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,939
we went and we went to this pizza spot

354
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:51,859
in Santa Rosa and we order food and

355
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:54,438
we're eating the food and I'm like hey

356
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,970
guys this is a victory dinner right here

357
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:57,740
you know we just won the cup right here

358
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,019
you know sitting with my family and uh

359
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,769

360
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:05,629
I was you know I was we were we the

361
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,578
Emerald cup was Saturday and Sunday and

362
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,110
Monday morning we were gone on vacation

363
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:12,109
the first family vacation I took my

364
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,180
family on so uh you know the whole thing

365
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,568
was just kind of this crazy like hey

366
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:19,308
that happened and you know you kind of

367
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:21,049
expected to have like an impact when it

368
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:23,028
happens like hey you just won and it

369
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,849
kinda it was like I want and I grabbed

370
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:27,620
my cup and I didn't really even realize

371
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,230
that I had won until dinner sitting

372
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,188
there you know so it was a trip and it

373
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,649
was it was really trippy because

374
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:38,750
honestly up until like 2013 I really

375
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,490
didn't know you know I had never been to

376
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,669
any other Cup except the Emerald cup

377
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:46,970
which was kind of a was kind of a little

378
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:49,028
local thing and I've never been to a

379
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:53,660
High Times cup I'd never met any other

380
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:55,669
people who who were like breeders who

381
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:57,198
were on the scene I know a lot of people

382
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,979
over the years who always made their own

383
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,808
seeds and and worked lines and stuff but

384
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,759
I didn't know anybody with a company I

385
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:06,469
didn't I had never seen any of that

386
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,058
whole scene that was going on I didn't

387
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,319
know about the forums I didn't know

388
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:11,419
people were on Facebook and Instagram

389
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:14,120
posting weed I don't even really know

390
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,649
Instagram on Instagram was just some

391
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,950
place people put up pictures of their

392
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:21,409
food and stuff you know and then a

393
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,910
that I will you know once once I kind of

394
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,949
started seeing it when I went on social

395
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,779
media totally changed so to all the

396
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,670
sudden go from being completely in the

397
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,769
dark and not know any of this stuff is

398
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:34,429
going on and then all of a sudden be

399
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:36,769
like hey I just won like one of the big

400
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:38,419
contests you know it really it blew me

401
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,419
away was a trip man it was a trippy

402
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:44,120
experience for sure yeah with that dad

403
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:46,789
and certainly deserving if we just take

404
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,279
a bit of a wine back for a moment how

405
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:51,139
did you make that progression from you

406
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,879
know you said you were making your own

407
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,500
seeds you had friends doing really well

408
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,200
with them how did you progress from that

409
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,379
point to being you know the head breeder

410
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,620

413
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:14,470

415

brought up some cherry limeade and they

426
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,649
saw the cherry limeade and they're like

427
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,360
dude did you enter this last year cuz

428
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,630
they had won that year you know and I

429
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:50,059
was like no I actually haven't seen it

430
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:54,860
till now this was it was a 4/20 party so

431
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:57,529
it you know 4/20 and um I I go no I just

432
00:17:54,859 --> 00:18:00,169
I just went and took this out this was

433
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:01,549
hanging up in the drying room I haven't

434
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,470
try even tried it yet you know and they

435
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,210
go dude they go if you would have

436
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,150
entered this you would have blown us out

437
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,190
of the water and I was like oh you guys

438
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,860
think so I go I entered the mother of it

439
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,390
but it's not that potent and this one is

440
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:17,059
crossed with the black lime so it might

441
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:21,440
have some potency to it and you know so

442
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:24,230
we smoked it and they were like dude

443
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,000
that's that's like that's the baddest

444
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,559
weed there is like we never seen nothing

445
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,039
like this before

446
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,750
and I was like okay well damn maybe you

447
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,789
know maybe I'll enter because I had kind

448
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,589
of come I had honestly gone like oh you

449
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:38,180
know I'm not gonna bother I don't know

450
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,589
I'm not just gonna give people weed for

451
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,570
him to tell me that it's good I already

452
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:45,109
know the weeds good I'm not into this

453
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:46,399
whole contest thing and so when they

454
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:48,619
said though that it was that much better

455
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,450
than the winner I was like whoa all

456
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,039
right well I'll enter this next year and

457
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,539
that you know so next year I entered it

458
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:58,309
and I got that's when I took third place

459
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:59,930
with it and so basically you know I

460
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,309
showed him different stuff I was working

461
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,590
with and I saw different stuff they were

462
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:06,139
working with and they were like hey you

463
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:08,539
know do you wanna um do you want to do

464
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,759
some projects together because you know

465
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:15,980
they they they lived like four houses

466
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:17,869
away from me at that point and so I was

467
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,400
like yeah you know I go I go you know

468
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,559
let you know show me some more stuff

469
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,330
they go you know and so Leo drops by one

470
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:27,049
day and he goes hey this is the rest of

471
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:29,029
the winner that won the the Emerald cup

472
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,829
and I looked at it and I went wow dude

473
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:34,879
that's crazy cuz that looks a lot like

474
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:36,529
what I call lime one that's my favorite

475
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,780
black lime clone that I keep around

476
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:43,399
that's a pique cross black lime and I go

477
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,139
you know we should do that cross and so

478
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,790
he goes I go you know do you have a male

479
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,259
of that that's that's proven that you

480
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,730
like and he goes yeah I got the pollen

481
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,190
right now coming out of the tent I go oh

482
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,839

483

485
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,130
and so I went ahead and I did the lime

486
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,220
one crossed with um with the chem that

487
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,310
he had and that's what black lime

488
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,019
reserve is you know and so I did that

489
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,470
one and I were I did a couple more

490
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:14,119
crosses with them and um that's just you

491
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,910
know that just kind of that just kind of

492
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:21,409
worked out to be that stuff you know and

493
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,509
so it was just kind of it was kind of a

494
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,250
trippy just just a weird luck kinda you

495
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:26,900
know like hey I want some of your seeds

496
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,849
and they're like hey you know your seeds

497
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,650
are your seeds are really good you want

498
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:31,730
to you want to do some stuff and that's

499
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,490
you know that's how it happened just

500
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,900
real organically like that yeah it

501
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,980
certainly sounds like some of the best

502
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,889
collaborations do happen on that

503
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,200
Organic side of things the question I'm

504
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:44,939
interested in is a lot of breeders or

505
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,069
you know companies will generally

506
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,750
describe their work as a certain style

507
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:51,210
you know like maybe someone would say I

508
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,769
tend to do like one parent will be old

509
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,480
school one will be new school you know

510
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:55,950
like kind of the merging of the flavors

511
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,808
or someone else might be like I just do

512
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,429
to new school things how would you

513
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:01,859
describe a fish in a day's work do you

514
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:05,850
think it follows a general style or not

515
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:08,250
particularly well I mean you know it's

516
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:10,408
it's the positioning on aficionado is

517
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,009
basically like all right this is this is

518
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:20,100
the best stuff there is this is the

519
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:21,929
stuff that you know growers who are

520
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,579
experienced want to grow this to get

521
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,159
stuff that's basically the highest end

522
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,808
product you know not necessarily you

523
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,278
know there's some people who are like oh

524
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,990
these are the monster this grows the

525
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,169
monster stuff every plant is gonna be

526
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,308
huge and heavy or this grows ladder

527
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,080
aficionado I'd say it's really aimed at

528
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:39,388
being something that's quality so that

529
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,769
you can say okay this is this is craft

530
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:44,099
cannabis this is boutique quality

531
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:48,028
cannabis and you know I'd say really

532
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:51,148
that that is the style that it's that

533
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:53,339
it's kind of shooting towards and then

534
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:57,569
also with like a little bit of added

535
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:59,548
Heritage stuff so that's why I'm leo

536
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:01,230
works with a lot of stuff like from

537
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:04,558
Mandelbrot because Mandelbrot at this

538
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,860
point is is kind of like a more of an

539
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,349
old-school staple breeder like you know

540
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:12,209
like royal cush is something that people

541
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:13,859
who are from around here they're like oh

542
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,569
yeah I've been buying royal for you I've

543
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:17,278
had oil for years I've been growing that

544
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:20,490
stuff for years now like a lot of the

545
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:22,319
old school growers I know if converted

546
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,450
over to old stuff like that and so you

547
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,250
know by kind of infusing that going okay

548
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,630
well here's something a Mandelbrot's but

549
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,669
then it's crossed with something that's

550
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,409
more new you know it's vents more like

551
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,149
it's not I wouldn't say Mandelbrot's

552
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:35,370
like a real old-school old-school

553
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:37,739
breeder but time flies so fast to the

554
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,979
point now where royal cush is kind of

555
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:44,669
like an old-school Emerald triangle

556
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,620
staple strain and you know like some of

557
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:49,200
the some of the chemists a few know it's

558
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,299
like yeah it's been around for a while

559
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,279
but I mean that's kind of the whole the

560
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,569
whole aim of aficionado I think is kind

561
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,399
of to say okay here's stuff that's

562
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:59,359
really high-end here's the stuff that's

563
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:04,759
really good in your joint in your bag

564
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:10,319
and it has you know some history to it

565
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:11,549
so you know like um I'd say that's kinda

566
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,079
that's kind of the thing and then

567
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:17,519
there's you know for me like as a

568
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:20,309
breeder personally like my whole thing

569
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,339
really has always been okay I want a

570
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:25,619
better plan like I want to grow I you

571
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:28,909
know I've honestly over the years I've

572
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:33,509
kind of slipped from being a proper

573
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:35,670
preservationist in that I tried to

574
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:38,220
always go okay what's the bet what's the

575
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:40,080
best possible thing so I had like some

576
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,940
Afghan EES they're too short they get

577
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,259
mold too easy then I cross them with

578
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,000
this I cross them with that now I have

579
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,619
the strain and now I don't even have

580
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,299
that Afghani anymore in some cases so um

581
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:53,159
for me it's all like improvement and

582
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,049
trying to have a plant that I really

583
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,330
want to grow and that when I show it to

584
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:59,159
people who are other growers who I who I

585
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:05,220
know they really want to grow that you

586
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:09,269
know so you know that's like the basis

587
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,440
of my work pretty much yeah okay and so

588
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:13,440
I mean if we just touched on one of the

589
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,750
points you made that heirloom slash land

590
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,180
race type stuff does pop up reasonably

591
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,460
frequently in aficionados you know the

592
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,740
line in general the thing which jumped

593
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,240
to mind to me is how do you resource

594
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,980
these types of genetics like they're not

595
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,269
there is certainly not easy type of

596
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,490
stuff to source like you know like I'll

597
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:30,599
and Afghani stuff like that I have to

598
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,430
imagine that would be some of the

599
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:37,759
hardest type of stuff to try to acquire

600
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:40,590
right yeah like I mean as far as like um

601
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,299
as far as like Highland Afghani that's

602
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:45,209
like that's something that Mandelbrot

603
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:48,029
God I think from Salmon Creek around

604
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,299
2003 or something like that I don't know

605
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,190
the exact story on that but um you know

606
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:55,769
a lot of like a lot of what efficient

607
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,559
auto stuff is is like stuff that comes

608
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:00,480
from Mandelbrot or that comes from

609
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,039
Shiloh where that comes from me like

610
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,809
guys who have been here

611
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,940
for a long time we're like the the

612
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:08,789
family vault purple that comes from a

613
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,559
guy named Larry who actually passed this

614
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:15,359
year he was a great dude

615
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:19,980
hippy Larry our crazy Larry and so you

616
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:22,109
know it's just a matter of people who

617
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,599
have these things and who have kept them

618
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:28,169
because they like stuff enough to not

619
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:30,119
just just switch over to commercial

620
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,390
mainstream clones I mean you kind of

621
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:35,639
have you kind of have of course there's

622
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,950
a million kinds of growers but you have

623
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,870
kind of two major subgroups in this area

624
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,029
you have people who either grow all

625
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:45,539
diesel and blue dream and they bust out

626
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:47,819
units and they make money or you have

627
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:51,930
people like there's people like me who

628
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:54,569
take a big hit on on money because it's

629
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:57,720
like okay I want to grow everything from

630
00:25:54,569 --> 00:26:01,439
seed like the last time I grew a clone

631
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,700
in my garden to actually grow weed from

632
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,650
it and not just to seed it for fun um

633
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,769
was probably ten years ago you know and

634
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,600
in between then and way back before that

635
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,329
there's probably only maybe one or two

636
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,579
seasons where I ever really you know

637
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:19,619
produced clones to Hass say okay I have

638
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:23,399
I have this weed and it's all comes from

639
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,679
this one clone like I I sacrifice you

640
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,040
know basically like ease of manufacture

641
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,190
I don't just go okay I'm gonna grow all

642
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,619
this so somebody wants all oh gee I got

643
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,360
all oh gee I'm like no I got a plan of

644
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,369
this I got a plan of that I got a plan

645
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,379
of this you know they're all different

646
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,599
because they're from seed and and even

647
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,310
if your stuff is is completely

648
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:49,289
consistent as far as like you know like

649
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:53,700
if you have like you know quote unquote

650
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:55,589
IBL stock it's like - you know you're

651
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,240
still people are still probably not

652
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,309
gonna take those plants and mix them in

653
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,809
the bag and if they do people might go

654
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,369
yeah I don't know you know I smoked one

655
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,720
joint out of that bag and it looked the

656
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,059
same as this other joint but the one

657
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,710
joint got me a little higher one joint

658
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,659
was a little tastier there there's still

659
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,190
these fine variations anytime you come

660
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,000
from seed it doesn't ever get to the

661
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,330
point where it's a hundred percent

662
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,859
consistent so you know people don't like

663
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,889
that

664
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:21,319
commercial stuff so the the main thing

665
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,420
is with sourcing genetics is you have to

666
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,399
track down the other set of people like

667
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,289
me who actually want to grow from seeds

668
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,000
so they still have seeds because most

669
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,399
people are like I don't need seeds dude

670
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,109
I just go buy OG clones I just go buy

671
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,450
cookies clones whatever is the flavor of

672
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:37,789
the week I'm gonna go buy that and I'm

673
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,769
gonna bust it out and and kill it and

674
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,210
that's all I want I don't want to mess

675
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:44,150
around with having a bunch of different

676
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,039
stuff you know but um if you really have

677
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,840
a love for like different genetics and

678
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,909
stuff then that's when you're gonna be

679
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,399
one of those people who says no I

680
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,410
actually have I have stuff like I have

681
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,490
strains I have old seed strains and and

682
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,630
they're they are unique because they um

683
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:02,058
they were bred by people who were

684
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,790
isolated for a long time so you know

685
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:06,529
that's how I have stuff and that's

686
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,029
that's where that's where that all that

687
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:10,009
kind of special stuff comes from when

688
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:11,329
people have it and then you know then

689
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:13,519
there's people who preserve things

690
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:16,548
through cloning which is awesome - you

691
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:20,418
know also really important but um but

692
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:23,918
it's definitely not quite as good as

693
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:28,040
having you know open pollinated

694
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,169
population of plants that come from that

695
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,960
gene pool instead of just one select

696
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:36,200
clone that's been around you know yeah

697
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,269
for sure and so you kind of almost

698
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,370
hinted at this idea I've been interested

699
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:42,440
in a while do you think there's any

700
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:44,569
value or maybe a better way to phrase it

701
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,450
is would you ever consider doing a

702
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:49,428
breeding cycle whereby the mother and

703
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,929
the father were from the same stock each

704
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:52,610
cycle but you know like you would you

705
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,530
were doing it from seed every time so

706
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:58,219
that each batch was kind of a little bit

707
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:59,599
unique within its own right well you

708
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,370
know that's really interesting that you

709
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,469
said that because I kind of have a

710
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:06,798
concept that I'm working on and I want

711
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:09,079
to see how well it flies that's how

712
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,609
people have grown weed for thousands of

713
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:15,710
years at the very least you know and a

714
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:17,839
lot of these like these people say oh

715
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,000
there's all this improvement and it's

716
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,678
yeah there's there's improvement but I'm

717
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,829
sure there's been points in history when

718
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,960
people had you know reached a point that

719
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,309
was similar to this or in certain areas

720
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,370
people have a

721
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,769
particular type that's a sir you know up

722
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:35,569
to the standards of today because you

723
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:37,309
know the way genetics work is those

724
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:39,319
traits have to exist in the original

725
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,869
stock in order to be able to lock them

726
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,869
down so maybe the old seeds weren't as

727
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:47,089
consistent but they still had all the

728
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:49,819
stuff we love in them today like people

729
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:51,500
are crazy over cookies and when I smell

730
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:53,839
cookies it's I'm like oh this is like a

731
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,799
hindu kush and the resin is a little bit

732
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:59,359
more waxy as opposed to being a little

733
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,559
bit a lot of the hindu kush might have a

734
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:05,389
little more dry feel to the resin or you

735
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,129
know like all the things that are hot

736
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,350
today i see those traits and they just

737
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,180
look like old stuff i saw from hippies

738
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:16,459
weed from back when i was a kid and when

739
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:20,420
i was a teenager so for me i always grow

740
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,309
from seed that i make basically over the

741
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,410
years maybe it's not last year's seed

742
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:27,079
maybe it's seed from five or ten years

743
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:30,110
ago or whatever but i always grow seed

744
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,720
that way so and and i really like it so

745
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:34,849
i'm kind of interested in maybe starting

746
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,670
to put out seed in that way where i say

747
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:44,599
okay this is cherry limeade numbers 1

748
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:46,820
through 20 from 2017 these are the

749
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:48,559
keepers out of you know run a big

750
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,539
population and go okay here's the

751
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,159
females that i like the very best there

752
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,559
was ten of them there was 12 of them

753
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,960
whatever these are really stand out and

754
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,019
then be able to release the seeds and

755
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,450
say okay here's cherry limeade these are

756
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:06,139
the f5s that i made from this line from

757
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:07,910
this year and then it's like people get

758
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,370
a window into the way that people

759
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,650
actually used to grow weed and get seeds

760
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,779
because everyone's into clones now or

761
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,670
they're into getting a breeding that

762
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,319
came from cloned parents and i have

763
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,450
appreciation for like all of those

764
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,579
different ways to do stuff and they're

765
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,590
all really good tools but at the same

766
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:27,500
time it's trippy because I don't see any

767
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:30,589
companies who are putting out seeds that

768
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:34,880
are made the way that weed growers have

769
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:37,399
been growing for you know all of history

770
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,830
so it's when you said that it's trippy

771
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,630
because it's something that I've really

772
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:42,029
been playing with going okay yeah I'm

773
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,610
gonna

774
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:47,399
this is gonna be the 2000 batch one

775
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:48,929
through 10 of this strain and people who

776
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,390
get that they get it and if you don't

777
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,370
get it then you got to get the 2018 you

778
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,920
got to get the 2019 they're all a little

779
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,419
different but different lines will come

780
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,460
out that way and that way instead of

781
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,720
providing the public with a really

782
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,450
narrow snapshot of the genetics that are

783
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,920
in a gene pool they actually get access

784
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,450
to the whole gene pool in all these

785
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,000
different little ways so that somebody

786
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,890
can go oh yeah well I made knockoffs of

787
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,720
this strain but you know they it turns

788
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,000
out they're knockoffs or this cool new

789
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,910
novel thing that they wouldn't have got

790
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,309
if I just take lime number one and and

791
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,840
lime male number one and I just put out

792
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,009
seeds like that and that's it because

793
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,019
they're only gonna get this little

794
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:36,480
window into the gene pool that way you

795
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:38,940
know yeah sure and so I mean I'm just

796
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,250
thinking I think the loss breeder who I

797
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,019
can think of who actually did that was

798
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,579
Tommy Hill when he did like the deep

799
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:47,819
Chum that was kind of open pollination

800
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:50,069
wasn't it as far as I know tom hill when

801
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:52,829
he did deep chunk yeah he just did open

802
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:54,539
pollination with that and you know

803
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:56,039
that's one that had been bottle necked

804
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,079
so much that it's one of the more

805
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,420
consistent strains i've seen from seed

806
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,189
but even in that you know there's ones

807
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,720
that are really hard and chunky and

808
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,370
there's ones that are really leafy and

809
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,079
loose and there's ones that are green

810
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:09,059
there's ones that are purple there's

811
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,470
ones that are sweet and earthy and then

812
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:15,450
there's ones that have to really like

813
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:17,460
the magic coffee Hindukush smell where

814
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,069
like when you smoke it it smells like

815
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,860
magic from a mile away and those ones

816
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:26,189
are really rare in those breedings but

817
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:28,799
when I first saw deep chunk I think he

818
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:31,200
released that 2004 is deep chunk but in

819
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,440
like 2000 I saw it as monkey balls in

820
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,230
spy rock and in those earlier ones

821
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,450
before the release I smelled a little

822
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,700
bit more of that old like what I call

823
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,440
magic purple indica that's just this old

824
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,750
Afghani where when you burn it it smells

825
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,480
more like a like a really good true

826
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:53,940
old-school haze or it's got that spicy

827
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,160
incense II funky light just really

828
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,289
special stuff to it you know but I

829
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,720
I think those were when he did that was

830
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,869
just an open pollination and then he

831
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,360
probably I don't know if he mixed the

832
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:08,339
females or if he just took his favorite

833
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,889
female and it had mixed males and he

834
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,210
only released him from one female or he

835
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,069
took all the seeds from a bunch of

836
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,460
females and put those in packs I'm not

837
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:19,919
really sure you know what he did with us

838
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,260
yeah it's interesting because I mean a

839
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,889
lot of his lines are just open

840
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,090
pollination of stuff he's had earlier

841
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,069
have you ever dived into any of the

842
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,140
other lines I know that the you know

843
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,059
he's has often got a good route but the

844
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,859
ones I'm more interested in we're the

845
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,989
ones people seem to have been less known

846
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,150
about like x18 I'm really interested in

847
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:42,678
no one seems to really run it too much

848
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:45,570
or pine ties yeah another one like that

849
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:51,000
you know the pine tar cush we used to

850
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:54,030
see back in the day people used to get

851
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,610
it from his family you know I went to

852
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,170
school with some of his family and so

853
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,490
his stuff would pop up like when I was

854
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,369
in high school and they just called it

855
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:04,139
the pine and my buddy c-money remembers

856
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,170
it more clear than I do I don't really

857
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:12,420
remember it I just know that um it's

858
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:16,470
dank and and you know like he says it

859
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,510
was super good and um you know like for

860
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:20,939
me back in those days all the weed was

861
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,500
so good that it was just kind of like oh

862
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,690
this guy's got this and this guy's got

863
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,280
that not that much stuff really stands

864
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,429
out unless I was the one who grew it

865
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,550
kind of for me but um but he but the

866
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:37,500
x.18 is another one I haven't personally

867
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:39,510
seen but Aaron from DNA said that that

868
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,639
really blows the deep chunk out of the

869
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,970
water that it's just a way better plant

870
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,739
with way better weed and so that makes

871
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:48,389
it interesting to me because you know

872
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:50,099
deep chunks one of these ones with crazy

873
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:51,719
mixed reviews because it's such pure

874
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,059
stock that people really love that

875
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,500
aspect but at the same time most people

876
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,360
don't really like to smoke it because

877
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,789
they usually only get a few seeds and

878
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,500
then they started with a pack and they

879
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:05,219
made some so they didn't ever see like

880
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,530
the older when it was really the line

881
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,419
was really more opened up and

882
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,130
so they haven't seen those special like

883
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,349
there's there's ones in it that are more

884
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,140
like a master Kush or a Hindu kameen it

885
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:20,460
is Hindu Kush but it's more of that um

886
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:22,469
classic classic funk to it so why not

887
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,420
when someone tells me that X 18 is way

888
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:26,639
better you know and I mean Aaron sees a

889
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,720
ton of weed too so I figure you know

890
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:33,269
that the X 18 must be killer and then

891
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:37,919
there was one I had a buddy who I used

892
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:40,019
to work for and he had this stuff and I

893
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,849
was like dude what is this this stuff's

894
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:43,619
incredible and he was like oh you like

895
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:45,809
that one and I was like yeah dude what

896
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,679
could you not like it as it has buds as

897
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,989
big as my arm

898
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,089
they're basically black and silver

899
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:53,609
because the weed is so purple and the

900
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,950
resin is so silvery white on him

901
00:36:53,610 --> 00:37:00,300
it smells like spray paint and ammonia

902
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:02,159
and skunk it was just amazing and you

903
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,080
know I was told that that was probably

904
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,699
the North Indian but then when I talked

905
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,349
to another buddy he said the North

906
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:09,539
Indians not really liked that it's not

907
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:11,460
quite so big then I saw Bodie run out a

908
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:13,380
little bit I only saw like maybe one

909
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:18,269
picture something it didn't really look

910
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:20,579
like what I saw so anyway Tom Hills dad

911
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:23,130
when I asked well what is this stuff you

912
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:25,619
know my buddy said oh this is this is

913
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:28,170
Tom Hill's dad stuff you know because um

914
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,549
you know Tom Hill was his buddy and he

915
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,139
had just given him a bunch of seeds and

916
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,960
said oh this is my dad's is my dad

917
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:37,079
strange you know and you know everything

918
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,840
that Tom Hill has as far as I know comes

919
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,599
from you know from his dad and and and

920
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,579
those guys that had worked with it over

921
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:49,980
the years in um in Mendo and so to me

922
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:52,799
that was the one that for me is one of

923
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,170
my holy grail strains and I still can't

924
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,100
really figure out 100% what it is it

925
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,960
might be the North Indian maybe if I can

926
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,210
finagle some seeds from bode at some

927
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,429
point and try some out I can see if I

928
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,740
see that one popping out and maybe lean

929
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:10,019
it back if it is it but I'm not really

930
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:13,379
I'm not really positive you know and

931
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:15,900
unfortunately to ask you know to ask

932
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,300
around to try to sort it back out I'm

933
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,190
sure Tom Hill would say my dad has lots

934
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,090
of strains and I'm sure my buddy would

935
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,159
go

936
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,329
no it's Tom Hills dad stuff it's just

937
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:29,670
the stuff chemist you know so that one

938
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:31,559
to me was incredible so if by any chance

939
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,450
someone ever tells you I have this stuff

940
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,389
from Tom Hill and it's gets these big

941
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:38,219
huge black and silver buds to smell like

942
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:40,559
skunk and spray paint pneumonia

943
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:42,599
definitely you know like if you got a

944
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,190
biome or you got a trade or you got a

945
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,469
fly somewhere together

946
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,659
don't worry get those suckers those

947
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:51,239
things are that that was a really really

948
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,069
incredible line and to me that was the

949
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,839
one that I saw from Tom hill

950
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,910
that was incredible I just don't know if

951
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,039
he ever released it I mean for all I

952
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:02,759
know it's x.18 you know what I mean

953
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,559
I just I've never seen x.18 I don't

954
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,100
remember the pine I don't remember the

955
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,170
pine tar cush really well I just

956
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,449
remember it was stony and it smelled a

957
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:17,400
lot like like a pine tree like cut and

958
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:19,769
pine you know and and that's that's all

959
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,380
I really know I have some I have some

960
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:25,309
haze that I got from from backyard

961
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:31,230
farmer at southfork seeds I have some

962
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:33,690
deep chunk cross Hayes F twos and those

963
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,760
probably have some really neat plants in

964
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,550
it my buddy at round table selections he

965
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,080
grew out some of them and he got some

966
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,090
incredible plants that looked really

967
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,549
neat like a deep chunk but very narrow

968
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,590
leaf which is kinda like the Achilles

969
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,930
heel of deep chunk it's cool to look at

970
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,090
but it lets in no light and it causes it

971
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:54,569
to really only get little buds on the

972
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,730
outside whereas the the monkey haze as

973
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,860
its called

974
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:00,480
it gets uh you know it lets the light in

975
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,059
so it gets these long butts they still

976
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,940
get the deep chunk color and you know so

977
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,039
for that's a neat one for sure yeah well

978
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,809
so many points you just hit on like I'm

979
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,309
a little total fanboy sorry I just I

980
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:15,480
need to clarify something quickly

981
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:19,199
he's the chemist Tom Hill's dad yes ha

982
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,449
ha all right cool I heard he might be

983
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:24,809
hanging out in Southeast Asia somewhere

984
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:26,819
still keeping on okay yeah I mean I

985
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:29,639
would imagine you know like I don't you

986
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,050
know I don't all I know is I was working

987
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:33,000
with my buddy and I said oh what is this

988
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,240
and he said that's Tom Mills that's Tom

989
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,059
Hill's dad stuff you

990
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:39,209
he's uh he's and at this point I didn't

991
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,579
I didn't know who Tom Hill was until

992
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:45,039
maybe two years ago or something

993
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:47,348
I just knew him as the guy who was my

994
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:51,849
who was my buddy's friend who came from

995
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:53,710
these killer seeds you know and and so I

996
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,440
said what is this and he said oh this is

997
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,539
Tom Hill's got stuff you know and he's

998
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,429
like he's like scientific with his

999
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,559
breeding you know he's like he's like a

1000
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:05,618
scientist and I remembered it for years

1001
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,150
as him being called scientist but it

1002
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:10,180
turned out I was talking to so I was

1003
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:11,950
talking to uh I was talking to backyard

1004
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:14,348
farmer and he goes no no is his name's

1005
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:15,669
chemist and I went that's right chemist

1006
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,140
but that's what my buddy said he's like

1007
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,269
these this guy's like a scientist with

1008
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:21,400
his breeding he knows all the tricks he

1009
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:24,880
knows all the ins and outs his strains

1010
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,639
are true breeding and so that that's how

1011
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,099
I know you know that's really who he is

1012
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,750
and stuff yeah just as a little side

1013
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:33,670
note quickly I've I've grown out

1014
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,380
probably close to 40 deep chunk females

1015
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,030
from this store I had probably falls

1016
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,460
exactly into the category you describe

1017
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:42,160
but only one of those was like kind of

1018
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,019
as you described that that magic Hindu

1019
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,838
thing and haven't been able to find it

1020
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:48,280
since I didn't clone it it's neat though

1021
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,159
when you get it right it's like coffee

1022
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:55,119
and earth and a little bit of any

1023
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:57,759
interesting oh yeah oh yeah it's

1024
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,950
interesting because you know

1025
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,080
quote-unquote indicas her you know

1026
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:04,689
broadleafs they they kind of get lumped

1027
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,779
into this category of being very kind of

1028
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:09,730
bland on the high but I've had some over

1029
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,980
the years I used to have this indica

1030
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,980
called big blue which i think is a

1031
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,539
different line from the same import as

1032
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,219
the deep chunk because it's pretty much

1033
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:21,190
the same plant and when I grow a big

1034
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:23,079
population a deep chunk I get ones that

1035
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,929
have the same form it's the one that's

1036
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,848
like as hard as a rock and it has the

1037
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:32,108
extra flavor and it gets the extra

1038
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:33,400
purple on the leaves and down all down

1039
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:37,420
all the way through the veins of the

1040
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,960
Leafs where it's usually white it's it's

1041
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:43,659
very like psychedelic and and laughy and

1042
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,280
giggly and cerebral and you would never

1043
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:47,799
think it from looking at this plant it's

1044
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,870
the definition of a boring

1045
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,789
broadleaf high when you look at the weed

1046
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:53,319
but when you smoke it it lays people on

1047
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:56,559
the ground with the gig loss per hour so

1048
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,300
you know yeah well I give him some seeds

1049
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,099
from a friend and all he told me was

1050
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,410
that that was supposedly from an

1051
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:04,809
unreleased Tom Hill line called the the

1052
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:06,339
blue Afghani and so maybe okay

1053
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:07,989
something to do with that I'm interested

1054
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,900
I'll have to get him haven't ya you

1055
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:13,629
haven't tried him ah no are they is with

1056
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,519
are they large seeds yeah I think I got

1057
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,300
about six or seven of them I'll have to

1058
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,320
get them again today

1059
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:22,740
yeah they look do they look like they're

1060
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,240
they're they're they're big muscle-bound

1061
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:28,000
look like a piece of rock and they're

1062
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,739
really big or they little seeds they're

1063
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,360
reasonably big but I know what you're

1064
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:33,759
talking about I've seen the real real

1065
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,680
big you know Afghani ones they know that

1066
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,930
but they aren't small ones by any means

1067
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,299
okay and that's interesting too because

1068
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:42,159
um you know like I generalize like oh

1069
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,769
that's what big blue seeds look like but

1070
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,389
the deep chunk is well like Bodhi gave

1071
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:48,730
me some of his deep chunk seeds that he

1072
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:50,859
made I was stoked on that and I was

1073
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,710
stoked in another way because they are

1074
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,690
small seeds and all of the ones that I

1075
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,519
do from my old stock that came from a

1076
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,460
friend at Tom Hills before the release

1077
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,409
they always have really really big seats

1078
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,780
so that made me know okay well this

1079
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:08,019
might be a little bit different of a leg

1080
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:10,330
of that line you know so do you think

1081
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:12,309
that the the size of the seed is

1082
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:14,110
entirely dependent on the genetics or do

1083
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:16,360
you think it also has some part to do

1084
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,670
with when the pollination occurs in you

1085
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,550
know the general timeframe of the plants

1086
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,980
life cycle well I would say that when

1087
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:27,010
you start with the pollination where

1088
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,019
you're you're in very early flower and

1089
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,760
you just have kind of the primordial of

1090
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:33,329
the flower is there you just have those

1091
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,620
first those first hairs are showing

1092
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:37,000
you're gonna get fewer seeds they're

1093
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:38,409
gonna be bigger they're gonna be

1094
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,360
healthier they're gonna have a thicker

1095
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,460
shell you'll probably have a higher

1096
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,170
female ratio from them they'll take

1097
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,970
longer to germinate but you'll get a

1098
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:52,059
better germination ratio and they'll

1099
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:53,889
store longer better but if you make if

1100
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:55,750
you take the same strain and you seed it

1101
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:58,389
a little bit later you'll get a lot more

1102
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,460
seeds they'll still be fully viable and

1103
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:01,219
the genetics will still all be of course

1104
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,710
intact

1105
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:07,489
good but you'll have smaller seeds with

1106
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:09,829
thinner shells and so there's a

1107
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:11,479
trade-off there like you know you're not

1108
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:13,549
gonna get a lot of people producing

1109
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,710
seeds for money who are gonna want to

1110
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,420
see them really really early I like to

1111
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,309
seed stuff when you can barely tell it's

1112
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,809
flowering like just when it starts to

1113
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:22,639
get enough to get so you know you're

1114
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:24,889
gonna get some seeds and then I

1115
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,650
basically get like you know really close

1116
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:29,839
to a hundred percent just perfect

1117
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,660
flawless seeds you never get the the

1118
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:35,000
wonky ones you get a lot less twins you

1119
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:37,608
get a lot more of the seeds are a lot

1120
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,289
more symmetrical you know so there's

1121
00:45:37,608 --> 00:45:42,230
definitely something to be said for that

1122
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:45,289
but you know you're never gonna make

1123
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,789
you're never gonna take like you're

1124
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:49,070
never gonna take sir these certain

1125
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:50,690
strains like you know I'd like blue

1126
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,269
dream for example you're never gonna

1127
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,130
make seeds on a blue dream plant even if

1128
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:56,900
you make it right when it first buds and

1129
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,180
you juice the hell out of it it's in

1130
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,460
full Sun it's the most happy plant ever

1131
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:03,199
and you leave it until the buds almost

1132
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,570
nearly dead and the seeds are as good as

1133
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:09,409
could be they'll never get as big as a

1134
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:11,539
well produced um deep chunk seed from

1135
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:14,239
the or big blue you know like from these

1136
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:16,130
really crazy afghan e's they they get

1137
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:19,699
they just genetically they get these

1138
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:21,680
really really big seeds but like bori

1139
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:24,829
seeds are always great and these seeds

1140
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,879
he gave me were beautiful and so that's

1141
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,739
what makes me think that they're

1142
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,289
genetically leaning a little bit to a

1143
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:33,019
different side in the gene pool yeah for

1144
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:35,210
sure yeah but there's definitely like a

1145
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:38,239
correlation there certain you know like

1146
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,400
a certain variety has a certain range of

1147
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,189
seed size like some just can't get as

1148
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,599
big as those suckers get huge you know

1149
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:48,440
yeah man those things are like little

1150
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:50,440
nuts yeah so if we just loop back to a

1151
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,309
topic we were talking about a while ago

1152
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,750
you were talking about how you know

1153
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,579
broadly speaking there's two types of

1154
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,858
growers in California the seed growers

1155
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,210
or the clone growers so to speak it's

1156
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,460
interesting because this idea seems to

1157
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:03,858
be coming up more and more especially in

1158
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,869
terms of how advantageous seeds can be

1159
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:08,210
compared to clones specifically in the

1160
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:09,470
outdoor setting you know the idea of

1161
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,659
having the taproot you know that's

1162
00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:13,338
really advantageous the one major

1163
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:14,288
argument I've had against this though is

1164
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:16,599
that you know

1165
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:20,169
not every seed is gonna yield a product

1166
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:23,109
as good as what an elite clone would so

1167
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:25,688
the question is do you feel that through

1168
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:28,268
strict and high quality breeding you can

1169
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:29,828
with a reasonable certainty offer a seed

1170
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:32,798
that is going to produce on average

1171
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:34,778
quite a high quality product yeah no

1172
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:37,809
problem and I think a lot of it comes

1173
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:39,579
down to taste so what happens is you

1174
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:44,039
might have a gene pool that can

1175
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:48,609
consistently do it can consistently

1176
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:51,130
recreate these plants with potency with

1177
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:54,728
yields with this with that a lot of

1178
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:59,289
times it comes down to a slight

1179
00:47:54,728 --> 00:48:01,928
variation in anything makes people get

1180
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:04,929
turned off to it based on taste so you

1181
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:08,769
might have 10 female plants and you

1182
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:10,418
clone them all and you have a bunch of

1183
00:48:08,768 --> 00:48:12,428
people who think the number three is the

1184
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:13,868
greatest weed ever and then you have a

1185
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:16,059
bunch of people who think that the

1186
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:17,949
number nine is the greatest whatever and

1187
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:20,048
then there's some people and and you

1188
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:21,459
have somebody who loves every plant that

1189
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:24,608
comes out of those seeds once they're

1190
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:29,038
bred really well but there's certain

1191
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:33,038
plants that are just more pleasing to

1192
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:35,109
there they're like they're like pop you

1193
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:38,349
know they're they're pop plants they're

1194
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:40,239
like pop music you know or pop art it's

1195
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:42,278
like this is what people people just

1196
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,219
like these you can sell this weed at

1197
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:47,168
Walmart you can sell this weed at

1198
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:49,059
Tiffany's you know like it doesn't

1199
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:51,400
matter who you are you're gonna like

1200
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,380
this and of course there's always some

1201
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,679
people who don't like it but generally

1202
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,390
if people like strong weed they're gonna

1203
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:00,818
think oh geez pretty good if they like

1204
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:02,228
strong weed they're gonna think kam is

1205
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:06,400
pretty good or if they like those more

1206
00:49:02,228 --> 00:49:09,968
indica kind of highs so I think like a

1207
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,039
lot of it comes down to not so much are

1208
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:14,139
the plants can you create plants that

1209
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:17,049
are all quality but it's like then you

1210
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:19,808
have to lock them down to be this

1211
00:49:17,048 --> 00:49:22,298
particular thing in which case you kind

1212
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:23,949
of you're gonna kind of alienate the

1213
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:26,030
people who might have liked the other

1214
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:29,780
thing that you didn't lock down you know

1215
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:31,640
so I do believe you can make a strain

1216
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,670
where everything is really high quality

1217
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:37,099
like I grow my my stuff that comes to my

1218
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:39,260
black lab crosses and I don't ever

1219
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,779
really get a plant from them that I go

1220
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:44,470
yeah I don't like this one you know I I

1221
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,460
like them all if people have never seen

1222
00:49:44,469 --> 00:49:48,799
something from the line that they're

1223
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,659
attached to the first time they see any

1224
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,640
given plant they go wow that's good

1225
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:55,339
stuff I like that one but once they've

1226
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,989
grown attached to one type then they'll

1227
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,700
start to see some of the other ones ago

1228
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:00,379
yeah I don't like that one but it's

1229
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:02,329
because they like that because of the

1230
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,460
one that they do like you know it kind

1231
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:07,309
of turns them off to the other ones so

1232
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:09,289
um you know I think a lot of it comes

1233
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:12,619
down to just your taste what you like

1234
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:14,449
and and then and then of course you know

1235
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:16,849
bottlenecking out the stuff that just

1236
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:18,139
nobody thinks is gonna be quality so

1237
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:19,400
that's what I spent years doing is

1238
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:22,190
trying to get rid of the stuff that

1239
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,250
nobody's gonna like and try to keep in

1240
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:27,320
the stuff that I know somebody's gonna

1241
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:29,119
love even though I know you know you

1242
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,900
can't please everybody with every single

1243
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,339
plant so an idea I've been thinking

1244
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,889
about a lot recently is do you think

1245
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:39,140
it's possible to selectively breed for

1246
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:40,429
either one trait like either breeding in

1247
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:43,069
or out and I guess what I mean by this

1248
00:50:40,429 --> 00:50:44,359
is let's just say you had a clone or you

1249
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,800
know a strain in general and you love

1250
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,630
everything about it there's just one

1251
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:51,200
trait specifically that's for example so

1252
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:53,780
maybe you know resistance to insects so

1253
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,909
you know something like that do you

1254
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,590
think you can breed that out and breathe

1255
00:50:55,909 --> 00:50:58,879
it out in such a way that you only get

1256
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,200
rid of that one trait or do you think

1257
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,090
you're always going to lose some

1258
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:04,159
peripheral aspects that will be related

1259
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:06,680
to the genes involved in that tray and I

1260
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,179
mean maybe more specifically if you

1261
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:09,679
could actually do it do you think it

1262
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:11,659
would just take a ridiculous number of

1263
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:12,949
generations to achieve the goal I kind

1264
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:16,629
of outlined or do you think you could do

1265
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:16,629
it in a reasonable number of generations

1266
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:22,879
you know it's interesting thing because

1267
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,860
it's really like the perfect question

1268
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,050
for like why would you want to hybridize

1269
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,970
something because if you already have

1270
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,610
something good why would you want to

1271
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:36,039
screw it up by adding something else I

1272
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:39,610
think like in the case you said of like

1273
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:39,610
insect resistance

1274
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,030
the further there's to bei there it's

1275
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:49,009
like this if you have a gene pool and

1276
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:51,140
this there's already plants in it that

1277
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:53,569
are exactly what you want except they

1278
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:56,029
are very insect resistant and you don't

1279
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:59,298
have to go outside of the gene pool then

1280
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:01,519
that's a case when line breeding without

1281
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:05,119
adding any outside genetics is a great

1282
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:07,219
tool so you can say okay well you know

1283
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,559
when I grow five of these they all get

1284
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:12,858
attacked by insects then that's a great

1285
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:16,220
time to go okay well let's go ahead and

1286
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:18,440
pop ten thousand seeds or five hundred

1287
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:23,029
seeds or whatever you have room for and

1288
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:24,889
then basically introduce that insect to

1289
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:28,460
that population and see if there's one

1290
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:32,900
that really shines and then if you can

1291
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:35,869
get actually a whole variety of those

1292
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,180
particular plants then hopefully you

1293
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:41,000
find one that was insect resistant and

1294
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:43,219
it also has the other traits that you

1295
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,920
already liked about the strain which in

1296
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:47,328
this hypothetical thing would be likely

1297
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,220
because it was already a strain you

1298
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:51,260
liked a lot but it just wasn't resistant

1299
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:52,879
to bugs so in that case that's when you

1300
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,000
really want to do selective breeding

1301
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:00,140
within the gene pool and bottleneck out

1302
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,079
all the plants so by taking that one

1303
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:04,759
plant and you can back cross to it and

1304
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,140
back cross to it and back cross to it

1305
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,589
and because it's already consistent

1306
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:11,389
strain back crossing to that plant is

1307
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:13,429
really gonna dominate the gene pool with

1308
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:17,539
itself and that's actually like a really

1309
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:19,699
good time to in breed and that cross and

1310
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:21,558
do all that stuff you wouldn't want to

1311
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:24,529
throw out all the other stuff because

1312
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:26,180
down the line you might realize hey wait

1313
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,769
there's another trait we didn't know

1314
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:29,779
because we had never seen this type of

1315
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:33,108
wilt before or we've never seen this

1316
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:35,690
type of mildew or blight or new strain

1317
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:37,429
of insect or species of insects so you

1318
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:39,650
still want to have the other ones you

1319
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:41,449
know put in cold storage or whatever but

1320
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,579
now you have this new line where you can

1321
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:46,009
go okay sweet we're not getting eaten by

1322
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:48,619
thrips every time like who's getting

1323
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:50,359
eaten by thrips is obviously a terrible

1324
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:51,599
plant so we got to go ahead and go for

1325
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:53,909
this

1326
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,940
part of the population preserves the

1327
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:58,409
part that we really don't want right now

1328
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,420
so that we know we have it in case we

1329
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:01,920
need something from it later but now

1330
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,278
we'll take this new direction where we

1331
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:08,159
have this the other the other place

1332
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:10,679
would be okay now while we grew out 500

1333
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:13,440
or we grew out 10,000 and we didn't find

1334
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:15,328
any plants that are not resistant to

1335
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,190
insects which means that in the past

1336
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:19,859
somebody's already bottlenecked these

1337
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:23,190
traits into this population and they're

1338
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:24,900
all gonna get attacked by insects no

1339
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,969
matter what in that case you're gonna

1340
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:30,809
have to borrow genetic material from a

1341
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:32,999
different race of plants so you're gonna

1342
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:35,099
have to say okay we're gonna go to this

1343
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:37,768
land race over here or we're gonna go to

1344
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:41,160
this this heirloom breed over here and

1345
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:43,768
go okay look these ones they just and

1346
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:46,259
you grow a big population and of course

1347
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:48,058
it doesn't have to be that they all grow

1348
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:51,539
like this but that's the best way to do

1349
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:54,239
it is to find a breed where none of them

1350
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:56,759
get attacked by insects and maybe if

1351
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,440
you're lucky this plant already breeds

1352
00:54:56,759 --> 00:55:00,239
true for a lot of the traits you liked

1353
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,400
about the other strains so that way

1354
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,568
you're making less work for yourself so

1355
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,420
let's say you have a strain that gets

1356
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:09,058
attacked by insects it has a great smell

1357
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,159
that you really love it gets you high

1358
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,619
like you want the plant grows like you

1359
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,868
want it to it finishes when you want it

1360
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:18,449
to and the only drawback is that it gets

1361
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:22,229
attacked by insects then maybe by some

1362
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:25,380
luck you know you find another strain

1363
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:27,239
that has all those same traits that you

1364
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,099
really like and even the terpene

1365
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:32,789
profiles are similar so it's similar

1366
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:35,670
weed but you go well this one over here

1367
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:37,979
it doesn't get attacked by insects in

1368
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:42,420
any of the population the whole thing is

1369
00:55:37,978 --> 00:55:44,669
insect resistant so it obviously has it

1370
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,278
breeds true for this particular trait in

1371
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:51,119
this case which is insect resistance so

1372
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:55,228
when you cross the two together you know

1373
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:57,298
I mean if it's too if it's so close to

1374
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:58,768
being perfect like I just said it was

1375
00:55:57,298 --> 00:56:00,298
then of course you'd probably just throw

1376
00:55:58,768 --> 00:56:02,218
away the first strain cuz you just found

1377
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:04,650
a second strain that's already perfect

1378
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:07,588
but there's gonna be

1379
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:09,389
right yeah for sure but but I mean I'm

1380
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:11,068
just saying that was I that was kind of

1381
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:12,598
the ideal you would be looking for to

1382
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:14,759
have a lot of traits that line up of

1383
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:19,798
course they're not all gonna line up so

1384
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:23,430
let's say strain a yields well but

1385
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:25,798
strain B doesn't yield well but it

1386
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:29,219
really has the insect resistance so you

1387
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:31,949
go okay we do still need something from

1388
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,929
the old strain that doesn't have the

1389
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:35,818
insect resistance and it still is the

1390
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:37,919
one that has the better buds with the

1391
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:40,409
better resin and all this stuff to it so

1392
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,970
okay so it's worthwhile so then in that

1393
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:44,068
case you know you're gonna make that

1394
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:45,209
hybrid now when you make the hybrid

1395
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,699
you're gonna go through and you're gonna

1396
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,349
look for all those traits you wanted but

1397
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:51,689
you're gonna look for the plants that do

1398
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:53,818
possess that in fact that borrowed trait

1399
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:55,289
and now those are going to be the plants

1400
00:56:53,818 --> 00:57:00,269
that you're gonna breed to go forward

1401
00:56:55,289 --> 00:57:02,220
and you know it all really depends on

1402
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:05,460
like you know the frequency that this

1403
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:08,038
particular trait pops out in the in the

1404
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:11,159
population like is it a one-in-ten is it

1405
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:13,470
a 100 is it one in a thousand and if

1406
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,358
it's already like the strains really

1407
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:19,078
true for that it's gonna be pretty easy

1408
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:21,538
to borrow that trait into the other one

1409
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:23,190
because at the very least you're gonna

1410
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:26,549
start off and you're gonna get a quarter

1411
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:28,880
or a third or half or depending on how

1412
00:57:26,548 --> 00:57:33,599
dominant that strain is for that trait

1413
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:37,950
so to answer your question in a simple

1414
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:40,200
way which I never do I would say that

1415
00:57:37,949 --> 00:57:41,969
you know it's not it's not really that

1416
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:44,399
hard it just you have to approach it in

1417
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:46,500
that way where you go okay what is our

1418
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,088
list of traits that we need for this

1419
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,949
strain and then what is what what are we

1420
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:54,838
looking to borrow from another strain

1421
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:57,960
and does this string and does this other

1422
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,460
strain really have it to donate and in

1423
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,289
that case then yeah you'll make your new

1424
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,179
hybrid you'll find your plants that fit

1425
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:05,069
the description and as long as they fit

1426
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:07,078
the description you take them you breed

1427
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:11,250
them together try some different

1428
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,568
combinations of parents and then you

1429
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,099
know at a certain point you'll find one

1430
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:16,558
that has all those traits that you want

1431
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,940
I mean that's kind of just what you know

1432
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,450
like I mean that's not what you do when

1433
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,858
you're making

1434
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:21,629
simple hybrids but when you're breeding

1435
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:23,670
a strain that that really is something

1436
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:26,820
that's going on you know like I do that

1437
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:28,320
I do that what strains a lot yeah for

1438
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,660
sure and I know that that type of

1439
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,940
approach is used in many many men there

1440
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:34,259
are many many many other fields of

1441
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:37,289
agriculture around the world and it's

1442
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:39,150
certainly effective yeah while we're on

1443
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:41,309
the topic of you know kind of locking in

1444
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:43,769
traits I remember having this discussion

1445
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:46,049
with mr. Sol about back crossing and I

1446
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:48,659
specifically was interested in why he

1447
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:51,539
chose to use the Shiva's gonca model as

1448
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:53,279
opposed to one of the brothers of you

1449
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:56,429
know the princess and the genius in the

1450
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,109
stock and he said to me well it was it

1451
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:59,190
had good traits obviously the shape of a

1452
00:58:58,108 --> 00:59:01,500
skunk that he wanted but more

1453
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:03,690
importantly it was really easy to see

1454
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,449
those phenotypes when he was going

1455
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,200
through each generation back crossing it

1456
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:09,929
that kind of brought up an interesting

1457
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,649
idea because I mean one would you guys

1458
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:14,699
consider doing back crosses in

1459
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,460
aficionado because a lot of the work is

1460
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:19,799
more kind of f1e type stuff but the

1461
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,659
other question is is that at the type of

1462
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,010
approach you would take would you want

1463
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:25,049
to use something that was really

1464
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:27,990
different just such that it was you know

1465
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:29,789
almost just doing the job of providing

1466
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:31,618
the y-chromosome and then you could

1467
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:33,088
easily weed out most of its traits or

1468
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:35,130
would you look to use something which

1469
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:38,460
was more similar as you just mentioned

1470
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:40,980
but the the implication of that is maybe

1471
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:44,280
it's a little harder to weed out exactly

1472
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:46,409
what you don't want yeah I mean as far

1473
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,900
as to be able to see something out right

1474
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:51,449
I mean I used to always go okay you want

1475
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:53,670
to use if you're gonna take say like

1476
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:57,358
you're gonna take a G and you want to

1477
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:59,700
make a G from seed let's find a male

1478
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,549
that's already almost just like Oh G in

1479
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:05,068
every way and then we'll do that and

1480
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:07,619
then after a while I went yeah but I

1481
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:09,719
can't see it once I did it in practice I

1482
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:15,150
went I it's really hard to see what it

1483
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:17,009
is so what I realized and I started the

1484
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:19,710
project and I never did anything with it

1485
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:22,650
dying breed and round table selections

1486
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:24,690
and cheese I don't know probably a

1487
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,460
couple other people did stuff with it

1488
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,608
what I did was I took that I took the

1489
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,559
deep chunk and I put it on the fire OG

1490
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:33,568
and I gave that to the guy who

1491
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:35,189
who gave me the deep chunk seeds

1492
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:35,579
originally and he called it great balls

1493
01:00:35,188 --> 01:00:41,129
of fire

1494
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:44,430
and so what's interesting is deep chunk

1495
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:51,499
is a really trippy plant because it's

1496
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:55,288
totally inbred and it is of course it's

1497
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:58,948
its dominant in breedings for all these

1498
01:00:55,289 --> 01:01:03,809
traits like I would say in a lot of case

1499
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:07,588
the dark color a lot of resin broad

1500
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:11,298
leaves but one thing that it wasn't

1501
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:13,558
dominant for in out crosses that I did

1502
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:15,778
meaning that I guess it's probably a

1503
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:19,499
double recessive trait in its gene pool

1504
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:21,929
is that its height it's not dominant in

1505
01:01:19,498 --> 01:01:26,879
out crosses so what happens when you

1506
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:30,268
make deep chunk cross something that

1507
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:32,099
grows fast is you get basically deep

1508
01:01:30,268 --> 01:01:36,958
chunk plants but they're very fast

1509
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:39,179
growing right so I haven't grown out a

1510
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:40,889
large enough population of that but what

1511
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:42,900
I really wanted to do with it was go

1512
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:45,118
okay it's gonna be easy to see these

1513
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,369
plants that are the ones that aren't the

1514
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:51,869
broad leaves they're gonna be a lot more

1515
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:53,818
likely to be the OG types and it's so

1516
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:55,619
dominant for that trait that I think

1517
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:58,199
I'll probably have to grow out a

1518
01:01:55,619 --> 01:02:00,329
thousand of them to be able to get a few

1519
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:05,579
good plants to try combinations with

1520
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:07,410
that have the narrow leaves and dying

1521
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:09,719
breed took that and they actually

1522
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:12,058
selected one that was a little bit more

1523
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,159
narrow leaf and they put that back on

1524
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,869
the fire road G again I haven't seen

1525
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:19,828
that grown out yet but I'm curious about

1526
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:22,079
it but that's an example of doing like

1527
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:23,939
what what mr. Sol was talking about

1528
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,160
where you use something that's really

1529
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:29,489
obvious and then it's easy to take out

1530
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:31,139
the problem with deep chunk or it's not

1531
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:33,869
really a problem it's just that when I

1532
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:35,818
do you know you plant 20 or 40 of them

1533
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:37,979
you go hey we have a bunch of giant

1534
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:40,880
sized deep chunk with a little bit more

1535
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:43,409
THC coming from the og but you don't get

1536
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,730
you don't get many that have any kind of

1537
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:49,929
an OG smell or a No

1538
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:52,990
you look to them and so it's kind of a

1539
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:55,299
pain in the butt but it is um it's

1540
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:59,379
definitely it's definitely a valuable

1541
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:02,530
thing to do and I don't I don't see any

1542
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:04,119
reason not to do back cross projects if

1543
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:06,369
you have a plant that you really really

1544
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:08,380
like you know I think it's a I think

1545
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:10,240
it's good and I think that you know

1546
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:11,829
doing something that pops right out at

1547
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:13,959
you like that using a plant that is

1548
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:15,340
different so that you can weed it out of

1549
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,809
the population really easy I think

1550
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,869
that's you know that I think that's

1551
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:21,940
smart it's a sharp idea yeah and so you

1552
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:23,590
just touched on this idea of you know

1553
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,599
popping you said popping a thousand

1554
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,190
seeds how many seeds do you like to pop

1555
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,190
when you are gonna look through a line

1556
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:32,139
for a mile for example and and a little

1557
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:34,599
side question if you were to pop another

1558
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:36,190
breeders seeds how many would you want

1559
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:37,839
to pop to get an idea of whether you

1560
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:39,760
could be like oh that's Bunco they do

1561
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,500
good stuff

1562
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:46,600
I'd say it's all dependent on the

1563
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:50,108
genetics I don't think I think there's

1564
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:52,000
some strains that the way they're bred

1565
01:03:50,108 --> 01:03:55,029
like if you're gonna pop something from

1566
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,980
mr. Sol I don't think that you probably

1567
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,960
need to plant more than a pack or two

1568
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:01,000
because of the way he breeds he's

1569
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,309
locking down traits he's using parents

1570
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,389
that actually mesh and make the gene

1571
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:09,369
combinations that he wants and he's um I

1572
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:12,789
mean the dude he's a he's a nuclear

1573
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:14,590
engineer or something I mean you know

1574
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:16,869
he's not just gonna be jumping into and

1575
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:18,970
doing stuff like that now that in

1576
01:04:16,869 --> 01:04:20,289
comparison to somebody who says hey I'm

1577
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:24,339
gonna take this and throw it together

1578
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:27,699
with this you know I mean deep chunk

1579
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:30,210
cross og was one that was that takes big

1580
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:32,739
numbers because of this interesting

1581
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:36,280
interplay between the genetics where

1582
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:38,229
deep chunk basically eclipses everything

1583
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,830
it collides with there's nothing that

1584
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:43,539
really can stand out like deep chunk

1585
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:47,590
just throws a shadow on anything in the

1586
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:49,480
genetics so you are gonna be able to get

1587
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:51,608
ones out of it but it's gonna take you a

1588
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,740
bigger population to find them because

1589
01:04:51,608 --> 01:04:56,199
there is really true dominance for a lot

1590
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:58,119
of its traits that it has

1591
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:00,969
but like I said height is not one of

1592
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:03,219
those traits so then that kind of shows

1593
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:06,069
you with my knowledge of genetics you

1594
01:05:03,219 --> 01:05:08,829
know like I'm no rocket scientist with

1595
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:11,620
it but that that's probably a double

1596
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:14,349
recessive because it breeds true in an

1597
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:17,650
inbred population but it doesn't breed

1598
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:19,690
true or it doesn't dominate anything

1599
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:23,650
when you do out crosses with it at all

1600
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:25,750
so you know there there's your two

1601
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:29,889
examples of okay here we got you know

1602
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:32,230
Cindy ninety-nine seeds or Cindy

1603
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:34,089
ninety-nine FEM seeds like hey grow

1604
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:37,030
three you're gonna get a good plant you

1605
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:38,590
know grow rags grow ten grow 20 grow 30

1606
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:40,870
you're gonna have a lot of cool stuff in

1607
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,550
there and it's kind of gonna be that

1608
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:44,619
because that's his goal as a breeder

1609
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:46,630
then there's other people and there's

1610
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:50,259
stuff that I make too I make stuff I try

1611
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:52,930
to make stuff that is really really

1612
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,910
consistent and I try to make stuff

1613
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:56,859
that's really really wild because in

1614
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,659
stuff that's consistent when you go

1615
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,849
ahead and you plant a row of it it

1616
01:05:58,659 --> 01:06:03,250
behaves just how you want it to it does

1617
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:05,679
everything that you you want it to do it

1618
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:08,679
finishes when you want it to finish and

1619
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:10,449
all this stuff but then if you want to

1620
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:12,609
find something that's really gonna be

1621
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:14,529
out of this world and it's completely

1622
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:16,539
different than anything anyone's ever

1623
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:18,040
seen you're not gonna get that out of

1624
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,869
your true breeding seeds your true

1625
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:21,519
breeding seeds only have what you've

1626
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:23,769
seen from them because that's all they

1627
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,110
do deep chunk does deep chunk you're not

1628
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:27,940
gonna grow deep chunk and go whoa I grew

1629
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:31,000
this deep chunk and now I got this crazy

1630
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:33,010
you know just crazy plant with this

1631
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,989
crazy terpene profile it's gonna be like

1632
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:37,150
oh it's just a variation on deep chunk

1633
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:40,299
it's pure Cindy 99 you're gonna get a

1634
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:42,130
variation on Cindy 99 which is awesome

1635
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:45,070
when you're looking for that and then

1636
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:46,630
you know doing crazy crazy Polly hybrids

1637
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:48,250
and stuff is really cool if you're just

1638
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,210
looking for something that's really

1639
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:53,889
weird like I got I got one called

1640
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:56,679
Nubia that my buddy Braveheart found out

1641
01:06:53,889 --> 01:07:00,750
of some seeds and it's like one of the

1642
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:04,629
only CBD plants that's that high in CBD

1643
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:06,699
two-to-one ratio and it makes really

1644
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,890
really good full melt hash and that's

1645
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:11,018
not common with CBD plants and I

1646
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:13,268
kind of attribute some of that to the

1647
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:16,868
old genetics like the dirt purp in it

1648
01:07:13,268 --> 01:07:19,389
that has it has you know it's terpene

1649
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:22,690
rich it has really nice resin that's

1650
01:07:19,389 --> 01:07:24,699
really it's really melty anyway but then

1651
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:27,309
you know at the same time then it's this

1652
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:29,169
crazy this crazy poly hybrid thing that

1653
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:31,329
I did and then you get this plant that

1654
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:33,579
you don't really see this in other

1655
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:35,200
populations people grow out tons of CBD

1656
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:37,059
and they're like it's great but you

1657
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,939
can't make full mount Ashley it but

1658
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:42,220
through doing some weirdo stuff you know

1659
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,929
you get these weirdo things that you

1660
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:48,308
realize are valuable once you actually

1661
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:50,440
put him into practice as far as like for

1662
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:52,960
to get somebody's seed to know if it's

1663
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,880
good it just depends like I feel like

1664
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,369
with breeding it's all about like

1665
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,440
honesty like if you're gonna if it's

1666
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:01,690
wild say it's wild if it's ultra

1667
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,639
consistent say it's ultra consistent and

1668
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:06,009
then that way when people go to select

1669
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:07,858
what they want to get from you or what

1670
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:11,559
they want to spend their time on to grow

1671
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:13,630
they have an idea you know which ride

1672
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:17,560
they're buying a ticket for because you

1673
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:19,029
you don't want to try to grow you don't

1674
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,489
want to try to grow something where you

1675
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:24,429
want to get all good stuff that's all

1676
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:25,809
the same and have it all be wild and

1677
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:28,270
then some of them aren't even that great

1678
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,520
but if someone tells you hey these seeds

1679
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:32,170
are wild they're not all good but when

1680
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,389
you find the best one in it you're gonna

1681
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:36,250
have something that's incredible then

1682
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:39,819
it's like cool now you know what you're

1683
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:43,810
signing up for and so it's not so much

1684
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:46,509
that maybe a better breeder is going to

1685
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:48,489
have more consistent seeds it's that in

1686
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:51,969
my opinion a better breeder is gonna

1687
01:08:48,488 --> 01:08:54,068
tell you what is what so that when you

1688
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:57,100
get into it you know like okay do you

1689
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:58,810
want to have you want to find this

1690
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,509
purple one here that's got this really

1691
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:04,239
special terpene profile it only pops out

1692
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:06,880
maybe one in 20 so you're probably gonna

1693
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:09,459
want to plant about 50 or 60 seeds just

1694
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,440
so that you know you got more of a

1695
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:15,069
likelihood because if it pops out one in

1696
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:17,318
20 in a big population somebody could

1697
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:20,710
buy one pack or two packs and get 20

1698
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,819
seeds really easily and go well it

1699
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:24,060
didn't come this

1700
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:26,109
because you know it's not gonna hit but

1701
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,670
do you want to know that when you buy

1702
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:29,170
the seeds I don't want to get seeds from

1703
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:31,060
somebody and have them go yeah they're

1704
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,920
all this and then you plant them and you

1705
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,798
go dude I didn't get any of that and

1706
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,659
then if somebody tells you oh there's

1707
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:39,220
all kinds of neat stuff in this and then

1708
01:09:37,659 --> 01:09:41,289
you plant it and you go dude I only got

1709
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:43,480
one thing out of like 50 plants they're

1710
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:45,310
all exactly the same either one of those

1711
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:47,588
is gonna be a disappointment you know so

1712
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:50,140
it's really up to long for you know

1713
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:52,119
through the breeder to be ethical and

1714
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:55,000
give you an idea of what you're getting

1715
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:58,720
yourself into I think yeah it sounds

1716
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,119
like good philosophy and so just on a

1717
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,490
slightly different topic recently we've

1718
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:06,939
seen the launch of your own new company

1719
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:08,529
freeborn selections what what inspired

1720
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:10,359
you to start this is it kind of a bit

1721
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:12,039
like bodis companies where it's just

1722
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:13,960
kind of like a different type of work he

1723
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:16,630
wants to do and what type of things can

1724
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,520
we expect from it well tell you what I

1725
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,409
mean like I said you know I was 10 years

1726
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,000
old looking at height I'm seeing people

1727
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:23,710
at seed company is saying oh that'd be

1728
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,960
cool you know to have a seed company and

1729
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:27,520
breed and then I started breeding I got

1730
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,670
all these different breeds you know and

1731
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,430
um so you know like when I when I first

1732
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:35,230
talked to Leo from afficionado you know

1733
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:37,030
he said oh yeah you know you should you

1734
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:39,429
should you should come on company and

1735
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:40,840
well you know you can do this and do

1736
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:43,810
that and I was like yeah man you know I

1737
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,610
go uh you know I'm down to do stuff I

1738
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:48,370
like to work with people and you know

1739
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:50,920
that's it it's cool but you know I'm

1740
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:53,349
still I'm not just gonna be you know I'm

1741
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,329
not coming in to just be like part of

1742
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:58,090
somebody else's thing you know I've been

1743
01:10:55,329 --> 01:11:01,600
doing this for you know I've been I've

1744
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:03,909
been you know improving in creating

1745
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,090
strains for 20 years I'm not just trying

1746
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:10,779
to just sign on to somebody's stuff so I

1747
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:13,590
basically I basically just thought well

1748
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:16,329
I have all these things that I've made

1749
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:18,880
efficient auto the way the marketing is

1750
01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:21,519
positioned is to say you know this is

1751
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:25,180
basically the best weed you've ever seen

1752
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:28,030
the best seeds you've ever seen and you

1753
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,650
know I feel like when we add black lime

1754
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:32,289
reserve I was like I feel like this is a

1755
01:11:29,649 --> 01:11:34,719
game-changer I gave them to people I

1756
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:35,170
gave a lot of lime stuff over the years

1757
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,489
to

1758
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:39,520
a lot of different people and I always

1759
01:11:36,488 --> 01:11:41,259
ask them you know is this business

1760
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,480
blowing stuff away is this what you want

1761
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,369
to grow now or are you just gonna retire

1762
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:46,928
it you tried it you don't want to do it

1763
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:48,609
and everyone who I gave it to always

1764
01:11:46,929 --> 01:11:50,560
said this is something that I really

1765
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:53,889
wanna that I really want to go with so

1766
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:56,230
that's like something that I felt like

1767
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:58,660
was appropriate to release and say hey

1768
01:11:56,229 --> 01:12:00,849
this is this is good you know this is

1769
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:02,649
like the best stuff anything that I do

1770
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,150
of course I'm gonna think it's great but

1771
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:05,979
I have to know that okay it's kind of

1772
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:09,309
match with the market it's gonna it's

1773
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:10,899
gonna it's gonna be really big good

1774
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,550
yields it's gonna be great for this

1775
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:16,899
gonna be great for that kind of you know

1776
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:18,760
check all the boxes and so I was

1777
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:21,339
comfortable to do that but honestly like

1778
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:26,140
to say okay I'm just gonna make seeds

1779
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:28,360
always to be released as being you know

1780
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:30,940
the greatest thing around and maybe they

1781
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:33,009
don't really you know there there's not

1782
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:34,479
really anything that different you know

1783
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:36,640
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you I'm

1784
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:41,738
a better breeder than then mr. Sol or

1785
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:43,390
bode or inspector or Fletch or any of

1786
01:12:41,738 --> 01:12:45,069
these guys I'm not you know what I mean

1787
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:48,340
like I'm not gonna sit here and tell you

1788
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:52,630
that I'm that I'm you know mr. awesome

1789
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:54,640
so it's hard for me to to position stuff

1790
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:57,039
that way so for me I'm like okay I just

1791
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:59,739
wanted to do a company where I could say

1792
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,448
I'm gonna um I'm gonna make this stuff

1793
01:12:59,738 --> 01:13:04,419
it's stuff that I think is great I think

1794
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:07,238
it brings a lot to the table and people

1795
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:09,520
will enjoy it and and so that's why I'm

1796
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:11,948
really you know making the push on doing

1797
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,449
on doing my own stuff because any time

1798
01:13:11,948 --> 01:13:16,928
when you're when you're working with

1799
01:13:13,448 --> 01:13:19,000
people you know your visions have to

1800
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:23,560
meet and if your visions aren't meeting

1801
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:28,060
up then you know it's not it's not

1802
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:31,210
really conducive to to success in that

1803
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,860
in that way so you know freeborn

1804
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:35,710
selections is just like you know my

1805
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:39,369
middle name is Freeborn you know these

1806
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:41,079
are my selections and you know like you

1807
01:13:39,369 --> 01:13:43,359
see like on my thing it's like oh it's a

1808
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:45,969
company you know it's it's a new company

1809
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:48,069
it's a wise it's a since 1997 because

1810
01:13:45,969 --> 01:13:48,520
you know freeborn's been selecting since

1811
01:13:48,069 --> 01:13:52,899
nineteen

1812
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:55,180
97 that's what the work is so that's

1813
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:57,069
basically you know that's that's the

1814
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:58,659
whole thing of of it is just going okay

1815
01:13:57,069 --> 01:14:01,599
this is a place where I can put my work

1816
01:13:58,659 --> 01:14:03,670
I don't have to worry about meeting any

1817
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,650
kind of standard beyond what I say it is

1818
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:08,340
if I say it's wild its wild if I say

1819
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:10,689
it's unstable its unstable if I say it's

1820
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,100
if I say it's the best strain I've ever

1821
01:14:10,689 --> 01:14:13,689
seen it's the best training I've ever

1822
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,520
seen I can just do whatever I want it

1823
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:18,339
doesn't all have to fit into the heading

1824
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,900
of going okay this is the best you ever

1825
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,670
seen because that's that's a lot of

1826
01:14:19,899 --> 01:14:24,629
pressure and that's hard to UM that's

1827
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:27,159
hard to deliver on you know yeah sure

1828
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:30,340
and so just as a bit of a personal

1829
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:33,789
curiosity even though cherry-lime took

1830
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,560
first place and black wine didn't which

1831
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:41,170
one do you think is actually the most

1832
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:43,150
and out of there to you know black lime

1833
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:45,850
is really trippy it's one of these ones

1834
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:49,569
like I know a guy who used to get all

1835
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:51,610
the weed from from you know the main

1836
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:53,710
diesel guys on the East Coast the chem

1837
01:14:51,609 --> 01:14:56,380
guys and you know he'd buy their weed

1838
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:58,119
for you know huge amounts of money stuff

1839
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:00,340
that's just ridiculous like people don't

1840
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:02,019
believe people pay this much for for

1841
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,460
weed and he used to come over here and

1842
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:08,550
get black line before I crossed it with

1843
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:12,520
OG and you know I I didn't ever know

1844
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:14,800
until I was talking to him last year in

1845
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,480
here two years ago and he goes ah you're

1846
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,920
the black lime guy I go yeah I go you

1847
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,629
like that and he go and he told me the

1848
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:23,829
story goes man that was the best weed

1849
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:26,109
that I ever got was black line and he

1850
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:27,760
goes I used to get the super skunk I

1851
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:29,859
used to get the diesel likes to get the

1852
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,289
camp you know I've seen all the oh geez

1853
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:34,449
he goes the black line he goes I was my

1854
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:37,210
stuff dude like that was like I could

1855
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:38,920
kill it on that back in those days I was

1856
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:40,689
like wow I didn't even know back then I

1857
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,109
didn't you know like you're very

1858
01:15:40,689 --> 01:15:46,210
isolated when you're in the um you know

1859
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:48,549
in the woods for one you're very

1860
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:50,829
isolated but beyond that when you're not

1861
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:52,510
you know you're not really tied in I was

1862
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:55,119
never one of these guys who flew to

1863
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:58,329
Amsterdam or did any of the stuff so you

1864
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,010
know um anyway you know the my point

1865
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:00,559
being that for me black lime is like

1866
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:04,539
it's like

1867
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:08,840
best week there is and I crossed it with

1868
01:16:04,539 --> 01:16:10,489
with the PK the og back in the day not

1869
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,949
because I wanted to make any

1870
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:14,719
improvements but because I took the og

1871
01:16:12,949 --> 01:16:17,210
and I hit it with every male I had at

1872
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:19,820
the time trying to get oh gee seeds

1873
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:21,350
because nobody wanted to grow my seeds

1874
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:24,199
all of a sudden they were talking about

1875
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:26,660
oh we want to we want to buy only OG

1876
01:16:24,199 --> 01:16:29,510
because we can sell this you know we can

1877
01:16:26,659 --> 01:16:31,960
sell this in LA for $8,000 a pound and

1878
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:36,860
all the rest of the stuff we can't so

1879
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:39,289
you know black lime for me was really

1880
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:41,960
like that the heavy it was heavy hitting

1881
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:45,079
it had all the flavors had fuel had

1882
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,060
fruit I I've been looking for years for

1883
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:49,960
something that was like lime because my

1884
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:52,490
buddy who was from that crew who

1885
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:56,989
originally gave some of my friends some

1886
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:59,119
of the original seeds that I got they

1887
01:16:56,989 --> 01:17:00,739
they had a thing called lime and I was

1888
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:02,059
always like I want to find this lime I

1889
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:04,099
want to fly wanna breed a strain that's

1890
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:06,680
lime like a lime popsicle you know and

1891
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,780
so once I finally did it it was just to

1892
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,300
me I was like here's the ultimate cherry

1893
01:17:08,779 --> 01:17:13,429
if I have cherry limeade and I have

1894
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,619
black lime and I have a baguette each

1895
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:19,789
say ah the ounce of each and I'm smoking

1896
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:23,239
heavy I'm gonna probably smoke the black

1897
01:17:19,789 --> 01:17:26,000
lime like ten to one and the cherry

1898
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:29,000
limeade is incredible it just it's not

1899
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:33,680
it doesn't resonate with me as well and

1900
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,899
I think that overall the cherry limeade

1901
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:39,050
is more of a crowd-pleaser it's purple

1902
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:40,729
but it's stony like OG it has an

1903
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:42,980
incredible amount of terpenes when you

1904
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:46,069
smoke it and I literally taste sweet in

1905
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:48,259
your mouth not just like it not just

1906
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:50,210
like a sweet smell but it actually on

1907
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:53,510
your tongue is kind of like sweet like

1908
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:57,170
sugary and it's just really really good

1909
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:59,480
weed it's really resistant but black

1910
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:01,730
lime for me is just like black limes the

1911
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:03,829
king of the jungle for me and then and

1912
01:18:01,729 --> 01:18:08,059
then my other one that I call root beer

1913
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:10,729
which is a which is a headband with some

1914
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,590
you know some old Afghan ease in Hindu

1915
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:14,299
it

1916
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:16,159
that's super that's super dank - those

1917
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:18,170
are the two for me cherry limeade is

1918
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:20,629
totally like a backburner strain for me

1919
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:23,149
a smoke but if I want to really impress

1920
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:25,579
somebody with a bud you know I know that

1921
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:29,059
in unless people have a relationship

1922
01:18:25,579 --> 01:18:30,979
with uh like a history of smoking those

1923
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:32,659
other things like me I know that when

1924
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:34,759
they smoke the cherry limeade that knee

1925
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:36,500
jerk is gonna be like oh that's the best

1926
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:38,600
that one's the best but if somebody has

1927
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,779
a lot of them for a long time you know

1928
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:44,270
it's um the lime for sure the lime is

1929
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:46,158
killer yeah that's really interesting

1930
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:48,110
because I was listening to you on the

1931
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,079
cannabis connection talk about the

1932
01:18:48,109 --> 01:18:52,250
creation of the cherry line and

1933
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:55,399
interestingly enough he's I think you

1934
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:58,729
said that the mother was a cherry pie s1

1935
01:18:55,399 --> 01:19:00,920
and yeah yeah and what I find

1936
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:02,388
interesting about this is we're seeing

1937
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,460
this happen more and more you know

1938
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:06,260
people are breeding with s ones as

1939
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,689
mothers I've even seen people breeding

1940
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,340
with an s2 as a mother how do you feel

1941
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:12,019
about this do you feel like you know

1942
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:15,440
it's fine to do as long as you do the

1943
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:17,869
necessary testing on the progeny or like

1944
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,049
what's your feelings on this well here's

1945
01:19:17,868 --> 01:19:24,170
an interesting thing you know I mean

1946
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:26,270
some strains they have exceptional

1947
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:32,560
stress causes them to seed themselves

1948
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:37,400
and the the progeny from those breedings

1949
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:39,429
will it'll take an exceptional amount of

1950
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:42,229
stress to make them seed themselves

1951
01:19:39,429 --> 01:19:44,270
something like cherry pie does it take

1952
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:46,309
any stress at all just seeds itself

1953
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:48,260
right unless you're like some kind of

1954
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:49,880
phenomenal space grower I don't know

1955
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:51,800
everybody who I know is like dude you

1956
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,239
grow cherry pie you're gonna be picking

1957
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,219
off some balls off the bottom of the

1958
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:58,509
plant before you flour it out it's about

1959
01:19:55,219 --> 01:20:00,560
day 21 today 25 or something day 30 and

1960
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:02,000
it's just gonna start getting these

1961
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:08,330
little balls at the bottom of the plant

1962
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:10,310
so if I would have used that as a mother

1963
01:20:08,329 --> 01:20:13,579
and hit it with the lime and released

1964
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:17,330
cherry lime seeds it would have been a

1965
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:22,729
disaster like I would have never done

1966
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:25,180
that so even at this point I'm still you

1967
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:27,879
know I'm still having people Testament

1968
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:30,240
or I'm growing them outdoor on that s4

1969
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:34,390
with a few different directions and

1970
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:36,579
they're all very stable outdoor they're

1971
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:38,560
even stable indoor for really good

1972
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:41,760
growers which is better than Cherry Pie

1973
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,920
but they're not they're not stable

1974
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:48,039
indoor in every it's not every line is

1975
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:51,369
good like the number seven line is you

1976
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:53,619
know one out of five my buddy my buddy

1977
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:59,229
Jasper had to do before he got a good

1978
01:20:53,619 --> 01:21:01,599
one the number eight quality over

1979
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:05,019
quantity love them and he had no

1980
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:08,890
problems whatsoever and the number eight

1981
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:10,780
there's also Kevin Joe jury has a

1982
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:14,920
cut-off of that that you know I guess

1983
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:18,250
does really well no matter what so you

1984
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:21,760
know it's a matter of okay what kind of

1985
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:23,920
an S one is it and then in that case you

1986
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,110
know like here's the deal if you take

1987
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:28,029
the wrong road and you get to s five

1988
01:21:26,109 --> 01:21:30,670
where you get to s ten or you get to s

1989
01:21:28,029 --> 01:21:32,619
twenty you're gonna have plants that are

1990
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:34,510
so herm that you won't even know there's

1991
01:21:32,619 --> 01:21:37,300
females in there they're just gonna all

1992
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:39,699
be producing pollen like mad if you take

1993
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:41,560
the right turn you're gonna get plants

1994
01:21:39,699 --> 01:21:43,960
where you're like dude I watered it with

1995
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,880
all this stuff I used like everything

1996
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,279
they use to make feminized seeds and I

1997
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,440
can't get these suckers to reverse just

1998
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:52,599
depends on which road you take so you

1999
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:56,339
have to take it in the right direction

2000
01:21:52,600 --> 01:22:00,070
so honestly think that there's a big

2001
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:03,130
lack of people making s1 seeds and the

2002
01:22:00,069 --> 01:22:07,929
reason I say that is because people lose

2003
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:10,750
clones so like my buddy right now has

2004
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:14,020
this skunk six it's this incredible

2005
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:16,510
plant and everybody wants it and nobody

2006
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:20,920
has it and he has it and he's almost

2007
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:22,780
lost it and it's my opinion not that

2008
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,760
these seeds need to be distributed

2009
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:26,559
necessarily but that they do need to be

2010
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,510
made like I told him I'm off dude get

2011
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,930
some of those cuts up there to inspect

2012
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:33,579
and have them s won those out so you got

2013
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:36,700
the seeds to put in the fridge because

2014
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:37,670
um you know as long as you test out a

2015
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:39,889
stress test

2016
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:41,449
Zess ones you're gonna find s ones that

2017
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:43,489
are more stable than the mother they

2018
01:22:41,448 --> 01:22:45,019
came from and you're gonna find some

2019
01:22:43,488 --> 01:22:47,089
better less so that's the nature of

2020
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:49,489
genetics is that you always get

2021
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:53,060
something that's more so and one that's

2022
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:54,678
less so you get like you know a more

2023
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:57,110
resinous plant and you get a less

2024
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:58,850
resinous plant you get a more purple

2025
01:22:57,109 --> 01:23:00,649
plant and you get a less purple plant

2026
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:02,960
you get a taller one you get a shorter

2027
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:04,488
one so you get all these combinations of

2028
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:09,760
whatever is in the gene pool of the

2029
01:23:04,488 --> 01:23:12,409
plant you know and I really think that

2030
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,510
that selfing stuff is neat I had this

2031
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:17,210
Northern Lights back in the day the one

2032
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:19,130
we got an 89 from seeds and it was

2033
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:21,198
incredible and it still did this day's

2034
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:22,670
one of my favorite plants I underrated

2035
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:25,129
it for years because it was a little

2036
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:28,039
plane on the Terp side although the

2037
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:31,900
flavor was incredible I just kind of

2038
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:34,460
didn't I don't know I was a little bit

2039
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:36,500
infatuated with smells that were a

2040
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:39,109
little more crazy so I didn't really

2041
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:42,590
realize how amazing of just like a hash

2042
01:23:39,109 --> 01:23:44,750
plant this thing was and it used to in

2043
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:48,350
cases where like the generators would

2044
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:51,350
die for you know a couple days before

2045
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:53,390
they could get back up and running or it

2046
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:55,910
would get heat stressed or whatever

2047
01:23:53,390 --> 01:24:01,160
these different issues are it would seed

2048
01:23:55,909 --> 01:24:02,988
itself and these seeds we always want oh

2049
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:03,409
they're hermie seeds and we always threw

2050
01:24:02,988 --> 01:24:05,479
them away

2051
01:24:03,409 --> 01:24:07,460
and every year there would be one or two

2052
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:09,229
that would be in the compost pile it

2053
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,420
would come up and we go oh it's a girl

2054
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:14,529
let's go ahead and grow it give it a

2055
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:18,829
shot and they'd always be perfect and

2056
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:20,599
you know we just thought just throw the

2057
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:22,609
seeds away I like wasn't looking at the

2058
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,920
evidence that no look these plants are

2059
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:27,139
good because we already had the clone I

2060
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,969
figured I'd never lose that clone you

2061
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:31,910
know we got it in 89 that clone was

2062
01:24:28,969 --> 01:24:35,448
around to like 2005 but then that clone

2063
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:37,189
got lost the only guy who had it he

2064
01:24:35,448 --> 01:24:39,349
lived by the Russian River which is

2065
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:41,659
notorious for flooding he had it in a

2066
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,820
trailer in a grove by the Russian River

2067
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:47,090
the Russian River flooded it washed the

2068
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:50,989
trailer and all the stock was law

2069
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:53,810
and and now I go god I wish I had some I

2070
01:24:50,989 --> 01:24:56,779
wish I had one of those bags of handfuls

2071
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:59,780
of beautiful brown pear-shaped Northern

2072
01:24:56,779 --> 01:25:02,929
Lights s1 seeds that I threw away you

2073
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:04,729
know and so I think it's important that

2074
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:06,890
people do it for preservation I don't

2075
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:09,619
know as much for distribution unless

2076
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:11,210
people kind of let you know like you

2077
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:13,220
really got to know the parent is it

2078
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:14,840
hermie Brown is it not hermie prone

2079
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:16,579
because if it's a hermie prone parent

2080
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:20,539
and you know if it's prone to intersects

2081
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:21,680
trait then you're gonna you know you're

2082
01:25:20,539 --> 01:25:23,090
gonna have you're gonna have some

2083
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:25,130
problems with those seeds but for

2084
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:28,039
preservation purposes I think that

2085
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:32,329
feminized seeds and soft seeds are a

2086
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:34,159
really neat tool and especially in the

2087
01:25:32,329 --> 01:25:37,069
case where you have the clone and you

2088
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:39,309
don't have the population of seeds to

2089
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:42,769
pull a male from or whatever you know

2090
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:44,660
yeah awesome and so maybe it's like a

2091
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:46,790
little follow-up question do you think

2092
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:49,340
that if you have a plant that doesn't

2093
01:25:46,789 --> 01:25:50,899
display any humanik traits on in normal

2094
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:53,090
cases you know like it's just a stable

2095
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:55,549
plant by all measure but for whatever

2096
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:57,319
reason it's exposed to some serious

2097
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:59,570
stress maybe a light leak for example

2098
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:02,059
and it produces some nana's and makes ms

2099
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:04,909
ones do you think that those seeds are

2100
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:06,380
necessarily more homey prone so to speak

2101
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:08,300
because the general consensus would be

2102
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:10,550
that like a plant that tends to Hermey

2103
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,020
you know the seeds will likewise tend to

2104
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:14,029
hear me so I'm interested like if a

2105
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:16,790
stable plant makes us one that's due to

2106
01:26:14,029 --> 01:26:18,199
the stress is is those offspring any

2107
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:20,359
more likely to hurt me than the mother

2108
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:22,670
like were they stable as well so to

2109
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:24,529
speak yeah I think there's a crazy

2110
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:27,710
stigma surrounding the whole thing where

2111
01:26:24,529 --> 01:26:29,569
people though feminized seeds hermie and

2112
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:31,670
I think the reason why is because a lot

2113
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:34,000
of people take plants that are easy to

2114
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:36,050
reverse they reverse them they make

2115
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,310
quote-unquote feminized seeds which

2116
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:39,500
really aren't feminized they're usually

2117
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:41,990
about 90% I mean you can go all the way

2118
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:43,460
back to marijuana botany that I read

2119
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:44,899
when I was a kid and they tell you hey

2120
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:47,840
if a plant seeds itself you're gonna

2121
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:49,039
probably get about 90% female so you're

2122
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,770
gonna get the rest of them are gonna be

2123
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,359
like true intersex plants which means

2124
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,400
you know you're gonna have like you're

2125
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:57,688
gonna have balls on one side and hairs

2126
01:26:55,399 --> 01:27:00,058
on the other side

2127
01:26:57,689 --> 01:27:03,719
I think that because people did that

2128
01:27:00,059 --> 01:27:07,229
where they took these plants that go

2129
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:09,689
really easy you know like the apple

2130
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:11,579
doesn't fall far from the tree if you

2131
01:27:09,689 --> 01:27:14,668
have a plant that likes to seed itself

2132
01:27:11,578 --> 01:27:16,618
and it seeds itself you're gonna have a

2133
01:27:14,668 --> 01:27:18,380
progeny that are gonna like to seed

2134
01:27:16,618 --> 01:27:21,859
themselves if you have a plant that

2135
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:25,168
won't seed itself unless it's in very

2136
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:27,058
unusual circumstances then you're gonna

2137
01:27:25,168 --> 01:27:30,958
get progeny where the bulk of those

2138
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:32,788
seeds are not going to they're not gonna

2139
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:35,130
seed themselves unless they're under

2140
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:39,958
those same extraordinary circumstances

2141
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:42,059
so yeah I really think that that I

2142
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:44,488
really think that the the stigma

2143
01:27:42,059 --> 01:27:46,529
surrounding feminized seeds I really

2144
01:27:44,488 --> 01:27:51,149
think it comes from people choosing poor

2145
01:27:46,529 --> 01:27:53,130
parents and that if you use the right

2146
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:54,359
parents then you know you're gonna get

2147
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:56,010
something good and then I think it's

2148
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:58,408
important that people understand that

2149
01:27:56,010 --> 01:28:00,929
being that there's no male in the cross

2150
01:27:58,408 --> 01:28:03,238
and that some of those plants in the

2151
01:28:00,929 --> 01:28:06,239
cross are gonna represent the male

2152
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:08,158
plants basically those are they're gonna

2153
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:11,848
be the ones that are like males with

2154
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:13,738
hairs they're like 50/50 so you you know

2155
01:28:11,849 --> 01:28:16,860
you shouldn't be surprised if you get a

2156
01:28:13,738 --> 01:28:20,788
pack if you get it if you get you know

2157
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:25,139
ten seeds and one of those are two of

2158
01:28:20,788 --> 01:28:29,578
those seeds in that pack is gonna be a

2159
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:31,739
full-blown intersex plant because those

2160
01:28:29,578 --> 01:28:33,658
are basically the males in the pack not

2161
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:35,638
that you want to use those as males but

2162
01:28:33,658 --> 01:28:39,748
that those are the ones that are in the

2163
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:44,880
population trying to ensure that they

2164
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:46,738
make more seeds you know so no oh sorry

2165
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,099
going yeah no no no go ahead go ahead

2166
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,958
man

2167
01:28:47,099 --> 01:28:50,069
I was just gonna say you kind of jumped

2168
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:52,019
in on the next question I was gonna ask

2169
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:53,609
him that yeah should you ever use those

2170
01:28:52,019 --> 01:28:56,010
into six months as males because I know

2171
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:58,828
that the most notable example in my mind

2172
01:28:56,010 --> 01:29:00,479
is and this is not like a bad thing

2173
01:28:58,828 --> 01:29:03,299
because I think the strain is quite good

2174
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:04,739
how many purple bike Ana buyer and they

2175
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:07,320
said that that whole project initially

2176
01:29:04,738 --> 01:29:09,058
started by finding what was essentially

2177
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:11,039
a mile above a Koosh out of what was

2178
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:12,720
meant to be a pack of s ones and

2179
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:15,119
bread that for several generations so

2180
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:18,449
maybe not the best example but overall

2181
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:20,729
the work doesn't seem to be super homey

2182
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:23,699
prone but I mean it also has basically

2183
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:25,469
no potency as far as my own growing sure

2184
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:26,670
how do you feel about using those mouths

2185
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:28,740
and the other little point I'll add is

2186
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:30,329
DJ short once said that he thought they

2187
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:32,909
were the best males like the male's

2188
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:34,739
which had a few pollens there are a few

2189
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:36,149
pistols on them and stuff and so I

2190
01:29:34,739 --> 01:29:38,279
always thought that's really weird like

2191
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:41,609
was that just like a an idea he just

2192
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:43,079
pulled outta nowhere you know I don't

2193
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:45,149
think it is it's something that I've

2194
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:47,850
kind of been trying to explore talking

2195
01:29:45,149 --> 01:29:49,859
to people it's something that I've been

2196
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:54,420
able to read a little bit on forums a

2197
01:29:49,859 --> 01:29:57,000
Tom Hill talking about DJ short various

2198
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,220
people I know a breeder of a really

2199
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,560
successful strain who doesn't actually

2200
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:05,670
want to be mentioned by name or by

2201
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:09,510
strain because he used a mail like that

2202
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:12,119
and he got basically the most stable

2203
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:15,720
progeny anyone's really ever seen out of

2204
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:17,909
any of their stuff and it was a male

2205
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:20,280
alright there's that there's a division

2206
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:23,250
though if you have ones that are

2207
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:26,819
straight feminized and then you and then

2208
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:28,829
they come up and they are self tore

2209
01:30:26,819 --> 01:30:30,659
whatever you know they come up and

2210
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:32,399
they're they're like 50/50

2211
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:35,399
there's hares at first and there's balls

2212
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:39,210
at first ok those ones to me those are

2213
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:40,739
very unattractive because in in in my

2214
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:43,560
mind although I've never seen it in

2215
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:45,719
practice in my mind that's what they are

2216
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,090
gonna bring to the table is more plants

2217
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:51,270
that are just 50/50 and 50/50 doesn't

2218
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:54,210
play for us you know so there's a big

2219
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:56,520
difference though between what DJ shorts

2220
01:30:54,210 --> 01:31:00,539
talking about which is actually a male

2221
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:03,390
plant which shows mail and grows as a

2222
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:07,050
male all the way until it reaches

2223
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:09,270
towards the late part of its life and

2224
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:14,190
all of a sudden starts to grow hairs

2225
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:16,350
right now there's there's females we

2226
01:31:14,189 --> 01:31:18,269
know and this is where people are gonna

2227
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:20,460
start to go oh man genes lost it here

2228
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:22,200
and I'm not saying just as a disclaimer

2229
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:23,809
I'm not saying this is what I'm gonna

2230
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:26,628
start doing this is what I

2231
01:31:23,809 --> 01:31:29,059
do I haven't actually done any real work

2232
01:31:26,628 --> 01:31:31,788
with this so it's not solid stuff it's

2233
01:31:29,059 --> 01:31:35,628
just something to basically tickle your

2234
01:31:31,788 --> 01:31:37,488
brain so you can actually go okay hmm

2235
01:31:35,628 --> 01:31:40,338
this is this is where this is a this is

2236
01:31:37,488 --> 01:31:42,858
a human all right you have these plants

2237
01:31:40,338 --> 01:31:46,038
that grow and they're completely male

2238
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:47,869
and I have seen them and they come from

2239
01:31:46,038 --> 01:31:51,408
ultra-stable lines like some of my

2240
01:31:47,868 --> 01:31:53,299
Afghan YZ and I got this stuff from

2241
01:31:51,408 --> 01:31:57,138
Kentucky from a buddy of mine

2242
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:59,779
Shanti Farms that was really good and

2243
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:03,529
really stable and showed no problems

2244
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:06,828
whatsoever with the females ever but the

2245
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:08,868
male's when they reach a late stage of

2246
01:32:06,828 --> 01:32:11,799
flowering they begin to produce a little

2247
01:32:08,868 --> 01:32:17,448
bit of female flowers in the male

2248
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:20,059
clusters so what I think is interesting

2249
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:22,608
is that we know that there's things like

2250
01:32:20,059 --> 01:32:24,139
hemp that basically are 5050 like those

2251
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:29,389
plants we're talking about to come out

2252
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:31,010
of the S ones they're 50/50 because when

2253
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:32,958
they grow hemp they want it to finish at

2254
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:34,969
the same time and males finish early and

2255
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:36,438
they begin to basically break down and

2256
01:32:34,969 --> 01:32:37,698
you start to screw up your hemp they

2257
01:32:36,439 --> 01:32:41,030
don't get as big you don't have a

2258
01:32:37,698 --> 01:32:42,529
consistent agricultural crop so that's

2259
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:45,618
normal we already know that that's

2260
01:32:42,529 --> 01:32:49,719
normal and can happen in cannabis so if

2261
01:32:45,618 --> 01:32:52,818
we know that a 50-50 state exists then

2262
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:57,828
we also know that we have these plants

2263
01:32:52,819 --> 01:33:03,889
where the females when they go late the

2264
01:32:57,828 --> 01:33:06,529
females start to actually stress or feel

2265
01:33:03,889 --> 01:33:08,328
overdone or feel freaked out because

2266
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:10,878
they haven't set seeds yet or whatever

2267
01:33:08,328 --> 01:33:12,948
it is and then they start to get you

2268
01:33:10,878 --> 01:33:15,019
know some balls late in life usually

2269
01:33:12,948 --> 01:33:17,509
there's a lot of different types of it

2270
01:33:15,019 --> 01:33:19,729
but you know some of them get just the

2271
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:23,829
bananas or some get little balls up at

2272
01:33:19,729 --> 01:33:27,079
the top or however they do it

2273
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:30,078
it's just interesting to wonder that

2274
01:33:27,078 --> 01:33:32,389
okay if that is one side of it could

2275
01:33:30,078 --> 01:33:34,128
that could the in in it and it's

2276
01:33:32,389 --> 01:33:35,958
genetically influenced because we know

2277
01:33:34,128 --> 01:33:36,708
it is because plants that are you know

2278
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:38,399
quote-unquote

2279
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:40,559
herby

2280
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:43,129
they are hermie prone it is their gene

2281
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:45,870
pool let's not all environment you know

2282
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:49,859
so you have to wonder okay is there an

2283
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:53,430
opposite state to that is there a state

2284
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:57,899
where the females like assuming that

2285
01:33:53,430 --> 01:34:02,880
it's possible that the the the females

2286
01:33:57,899 --> 01:34:05,279
that go hermie are our gene pools that

2287
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,260
are like so male that even the females

2288
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:11,069
are slightly male could there be an

2289
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:13,949
opposite state where the females are so

2290
01:34:11,069 --> 01:34:17,219
female that even the males are slightly

2291
01:34:13,949 --> 01:34:20,670
female and would that be the most stable

2292
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:23,369
form of genetics for what we want it for

2293
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:26,460
where the females will never produce

2294
01:34:23,369 --> 01:34:28,649
male parts and is that what that would

2295
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:30,569
look like and I'm not saying that that's

2296
01:34:28,649 --> 01:34:35,489
how it is or that's the case but that's

2297
01:34:30,569 --> 01:34:37,079
the point that Tom Hill GJ short who are

2298
01:34:35,489 --> 01:34:39,359
definitely not rookies in the breeding

2299
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:40,890
game they're they were curious about it

2300
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:43,679
and when I read about it I became

2301
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:45,960
curious about it too because you have to

2302
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:48,780
wonder okay if we have a 50-50 state and

2303
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,819
we have a state where the gene pool is

2304
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:54,630
so male that even the females are

2305
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:58,139
slightly male is their gene pools where

2306
01:34:54,630 --> 01:35:00,720
the females are so female that even the

2307
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:01,950
males are slightly female so that anyway

2308
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:05,369
that's that whole thing you were just

2309
01:35:01,949 --> 01:35:07,859
you brought up from DJ short yeah that's

2310
01:35:05,369 --> 01:35:10,349
that's actually how should I say

2311
01:35:07,859 --> 01:35:12,089
reassuring to hear is that I've done the

2312
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:13,680
same thing with one of my lines and I

2313
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:15,090
too found that the protein you are all

2314
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:17,909
extremely stable I haven't found any

2315
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:20,130
hermès but what I wanted to ask was have

2316
01:35:17,909 --> 01:35:23,069
you ever done it yourself in that you

2317
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:25,260
had the male produce some calluses and

2318
01:35:23,069 --> 01:35:26,849
then it pollinated itself so it's made

2319
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,980
an S one off the mat and then you grown

2320
01:35:26,850 --> 01:35:30,840
that out cuz I've done that no I mean

2321
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:33,359
the property to get males no I got a

2322
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,770
female and I'm growing it out okay I've

2323
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,449
been told that if you do that then

2324
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:38,010
you'll get males but I've never like I

2325
01:35:36,449 --> 01:35:40,349
said I've never done anything with it

2326
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:42,690
it's all theory for me it was just that

2327
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:46,740
I I see these guys who were kind of who

2328
01:35:42,689 --> 01:35:49,229
who were who are experienced and who are

2329
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:51,090
older than me and here they are you know

2330
01:35:49,229 --> 01:35:53,819
playing with this idea I'm like

2331
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:55,650
yeah I don't know I mean it looks

2332
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:57,118
interesting so for me it's all totally

2333
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:59,879
speculation you know that's why I was

2334
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:02,549
making sure that people know that um you

2335
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:05,069
know I'm not on the I'm not drinking the

2336
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:10,110
kool-aid I just am curious you know how

2337
01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:12,058
it tastes good phrase good phrase

2338
01:36:10,109 --> 01:36:13,948
so just to jump off topic for a moment

2339
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:15,719
at the Emerald cup I was really grateful

2340
01:36:13,948 --> 01:36:17,879
to be able to try some of the skunk you

2341
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:19,260
were playing with the thing I remember

2342
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,690
taking away from it was it had this

2343
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:24,599
awesome skunky metallic vibe and it made

2344
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:27,238
me wonder what do you think is the deal

2345
01:36:24,599 --> 01:36:28,739
with metallic tasting terpenes or we'd

2346
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:30,468
like surely it has to be a terpene

2347
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:32,908
combination right like surely we're not

2348
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:34,679
inhaling you know larger than normal

2349
01:36:32,908 --> 01:36:37,408
levels of aluminum or something like

2350
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:39,690
that well I can tell you you know that

2351
01:36:37,408 --> 01:36:42,479
because I because I grew it and I tried

2352
01:36:39,689 --> 01:36:45,229
it I know that there's nothing weird in

2353
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:45,229
that weed

2354
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:52,229
it's very metallic to me it smells like

2355
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:55,170
blood was kind of my take on it um it

2356
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:56,939
really like it smells like you have a

2357
01:36:55,170 --> 01:36:59,550
nosebleed kinda in it

2358
01:36:56,939 --> 01:37:01,500
it smells like skunk like the animal it

2359
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:05,010
was kind of a true skunky smell with a

2360
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:10,130
lot of metal behind it and that came out

2361
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:12,539
of the black lime it's a weird throw and

2362
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:15,840
you know I don't really know but I do

2363
01:37:12,538 --> 01:37:20,219
know that there's stuff going on that is

2364
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:22,170
separate from terpenes you know we

2365
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:24,000
consider terpenes to be responsible for

2366
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:25,980
a hundred percent of the smell and weed

2367
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,059
but there is other stuff that goes on in

2368
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:32,038
there that creates smells aside from you

2369
01:37:30,059 --> 01:37:35,038
know things in nature that create smells

2370
01:37:32,038 --> 01:37:39,569
like you know bacteria or fungus or

2371
01:37:35,038 --> 01:37:41,719
whatever but um you know III wonder I

2372
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:44,639
don't know I mean what is what is that

2373
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:47,550
what is what's the blood terpene it's

2374
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,868
really weird man that weed was so killer

2375
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:51,270
though that's so really that was a

2376
01:37:48,868 --> 01:37:53,339
really exceptional plant and luckily I

2377
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:56,250
made some seeds on that so in the future

2378
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:58,409
I'll probably go through them and I

2379
01:37:56,250 --> 01:38:01,469
still have some of the weed I suppose I

2380
01:37:58,408 --> 01:38:03,538
could get it tested and then you know

2381
01:38:01,469 --> 01:38:04,680
that might give us an answer I think I

2382
01:38:03,538 --> 01:38:08,550
need to probably start doing

2383
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:11,010
not basically filing away a sample of

2384
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:13,800
every single plant just so that if

2385
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:15,900
something comes into question in

2386
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,130
hindsight we can go ahead and test it

2387
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:19,519
even though it we kind of missed the

2388
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:22,170
boat because I can still test that now

2389
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,030
yeah but yeah really really really

2390
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:25,140
that's a really weird one dude I I don't

2391
01:38:24,029 --> 01:38:27,779
I don't know what that is but I mean

2392
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:30,570
there's there's um you know there's like

2393
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:36,359
the purple color and weed has has a

2394
01:38:30,569 --> 01:38:38,279
flavor to it depending on what it is you

2395
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:40,139
know there's there there is stuff in

2396
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:41,759
there it might not necessarily be a

2397
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:43,440
terpene but it seems like it's it

2398
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,300
probably is a terpene it's just weird

2399
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:46,949
because I don't ever see like on the

2400
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:50,100
terpene wheel them going yeah this

2401
01:38:46,949 --> 01:38:51,960
smells like an old dirty nickel or you

2402
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,030
know smells like the gate the chain on

2403
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:55,289
your gate or an old dirty lock or

2404
01:38:54,029 --> 01:38:57,869
something that's how that weed smell

2405
01:38:55,289 --> 01:39:00,569
does really yeah it was some really cool

2406
01:38:57,869 --> 01:39:02,220
stuff thanks again for that jumping at

2407
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:04,439
my next little skunk question the

2408
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:06,180
roadkill skunk long debated much talked

2409
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:08,099
about on the show we're slowly getting

2410
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:10,079
there though first and foremost what do

2411
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,490
you think the genetics are because over

2412
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,729
time we've had a larger and larger

2413
01:39:11,489 --> 01:39:16,679
amount of guests seem to either agree or

2414
01:39:14,729 --> 01:39:19,739
throw it out there that it is also their

2415
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:23,700
belief that the the name roadkill skunk

2416
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:25,409
is likely just a name saying for how it

2417
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:26,819
smells but not a reference to the

2418
01:39:25,409 --> 01:39:27,960
genetics and most people have been

2419
01:39:26,819 --> 01:39:30,179
throwing it out there that they think it

2420
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:33,270
was maybe an Afghani even what do you

2421
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:35,250
think yeah I mean I can Chuck my two

2422
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:38,790
pennies from the peanut gallery here I

2423
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:41,159
don't really have you know this is

2424
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:45,479
definitely not my expertise is what is

2425
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:47,489
skunk but what have I seen that was

2426
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:50,369
skunky you know the super skunk was

2427
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:52,769
skunky and we know that was Afghani it's

2428
01:39:50,369 --> 01:39:55,500
across a course it's like a skunk Afghan

2429
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:58,650
ears I you know like I said it's not

2430
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:02,970
really am I not my thing is the skunk

2431
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:04,829
but um I have only ever grown one plant

2432
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:07,670
that to me was like really like a dead

2433
01:40:04,829 --> 01:40:11,130
skunk I got it from I got it from Steve

2434
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:13,409
see money's dad that was uh what he

2435
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:16,319
called pissy pungent favorito he gave

2436
01:40:13,409 --> 01:40:17,889
like Spanglish names to a lot of stuff

2437
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:20,498
that's where I got the name

2438
01:40:17,889 --> 01:40:24,969
Pina for my pineapple strain that I got

2439
01:40:20,498 --> 01:40:26,828
from those guys you know pissy pungent

2440
01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:29,889
favorito man it was that kind of weed

2441
01:40:26,828 --> 01:40:31,958
where if you have it you know you like

2442
01:40:29,889 --> 01:40:33,819
God who apologize to people even if they

2443
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:35,889
smoke because it's like hey sorry I'm

2444
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:38,679
sorry I got this in my pocket guys like

2445
01:40:35,889 --> 01:40:42,010
you know like hey you need to you need

2446
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:44,199
to probably wash your t-shirt and go you

2447
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:46,510
know take a bath and some tomato juice

2448
01:40:44,198 --> 01:40:48,578
cuz you smell like you got dirty laundry

2449
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:52,329
and skunk all over you man it's just

2450
01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:53,918
funky and raw and it was here's the

2451
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:55,748
thing to me is the reason why I'm

2452
01:40:53,918 --> 01:40:57,398
interested in skunk is not because I'm

2453
01:40:55,748 --> 01:40:59,228
not impressed by something that smells

2454
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:04,499
like a dead skunk it was because when I

2455
01:40:59,229 --> 01:41:08,739
had that weed which was an Afghani it

2456
01:41:04,498 --> 01:41:11,429
tasted so delicious it's so hard to

2457
01:41:08,738 --> 01:41:14,828
describe what it tasted like it was this

2458
01:41:11,429 --> 01:41:16,689
like I don't know man like I you know

2459
01:41:14,828 --> 01:41:20,018
it's one of those weird ones where I can

2460
01:41:16,689 --> 01:41:22,749
only describe it as tasting like the

2461
01:41:20,019 --> 01:41:24,309
color of like a like a parking cone here

2462
01:41:22,748 --> 01:41:27,069
in the States you know just like it was

2463
01:41:24,309 --> 01:41:28,269
like this orange not like citrus but it

2464
01:41:27,069 --> 01:41:31,719
was this it was just this thing that

2465
01:41:28,269 --> 01:41:33,610
just lights up your tongue like so hard

2466
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:36,849
to describe man but it was such an

2467
01:41:33,609 --> 01:41:38,228
incredible smell and taste and it was

2468
01:41:36,849 --> 01:41:39,939
just like my favorite weed ever and I

2469
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:42,070
had one little plan of it and I grew

2470
01:41:39,939 --> 01:41:44,260
that that was the first time in 94 that

2471
01:41:42,069 --> 01:41:47,558
I grew those seeds that I got and I

2472
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:49,599
never had another thing like it the

2473
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:51,639
closest I saw to it was what I called

2474
01:41:49,599 --> 01:41:54,069
the arcade of Super Skunk which I'm not

2475
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:56,708
positive if it's the skunk 6 or the

2476
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:59,618
skunk 4 or any of these other ones that

2477
01:41:56,708 --> 01:42:03,458
people have I'm excited to see the skunk

2478
01:41:59,618 --> 01:42:07,389
6 cuz talking to talking to a couple

2479
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:09,578
guys it seems like it could be the same

2480
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:11,559
one that was like the closest thing that

2481
01:42:09,578 --> 01:42:16,380
I ever smelled to the pissy pungent was

2482
01:42:11,559 --> 01:42:19,149
a super skunk and then you know like

2483
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:21,130
honestly like out of the lime like you

2484
01:42:19,149 --> 01:42:24,099
know you smelled that one it's in the

2485
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:25,868
ballpark of animal animal funk skunk

2486
01:42:24,099 --> 01:42:27,429
there's a lot of skunk enos in the lime

2487
01:42:25,868 --> 01:42:29,648
the lime will make your clothes smell

2488
01:42:27,429 --> 01:42:31,699
like a skunk it'll make your car smell

2489
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:37,579
like a skunk but a

2490
01:42:31,699 --> 01:42:42,189
close it smells like usually like a mix

2491
01:42:37,579 --> 01:42:47,569
of like you know gasoline lime peels

2492
01:42:42,189 --> 01:42:50,869
urinal cakes and you know Spearman in

2493
01:42:47,569 --> 01:42:52,369
earth and moss and funk and but but from

2494
01:42:50,869 --> 01:42:54,079
a distance that smells like a skunk and

2495
01:42:52,369 --> 01:42:56,420
there was a lot of weed back in the day

2496
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,880
that was really skunky from a distance

2497
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:00,529
more so than now but then there was some

2498
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,119
stuff that's there's another skunk to

2499
01:43:00,529 --> 01:43:05,689
you that was Afghani based actually

2500
01:43:02,119 --> 01:43:08,479
there I had a buddy up here and we

2501
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:10,399
called him we called him Grimble and the

2502
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:12,859
weed that his family had we'd call it

2503
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:15,829
grymps grapes and to this day grymps

2504
01:43:12,859 --> 01:43:18,949
grapes is one of those strains that is

2505
01:43:15,829 --> 01:43:20,989
one of those lost lost Grail strains

2506
01:43:18,949 --> 01:43:22,970
like if somebody had that it would be

2507
01:43:20,989 --> 01:43:26,090
incredible it was like when you would

2508
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:27,530
open it up in the car you wouldn't think

2509
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:30,980
someone opened weed you would think

2510
01:43:27,529 --> 01:43:32,869
somebody drove by a dead skunk and then

2511
01:43:30,979 --> 01:43:35,179
when you smelled it up closest smelled

2512
01:43:32,869 --> 01:43:38,349
like a skunk but it smelled like pine

2513
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:42,350
and the only reason why it was called

2514
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:43,970
grapes was because it was purple and it

2515
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:47,720
had nothing to do with a smile it was

2516
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:50,750
skunk pine and it was skunky really in

2517
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:53,210
an amazing way it was super super funky

2518
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:54,829
and that was another one and that was

2519
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:56,480
one that you could really easily look at

2520
01:43:54,829 --> 01:44:00,170
the weed and go yeah that's Afghani

2521
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,549
that's just a straight Afghani so and I

2522
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:03,619
mean you can go back and you can read

2523
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:06,199
like marijuana botany and you can read

2524
01:44:03,619 --> 01:44:07,309
any of these old books and they'll tell

2525
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:10,369
you if you want

2526
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:12,140
acrid skunky funky weed you know it

2527
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:16,039
comes from Afghani and when I smell a

2528
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:19,940
skunk I smell coffee onion burnt rubber

2529
01:44:16,039 --> 01:44:21,619
garlic and what everybody calls skunk

2530
01:44:19,939 --> 01:44:23,389
that you think of when you smell a skunk

2531
01:44:21,619 --> 01:44:25,670
at a distance but if you've ever had

2532
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:29,030
like a house skunked or a car ran over a

2533
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:31,670
skunk in an old car it makes your eyes

2534
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:34,069
burn and it smells more like burnt it

2535
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:38,390
smells like it smells like somebody you

2536
01:44:34,069 --> 01:44:40,969
know put you know a piece of a tire a

2537
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:42,920
bunch of garlic a bunch of onions and

2538
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:44,909
they took that all and they lit it on

2539
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:47,069
fire and blew it in your face that's

2540
01:44:44,908 --> 01:44:49,138
and some coffee beans you know that's

2541
01:44:47,069 --> 01:44:50,880
what it really smells like a real

2542
01:44:49,139 --> 01:44:52,710
[ __ ] dead skunk on the road for

2543
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,230
people who haven't actually you know

2544
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:57,179
smelled a you know an American skunk

2545
01:44:55,229 --> 01:44:58,888
it's it's a really really funky smell

2546
01:44:57,179 --> 01:45:00,899
and then there's the smell we think of

2547
01:44:58,889 --> 01:45:03,090
from weed that's the skunky smell but um

2548
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:05,579
if anybody's gonna have a real roadkill

2549
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:07,319
skunk I mean there's those noser smells

2550
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:09,359
that I've smelled come out of afghani a

2551
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:14,519
lot it's not rare to smell a garlicky

2552
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:16,920
oniony a coffee ish those things come

2553
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:18,120
out a burnt rubber so you know someone's

2554
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:19,920
gonna have to find the right combination

2555
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:22,948
of something that smells kind of like

2556
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,050
what I gave to you and then have the

2557
01:45:22,948 --> 01:45:26,908
heavy coffee the heavy burnt onion the

2558
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:28,920
burnt garlic at the burnt rubber does

2559
01:45:26,908 --> 01:45:30,689
those things are you know and I smell a

2560
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:34,500
dead skunk up close that's how it hits

2561
01:45:30,689 --> 01:45:36,178
me in the nose yeah I mean that's that's

2562
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:39,389
so interesting in relation to that

2563
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:41,069
grapes the gramps grapes about how is

2564
01:45:39,389 --> 01:45:42,869
purple but it smells like skunk because

2565
01:45:41,069 --> 01:45:44,880
we also referenced earlier how a lot of

2566
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:46,349
purple stuff tends to smell the same so

2567
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,389
that's really interesting I think

2568
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:50,579
ultimately the question is though is do

2569
01:45:48,389 --> 01:45:53,389
you think in theory cannabis as a whole

2570
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:56,340
has the potential to generate almost or

2571
01:45:53,389 --> 01:46:02,190
including every smell possible so to

2572
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:04,440
speak I as far as I've seen I think so I

2573
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:06,569
mean I know at least at one point it did

2574
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:09,569
I don't know about our current gene pool

2575
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:11,519
and what we've done with it because you

2576
01:46:09,569 --> 01:46:13,679
know it takes who knows how many

2577
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,750
thousands or millions of years it took

2578
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:18,329
to reach a point of diversity where it

2579
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:20,609
really produced everything and then we

2580
01:46:18,329 --> 01:46:22,859
kind of grabbed it all and did what we

2581
01:46:20,609 --> 01:46:24,389
did with it and now it's been bottle

2582
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:27,719
necked out and what's interesting with

2583
01:46:24,389 --> 01:46:30,329
genetics is that everything's still in

2584
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:33,000
there but it's not maybe in there short

2585
01:46:30,329 --> 01:46:34,829
term like we like there might be tons of

2586
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,279
stuff with roadkill skunk and I know we

2587
01:46:34,829 --> 01:46:40,829
could get it back to be that exact thing

2588
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:43,050
and maybe it's there right now but if

2589
01:46:40,829 --> 01:46:45,510
it's not there right now we don't know

2590
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:47,579
if it's gonna take six months or six

2591
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:49,619
thousand years to get back to the point

2592
01:46:47,579 --> 01:46:51,179
where we've opened the genetics back up

2593
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:53,340
to that point because things get

2594
01:46:51,179 --> 01:46:56,130
bottlenecked out and we think of them as

2595
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:58,170
being completely gone but if you were to

2596
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:59,670
grow millions

2597
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:01,949
these then you know things would pop

2598
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:03,480
back out it's just we're not you know we

2599
01:47:01,948 --> 01:47:06,059
don't have there's not enough people in

2600
01:47:03,479 --> 01:47:08,189
the world I don't think to bring back

2601
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:12,000
the diversity that was there possibly at

2602
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:14,099
one point but just to answer the

2603
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,579
question yes or no I think yes I think

2604
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:21,060
cannabis has the potential to produce

2605
01:47:17,579 --> 01:47:23,819
any smell that exists anywhere else in

2606
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:26,810
the world including bacterial and fungal

2607
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:29,488
smells I think so

2608
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:31,260
that's awesome that's so I think so as

2609
01:47:29,488 --> 01:47:33,509
well so I mean yeah interesting to see

2610
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,840
what it would take to actually do such a

2611
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:36,900
thing

2612
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:39,179
given like I mean certainly like for me

2613
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:40,738
mango pops up more than any other flavor

2614
01:47:39,179 --> 01:47:42,750
to me maybe it's just the things I

2615
01:47:40,738 --> 01:47:44,250
select but it's like given that like

2616
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:47,939
yeah there's a lot of things which must

2617
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:49,170
go unrepresented yeah and there you know

2618
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:51,988
there's things that just really take

2619
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:57,029
over gene pools it's really easy um for

2620
01:47:51,988 --> 01:47:59,759
you know I mean you know I'm not a I'm

2621
01:47:57,029 --> 01:48:02,009
not a terpene scientist but um you know

2622
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,619
if such a thing exists but as far my

2623
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:09,420
understanding is that a lot of times

2624
01:48:03,619 --> 01:48:11,510
it's like like limonene and and Mersin

2625
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:13,289
tend to be kind of the like the

2626
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:15,000
precursors to a lot of the other

2627
01:48:13,289 --> 01:48:16,198
terpenes that developed and I kind of

2628
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,270
noticed that because I'll smell

2629
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:19,559
something and I'll go this one smells

2630
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:21,120
like train wreck and then I'll go over

2631
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:23,580
here and I'll go this one smells like

2632
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:27,090
that sweet Afghani kind of berry grape

2633
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:29,100
Tootsie Pop kind of smell and then later

2634
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:30,869
on they develop and I go there's none of

2635
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:33,960
that left it's not there at all but it

2636
01:48:30,869 --> 01:48:37,469
kinda is there to start and you know I

2637
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:41,399
think that those things what happens is

2638
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:43,500
they kind of take over they kind of take

2639
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:45,719
over gene pools to where it's like wow

2640
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:48,238
okay if you got anything that's got that

2641
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:50,219
kind of train wreck II Amsterdam haze

2642
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:52,339
smell in there or you have anything that

2643
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:56,698
has that kind of great be raspberry

2644
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:58,739
sweet thing it's like they they take

2645
01:48:56,698 --> 01:49:01,439
over gene pools so much that I think

2646
01:48:58,738 --> 01:49:03,689
they've given themselves the reputation

2647
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:06,869
of being generic smells at this point

2648
01:49:03,689 --> 01:49:09,769
because they're just so dominant in gene

2649
01:49:06,869 --> 01:49:12,420
pools and I think that that

2650
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:14,370
you know everybody hybridizing things

2651
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:19,199
and kind of mishmash in and hodgepodge

2652
01:49:14,369 --> 01:49:21,359
and stuff up I think over over the years

2653
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:23,039
that it's like okay well you have this

2654
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:25,380
you have this real special thing over

2655
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:26,729
here that smells like roses and now you

2656
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,859
crossed it with this thing that smells

2657
01:49:26,729 --> 01:49:30,689
like train wreck and guess what you know

2658
01:49:28,859 --> 01:49:33,239
Rose is not going to overtake train

2659
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:35,399
wreck so now you just took a gene pool

2660
01:49:33,239 --> 01:49:37,170
that had something special in it and you

2661
01:49:35,399 --> 01:49:38,460
kind of erased it unless you want to

2662
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:41,250
grow like I said you want to grow

2663
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:43,980
thousands or millions of plants to try

2664
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:47,609
to you know recuperate those does kind

2665
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:49,589
of funk you know yeah I guess it's safe

2666
01:49:47,609 --> 01:49:52,289
to say one wrong step forward is gonna

2667
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:56,850
take a crazy amount of effort to undo it

2668
01:49:52,289 --> 01:49:58,079
in using those seeds generated yeah you

2669
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:59,640
know cuz because you have these

2670
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:01,380
different genes they behave different

2671
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,820
ways they don't play well with others at

2672
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:05,279
all they just come in and they just

2673
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:07,289
basically you know they just they just

2674
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:11,279
bully the whole yard you know and then

2675
01:50:07,289 --> 01:50:13,199
it's like okay well we now we have this

2676
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:15,599
you know I have one that's really cool

2677
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:18,899
um it has that smell but it has all

2678
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:22,140
these other smells and it it actually

2679
01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:24,779
keeps the smell and the other finer

2680
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:29,240
smells with it it's called candelabra I

2681
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:31,559
got it from a friend of mine in 2004 and

2682
01:50:29,239 --> 01:50:33,479
it was I used to call it the ten

2683
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:34,920
thousand smiles and some people smell

2684
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:36,959
and they go oh it smells like train

2685
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:38,399
wreck and I'm like dude smell it again

2686
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,869
and they're like oh it smells like great

2687
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:41,849
you're like smell it again they're like

2688
01:50:39,869 --> 01:50:43,739
oh it smells like orange asked all these

2689
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:44,400
terpenes and then when we see it get

2690
01:50:43,739 --> 01:50:47,130
tested

2691
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:50,009
you send it to SC labs where they test

2692
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:52,500
for like 35 terpenes and it hits for

2693
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:54,659
like 33 of them and there's not many

2694
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:56,340
strains that do stuff so it really does

2695
01:50:54,659 --> 01:50:58,619
have a lot of it really does have

2696
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:01,980
thousands of flavors in it you know but

2697
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:04,289
um but that's a neat one where it has

2698
01:51:01,979 --> 01:51:06,179
that thing in it that I kind of turned

2699
01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:08,729
off by that's kind of the train wreck

2700
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:13,140
smell because it just is it's like kind

2701
01:51:08,729 --> 01:51:14,759
of overly common you know but it but it

2702
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:18,210
has something really nice to it you know

2703
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:19,680
so it's they don't yeah

2704
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:21,850
they don't always ruin everything but

2705
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:24,020
they pop a tendency for sure

2706
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:26,240
so I mean while we're on the topics of

2707
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:28,670
like labs and all the modern kind of

2708
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:31,279
techniques that go along with that the

2709
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:34,279
emergence and growing popularity of

2710
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:35,960
these kind of um pre sexing science kits

2711
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:37,130
you can get seems to be growing

2712
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,779
initially I figured it would probably

2713
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:41,420
something more a breeder would be

2714
01:51:38,779 --> 01:51:43,819
interested in but I don't know it seems

2715
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:45,890
to be just on the rise growing in in

2716
01:51:43,819 --> 01:51:48,079
general is this something you'd be

2717
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:49,550
interested in because I mean given how

2718
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:51,649
many seeds you run through I figure

2719
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:53,420
maybe not like I mean you did be

2720
01:51:51,649 --> 01:51:55,549
spending crazy amounts and money on it

2721
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:56,960
but at the same time it seems to be a

2722
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:59,180
growing technology like do you think

2723
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,689
it'll stick around long term or not

2724
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:02,030
really

2725
01:51:59,689 --> 01:52:04,460
I think it'll stick around long term I

2726
01:52:02,029 --> 01:52:07,130
think it has its benefits I think that

2727
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:11,079
when new technologies come around the

2728
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:15,199
price line tends to drop really fast and

2729
01:52:11,079 --> 01:52:17,930
anything that's based on technology it

2730
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:19,729
has a big expense to start and as soon

2731
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:23,119
as it's been established then the price

2732
01:52:19,729 --> 01:52:24,859
drops and that price carries from the

2733
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:26,390
labs to the consumer because they want

2734
01:52:24,859 --> 01:52:28,219
to get everyone's money right they don't

2735
01:52:26,390 --> 01:52:29,720
just want people who have a lot of money

2736
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:32,539
so they're trying to get their prices

2737
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:38,030
down and I think eventually it would be

2738
01:52:32,539 --> 01:52:41,420
practical my joke as a as a as a troll

2739
01:52:38,029 --> 01:52:44,019
on social media was that I'll do it when

2740
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:49,970
it costs less than a pot in some dirt

2741
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:52,700
because I can I can grow the plant till

2742
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:55,520
it's a male for cheaper than I can get

2743
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:59,029
it tested you know they want $8 a test

2744
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:01,250
and I can grow a plant until it sexes

2745
01:52:59,029 --> 01:53:05,210
and see what it is

2746
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:07,010
for less than that so in that case I was

2747
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:09,560
like yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do

2748
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:11,869
it myself but it would be practical and

2749
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:14,420
it could be practical for certain

2750
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:16,609
projects like if you really don't want

2751
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:20,180
the males I think that it's practical

2752
01:53:16,609 --> 01:53:22,489
for people who have their areas maxed

2753
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:26,570
out and they want to only transplant

2754
01:53:22,489 --> 01:53:30,769
their females so that they don't have to

2755
01:53:26,569 --> 01:53:33,889
grow the males for me losing the plants

2756
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:35,329
before they show what they are is just

2757
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:38,479
foolish because I'm a breed

2758
01:53:35,328 --> 01:53:40,429
you know like if it's if it's a terrible

2759
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,679
plan I'm gonna kill it and if it's a

2760
01:53:40,429 --> 01:53:43,309
good plan I want to keep it and if it's

2761
01:53:42,679 --> 01:53:45,649
a male

2762
01:53:43,309 --> 01:53:47,510
even better you know like I don't want

2763
01:53:45,649 --> 01:53:49,309
my best plant to be if I you know

2764
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:51,829
whatever I can do whatever I can measure

2765
01:53:49,309 --> 01:53:53,838
just by looking at it and smelling it

2766
01:53:51,828 --> 01:53:56,148
and stuff in veg I'm hoping that's a

2767
01:53:53,838 --> 01:53:58,550
male you know cuz I'm like okay this is

2768
01:53:56,149 --> 01:54:00,139
the one in this breed that I know is

2769
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:02,179
killer like if I was growing a bunch of

2770
01:54:00,139 --> 01:54:04,309
deep chunk and I see the one that has

2771
01:54:02,179 --> 01:54:07,399
the smaller leaves that taco on the

2772
01:54:04,309 --> 01:54:09,168
edges a little harder and I'm and I'm

2773
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:11,809
looking at that and I'm associating that

2774
01:54:09,168 --> 01:54:14,569
with the best type of deep chunk then

2775
01:54:11,809 --> 01:54:16,760
I'm like fingers crossed I'm like I hope

2776
01:54:14,569 --> 01:54:19,819
this is a male you know because if this

2777
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:22,219
is a male I can tell which ones of the

2778
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:24,018
females have that but the males are a

2779
01:54:22,219 --> 01:54:26,239
lot harder to tell and if I can see

2780
01:54:24,019 --> 01:54:28,878
these things that I really know relate

2781
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:32,718
to the traits that pop up in the females

2782
01:54:28,878 --> 01:54:35,118
then I'm gonna be going ok cool I'm glad

2783
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:37,939
it's a male so for me it's not that

2784
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:41,628
practical but for people who are who are

2785
01:54:37,939 --> 01:54:43,369
growing to produce flowers exclusively I

2786
01:54:41,628 --> 01:54:45,439
think that you know I think it's

2787
01:54:43,368 --> 01:54:48,438
worthwhile I think it's something people

2788
01:54:45,439 --> 01:54:50,719
can do and you're gonna go from being in

2789
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:54,109
your little six-packs or your little

2790
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:55,639
four-inch pots and instead of going

2791
01:54:54,109 --> 01:54:58,189
instead of up potting into all these

2792
01:54:55,639 --> 01:54:59,569
bigger pots you're just gonna be able to

2793
01:54:58,189 --> 01:55:02,059
take your females and stick them right

2794
01:54:59,569 --> 01:55:03,948
into your final pots you know so number

2795
01:55:02,059 --> 01:55:07,849
one you can skip a transplanting stage

2796
01:55:03,948 --> 01:55:09,348
you can skip a nursery stage where

2797
01:55:07,849 --> 01:55:11,179
you're actually building them up to be

2798
01:55:09,349 --> 01:55:13,788
ready to go into their final homes and

2799
01:55:11,179 --> 01:55:17,088
you can go ahead and get them into their

2800
01:55:13,788 --> 01:55:18,978
final homes established right away which

2801
01:55:17,088 --> 01:55:22,248
is it can be a benefit to if you have

2802
01:55:18,979 --> 01:55:22,989
the right strains so yeah thanks for

2803
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:27,108
that call

2804
01:55:22,988 --> 01:55:29,238
yeah and so how about on the other end

2805
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:30,619
of the spectrum with the labs ha tops

2806
01:55:29,238 --> 01:55:31,788
are away for this truck to go past my

2807
01:55:30,618 --> 01:55:39,319
house I don't know if you can hear of it

2808
01:55:31,788 --> 01:55:40,878
it's really loud sweet so on the other

2809
01:55:39,319 --> 01:55:43,878
end of the spectrum with labs how do you

2810
01:55:40,878 --> 01:55:46,429
feel about the THC values and I guess

2811
01:55:43,878 --> 01:55:48,078
the newly emerging terpene values for

2812
01:55:46,429 --> 01:55:48,649
someone like you I guess terpene values

2813
01:55:48,078 --> 01:55:51,319
are quiet

2814
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:53,329
Orton given you know how well your

2815
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:55,538
strands do chart on them there's always

2816
01:55:53,328 --> 01:55:59,478
been you know the ongoing debate about

2817
01:55:55,538 --> 01:56:01,639
the the validity of the THC values given

2818
01:55:59,479 --> 01:56:03,739
and how they seem to be kind of creeping

2819
01:56:01,639 --> 01:56:05,689
up over time what's your take on all of

2820
01:56:03,738 --> 01:56:07,759
this you know and and how do you think

2821
01:56:05,689 --> 01:56:11,389
like the terpene values are gonna slowly

2822
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:16,248
over time become more highly valued than

2823
01:56:11,389 --> 01:56:18,828
the THC values well to to start off like

2824
01:56:16,248 --> 01:56:21,828
I can say that uh I know there's a lot

2825
01:56:18,828 --> 01:56:24,128
of people who are as far as inflated

2826
01:56:21,828 --> 01:56:27,849
numbers I know there's people who are

2827
01:56:24,128 --> 01:56:30,559
adding resin to their flower samples and

2828
01:56:27,849 --> 01:56:35,958
in that case it's really easy to jump

2829
01:56:30,559 --> 01:56:38,329
from 21 to 29 or 27 to 32 or you know

2830
01:56:35,958 --> 01:56:42,828
then I know also there's breeders who

2831
01:56:38,328 --> 01:56:45,349
are using testing to make sure that the

2832
01:56:42,828 --> 01:56:49,248
males they're using are the highest THC

2833
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:51,110
male and that is a new thing and the

2834
01:56:49,248 --> 01:56:52,760
feem testing the females as well as a

2835
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:57,558
new thing you didn't used to be able to

2836
01:56:52,760 --> 01:57:00,699
test so I think that that will make the

2837
01:56:57,559 --> 01:57:04,429
numbers jump up to you know I think that

2838
01:57:00,698 --> 01:57:07,609
for me I'm not looking for the highest

2839
01:57:04,429 --> 01:57:11,479
THC I'm looking for the strongest effect

2840
01:57:07,609 --> 01:57:13,908
so my joke is that I test on humans you

2841
01:57:11,479 --> 01:57:15,889
know you can test it in the lab all you

2842
01:57:13,908 --> 01:57:19,478
want but I've noticed over the years

2843
01:57:15,889 --> 01:57:23,090
that I smoke some stuff from reputable

2844
01:57:19,479 --> 01:57:26,449
guys that test at reputable labs and the

2845
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:29,149
THC might be really high and it might be

2846
01:57:26,448 --> 01:57:31,788
really high in certain terpenes but when

2847
01:57:29,149 --> 01:57:34,099
you know people smoke it they don't

2848
01:57:31,788 --> 01:57:35,359
really think it's that strong it doesn't

2849
01:57:34,099 --> 01:57:40,788
really hit you that hard

2850
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:43,339
so I think really like labs are neat but

2851
01:57:40,788 --> 01:57:45,768
I think basically they're a little bit

2852
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:47,479
more they're more valuable as far as for

2853
01:57:45,769 --> 01:57:50,958
finished product like telling what's

2854
01:57:47,479 --> 01:57:53,780
good if we already know it's good then

2855
01:57:50,958 --> 01:57:55,368
the lab is cool to tell us why so if we

2856
01:57:53,779 --> 01:57:59,478
go okay this is the most potent weed

2857
01:57:55,368 --> 01:58:02,130
I've ever smoked we want the lab to tell

2858
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:05,159
us why now we go and we see okay well

2859
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:07,079
turns out it's only 14 percent THC well

2860
01:58:05,158 --> 01:58:10,500
how can this be the most potent well

2861
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:13,139
here we got CBG and then it turns out we

2862
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,600
didn't know but there's THC V and then

2863
01:58:13,139 --> 01:58:17,909
it turns out that there's this certain

2864
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:20,219
ratio of this terpene to that terpene

2865
01:58:17,908 --> 01:58:22,319
and when they're all together you get

2866
01:58:20,219 --> 01:58:27,210
this effect that creates the most potent

2867
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:28,948
weed with the 14% THC content or you

2868
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:31,469
know however it is that's hypothetical

2869
01:58:28,948 --> 01:58:32,879
of course but um for me as far as

2870
01:58:31,469 --> 01:58:39,179
breeding to answer that part of the

2871
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:42,719
question you know I I you know I I'm I'm

2872
01:58:39,179 --> 01:58:45,000
too young to be a hippie and I'm too not

2873
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:47,939
hippy to be a hippie as well but I'm

2874
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,579
kind of a hippie man like I like to look

2875
01:58:47,939 --> 01:58:53,250
at the plants and kinda talk to the

2876
01:58:50,579 --> 01:58:58,019
plants and communicate with them and see

2877
01:58:53,250 --> 01:59:00,179
which one really you know when I smell

2878
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:02,190
it like there's these certain smells

2879
01:59:00,179 --> 01:59:05,279
that pop out I mean cherry limeade and

2880
01:59:02,189 --> 01:59:07,738
black lime or bred purely on stem reps

2881
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:10,198
and it's not really something that I can

2882
01:59:07,738 --> 01:59:12,869
show people what I'm looking for

2883
01:59:10,198 --> 01:59:15,238
it's this thing where I go mmm that's

2884
01:59:12,869 --> 01:59:17,460
that one I've seen that before and when

2885
01:59:15,238 --> 01:59:21,059
I saw that before that was incredible

2886
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:23,520
and so for me the labs are cool to tell

2887
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:24,989
me what that means okay when I see this

2888
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:28,469
what does that tell me

2889
01:59:24,988 --> 01:59:31,379
and then if I can see a correlation that

2890
01:59:28,469 --> 01:59:34,319
says every time I see this and then when

2891
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:37,079
I test it it turns out that it has this

2892
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:38,460
in common then maybe I can test and I

2893
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:41,219
can go for the ones that have more of

2894
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:43,829
that you know but at this point for me

2895
01:59:41,219 --> 01:59:53,029
it's really it's really more a question

2896
01:59:43,829 --> 01:59:56,340
of you know like what do I like and and

2897
01:59:53,029 --> 02:00:00,090
what kind of makes my brain jump when I

2898
01:59:56,340 --> 02:00:02,579
see it or I smell it or you know that

2899
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:05,550
kind of stuff and I really like it

2900
02:00:02,579 --> 02:00:07,710
because I know that all of the good

2901
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:09,360
things like I said earlier that we see

2902
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:13,829
in weed they've been there for a long

2903
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:16,210
time and all of the genetics that we

2904
02:00:13,829 --> 02:00:17,800
have are still here from people doing

2905
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:19,779
traditional breeding where they

2906
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:24,010
basically are doing just you know what

2907
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:26,500
I'm talking about and so you know I'm

2908
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:30,039
comfortable I'm comfortable honestly

2909
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:32,560
like with just picking plants and making

2910
02:00:30,039 --> 02:00:34,619
seeds and I feel like as long as I do

2911
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:38,680
open pollination 's

2912
02:00:34,619 --> 02:00:41,529
to preserve the genetics that I'll be

2913
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:43,719
all right you know and I've wired up now

2914
02:00:41,529 --> 02:00:47,229
because I know that I know the value of

2915
02:00:43,719 --> 02:00:49,029
stuff I used to think that everybody

2916
02:00:47,229 --> 02:00:51,939
would have the seeds that they gave me

2917
02:00:49,029 --> 02:00:53,649
because it was their stuff and now I

2918
02:00:51,939 --> 02:00:55,689
know better when someone gives you

2919
02:00:53,649 --> 02:01:00,219
something you might be the last person

2920
02:00:55,689 --> 02:01:03,519
that has it you know so you know I'm I'm

2921
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:05,980
into trying to do trying to do you know

2922
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:08,050
use labs to get to new places but at the

2923
02:01:05,979 --> 02:01:09,939
same time I've like I've really realized

2924
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:12,130
like in you got to keep it all you got

2925
02:01:09,939 --> 02:01:13,960
to keep it the old stuff intact and you

2926
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:15,489
got to you got to take the new stuff in

2927
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:18,130
new directions and for going in new

2928
02:01:15,488 --> 02:01:20,019
directions the labs are cool but for

2929
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:21,699
keeping the old stuff intact they're

2930
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:23,830
worthless the labs not gonna tell you

2931
02:01:21,699 --> 02:01:26,679
anything about your open pollination you

2932
02:01:23,829 --> 02:01:28,420
know they're just you got to keep it all

2933
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:31,270
no matter what and then when you're

2934
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:32,890
gonna selectively lime green then you

2935
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:34,870
know the lab telling you that this is

2936
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:35,680
the highest THC male that they've ever

2937
02:01:34,869 --> 02:01:38,050
seen Hey

2938
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:40,090
well you want the highest THC line out

2939
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:43,360
of that then that's that's gonna be

2940
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:47,829
worthwhile you know so yeah I think

2941
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:49,389
they're good too to tell you what you're

2942
02:01:47,829 --> 02:01:52,420
seeing you know why is this like this

2943
02:01:49,390 --> 02:01:54,940
they can explain that for you yeah

2944
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:56,829
without some awesome information there

2945
02:01:54,939 --> 02:01:58,899
just to loop back on one of the points

2946
02:01:56,829 --> 02:02:01,119
you made a bit earlier about using

2947
02:01:58,899 --> 02:02:03,039
humans to test sir this is a great point

2948
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:04,960
that I've always stood by the

2949
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:07,750
interesting kind of counter-argument to

2950
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:11,140
that point though is is it not the same

2951
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:14,350
people who over time have driven the

2952
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:15,880
prioritization of aesthetics which has

2953
02:02:14,350 --> 02:02:18,520
led to the loss of certain other

2954
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:20,710
qualities because I only kind of thought

2955
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:22,719
of this idea not long ago and I I

2956
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:24,279
realized it is like almost a bit of a

2957
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:26,140
dichotomy you know it's like the best

2958
02:02:24,279 --> 02:02:27,399
weed is the stuff that you've got to try

2959
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:30,300
for yourself and it's just overall

2960
02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:32,549
effect but at the same time we also know

2961
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:35,400
we push for the most aesthetic weed

2962
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:39,539
which we do at least now no is generally

2963
02:02:35,399 --> 02:02:42,750
not the best um yeah I mean you know

2964
02:02:39,539 --> 02:02:45,029
like a big fat bud a really really

2965
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:47,699
sugary look you know they don't

2966
02:02:45,029 --> 02:02:49,739
necessarily I mean like the black happy

2967
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:51,479
that I had sure had big fat buds and was

2968
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:53,399
purple and pretty but it looked like it

2969
02:02:51,479 --> 02:02:54,989
had no resin on it even when I crossed

2970
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:57,629
it with a Hindu Kush which is a really

2971
02:02:54,989 --> 02:03:01,380
white looking bud like incredibly white

2972
02:02:57,630 --> 02:03:02,970
weed when you grow at Indore once it was

2973
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:03,390
crossed you'd look at the weed and you'd

2974
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:05,159
go

2975
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:06,720
there's no resin on this and you'd break

2976
02:03:05,159 --> 02:03:08,970
it up and your hands wouldn't get sticky

2977
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:11,699
and you'd roll it up and you'd inhale it

2978
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:14,869
and you would go holy [ __ ] this is

2979
02:03:11,699 --> 02:03:17,760
potent I mean just on the it was the

2980
02:03:14,869 --> 02:03:19,319
expansion and the exhale and the flavor

2981
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:24,810
and then the effect that just

2982
02:03:19,319 --> 02:03:26,670
immediately got you it wasn't you know

2983
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:29,280
to look at it you would think this is

2984
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:31,529
this is the stuff sucks and based on

2985
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,329
looking based on that I would say that

2986
02:03:31,529 --> 02:03:35,219
probably in tests it probably couldn't

2987
02:03:33,329 --> 02:03:37,529
have that much th Sikhs it didn't have

2988
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:39,930
that big of a percentage of resin but

2989
02:03:37,529 --> 02:03:41,729
the flower was incredible you know and a

2990
02:03:39,930 --> 02:03:43,590
lot of the a lot of the stuff that's all

2991
02:03:41,729 --> 02:03:44,609
those really cool sativas that people

2992
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:47,220
loved so much

2993
02:03:44,609 --> 02:03:50,670
it looked it looks bad it's not good

2994
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:53,670
looking stuff but I'll tell you what if

2995
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:55,739
you start to think okay this is my

2996
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:57,119
favorite kind of weed is the sativa all

2997
02:03:55,739 --> 02:03:58,739
of a sudden that look is gonna become

2998
02:03:57,119 --> 02:04:00,750
attractive to you because you're like

2999
02:03:58,739 --> 02:04:05,599
woohoo that looks like that one that's

3000
02:04:00,750 --> 02:04:08,039
the stuff I like you know I think that I

3001
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:09,770
mean it's been documented and a lot of

3002
02:04:08,039 --> 02:04:12,210
people have spoke on it before that

3003
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:17,310
everyone bred things to be fast

3004
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:20,159
sugary fat those you know as a smoker

3005
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:21,720
fast sugary and fat it that doesn't

3006
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:24,029
really do anything for you man

3007
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:26,640
it's gotta have for me I've always bred

3008
02:04:24,029 --> 02:04:28,409
it sure I like weed to be you know all

3009
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:30,329
of those things but then I want to have

3010
02:04:28,409 --> 02:04:33,000
the really nice smell that really nice

3011
02:04:30,329 --> 02:04:37,470
taste I want to have a good effect and

3012
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:39,569
I'm not I'm not locked into a one effect

3013
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:41,350
type of thing you know like I'm not

3014
02:04:39,569 --> 02:04:44,710
worried if it's

3015
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:48,010
Gracie sativa or a heavy indica or ultra

3016
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:49,960
potent strain or a very mild strain for

3017
02:04:48,010 --> 02:04:51,340
me I'm like whatever special about that

3018
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:56,289
strain that's what I want to maintain

3019
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:59,680
about it so you know like I really like

3020
02:04:56,289 --> 02:05:02,289
I like to laugh you know what I mean I

3021
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:05,820
love like comedy I love funny movies I

3022
02:05:02,289 --> 02:05:09,909
love funny people I love funny stories

3023
02:05:05,819 --> 02:05:11,769
so if we don't make you giggle I'm like

3024
02:05:09,909 --> 02:05:13,210
oh what's that one I gotta try to lock

3025
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:16,810
that in you know I got to make sure I

3026
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:18,279
keep that around and um and so like

3027
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:22,300
though there's those little things that

3028
02:05:18,279 --> 02:05:26,199
really those don't show up at on a

3029
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:28,210
picture on Instagram you know so I think

3030
02:05:26,199 --> 02:05:30,609
that's why right now kind of the king of

3031
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:32,289
everything is like if you look on

3032
02:05:30,609 --> 02:05:33,939
Instagram and you see a pretty picture

3033
02:05:32,289 --> 02:05:35,289
and you go oh that's a nice strain and

3034
02:05:33,939 --> 02:05:36,849
you click on it you're like yeah it's

3035
02:05:35,289 --> 02:05:40,529
probably something probably cookie fam

3036
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:44,079
you know it's gelato it's sherbert it's

3037
02:05:40,529 --> 02:05:47,559
cookies or if not then it's probably OG

3038
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:50,079
or you know cam or something from that

3039
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:52,390
from the family of all those fuels and

3040
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:54,609
everything like that and and those are

3041
02:05:52,390 --> 02:05:57,190
all great strains but I think the reason

3042
02:05:54,609 --> 02:05:58,989
why they took over is because they look

3043
02:05:57,189 --> 02:06:01,089
so pretty and then when you get some and

3044
02:05:58,989 --> 02:06:04,000
you try it you go oh okay and it's good

3045
02:06:01,090 --> 02:06:06,340
but a lot of the stuff over the years it

3046
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,680
did just kinda go down the tubes it

3047
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:12,550
looks great and then it's just not you

3048
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:14,950
know it's not all that good I know there

3049
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:17,529
was a deal where for awhile people loved

3050
02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:20,260
the the nested calyxes that's the look

3051
02:06:17,529 --> 02:06:23,170
where you have like you have like the

3052
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:25,090
you have the pod inside the pod inside

3053
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:27,760
the pod inside the pod and what happens

3054
02:06:25,090 --> 02:06:29,739
is there's no room really for the resin

3055
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:31,539
to develop so you wind up with stuff

3056
02:06:29,739 --> 02:06:33,219
where when you break it up there's

3057
02:06:31,539 --> 02:06:35,529
really not that much resin the resin is

3058
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:41,050
only on the outside of the bud or in

3059
02:06:35,529 --> 02:06:45,729
between you know hairs yeah people think

3060
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:47,860
you know the the the stigma the hair is

3061
02:06:45,729 --> 02:06:50,139
is attractive so they breed for their we

3062
02:06:47,859 --> 02:06:54,009
need to be very hairy Harry's burn hairs

3063
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:54,989
burn hot they don't produce they don't

3064
02:06:54,010 --> 02:06:56,670
produce res

3065
02:06:54,988 --> 02:06:58,259
and I mean I've seen somewhere seemingly

3066
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:00,420
they do produce resin but they certainly

3067
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:05,010
don't produce resin like the rest of the

3068
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:07,739
like the flower so yeah I mean I I think

3069
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:12,570
it's definitely you know aesthetics and

3070
02:07:07,738 --> 02:07:16,879
and ease of of growing have have taken

3071
02:07:12,569 --> 02:07:18,299
stuff down down a notch for sure yeah

3072
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:20,880
yeah

3073
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:23,699
so not trying to have a jab at you or

3074
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:25,559
anything but recently in the aficionado

3075
02:07:23,698 --> 02:07:27,899
catalog we've seen the introduction of

3076
02:07:25,559 --> 02:07:29,429
some crosses with zeros and sunsets sure

3077
02:07:27,899 --> 02:07:30,808
but you know I think a lot of people

3078
02:07:29,429 --> 02:07:34,288
wouldn't have predicted these ones

3079
02:07:30,809 --> 02:07:35,699
coming out in your opinion you know what

3080
02:07:34,288 --> 02:07:37,889
was the reason behind doing this do you

3081
02:07:35,698 --> 02:07:38,998
like those cuts like do you the zoodles

3082
02:07:37,889 --> 02:07:41,760
is an interesting one because a lot of

3083
02:07:38,998 --> 02:07:43,349
people reference how like it in itself

3084
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:45,510
is not a great strain but there's so

3085
02:07:43,349 --> 02:07:47,099
much potential to make something with it

3086
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:50,639
you know a you of that school of thought

3087
02:07:47,099 --> 02:07:54,769
as well I think that the the skittles

3088
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:58,618
has a lot of um it has a lot of neat

3089
02:07:54,769 --> 02:08:03,019
stuff to it I personally it's not

3090
02:07:58,618 --> 02:08:08,549
something all grow it's difficult to

3091
02:08:03,019 --> 02:08:13,349
really have do nice you know to come out

3092
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:15,059
nicely I saw recently archived just days

3093
02:08:13,349 --> 02:08:18,389
doing some stuff with the dote with a

3094
02:08:15,059 --> 02:08:22,230
dose IDO I think it looks really nice

3095
02:08:18,389 --> 02:08:25,920
it's got a lot a lot of resin dying

3096
02:08:22,229 --> 02:08:30,779
breed those guys are the guys who named

3097
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:33,868
it skittles and you know they they've

3098
02:08:30,779 --> 02:08:37,738
done cool stuff I like the I like the OC

3099
02:08:33,868 --> 02:08:41,219
cush that Eddie lap basically OG seed

3100
02:08:37,738 --> 02:08:42,899
crossed with the with the skittles I

3101
02:08:41,219 --> 02:08:45,029
like that better than the skills myself

3102
02:08:42,899 --> 02:08:47,308
it reminds me a lot of what I call sky

3103
02:08:45,029 --> 02:08:49,738
Cutler cush that I have that's a cross

3104
02:08:47,309 --> 02:08:51,570
that has some of the old stuff for mine

3105
02:08:49,738 --> 02:08:56,549
then mixed in with some like Skywalker

3106
02:08:51,569 --> 02:08:59,340
and PK and stuff you know honestly for

3107
02:08:56,550 --> 02:09:02,470
aficionado people because people know me

3108
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:06,340
from from from

3109
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:09,340
uh you know being at the booth putting

3110
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:11,140
stuff out with aficionado the only stuff

3111
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:16,000
that I ever really did with aficionado

3112
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:18,010
was I gave Leo some pollen and told him

3113
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,189
that it would be great on the in the

3114
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:23,289
Pines clone that got released as in The

3115
02:09:21,189 --> 02:09:24,639
Pines I told him I had the black lime

3116
02:09:23,289 --> 02:09:26,409
and it would work really good with the

3117
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:29,410
cam he gave me that pollen that was

3118
02:09:26,409 --> 02:09:31,510
black lime reserve I released some f3s

3119
02:09:29,409 --> 02:09:36,510
of what I call red Hindukush which is

3120
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:40,680
big red cross Hindu cross pure Kush and

3121
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:43,170
what I gave him some some of my Skye

3122
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:48,310
Skywalker cross Skye djaro

3123
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:50,739
to put on to put on some stuff and he

3124
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:54,370
did that with a Louie og and we called

3125
02:09:50,739 --> 02:09:56,349
that Versailles and other than that man

3126
02:09:54,369 --> 02:09:58,390
no no none of that stuff is my work I

3127
02:09:56,350 --> 02:10:01,630
mean all the royal stuff is all coming

3128
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:04,840
from Mendel brought given that to Leo to

3129
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:10,270
work with anything that you see with

3130
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:14,409
cookies cherry sherbert skittles I you

3131
02:10:10,270 --> 02:10:15,730
know I you know I didn't I didn't make

3132
02:10:14,409 --> 02:10:19,869
any of that stuff so I can't really

3133
02:10:15,729 --> 02:10:21,419
speak on it okay and so another kind of

3134
02:10:19,869 --> 02:10:24,699
interesting topic I've seen is that

3135
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:27,399
we've seen both an increase in price of

3136
02:10:24,699 --> 02:10:29,979
seeds and an increase in quality or

3137
02:10:27,399 --> 02:10:32,289
maybe consistency in recent years

3138
02:10:29,979 --> 02:10:34,389
however we've also seen an increase in

3139
02:10:32,289 --> 02:10:36,550
price for some seeds that don't equally

3140
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:37,900
have an increase in quality do you think

3141
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:40,180
this is going to continue do you think

3142
02:10:37,899 --> 02:10:42,189
that like you know I think that there

3143
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:44,110
will always be a market for high-priced

3144
02:10:42,189 --> 02:10:46,089
seeds that are incredibly good quality

3145
02:10:44,109 --> 02:10:48,489
and we've got some of that right now but

3146
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:50,440
I also think that yeah like we might get

3147
02:10:48,489 --> 02:10:52,210
more and more people selling bunk seeds

3148
02:10:50,439 --> 02:10:53,979
for just more do you think that's gonna

3149
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:56,230
continue or do you even agree with the

3150
02:10:53,979 --> 02:11:01,839
idea that the price of seeds has kind of

3151
02:10:56,229 --> 02:11:05,139
increased over time you know I mean I

3152
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:07,480
think the most expensive stuff that I

3153
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:10,660
really saw was like some of that I guess

3154
02:11:07,479 --> 02:11:12,969
like alien stuff I heard people were

3155
02:11:10,659 --> 02:11:15,609
doing those for like you know a thousand

3156
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:15,970
and 1500 and of course people do like

3157
02:11:15,609 --> 02:11:18,369
chair

3158
02:11:15,970 --> 02:11:20,500
any auctions and stuff and and stuff

3159
02:11:18,369 --> 02:11:22,840
brings in like ridiculously high prices

3160
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:25,930
but people people spend different for

3161
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:27,909
that kind of stuff because you know it's

3162
02:11:25,930 --> 02:11:29,409
just a different thing and it's like

3163
02:11:27,909 --> 02:11:32,139
buying a thousand dollar plate of food

3164
02:11:29,409 --> 02:11:35,819
or something you know but um as far as

3165
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:38,710
like stuff being high-priced I mean like

3166
02:11:35,819 --> 02:11:41,289
black lime reserve the donation on that

3167
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:44,260
was two hundred and fifty and a lot of

3168
02:11:41,289 --> 02:11:46,600
people said that's ridiculous that's way

3169
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:50,680
too much anything over a hundred bucks

3170
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:52,450
for ten seeds is crazy and then you know

3171
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:54,550
they were gone and then everybody was

3172
02:11:52,449 --> 02:11:56,199
like oh where are they and it's like

3173
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:58,090
well there's only 300 packs that's why

3174
02:11:56,199 --> 02:12:00,639
you know that they they have it there's

3175
02:11:58,090 --> 02:12:02,470
an added value when you when you have

3176
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:04,480
leverage basically for your product

3177
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:06,640
because it's super limited you know and

3178
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:08,679
I don't mean for myself but for the

3179
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:10,930
people who actually got those seeds you

3180
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:12,520
know black lime reserve is a little bit

3181
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:14,320
more sought-after than something that

3182
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:16,450
comes out of a pack of seeds that you

3183
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:17,739
could buy from a huge company and

3184
02:12:16,449 --> 02:12:21,849
there's millions of packs you know

3185
02:12:17,739 --> 02:12:26,439
because you know it's harder to get but

3186
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:29,789
um I think you know there's there's been

3187
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:32,109
stuff over the years that's that's um

3188
02:12:29,789 --> 02:12:35,500
ridiculously expensive and there's stuff

3189
02:12:32,109 --> 02:12:38,849
that's not ridiculous of course and I

3190
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:41,170
you know sometimes I kind of wonder like

3191
02:12:38,850 --> 02:12:42,760
you know I see breeders that make

3192
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:45,850
certain stuff and I'm like wow those are

3193
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:47,770
so that's that's such a small amount to

3194
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:49,870
get for the seeds and it's not because

3195
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:51,460
the seeds it's not the value of a seed a

3196
02:12:49,869 --> 02:12:51,789
seed is worth nothing you know what I

3197
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:53,739
mean

3198
02:12:51,789 --> 02:12:55,779
it's the genetics that are inside the

3199
02:12:53,739 --> 02:12:57,340
seed what is this seed otherwise it's

3200
02:12:55,779 --> 02:13:00,819
you know a hemp seeds a hemp seed you

3201
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:03,060
know buy it by the pound but for me if

3202
02:13:00,819 --> 02:13:06,309
there's something that is really special

3203
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:11,050
I'm willing you know I've I've given

3204
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:13,210
people I've given people $200 $300 for

3205
02:13:11,050 --> 02:13:15,820
ten seeds because you know it was

3206
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:17,710
something that I wanted and I know the

3207
02:13:15,819 --> 02:13:19,989
value because I can take a pack of seeds

3208
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:23,260
and I can get a whole ton form I mean

3209
02:13:19,989 --> 02:13:24,939
not for them but out of them you know

3210
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:28,980
what I mean like you can go okay well

3211
02:13:24,939 --> 02:13:28,979
like right now I have bodis

3212
02:13:29,139 --> 02:13:33,920
super snow Lotus it's Super Skunk cross

3213
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:35,059
snow Lotus and I'm like well I just want

3214
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,828
to butt them out and see what they are

3215
02:13:35,059 --> 02:13:38,510
but I go I'm gonna keep that one male

3216
02:13:36,828 --> 02:13:40,279
and I'm gonna go ahead and make sure

3217
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:42,380
that out of my one pack of seeds I have

3218
02:13:40,279 --> 02:13:44,899
like a few hundred more seeds out of

3219
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:48,679
them so it's like four one pack of seeds

3220
02:13:44,899 --> 02:13:50,000
you can get hundreds of seeds and and of

3221
02:13:48,679 --> 02:13:51,770
course you could get thousands or

3222
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,439
millions if you were to clone them up

3223
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:59,360
and stuff but um you know I think seed

3224
02:13:54,439 --> 02:14:01,698
values a trip like if it's really

3225
02:13:59,359 --> 02:14:03,649
special enough I think stuff is worth it

3226
02:14:01,698 --> 02:14:05,299
like if somebody told me oh dude I got

3227
02:14:03,649 --> 02:14:07,189
chemist stuff that's the stuff you were

3228
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:08,900
talking about dude I'd be like well what

3229
02:14:07,189 --> 02:14:11,149
do you want for them you know I mean

3230
02:14:08,899 --> 02:14:13,399
like if I gotta trade somebody that I

3231
02:14:11,149 --> 02:14:15,019
gotta trade somebody like three pounds

3232
02:14:13,399 --> 02:14:17,839
of cherry limeade and they got the real

3233
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:19,790
thing I'm gonna be like dude dude here

3234
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:21,739
we go right now give me those give me

3235
02:14:19,789 --> 02:14:23,328
fifteen seeds I gave me three pounds of

3236
02:14:21,738 --> 02:14:26,029
weed because it's something that I

3237
02:14:23,328 --> 02:14:28,009
really want so you know value is weird

3238
02:14:26,029 --> 02:14:30,349
man like you know what's a dog worth

3239
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:32,659
what's a horse work worse well you know

3240
02:14:30,349 --> 02:14:36,349
some horses are worth dog food and some

3241
02:14:32,658 --> 02:14:38,539
horses are worth you know eight hundred

3242
02:14:36,349 --> 02:14:40,340
thousand dollars or some horses are

3243
02:14:38,539 --> 02:14:43,368
worth five million dollars it just

3244
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:45,050
depends on how it breeds what it brings

3245
02:14:43,368 --> 02:14:47,719
to the table and all that kind of stuff

3246
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:49,730
and so I think we're gonna start seeing

3247
02:14:47,719 --> 02:14:52,578
a lot more seeds that are a lot cheaper

3248
02:14:49,729 --> 02:14:54,348
because seeds are really easy to produce

3249
02:14:52,578 --> 02:14:57,948
and if people are willing to part with

3250
02:14:54,349 --> 02:14:59,989
their genetics for cheap then you can

3251
02:14:57,948 --> 02:15:01,789
produce seeds for very cheap it's the

3252
02:14:59,988 --> 02:15:03,289
same process pretty much as producing

3253
02:15:01,789 --> 02:15:08,179
hemp seeds and you can buy those suckers

3254
02:15:03,289 --> 02:15:10,698
for cheap right so uh I think also that

3255
02:15:08,179 --> 02:15:13,399
there will start to be seeds that are

3256
02:15:10,698 --> 02:15:16,488
more and more premium as well to where

3257
02:15:13,399 --> 02:15:18,319
people go yeah these are you know this

3258
02:15:16,488 --> 02:15:21,799
ridiculous amount for this pack of seeds

3259
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:23,808
you know and I did black lime reserve I

3260
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:26,150
told everybody hey if you don't find

3261
02:15:23,809 --> 02:15:28,340
what I you know I showed everybody what

3262
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:30,769
the weed looks like got off of good

3263
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:32,809
plants I said if you don't get this like

3264
02:15:30,770 --> 02:15:35,329
this in your pack come back to me I'll

3265
02:15:32,809 --> 02:15:37,219
give you two more packs so people look

3266
02:15:35,328 --> 02:15:38,868
at it and they go oh well that's so out

3267
02:15:37,219 --> 02:15:41,539
of control and I'm like yeah but there's

3268
02:15:38,868 --> 02:15:44,000
not any there's not anybody else who's

3269
02:15:41,539 --> 02:15:45,619
you right up front if you don't get what

3270
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,420
you want I'm not saying if they don't

3271
02:15:45,619 --> 02:15:49,519
germinate I'm not saying if you get

3272
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:51,949
something that's intersex or if you get

3273
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:54,350
these issues I'm saying that if it just

3274
02:15:51,949 --> 02:15:56,569
you don't like it like a restaurant like

3275
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:58,730
you says you send out the steak and you

3276
02:15:56,569 --> 02:16:00,649
asked it for it to be rare and it comes

3277
02:15:58,729 --> 02:16:02,750
out and it's rare and you didn't realize

3278
02:16:00,649 --> 02:16:05,179
you don't like rare steak I'm giving you

3279
02:16:02,750 --> 02:16:06,800
another steak you know like even if it's

3280
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:09,560
their fault basically I was still

3281
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:11,539
guarantee in those seeds and I didn't

3282
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:13,310
really get anybody who ever took me up

3283
02:16:11,539 --> 02:16:16,579
on that and I didn't get any complaints

3284
02:16:13,310 --> 02:16:19,850
or anything but I think that um that if

3285
02:16:16,579 --> 02:16:22,309
people are willing to you know like I

3286
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:25,250
when I put those out people would

3287
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:26,810
contact me and they'd say hey is it all

3288
02:16:25,250 --> 02:16:30,199
right if I make seeds and I'd be like

3289
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:31,850
there's only the only rule is that you

3290
02:16:30,199 --> 02:16:34,218
make some good ones you know make some

3291
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:35,659
nice stuff and then they'd say well what

3292
02:16:34,218 --> 02:16:37,549
do I look for and I'd say well what do

3293
02:16:35,659 --> 02:16:40,579
you want from the seats and as a breeder

3294
02:16:37,549 --> 02:16:42,439
I would tell him here is what here

3295
02:16:40,579 --> 02:16:43,849
here's here's some of the markers for

3296
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:45,559
these traits and here's some of the

3297
02:16:43,849 --> 02:16:47,679
markers for those traits so that hey you

3298
02:16:45,558 --> 02:16:50,329
want the one that's really really limey

3299
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:51,590
let me send me pictures of your plants

3300
02:16:50,329 --> 02:16:53,840
and I'll tell you which one is most

3301
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:57,380
likely to be that throwback to that old

3302
02:16:53,840 --> 02:17:00,349
lime line that is you know the genetics

3303
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:02,058
are basically you know lock together

3304
02:17:00,349 --> 02:17:03,799
where you get this leaf type you're

3305
02:17:02,058 --> 02:17:06,019
probably gonna get the lime smell you

3306
02:17:03,799 --> 02:17:09,019
know you get the smell there it is you

3307
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:10,909
know and so I feel like if people want

3308
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:13,069
to really put out seeds for really high

3309
02:17:10,909 --> 02:17:14,899
prices and they're willing to give you a

3310
02:17:13,069 --> 02:17:16,670
service that goes beyond just this

3311
02:17:14,899 --> 02:17:17,840
little thing of seeds I feel like

3312
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:20,599
they're valuable and they're worth

3313
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:23,299
something extra and then if somebody's

3314
02:17:20,599 --> 02:17:24,950
gonna say hey here's some seeds I don't

3315
02:17:23,299 --> 02:17:26,869
ever want to hear nothing about it these

3316
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:29,599
cost 20 bucks a pack cool that's cool

3317
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:31,309
too you know but it just all it all

3318
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:33,229
depends on how people want to do their

3319
02:17:31,308 --> 02:17:37,939
thing and I think it really comes down

3320
02:17:33,229 --> 02:17:41,479
to just being ethical and saying this is

3321
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:43,340
what this really is if you find out it's

3322
02:17:41,479 --> 02:17:46,039
not what it is put it on your website

3323
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:48,349
put it on your you know do whatever like

3324
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:50,179
I have my my root beer I thought for

3325
02:17:48,349 --> 02:17:51,979
years it was seven oh seven headband it

3326
02:17:50,179 --> 02:17:54,638
turns out no it's the headband they call

3327
02:17:51,979 --> 02:17:56,948
la cush it's the mother of the 707

3328
02:17:54,638 --> 02:17:59,500
band suits in the ballpark but I'm like

3329
02:17:56,949 --> 02:18:01,149
sorry guys it's not 7:07 headband and

3330
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:04,058
this is strains not even released but

3331
02:18:01,148 --> 02:18:05,590
I've been putting out info about it and

3332
02:18:04,058 --> 02:18:08,318
I you know I feel like you're supposed

3333
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:10,420
to have the right info so when you do go

3334
02:18:08,318 --> 02:18:11,829
to breed like people like don't breed

3335
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:13,449
with my stuff I'm like dude you ain't

3336
02:18:11,829 --> 02:18:15,099
gonna live forever you know like

3337
02:18:13,449 --> 02:18:17,739
everybody it shouldn't have to wait for

3338
02:18:15,099 --> 02:18:21,099
you to die to go okay well now I can do

3339
02:18:17,738 --> 02:18:25,929
these seeds like you know it's just it's

3340
02:18:21,099 --> 02:18:28,898
just a question of I think um um you

3341
02:18:25,929 --> 02:18:31,000
know quality and like you know

3342
02:18:28,898 --> 02:18:32,528
commitment to what whatever the thing is

3343
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,138
and so that's your difference between

3344
02:18:32,529 --> 02:18:37,809
your $20 seeds and your and your

3345
02:18:35,138 --> 02:18:40,028
whatever $20,000 seats who knows how

3346
02:18:37,808 --> 02:18:43,119
high prices are gonna get the future

3347
02:18:40,029 --> 02:18:44,529
when stuff is you know whatever is more

3348
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:46,719
sought-after because now there's a

3349
02:18:44,529 --> 02:18:49,469
bigger community of people which causes

3350
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:52,358
more demand you know so we'll see

3351
02:18:49,468 --> 02:18:54,968
yes I almost raises another interesting

3352
02:18:52,359 --> 02:18:58,689
point at which point do you think

3353
02:18:54,968 --> 02:19:00,308
someone can call some work I went say

3354
02:18:58,689 --> 02:19:02,139
across because maybe you've just

3355
02:19:00,308 --> 02:19:04,090
actually lined reddit but at what point

3356
02:19:02,138 --> 02:19:06,579
can you call work your own you know if

3357
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:08,710
you took Mandelbrot's royal and took it

3358
02:19:06,579 --> 02:19:10,269
to the f20 do you think you'd be fair to

3359
02:19:08,709 --> 02:19:12,188
say it's kind of your own at that point

3360
02:19:10,269 --> 02:19:15,519
and likewise you know if you make an f1

3361
02:19:12,189 --> 02:19:17,290
is do you feel like you can really kind

3362
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:19,599
of say it's yours in the sense of like

3363
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:21,040
it's you know what I mean like it's not

3364
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:23,949
just kind of borrowing off other

3365
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:27,040
people's stuff too heavily I think that

3366
02:19:23,949 --> 02:19:30,929
I think that where the line is drawn I

3367
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:33,729
think that when you make a hybrid and

3368
02:19:30,929 --> 02:19:36,308
it's just a fresh hybrid of other

3369
02:19:33,728 --> 02:19:38,170
people's work I think that it's just a

3370
02:19:36,308 --> 02:19:39,759
hybrid of other people's work and you

3371
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:44,129
did a selection and that's cool and

3372
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:46,478
that's like the beginning of a process I

3373
02:19:44,129 --> 02:19:49,420
think that as soon as you take it in a

3374
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:51,340
new direction where what you get doesn't

3375
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:51,549
come out of the things that you started

3376
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:54,370
with

3377
02:19:51,549 --> 02:19:56,469
then it's deserving of a new name

3378
02:19:54,370 --> 02:19:59,949
because otherwise it's almost a

3379
02:19:56,469 --> 02:20:02,469
misrepresentation of the old genetics so

3380
02:19:59,949 --> 02:20:04,960
like in this case if I take you know

3381
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:08,199
like I have cherry limeade right and I

3382
02:20:04,959 --> 02:20:11,589
go okay here's a black lime across

3383
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:13,931
a pie and I make those seeds well it's

3384
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:16,601
black lime cross cherry pie but when I

3385
02:20:13,931 --> 02:20:18,521
take a selection out of the F ones and I

3386
02:20:16,601 --> 02:20:22,239
breed it in a new direction and now it's

3387
02:20:18,521 --> 02:20:25,601
got some of the terpenes of the cherry

3388
02:20:22,239 --> 02:20:28,420
pie but it's got the it's got the

3389
02:20:25,601 --> 02:20:32,440
strength and the stone enos and the

3390
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:35,560
increased size of the black lime and you

3391
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:38,489
know I keep taking it in further and

3392
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:41,351
further and further to the point where

3393
02:20:38,489 --> 02:20:43,569
you can't get those plants from what you

3394
02:20:41,351 --> 02:20:46,870
started with then you know that's a new

3395
02:20:43,569 --> 02:20:48,789
thing and I don't think you ever get so

3396
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:53,351
far into something where you don't need

3397
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:56,170
to give people credit or you don't need

3398
02:20:53,351 --> 02:20:58,989
to give a background of it I feel like

3399
02:20:56,170 --> 02:21:02,590
that stuff is more of like academic

3400
02:20:58,989 --> 02:21:05,079
thing like it's more of a like thing for

3401
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:06,940
science where you say hey here's what

3402
02:21:05,079 --> 02:21:09,069
this is because when people know what

3403
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:11,620
this is if we ever need to recreate it

3404
02:21:09,069 --> 02:21:13,840
we can recreate it like what if you know

3405
02:21:11,620 --> 02:21:16,660
say like cherry limeade I lost it all

3406
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:18,640
but somebody has one clone and it turns

3407
02:21:16,659 --> 02:21:21,851
out that it's the cure for some crazy

3408
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:24,039
disease and then I lose then they lose

3409
02:21:21,851 --> 02:21:26,141
the clone and they're like well what was

3410
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:29,590
it and I'm like well I don't know what

3411
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:31,329
it was no it's like well then now nobody

3412
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:34,120
knows what it was so they don't know

3413
02:21:31,329 --> 02:21:36,431
where to look for it so if it became

3414
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:39,250
really useful and valuable at a certain

3415
02:21:36,431 --> 02:21:41,590
point from a scientific perspective it's

3416
02:21:39,250 --> 02:21:43,840
like he just screwed things up there now

3417
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:45,909
it's not really what it's supposed to be

3418
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:50,319
nobody can backtrack nobody can figure

3419
02:21:45,909 --> 02:21:51,879
out what it is and you know so I think

3420
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:55,209
like that's like why it's really

3421
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:58,869
important in ways to have your have your

3422
02:21:55,209 --> 02:22:01,239
you know your lineage is there and and

3423
02:21:58,870 --> 02:22:03,820
give credit to people because they did

3424
02:22:01,239 --> 02:22:05,739
do some work and then you know for your

3425
02:22:03,819 --> 02:22:07,390
work then you do then you deserve some

3426
02:22:05,739 --> 02:22:09,399
credit - everyone deserves what they

3427
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:11,739
deserve but they don't just deserve

3428
02:22:09,399 --> 02:22:13,719
everything you know like just because

3429
02:22:11,739 --> 02:22:15,129
somebody has a plant doesn't mean now

3430
02:22:13,719 --> 02:22:17,079
they deserve all the credit for that

3431
02:22:15,129 --> 02:22:19,719
plant like there's other people who

3432
02:22:17,079 --> 02:22:21,289
should get some credit too like if I

3433
02:22:19,719 --> 02:22:23,750
knew the people who

3434
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:24,980
gave the seeds two dudes who brought him

3435
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:27,200
here to California that were in

3436
02:22:24,979 --> 02:22:29,359
Afghanistan I'd be like yeah its dude

3437
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,711
over there in Afghanistan so and so he's

3438
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:33,620
he was the guy who had him in

3439
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:36,800
Afghanistan and but I don't I only know

3440
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:38,931
him back to a certain place and and so

3441
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:41,960
I'll tell you you know black line comes

3442
02:22:38,931 --> 02:22:45,370
back from Heath and Ian and goes back to

3443
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:49,039
John and it goes back to this Burmese

3444
02:22:45,370 --> 02:22:51,440
and it goes back to Afghani and hawken

3445
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,480
and Northern Lights and you know that's

3446
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:55,399
that's all I know about it that's as far

3447
02:22:53,479 --> 02:22:58,279
back as it goes and I don't lose

3448
02:22:55,399 --> 02:23:00,949
anything by saying that that it all come

3449
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:04,190
that stuff comes from from places like

3450
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:06,320
that and it's like yeah that the reason

3451
02:23:04,190 --> 02:23:10,431
why black lime is black lime is because

3452
02:23:06,319 --> 02:23:13,159
I chose a sport plant out of you know as

3453
02:23:10,431 --> 02:23:14,899
an oddball in in a population and then I

3454
02:23:13,159 --> 02:23:16,460
crossed it was something that was in a

3455
02:23:14,899 --> 02:23:19,341
completely different side of the

3456
02:23:16,460 --> 02:23:21,829
spectrum and then I got it to be where

3457
02:23:19,341 --> 02:23:24,500
it took something from both places for

3458
02:23:21,829 --> 02:23:25,851
the flavor and for the plant and I made

3459
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:28,370
it into something and it's something

3460
02:23:25,851 --> 02:23:30,230
that's it's totally different like you

3461
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:31,820
can't show it to either the people who

3462
02:23:30,229 --> 02:23:34,069
it originally came from and they go oh

3463
02:23:31,819 --> 02:23:35,539
that's my stuff they're like ooh this is

3464
02:23:34,069 --> 02:23:38,479
nice this is something new I've never

3465
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:40,790
seen this and so at that point I feel

3466
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:45,560
like now that's a new thing and sure you

3467
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:48,200
deserve credit for what that is but you

3468
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:51,190
know ethics is ethics is weird man you

3469
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:53,931
know ethics is a weird subject because

3470
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:57,140
it all comes down to belief and belief

3471
02:23:53,931 --> 02:23:59,091
isn't um you know belief and right or

3472
02:23:57,140 --> 02:24:01,250
wrong or good or bad it's not like a

3473
02:23:59,091 --> 02:24:03,649
concrete thing you know some people are

3474
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:05,630
some people are spiritual and they're

3475
02:24:03,649 --> 02:24:07,431
cannibals you know or some people are

3476
02:24:05,630 --> 02:24:09,500
you know it's like whatever just

3477
02:24:07,431 --> 02:24:11,211
everybody basically what I what I think

3478
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:12,950
comes down to with like ethics with

3479
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:16,250
what's yours and what's not yours and

3480
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:18,801
all that is basically like if you have

3481
02:24:16,250 --> 02:24:22,610
rules or you have things that you hold

3482
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:24,439
other people to you know you make the

3483
02:24:22,610 --> 02:24:26,601
rules so follow the damn rules they're

3484
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:28,730
your rules you know don't be mad about

3485
02:24:26,601 --> 02:24:30,681
somebody doing something that you do all

3486
02:24:28,729 --> 02:24:33,550
the time like that just isn't that

3487
02:24:30,681 --> 02:24:36,140
doesn't make any sense you know

3488
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:38,630
you know I think it just it just all a

3489
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:41,329
matter of you know do real work make

3490
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:43,430
real stuff happen and then you get the

3491
02:24:41,329 --> 02:24:46,011
credit for what you did you know I don't

3492
02:24:43,431 --> 02:24:47,511
need the credit from from Ian I'll need

3493
02:24:46,011 --> 02:24:49,909
the credit from Heath I get the credit

3494
02:24:47,511 --> 02:24:51,290
for doing what I did and they get their

3495
02:24:49,909 --> 02:24:56,479
credit for doing what they did you know

3496
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:59,061
so yeah for sure so I mean on the topic

3497
02:24:56,479 --> 02:25:01,640
of ethics and potentially questionable

3498
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:03,140
ones I remember around the time of the

3499
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:05,001
Emerald cup or I think maybe even the

3500
02:25:03,140 --> 02:25:07,130
day after you put up a post basically

3501
02:25:05,001 --> 02:25:08,659
saying you know along the lines of you

3502
02:25:07,130 --> 02:25:11,079
you knew that you weren't gonna get

3503
02:25:08,659 --> 02:25:13,610
placed where you should have been and

3504
02:25:11,079 --> 02:25:15,560
you know hinted to the idea that maybe

3505
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:17,780
there was some more politics behind the

3506
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:19,970
scenes in regards to the judging than

3507
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:21,829
what the public was aware of did I just

3508
02:25:19,970 --> 02:25:23,359
kind of misinterpret that post or is

3509
02:25:21,829 --> 02:25:25,640
there something a little more yeah going

3510
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:27,681
on no you know what was going on

3511
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:30,050
honestly was people were saying that I

3512
02:25:27,681 --> 02:25:32,329
was gonna win and they were saying that

3513
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:34,760
I was gonna win because it was fixed and

3514
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:36,079
the reason why I won was because I was

3515
02:25:34,761 --> 02:25:39,200
gonna win no matter what

3516
02:25:36,079 --> 02:25:39,921
and my we'd probably wasn't really that

3517
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:44,030
good anyway

3518
02:25:39,921 --> 02:25:47,751
and the contest isn't blind and all this

3519
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:50,900
different stuff and you know what I

3520
02:25:47,751 --> 02:25:53,300
basically was saying was look I've won

3521
02:25:50,899 --> 02:25:56,210
third I've won second I have won first

3522
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:58,159
all in a row if you guys think I'm gonna

3523
02:25:56,210 --> 02:25:59,960
take first again when there's gonna

3524
02:25:58,159 --> 02:26:02,989
probably be a thousand entries from all

3525
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:05,751
over California you guys are tripping

3526
02:26:02,989 --> 02:26:07,699
because it's just not gonna happen there

3527
02:26:05,751 --> 02:26:09,890
was no way that I was gonna do that

3528
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:12,561
again it's just not it just wasn't

3529
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:17,931
possible there's not like you know like

3530
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:20,630
yeah I got good weed but even if you

3531
02:26:17,931 --> 02:26:22,461
know there is people were like oh well I

3532
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:24,020
know who's gonna win that guy's gonna

3533
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:25,970
win and I'm like you guys really think

3534
02:26:24,021 --> 02:26:27,440
I'm gonna win again you know and they

3535
02:26:25,970 --> 02:26:29,539
were like well yeah of course you'll win

3536
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:31,521
again because that's why you want in the

3537
02:26:29,540 --> 02:26:35,480
first place and I'm like no I really

3538
02:26:31,521 --> 02:26:37,461
want in the first place and I can tell

3539
02:26:35,479 --> 02:26:40,520
you right now that I'm not gonna win

3540
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:42,289
again because I know I really want now

3541
02:26:40,521 --> 02:26:44,329
if it was fixed I'd be like yep I'm

3542
02:26:42,290 --> 02:26:45,109
gonna win I know I'm gonna win because

3543
02:26:44,329 --> 02:26:48,648
it's fixed

3544
02:26:45,109 --> 02:26:51,199
I always win but you know that's not why

3545
02:26:48,648 --> 02:26:54,078
I won man I won because I had because

3546
02:26:51,199 --> 02:26:56,479
everybody entered fuel and everybody

3547
02:26:54,078 --> 02:26:59,238
entered fruit and I entered fruit feel

3548
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:01,519
and everybody's purple doesn't get you

3549
02:26:59,238 --> 02:27:04,520
high and everybody's cush tastes like

3550
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:06,770
cush and I entered I entered purple weed

3551
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:08,629
that gets you high tastes like purple

3552
02:27:06,770 --> 02:27:11,390
tastes like cush takes like a bunch of

3553
02:27:08,629 --> 02:27:17,180
other crazy stuff - I took seven hours

3554
02:27:11,389 --> 02:27:18,680
to trim three ounces you know and that's

3555
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:20,090
just how I did it you know I didn't

3556
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:23,289
touch the weed when I cut it off the

3557
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:26,299
plant I did all this special stuff and

3558
02:27:23,289 --> 02:27:28,129
you know it gave me an edge and I just

3559
02:27:26,299 --> 02:27:29,628
knew the reality was that's why I put up

3560
02:27:28,129 --> 02:27:31,789
the post I'm like dude if you guys

3561
02:27:29,629 --> 02:27:33,619
really think that you know I'm

3562
02:27:31,789 --> 02:27:36,498
big-headed enough to go in here and

3563
02:27:33,619 --> 02:27:38,270
think I'm gonna win you know I just I

3564
02:27:36,498 --> 02:27:39,828
don't I don't believe that I don't think

3565
02:27:38,270 --> 02:27:41,930
it can be done I don't think anybody's

3566
02:27:39,828 --> 02:27:45,049
gonna win this sucker two years in a row

3567
02:27:41,930 --> 02:27:46,760
sure third second first you know I

3568
02:27:45,049 --> 02:27:48,648
always do pretty well but it's because

3569
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:51,408
of those tricks I use to make my stuff

3570
02:27:48,648 --> 02:27:53,510
look unhandled I you know people's weeds

3571
02:27:51,408 --> 02:27:56,748
dry in seven days why we ain't dry for

3572
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:58,219
24 days you know people's weed is cut

3573
02:27:56,748 --> 02:28:00,469
down and put in the wheelbarrow mine's

3574
02:27:58,219 --> 02:28:02,688
cut down and stuck on a hanger people's

3575
02:28:00,469 --> 02:28:05,179
weed is touched with hands I touched the

3576
02:28:02,689 --> 02:28:07,248
stem people trim the weed and they put

3577
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:08,898
it in a pile people pull weed out of

3578
02:28:07,248 --> 02:28:11,478
bags their trimmers are trimming I'm

3579
02:28:08,898 --> 02:28:13,878
like no man this stuff is like this is

3580
02:28:11,478 --> 02:28:15,799
like scientific grade right here you

3581
02:28:13,879 --> 02:28:19,840
know that's like these are specimens of

3582
02:28:15,799 --> 02:28:22,128
the plant perfectly preserved but I I

3583
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:24,020
you know did I think I'd probably be in

3584
02:28:22,129 --> 02:28:25,850
the top ten yeah I did because I know

3585
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:28,668
how much care I put into those entries

3586
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:30,379
but you know I knew there was no way I

3587
02:28:28,668 --> 02:28:32,270
was gonna win and that that's what the

3588
02:28:30,379 --> 02:28:32,810
post was about and there were and I was

3589
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:35,569
joking

3590
02:28:32,809 --> 02:28:39,408
it was tongue-in-cheek I was saying oh

3591
02:28:35,568 --> 02:28:41,180
yeah you know here's Swami talking to

3592
02:28:39,408 --> 02:28:44,180
Tim figuring out how to let me win you

3593
02:28:41,180 --> 02:28:45,979
know but um but it was really it was

3594
02:28:44,180 --> 02:28:48,289
because you know I was making fun of

3595
02:28:45,978 --> 02:28:51,248
people who were making fun of me because

3596
02:28:48,289 --> 02:28:56,029
you know it was just unrealistic people

3597
02:28:51,248 --> 02:28:58,128
basically if people if people lose its

3598
02:28:56,029 --> 02:28:59,069
fixed if they win its fair that's how

3599
02:28:58,129 --> 02:29:01,471
people think you know

3600
02:28:59,069 --> 02:29:03,270
they're like wall my friend didn't win

3601
02:29:01,470 --> 02:29:04,829
so it's fixed and then when their friend

3602
02:29:03,271 --> 02:29:06,811
wins they're like hell yeah this is a

3603
02:29:04,829 --> 02:29:08,521
good contest because my friend want it's

3607
02:29:12,149 --> 02:29:16,739
good and the weed I entered was good and

3608
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:19,739

3609
02:29:16,739 --> 02:29:21,360

3610
02:29:19,739 --> 02:29:23,431

3611
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:25,021
was gonna say your online presence in my

3612
02:29:23,431 --> 02:29:26,579
opinion I hope you don't take any

3613
02:29:25,021 --> 02:29:28,380
offense to this it's kind of like semi

3614
02:29:26,579 --> 02:29:29,970
troll in a little ways like it's like a

3615
02:29:28,379 --> 02:29:31,829
lot of good jokes followed up with kind

3616
02:29:29,970 --> 02:29:35,670
of like a no I'm just kidding type of

3617
02:29:31,829 --> 02:29:37,860
thing and no it is I'm I'm I'm I'm a fun

3618
02:29:35,670 --> 02:29:40,860
lover you know I'm not mean about stuff

3619
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:42,329
I don't bully people but um but um you

3620
02:29:40,860 --> 02:29:44,370
know like I said I like to laugh man I

3621
02:29:42,329 --> 02:29:45,629
like to make people laugh I think like

3622
02:29:44,370 --> 02:29:47,551
laughing is one of the greatest things

3623
02:29:45,629 --> 02:29:49,920
there is that's why you know like if if

3624
02:29:47,550 --> 02:29:51,449
people if people are into the weed

3625
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:52,890
community and they don't like to laugh

3626
02:29:51,450 --> 02:29:56,070
like I don't know what they're smoking

3627
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:57,239
you know yeah yeah so I mean just

3628
02:29:56,069 --> 02:29:59,101
relating to that do you think that

3629
02:29:57,239 --> 02:30:00,720
things in general have gotten a bit

3630
02:29:59,101 --> 02:30:02,400
uptight and tense in the community and

3631
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:04,229
maybe we could use a bit more of this

3632
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:07,920
kind of just you know kind of

3633
02:30:04,229 --> 02:30:09,390
light-hearted fun yeah you know I don't

3634
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,040
know I mean it's hard because

3635
02:30:09,390 --> 02:30:11,579
everybody's got a different sense of

3636
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:14,070
humor

3637
02:30:11,579 --> 02:30:15,420
some people take things too far some

3638
02:30:14,069 --> 02:30:15,840
people don't know when they're being a

3639
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:17,851
bully

3640
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:19,829
some people don't they're not really

3641
02:30:17,851 --> 02:30:22,950
intelligent enough to actually make a

3642
02:30:19,829 --> 02:30:26,340
joke that's like a joke and their joke

3643
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:28,500
is just you know calling somebody fat or

3644
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:30,149
calling somebody stupid or calling

3645
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:32,310
somebody a [ __ ] and they think that's a

3646
02:30:30,149 --> 02:30:34,739
joke you know like some people just

3647
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:36,539
they're they're not they then they're

3648
02:30:34,739 --> 02:30:37,949
missing it and they're like oh well you

3649
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:39,990
do the same thing and I'm like no I

something offensive to somebody that

3655
02:30:49,409 --> 02:30:54,601

3668

3669
02:31:24,670 --> 02:31:28,870
this is you know everything's different

3670

3672
02:31:30,851 --> 02:31:35,141
people but back in the day it was like

3673
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:36,880
if somebody smokes weed and they grow

3674
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:39,310
weed you know they're kind of a smartass

3675
02:31:36,879 --> 02:31:40,779
you know they're kind of a joker and all

3676
02:31:39,310 --> 02:31:43,000
of us who are a little more old-school

3677
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:44,500
we can recognize each other and go yeah

3678
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,659
that dude that dude right there he's

3679
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:49,030

3682
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:57,641
just I don't know and there's different

3683
02:31:54,550 --> 02:32:01,689
levels to two peoples banter and

3684
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:04,149
different stuff like that and you know I

3685
02:32:01,690 --> 02:32:07,271
feel like a lot of people just they just

3686
02:32:04,149 --> 02:32:10,569
basically bully people and they're jerks

3687
02:32:07,271 --> 02:32:14,110
and they you know people don't know that

3688
02:32:10,569 --> 02:32:15,970
it's not serious and you know it's just

3689
02:32:14,110 --> 02:32:17,891
out of context and style so it's like

3690
02:32:15,970 --> 02:32:19,359
it's got a you know it's got a kind of

3691
02:32:17,890 --> 02:32:20,949
you got to kind of have a context I

3692
02:32:19,360 --> 02:32:24,641
don't mess with anybody who I don't know

3693
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:26,409
like honestly I you know I I know human

3694
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:28,060
nature well enough to be like no I'm not

02:32:26,409 --> 02:32:29,200
gonna I'm not gonna mess with people who

3696
02:32:28,060 --> 02:32:32,050
I don't know they have to know I'm

3697
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:35,980
messing with them and you know otherwise

3698
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:38,529
it's dangerous and it can be cruel and

3699
02:32:35,979 --> 02:32:41,261
it just kind of not staying in your own

3700
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:43,061
lane you know like talking to you know

3701
02:32:41,261 --> 02:32:44,950
I'm from the counterculture man like you

3702
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:46,810
talk about people that's like you know

3703
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:52,271
that's not cool that's like snitching

3704
02:32:46,810 --> 02:32:54,011
Kiko so for me I'm not into you know I'm

3705
02:32:52,271 --> 02:32:55,511
not into being a jerk like that but yeah

3706
02:32:54,011 --> 02:32:57,399
like you said like I'm a little trollee

3707
02:32:55,511 --> 02:33:00,210
but you know I'm trolling my friends man

3708
02:32:57,399 --> 02:33:02,890
i troll roundtable selections i troll

3709
02:33:00,209 --> 02:33:05,199
you know i I just

3710
02:33:02,890 --> 02:33:06,579
then we say troll and now it used to

3711
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:08,681
just be called [ __ ] with people

3712
02:33:06,579 --> 02:33:11,620
you're just messing around you're having

3713
02:33:08,681 --> 02:33:14,710
fun you know and uh and that's what I do

3714
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:16,811
and I think that that needs to be like

3715
02:33:14,709 --> 02:33:19,600
something that hangs around as far as

3716
02:33:16,810 --> 02:33:21,819
people being able to laugh at themselves

3717
02:33:19,601 --> 02:33:24,190
being able to laugh at stuff that's

3718
02:33:21,819 --> 02:33:24,969
going on laugh at situations laugh at

3719
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:26,709
idea

3720
02:33:24,969 --> 02:33:28,389
you know I'm not really trying to laugh

3721
02:33:26,709 --> 02:33:30,489
at people I'm trying to laugh at myself

3722
02:33:28,389 --> 02:33:33,309
I'm trying to laugh at the joke you know

3723
02:33:30,488 --> 02:33:35,288
and um and I think that goes hand in

3724
02:33:33,309 --> 02:33:37,328
hand with weed weed is funny man weed

3725
02:33:35,289 --> 02:33:39,520
makes you giggle it makes you laugh

3726
02:33:37,328 --> 02:33:41,260
people look funny when they're high you

3727
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:43,600
know people get high and they look like

3728
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:45,279
you know you might have a buddy who gets

3729
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:46,748
high and he looks like a tired giraffe

3730
02:33:45,279 --> 02:33:49,779
or something you know you're just like

3731
02:33:46,748 --> 02:33:51,248
man this is you know it I think it goes

3732
02:33:49,779 --> 02:33:53,078
together with the whole thing and I

3733
02:33:51,248 --> 02:33:55,299
think if that kind of gets lost and it

3734
02:33:53,078 --> 02:33:56,978
becomes this you know I see people who

3735
02:33:55,299 --> 02:33:58,658
are all science and they're all

3736
02:33:56,978 --> 02:34:00,219
technique and they're all this and

3737
02:33:58,658 --> 02:34:04,228
they're all that and I'm like man do you

3738
02:34:00,219 --> 02:34:04,228

02:37:32,329 --> 02:37:43,549
it it's super super slick man this is

3808
02:37:39,170 --> 02:37:46,010
lick talker but yeah man basically like

3809
02:37:43,549 --> 02:37:48,469
you know just just just anybody who's

3810
02:37:46,010 --> 02:37:50,090
really into doing stuff and you know

3811
02:37:48,469 --> 02:37:50,869
most of the people who I named it's not

3812
02:37:50,090 --> 02:37:52,340
because

3813
02:37:50,870 --> 02:37:54,290
there's a lot of people who I'd like to

3814
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:56,120
work with who I don't name the people

3815
02:37:54,290 --> 02:37:57,890
who I did name are people who we've

3816
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:59,840
already done something with or they gave

3817
02:37:57,889 --> 02:38:02,269
me some stock and said I could work with

3818
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:05,239
it or I gave them some stock and said

3819
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:08,060
that they could work with it and maybe

3820
02:38:05,239 --> 02:38:09,739
they've already made some crosses I've

3821
02:38:08,059 --> 02:38:11,090
already made some crosses and so that

3822
02:38:09,739 --> 02:38:13,340
you know that's that's the people kind

3823
02:38:11,090 --> 02:38:15,049
of that I mentioned it's less people who

3824
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:17,450
I'd want to work with and more people

3825
02:38:15,049 --> 02:38:19,608
who I already do work with you know so

3826
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:20,840
as far as people you know who I'd want

3827
02:38:19,609 --> 02:38:23,180
to work of course there's there's a

3828
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:25,728
bunch of them and like I you know

3829

seeds and I'm looking forward to doing

3834
02:38:38,059 --> 02:38:41,539
something with those next year I'll

3835
02:38:39,859 --> 02:38:43,520
probably pop all of those that's like a

3836
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:45,140
super generous dude who when I asked him

3837
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:47,210
yeah can I get a pack of this he's like

3838
02:38:45,139 --> 02:38:49,099

3839
02:38:47,209 --> 02:38:51,949
I'm like man I don't know probably only

3840
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:53,809

okay right on you know like Bodie man I

3845
02:39:00,620 --> 02:39:04,430
I met Bodie maybe for five minutes and

3846
02:39:02,959 --> 02:39:06,289
the next time I saw him he had a gift

3847
02:39:04,430 --> 02:39:08,270
for me for Christmas you know like

3848

02:39:20,478 --> 02:39:23,869
they're always it's just people who

3854
02:39:22,609 --> 02:39:25,399
we're all kind of looking out for each

3855
02:39:23,870 --> 02:39:27,620
other we're trying to see each other do

3856
02:39:25,398 --> 02:39:29,559
better and we all kind of know where

3857
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:33,020
we're coming from because in the past

3858
02:39:29,559 --> 02:39:36,260
everybody was kind of in a certain

3859
02:39:33,020 --> 02:39:38,210
regard as far as like society we're all

3860
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:41,600
kind of like you know on the outskirts

3861
02:39:38,209 --> 02:39:44,119
like deemed by society is kind of like

3862
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:45,710
being looser potheads you know and now

3863
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:47,329
all of a sudden people are like oh no

3864
02:39:45,709 --> 02:39:47,719
you guys are the top you guys are the

3865
02:39:47,329 --> 02:39:49,939
best

3866
02:39:47,719 --> 02:39:51,920
you guys are good at this I'm like all

3867
02:39:49,939 --> 02:39:53,569
right cool you know that's great I'm

3868
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:55,549
glad it can turn into something since I

3869
02:39:53,569 --> 02:39:58,219
heard he spent my whole life doing it

3870
02:39:55,549 --> 02:39:59,858
but um but you know you can kind of you

3871
02:39:58,219 --> 02:40:02,209
meet those people in you and you know

3872
02:39:59,859 --> 02:40:04,069
you know that they're that they've been

3873
02:40:02,209 --> 02:40:06,079
around and they've done stuff you know

3874
02:40:04,069 --> 02:40:08,629
meena swamp boys those guys are cool

3875
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:10,489
like I've still never met him but you

3876
02:40:08,629 --> 02:40:12,109
know I you know we troll each other

3877
02:40:10,489 --> 02:40:14,360
lightly and like I said you can just

3878
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:17,329
tell like people have been around their

3879
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:18,950
smart asses we're all kind of on a on a

3880
02:40:17,329 --> 02:40:20,629
little level we're all totally different

3881
02:40:18,950 --> 02:40:22,700
you know what I mean none of us are

3882
02:40:20,629 --> 02:40:24,800
really you know that's the thing is

3883
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:28,551
that's what's the same about us is we're

3884
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:30,800
all hella different so yeah man anybody

3885
02:40:28,550 --> 02:40:32,779
who's really into doing stuff for the

3886
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:35,510
plants sake for itself and not just to

3887
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:40,489
not just to come up and look hype you

3888
02:40:35,511 --> 02:40:44,450
know so yeah sure and so I'm interested

3889
02:40:40,489 --> 02:40:47,239
you know given your kind of you know

3890
02:40:44,450 --> 02:40:49,700
closeness I'll put it as with Frenchie

3891
02:40:47,239 --> 02:40:51,409
through howl aficionado has that

3892
02:40:49,700 --> 02:40:53,271
influence any of your breeding like has

3893
02:40:51,409 --> 02:40:56,090
he ever mentioned anything or have you

3894
02:40:53,271 --> 02:40:59,090
ever tried to maybe create something

3895
02:40:56,090 --> 02:41:01,610
that was more well suited for kind of

3896
02:40:59,090 --> 02:41:04,280
you know these really high-quality hash

3897
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:06,110
production methods and if so what type

3898
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:08,511
of things would you be looking to do if

3899
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:10,101
you were trying to pursue that well

3900
02:41:08,511 --> 02:41:11,810
that's kind of an interesting one I mean

3901
02:41:10,101 --> 02:41:14,239
Frenchie's cool in that you know he'll

3902
02:41:11,810 --> 02:41:15,619
take something and he'll make it and you

3903
02:41:14,239 --> 02:41:17,209
know he might make a few different

3904
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:18,980
things at once and you get to kind of

3905
02:41:17,209 --> 02:41:21,020
see okay well this comes out like this

3906
02:41:18,979 --> 02:41:23,060
and this comes out like that you know I

3907
02:41:21,021 --> 02:41:24,471
was making hash for a long time and then

3908
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:26,390
as soon as I started seeing people

3909
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:28,609
really do it a lot I kind of got bored

3910
02:41:26,390 --> 02:41:31,159
with it as soon as I saw people get this

3911
02:41:28,610 --> 02:41:32,659
really really crazy high grade hash I

3912
02:41:31,159 --> 02:41:35,539
was like well I was just waiting to see

3913
02:41:32,659 --> 02:41:38,390
that and they already did it so I kind

3914
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:40,400
of just stopped doing it and so I really

3915
02:41:38,390 --> 02:41:42,859
like to give stuff to people who do take

3916
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:45,170
the time to do that because to me that's

3917
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:49,250
like a whole other aspect that's kind of

3918
02:41:45,170 --> 02:41:52,069
like going all into that where you know

3919
02:41:49,250 --> 02:41:54,110
for me it was you know I used to make

3920
02:41:52,069 --> 02:41:59,029
hash I used to make dry hash I used to

3921
02:41:54,110 --> 02:42:02,391
make water hash and you know I've been

3922
02:41:59,030 --> 02:42:04,700
able to go now and go okay you know

3923
02:42:02,390 --> 02:42:06,890
Frenchie here's some of this uni and he

3924
02:42:04,700 --> 02:42:08,450
makes it up and it's like okay wow look

3925
02:42:06,890 --> 02:42:10,129
at the difference in texture on this

3926
02:42:08,450 --> 02:42:12,230
it's not that what's gonna happen okay

3927
02:42:10,129 --> 02:42:14,539
this stuff is like liquid this is water

3928
02:42:12,229 --> 02:42:16,859
hash but it's like liquid or give

3929
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:19,800
something to somebody who makes

3930
02:42:16,859 --> 02:42:23,309
who makes um butane extracts you know

3931
02:42:19,799 --> 02:42:24,688
and go okay that does that look at how

3932
02:42:23,309 --> 02:42:26,549
much terpenes is in this this is

3933
02:42:24,689 --> 02:42:29,369
ridiculous it gives you a little insight

3934
02:42:26,549 --> 02:42:33,090
into genetics and as far as like

3935
02:42:29,369 --> 02:42:34,078
steering the breeding what's really cool

3936
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:36,630
is that

3937
02:42:34,078 --> 02:42:39,379
I've always bred really for the smoke

3938
02:42:36,629 --> 02:42:41,908
and when you're breeding for the smoke

3939
02:42:39,379 --> 02:42:44,488
coincidentally you're breeding for the

3940
02:42:41,908 --> 02:42:48,148
extract because a plant that doesn't

3941
02:42:44,488 --> 02:42:49,770
smoke well doesn't typically extract

3942
02:42:48,148 --> 02:42:52,500
well although I'm sure there's

3943
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:53,760
exceptions to it because some plants

3944
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:55,439
don't smoke well because they have a

3945
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:57,420
tiny amount of resin and once you

3946
02:42:55,439 --> 02:43:02,850
extract it the resin might actually be

3947
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:05,699
exceptional but for me it's been cool

3948
02:43:02,850 --> 02:43:07,439
with seeing some stuff that Frenchy does

3949
02:43:05,699 --> 02:43:09,569
where you know he makes it and I'm like

3950
02:43:07,439 --> 02:43:12,210
wow this stuff just turns into straight

3951
02:43:09,568 --> 02:43:17,818
liquid or well this stuff sugars out

3952
02:43:12,209 --> 02:43:19,889
really crazy and um you know then you

3953
02:43:17,818 --> 02:43:21,840
know Frenchie's Frenchie's old school

3954
02:43:19,889 --> 02:43:23,670
dude like you know French cheese from

3955
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,350
like the generation of people who taught

3956
02:43:23,670 --> 02:43:27,359
me about weed and so they're in two

3957
02:43:25,350 --> 02:43:29,369
different things he's in the dark

3958
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:32,369
pressed hash and I was making dark

3959
02:43:29,369 --> 02:43:35,100
pressed hash when I met him he's into um

3960
02:43:32,369 --> 02:43:37,500
you know he's into he's you know he's

3961
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:41,309
different man he's not number one he's

3962
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:43,529
older number two he's European and that

3963
02:43:41,309 --> 02:43:46,288
comes down to you know some different

3964
02:43:43,529 --> 02:43:47,760
there's different mindsets he's looking

3965
02:43:46,289 --> 02:43:50,850
at different stuff than other people are

3966
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:52,800
looking at and then and number three

3967
02:43:50,850 --> 02:43:55,920
he's Frenchie man he's [ __ ] character

3968
02:43:52,799 --> 02:44:01,288
French is hilarious dude like uh he's

3969
02:43:55,920 --> 02:44:02,969
just like you know the he's just uh he's

3970
02:44:01,289 --> 02:44:06,119
Frenchie man he's is a trip you know

3971
02:44:02,969 --> 02:44:08,549
he's got a lot of charisma yeah yeah all

3972
02:44:06,119 --> 02:44:11,550
righty and so how do you feel about the

3973
02:44:08,549 --> 02:44:13,049
topic of tobacco and cannabis being

3974
02:44:11,549 --> 02:44:15,059
mixed together it's something we very

3975
02:44:13,049 --> 02:44:15,988
very briefly touched on with Bowie but

3976
02:44:15,059 --> 02:44:18,600
there's something I want to get into

3977
02:44:15,988 --> 02:44:21,448
more because I feel like as times gone

3978
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:23,880
by and there's been an increasing focus

3979
02:44:21,449 --> 02:44:24,479
on the flavor and the terpenes of modern

3980
02:44:23,879 --> 02:44:26,818
cannabis

3981
02:44:24,478 --> 02:44:28,769
I feel like tobacco's slowly crept out

3982
02:44:26,818 --> 02:44:30,359
because it's almost like it's a lot of

3983
02:44:28,770 --> 02:44:32,310
people would argue that it can do

3984
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:34,619
from some of the natural flavors and so

3985
02:44:32,309 --> 02:44:36,898
given there was that focus on flavor its

3986
02:44:34,619 --> 02:44:39,449
usage kind of fell off a bit do you feel

3987
02:44:36,898 --> 02:44:41,038
that's the case and do you feel like it

3988
02:44:39,449 --> 02:44:44,029
is an overall negative or maybe it has

3989
02:44:41,039 --> 02:44:46,859
like its place in the world of cannabis

3990
02:44:44,029 --> 02:44:52,340
well this is a this is a trippy one for

3991
02:44:46,859 --> 02:44:58,168
me it's kind of uh it's kind of a

3992
02:44:52,340 --> 02:45:01,139
slippery slope because for years alright

3993
02:44:58,168 --> 02:45:03,600
I never smoked I never smoked tobacco

3994
02:45:01,139 --> 02:45:05,939
I'm not a tobacco smoker I didn't like

3995
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:07,859
you know some people are like oh I'm 15

3996
02:45:05,939 --> 02:45:09,930
I'm smoking cigarettes you know I didn't

3997
02:45:07,859 --> 02:45:11,908
ever smoke cigarettes my mom smoked a

3998
02:45:09,930 --> 02:45:16,039
little when I was a kid I hated the

3999
02:45:11,908 --> 02:45:21,029
smell I was never into it and then uh

4000
02:45:16,039 --> 02:45:27,439
you know I think maybe we had a we got a

4001
02:45:21,029 --> 02:45:31,168
friend and he in his dad is I think

4002
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:32,520
Spanish I'm not sure man he had one of

4003
02:45:31,168 --> 02:45:34,378
these accents where he lives in like

4004
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:36,300
three countries in Europe so you can't

4005
02:45:34,379 --> 02:45:38,760
really pin down his accent really well

4006
02:45:36,299 --> 02:45:41,309
he's like Italian Spanish and something

4007
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:43,318
else you know and he was like one of

4008
02:45:41,309 --> 02:45:47,668
these kind of one of these old-school

4009
02:45:43,318 --> 02:45:50,908
hardcore dudes he was he was a he was an

4010
02:45:47,668 --> 02:45:52,378
outlaw you know and he would he would we

4011
02:45:50,908 --> 02:45:55,288
saw him when we were smoking when I was

4012
02:45:52,379 --> 02:45:58,229
like 15 or something you know 14 and we

4013
02:45:55,289 --> 02:45:59,430
were really getting smoking we saw that

4014
02:45:58,228 --> 02:46:02,128
over there at their house they would

4015
02:45:59,430 --> 02:46:04,020
smoke with tobacco so we never really we

4016
02:46:02,129 --> 02:46:07,140
never really did it and then you know I

4017
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:09,180
was I was a dude who you know like I

4018
02:46:07,139 --> 02:46:12,238
took mushrooms for the first time man

4019
02:46:09,180 --> 02:46:13,199
when I was like 12 years old at school

4020
02:46:12,238 --> 02:46:16,288
you know what I mean

4021
02:46:13,199 --> 02:46:21,899
so like I'm like I was like a cosmonaut

4022
02:46:16,289 --> 02:46:23,600
at one point you know so basically one

4023
02:46:21,898 --> 02:46:26,248
time my buddy

4024
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:27,869
c-money he goes hey let's roll one up

4025
02:46:26,248 --> 02:46:29,609
like let's roll it up like those guys

4026
02:46:27,869 --> 02:46:32,369
down there he goes I'm gonna take a

4027
02:46:29,609 --> 02:46:33,689
little bit of tobacco and a little bit

4028
02:46:32,369 --> 02:46:35,369
of weed and then we're gonna put a

4029
02:46:33,689 --> 02:46:37,979
little bit of hash and a little bit of

4030
02:46:35,369 --> 02:46:39,569
quiche in there and man we lit it up and

4031
02:46:37,978 --> 02:46:41,309
I think we each maybe took like four

4032
02:46:39,568 --> 02:46:43,019
hits and we were so

4033
02:46:41,309 --> 02:46:45,148
gone we couldn't believe it because we

4034
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:47,399
had never experienced nicotine before

4035
02:46:45,148 --> 02:46:50,219
and when you're not a nicotine user it's

4036
02:46:47,398 --> 02:46:51,658
a really really intense drug it's one of

4037
02:46:50,219 --> 02:46:54,420
the strongest drugs there as it gives

4038
02:46:51,658 --> 02:46:56,250
you a really heavy heavy rush in the

4039
02:46:54,420 --> 02:46:59,639
face and it makes your feet feel light

4040
02:46:56,250 --> 02:47:03,238
you kind of feel like a spaceman and it

4041
02:46:59,639 --> 02:47:05,488
was really neat and then I think it was

4042
02:47:03,238 --> 02:47:10,670
all the way maybe two or three years

4043
02:47:05,488 --> 02:47:16,978
later one of my closest friends man a

4044
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:18,779
guy named Louis he was uh he was like aw

4045
02:47:16,978 --> 02:47:20,670
let's smoke this I got this I got this

4046
02:47:18,779 --> 02:47:23,130
Jamaican tobacco it's called front toe

4047
02:47:20,670 --> 02:47:24,809
you know and I was like oh yeah and he

4048
02:47:23,129 --> 02:47:26,488
goes yeah you know you put it in a bong

4049
02:47:24,809 --> 02:47:29,100
a little bit with some weed man it gets

4050
02:47:26,488 --> 02:47:31,049
you super high you know like it's like

4051
02:47:29,100 --> 02:47:34,488
nitrous or something and I was like oh

4052
02:47:31,049 --> 02:47:37,408
okay crazy and so I was like alright and

4053
02:47:34,488 --> 02:47:39,478
so I tried it and I couldn't believe it

4054
02:47:37,408 --> 02:47:41,340
I was like oh my god this is like smoke

4055
02:47:39,478 --> 02:47:44,578
this is like smoking that tobacco but

4056
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:46,710
this is way more intense you know and so

4057
02:47:44,578 --> 02:47:49,109
um you know that was my kind of my

4058
02:47:46,709 --> 02:47:51,688
experience with it but I was always anti

4059
02:47:49,109 --> 02:47:54,210
tobacco like I said I like to smile I

4060
02:47:51,689 --> 02:47:57,720
don't like the fact that you know I knew

4061
02:47:54,209 --> 02:47:59,908
a lot of smokers who got cancer and you

4062
02:47:57,719 --> 02:48:01,590
know like not to blend not to say was

4063
02:47:59,908 --> 02:48:05,068
definitely tobacco but of course there's

4064
02:48:01,590 --> 02:48:07,828
smokiness you know big tobacco products

4065
02:48:05,068 --> 02:48:09,658
that aren't probably even in anywhere

4066
02:48:07,828 --> 02:48:11,639
near as good for you considering there's

4067
02:48:09,658 --> 02:48:13,289
like 800 additives a lot different than

4068
02:48:11,639 --> 02:48:17,760
smoking a plant that's growing in the

4069
02:48:13,290 --> 02:48:21,840
ground you know and so then I think it

4070
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:24,449
was maybe about 2006 you know I'm

4071
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:26,010
hanging out with moniece and every he's

4072
02:48:24,449 --> 02:48:28,770
always smoking blent we call him Oh

4073
02:48:26,010 --> 02:48:30,840
blend you know blend blend he smoking

4074
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:33,140
blends you know so he's rolling these

4075
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:38,460
big Bob Marley cones all the time and uh

4076
02:48:33,139 --> 02:48:40,709
so I'm always like man roll up roll up

4077
02:48:38,459 --> 02:48:42,599
roll up a ital roll up one would note

4078
02:48:40,709 --> 02:48:43,978
aback oh just roll one with weed roll on

4079
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:45,960
the feet he's like nah man I want to

4080
02:48:43,978 --> 02:48:48,809
smoke a blend so I'm like alright so

4081
02:48:45,959 --> 02:48:50,250
after a while I'm like man screw it let

4082
02:48:48,809 --> 02:48:52,648
me hit the blend so I start hitting the

4083
02:48:50,250 --> 02:48:54,270
blend and after a while I like get this

4084
02:48:52,648 --> 02:48:56,969
real like

4085
02:48:54,270 --> 02:48:58,520
you know just like and hard to describe

4086
02:48:56,969 --> 02:49:02,429
like just this feeling of like

4087
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:04,170
well-being and not the edge that the

4088
02:49:02,430 --> 02:49:07,020
heavy weed would give me where I'd get a

4089
02:49:04,170 --> 02:49:09,988
little bit of like unexplainable

4090
02:49:07,020 --> 02:49:12,238
paranoia a little bit you know and so

4091
02:49:09,988 --> 02:49:14,939
after a while I see yeah I started I

4092
02:49:12,238 --> 02:49:21,750
started smoking man I started smoking

4093
02:49:14,939 --> 02:49:29,220
blimps and so from 2007 maybe until

4094
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:30,779
probably 2000 G's 2007 - maybe 2010 or

4095
02:49:29,219 --> 02:49:32,368
something I smoked blends and what was

4096
02:49:30,779 --> 02:49:34,408
interesting was I was breeding at the

4097
02:49:32,369 --> 02:49:37,590
time and I don't want it you know I

4098
02:49:34,408 --> 02:49:39,568
don't I don't condone smoking tobacco in

4099
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:40,590
any way anybody who's listening to it

4100
02:49:39,568 --> 02:49:41,278
you know that's why I said it's a

4101
02:49:40,590 --> 02:49:44,760
slippery slope

4102
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:47,520
but here's the deal there's very few

4103
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:50,670
strains that the terpene profile can cut

4104
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:52,828
through tobacco and there's very few

4105
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:55,799
strains that when you are a nicotine

4106
02:49:52,828 --> 02:49:57,510
user will boost the effect of the

4107
02:49:55,799 --> 02:49:59,578
nicotine to a point of giving you a

4108
02:49:57,510 --> 02:50:03,000
really heavy head rush even when you

4109
02:49:59,578 --> 02:50:08,010
smoke tobacco fairly often and those

4110
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:11,939
strains are the really heavy duty ones

4111
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:14,639
that are the very best weed and so if

4112
02:50:11,939 --> 02:50:18,389
you have a plant and you're a blend

4113
02:50:14,639 --> 02:50:20,340
smoker and it's good in a blend you know

4114
02:50:18,389 --> 02:50:22,559
it's the best weed you know and I I

4115
02:50:20,340 --> 02:50:26,639
don't you know it's a it's one of those

4116
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:30,809
weird things it's like you know it's

4117
02:50:26,639 --> 02:50:32,670
like you know like a badass jazz dude

4118
02:50:30,809 --> 02:50:35,010
like bird who shoots heroin telling you

4119
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:36,809
not to do heroin you know like it's like

4120
02:50:35,010 --> 02:50:39,750
it's not that it's not the tobacco that

4121
02:50:36,809 --> 02:50:43,139
helps you breed but you know I can't

4122
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:44,670
really say that it didn't um then it

4123
02:50:43,139 --> 02:50:46,590
didn't help me to develop a couple of

4124
02:50:44,670 --> 02:50:48,478
strains you know black lime and root

4125
02:50:46,590 --> 02:50:50,699
beer were the two strains that no matter

4126
02:50:48,478 --> 02:50:53,158
what you could always put him in a blend

4127
02:50:50,699 --> 02:50:55,078
and they would launch you straight to

4128
02:50:53,158 --> 02:50:57,568
the moon every time and then you try

4129
02:50:55,078 --> 02:50:59,430
some other stuff and it just didn't work

4130
02:50:57,568 --> 02:51:01,978
you know it's just like they're the ones

4131
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:06,630
that really work that way so for me I

4132
02:51:01,978 --> 02:51:07,799
can say you know if anybody is gonna

4133
02:51:06,629 --> 02:51:10,019
smoke tobacco

4134
02:51:07,799 --> 02:51:12,389
smoked any of that big tobacco stuff

4135
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:16,109
smoke smoke a grow a plant learn how to

4136
02:51:12,389 --> 02:51:18,568
try it you know I used to smoke I know

4137
02:51:16,109 --> 02:51:21,270
it's big tobacco too still you know but

4138
02:51:18,568 --> 02:51:23,398
me and moniece would smoke American

4139
02:51:21,270 --> 02:51:25,170
spirit and at least it doesn't have the

4140
02:51:23,398 --> 02:51:28,699
additives and it's probably still pretty

4141
02:51:25,170 --> 02:51:32,489
nasty just from how they grow it but um

4142
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:34,680
you know it's a plant man it's it's you

4143
02:51:32,489 --> 02:51:37,889
know I think it's really got a bad rap

4144
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:39,840
because people use it wrong I talked to

4145
02:51:37,889 --> 02:51:43,500
my doctor about how I was smoking blends

4146
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:47,760
and he was like yeah you know that's not

4147
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:49,709
really a tobacco user who usually falls

4148
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:52,350
under the statistics of people who are

4149
02:51:49,709 --> 02:51:54,239
gonna be really unhealthy for it they're

4150
02:51:52,350 --> 02:51:55,950
smoking a lot more tobacco than you're

4151
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:58,439
talking about right now you know and I

4152
02:51:55,950 --> 02:52:01,200
was like okay and you know I just wound

4153
02:51:58,439 --> 02:52:03,960
up quitting because um I can tell you it

4154
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:05,970
is hard on your lungs but my lungs do

4155
02:52:03,959 --> 02:52:07,500
feel like they felt before I ever smoked

4156
02:52:05,969 --> 02:52:09,449
tobacco you know they do feel like

4157
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:11,639
they've come back to being totally

4158
02:52:09,450 --> 02:52:13,500
normal again but you know I couldn't

4159
02:52:11,639 --> 02:52:15,239
breathe as well I didn't do as good like

4160
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:17,129
trying to run away in the woods or

4161
02:52:15,239 --> 02:52:20,430
anything like I was smoking changing to

4162
02:52:17,129 --> 02:52:23,699
tobacco so you know it is dangerous and

4163
02:52:20,430 --> 02:52:25,229
it is harmful but um that doesn't mean

4164
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:27,270
that it's dangerous or harmful to take a

4165
02:52:25,228 --> 02:52:30,420
puff of it here there or you know

4166
02:52:27,270 --> 02:52:33,420
whatever so it's an interesting thing it

4167
02:52:30,420 --> 02:52:38,040
definitely it's definitely a trippy

4168
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:41,939
subject and you know they're there man

4169
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:45,319
there's tobacco I got this tobacco I got

4170
02:52:41,939 --> 02:52:47,760
this tobacco back in the day uh uh and

4171
02:52:45,318 --> 02:52:49,680
this guy gave it to me and he said oh do

4172
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:51,210
you blend and I said you know yeah and

4173
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:53,639
he goes I'll just put a little of this

4174
02:52:51,209 --> 02:52:55,259
in there and I took it home and and I

4175
02:52:53,639 --> 02:53:01,108
put in the bong and I smoked it in the

4176
02:52:55,260 --> 02:53:04,170
bong and what happened was I woke up you

4177
02:53:01,109 --> 02:53:07,010
know 45 seconds later on the ground

4178
02:53:04,170 --> 02:53:10,680
asking for a towel laughing and crying

4179
02:53:07,010 --> 02:53:12,750
because you know I had snot coming out

4180
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:15,270
my nose and I had drool running down my

4181
02:53:12,750 --> 02:53:19,930
face and I was laying on the carpet like

4182
02:53:15,270 --> 02:53:22,909
I was doing snow angels and

4183
02:53:19,930 --> 02:53:25,550
you know I couldn't I couldn't believe

4184
02:53:22,909 --> 02:53:27,770
it and that what that was that was the

4185
02:53:25,549 --> 02:53:30,889
that was that um you know the old stuff

4186
02:53:27,770 --> 02:53:33,380
that was the Rustica and that's the

4187
02:53:30,889 --> 02:53:36,500
original thick leaf Indian tobacco

4188
02:53:33,379 --> 02:53:40,009
that's that's um you know basically for

4189
02:53:36,500 --> 02:53:42,170
for a medicine man to smoke you know or

4190
02:53:40,010 --> 02:53:44,180
kind of what they really what they would

4191
02:53:42,170 --> 02:53:45,620
smoke when you see people smoking you

4192
02:53:44,180 --> 02:53:49,550
know and a peace pipe and stuff it's

4193
02:53:45,620 --> 02:53:51,710
this thick hardcore tobacco um it's like

4194
02:53:49,549 --> 02:53:55,639
if tobacco's like paper it's almost like

4195
02:53:51,709 --> 02:53:57,859
cardboard and when when you smoke that

4196
02:53:55,639 --> 02:54:00,889
that's not like smoking a cigarette and

4197
02:53:57,860 --> 02:54:02,420
that's like that's like you know but

4198
02:54:00,889 --> 02:54:05,059
it's like something you'd see in a movie

4199
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:07,159
somebody you know looked like somebody

4200
02:54:05,059 --> 02:54:07,779
must have blew ayahuasca up my nose or

4201
02:54:07,159 --> 02:54:10,760
something

4202
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:12,650
yeah well oh god it was yeah that's

4203
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:15,050
crazy so anyway that's my experience

4204
02:54:12,649 --> 02:54:17,239
with with some tobacco if people are

4205
02:54:15,049 --> 02:54:20,059
smoking it now every once in a while I

4206
02:54:17,239 --> 02:54:22,250
might smoke a little bit I didn't quit

4207
02:54:20,059 --> 02:54:24,049
in the way that I went I'm quitting I

4208
02:54:22,250 --> 02:54:25,879
just went I just quit in the way that I

4209
02:54:24,049 --> 02:54:29,959
just didn't smoke it anymore you know I

4210
02:54:25,879 --> 02:54:31,699
never got smoking it with weed I feel

4211
02:54:29,959 --> 02:54:33,379
like I didn't get addicted like other

4212
02:54:31,700 --> 02:54:34,850
people got addicted to it I don't know

4213
02:54:33,379 --> 02:54:38,179
if there's something to that or not I'm

4214
02:54:34,850 --> 02:54:41,000
really strong-willed so I was able to

4215
02:54:38,180 --> 02:54:43,220
just smoke tobacco every day all day for

4216
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:45,170
years and then just quit in the day I

4217
02:54:43,219 --> 02:54:47,179
cold turkey and I I did that a couple

4218
02:54:45,170 --> 02:54:49,520
times I started smoking again after

4219
02:54:47,180 --> 02:54:52,579
another year or whatever and then I just

4220
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:54,260
quit again cold turkey you know so yeah

4221
02:54:52,579 --> 02:54:57,079
well no I'm sure a lot of people wish

4222
02:54:54,260 --> 02:54:58,639
they could do that yeah for sure but I

4223
02:54:57,079 --> 02:55:00,799
think a lot of it you know I was talking

4224
02:54:58,639 --> 02:55:04,819
to to an old school friend of mine and

4225
02:55:00,799 --> 02:55:06,439
he said you know he used to smoke um he

4226
02:55:04,819 --> 02:55:09,590
used to smoke some big-name

4227
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:11,030
tobacco back in the day and when he

4228
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:12,950
would quit he would get terrible

4229
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:15,710
headaches and he would feel really bad

4230
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:18,140
and then he started smoking American

4231
02:55:15,709 --> 02:55:20,509
spirit and he smoked just as much and

4232
02:55:18,139 --> 02:55:22,340
then when he would quit he wouldn't get

4233
02:55:20,510 --> 02:55:25,819
the headaches and he wouldn't be that

4234
02:55:22,340 --> 02:55:29,200
bad to quit and he associated it with

4235
02:55:25,819 --> 02:55:32,829
the additives and he believes that the

4236
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:36,641
gives our more addictive than the actual

4237
02:55:32,829 --> 02:55:39,250
nicotine so yeah the anecdotal evidence

4238
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:42,039
but he felt that way so no I think

4239
02:55:39,250 --> 02:55:44,560
that's very much very much true because

4240
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:47,021
a lot of people I know who have tried to

4241
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:49,750
use the nicotine type vape pen say it's

4242
02:55:47,021 --> 02:55:52,141
nowhere near as gratifying as an actual

4243
02:55:49,750 --> 02:55:54,310
an actual cigarette and that should

4244
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:55,750
automatically show that yeah like a lot

4245
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:58,719
of the other chemicals Plus also there's

4246
02:55:55,750 --> 02:56:02,170
studies that show that like organically

4247
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:04,329
grown tobacco like non big stuff it the

4248
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:06,310
the chance of it giving you cancer is

4249
02:56:04,329 --> 02:56:08,379
greatly diminish because all the

4250
02:56:06,310 --> 02:56:12,279
additives are far more carcinogenic than

4251
02:56:08,379 --> 02:56:14,259
the actual tobacco plant itself yeah I

4252
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:15,641
mean I can believe it you know I spend

4253
02:56:14,260 --> 02:56:19,120
and we know there's a lot of those

4254
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:21,940
additives and we know that those

4255
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:26,920
additives are related to addiction and

4256
02:56:21,940 --> 02:56:30,271
and health problems and and and most of

4257
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:32,500
the studies done on tobacco are done on

4258
02:56:30,271 --> 02:56:34,659
they're done on that tobacco they're not

4259
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:38,319
done on on pure tobacco so it's really

4260
02:56:34,659 --> 02:56:41,379
hard to pin down what is really the

4261
02:56:38,319 --> 02:56:43,779
problem I I can tell you for sure that

4262
02:56:41,379 --> 02:56:45,850
smoking my own tobacco that I grow it's

4263
02:56:43,780 --> 02:56:47,320
still really bad for your lungs and it's

4264
02:56:45,851 --> 02:56:50,920
still really hard on your respiratory

4265
02:56:47,319 --> 02:56:53,440
system and everything but um but you

4266
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:55,899
know I feel like there's um I feel like

4267
02:56:53,440 --> 02:56:57,760
you know it's it's definitely a step up

4268
02:56:55,899 --> 02:57:00,250
from smoking all that other nasty stuff

4269
02:56:57,760 --> 02:57:02,979
they put in there yeah without a doubt

4270
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:05,200
and so I mean you please just to take a

4271
02:57:02,979 --> 02:57:07,149
step back and take a more macro view of

4272
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:09,579
the whole scene I've heard a few people

4273
02:57:07,149 --> 02:57:10,959
describe breeding in general as falling

4274
02:57:09,579 --> 02:57:13,000
into kind of two categories at the

4275
02:57:10,959 --> 02:57:15,369
moment we've kind of got you know you

4276
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:17,229
new school breeders who are you know

4277
02:57:15,370 --> 02:57:19,181
running with you know at your dose Eidos

4278
02:57:17,229 --> 02:57:20,890
and your Girl Scout cookies and all that

4279
02:57:19,181 --> 02:57:22,569
type of stuff and and that's got its own

4280
02:57:20,890 --> 02:57:24,310
merit and then you've got the other camp

4281
02:57:22,569 --> 02:57:26,829
which is more looking to delve into the

4282
02:57:24,310 --> 02:57:28,329
older work preservation work landrace

4283
02:57:26,829 --> 02:57:30,610
we're just working in that general

4284
02:57:28,329 --> 02:57:32,170
direction do you think this trend will

4285
02:57:30,610 --> 02:57:33,880
continue and if so do you think the

4286
02:57:32,170 --> 02:57:36,040
divide will get bigger between the two

4287
02:57:33,879 --> 02:57:37,600
schools because already I can see that

4288
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:39,760
it seems to be becoming more and more

4289
02:57:37,601 --> 02:57:41,860
present like more breeders become

4290
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:43,090
becoming more kind of known for working

4291
02:57:41,860 --> 02:57:44,680
with that old school stuff

4292
02:57:43,090 --> 02:57:46,120
less for working with the new school

4293
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:49,359
stuff and vice-versa for their

4294
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:53,829
counterparts yeah it's an interesting

4295
02:57:49,359 --> 02:57:57,670
thing man I think that um that they both

4296
02:57:53,829 --> 02:58:00,819
have their place I think that the kind

4297
02:57:57,670 --> 02:58:04,210
of the new school mindset is what it

4298
02:58:00,819 --> 02:58:09,159
kind of takes things in that bottleneck

4299
02:58:04,209 --> 02:58:11,769
direction of things being narrowed down

4300
02:58:09,159 --> 02:58:16,659
to these things that everyone can kind

4301
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:19,899
of agree are you know good in the market

4302
02:58:16,659 --> 02:58:25,090
the bag appeal the general like it's a

4303
02:58:19,898 --> 02:58:27,369
crowd pleaser kind of effect but then

4304
02:58:25,090 --> 02:58:29,439
you know I think it's very very

4305
02:58:27,370 --> 02:58:32,220
important for people to keep those old

4306
02:58:29,439 --> 02:58:36,880
genetics around because that's where

4307
02:58:32,219 --> 02:58:40,510
everything came from and people tend to

4308
02:58:36,879 --> 02:58:43,199
think of that in a vague sense like you

4309
02:58:40,510 --> 02:58:47,530
know while Girl Scout cookies you know

4310
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:49,120
40 years ago you know there was things

4311
02:58:47,530 --> 02:58:50,560
that turned into other things that

4312
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:52,510
turned into these things that turned

4313
02:58:50,559 --> 02:58:54,760
into cookies but like when I smell

4314
02:58:52,510 --> 02:58:56,978
cookies it's like I said it's it's an

4315
02:58:54,760 --> 02:59:00,159
Afghani to me and it has a little

4316
02:58:56,978 --> 02:59:02,709
something else so if you love cookies

4317
02:59:00,159 --> 02:59:07,209
you might be able to go grab a landrace

4318
02:59:02,709 --> 02:59:11,919
[ __ ] or a landrace a fee and go okay

4319
02:59:07,209 --> 02:59:13,989
well here's that same thing and it turns

4320
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:16,750
out it didn't take a whole lot of work

4321
02:59:13,989 --> 02:59:19,000
to arrive at this place where this stuff

4322
02:59:16,750 --> 02:59:21,129
is here so people think of like landrace

4323
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:23,829
and heirloom and old school as being

4324
02:59:21,129 --> 02:59:26,319
like this far-off thing from our

4325
02:59:23,829 --> 02:59:28,809
modern-day weed and in reality you can

4326
02:59:26,319 --> 02:59:31,659
take a lot of those old seeds I'm sure

4327
02:59:28,809 --> 02:59:34,809
you could go back and get seeds in 1900

4328
02:59:31,659 --> 02:59:36,430
or 1850 and you know if you still had

4329
02:59:34,809 --> 02:59:38,170
those and they were viable are you at a

4330
02:59:36,430 --> 02:59:40,420
time machine or whatever you could pop

4331
02:59:38,170 --> 02:59:42,700
them now and you'd go whoa look it's the

4332
02:59:40,420 --> 02:59:44,799
next og or it's the next whatever like

4333
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:48,010
I've never really been sold on this

4334
02:59:44,799 --> 02:59:50,739
whole concept of people doing these

4335
02:59:48,010 --> 02:59:52,989
crazy hybrids that all of a sudden give

4336
02:59:50,739 --> 02:59:55,898
you these new things that were unheard

4337
02:59:52,989 --> 02:59:56,940
of in the past I think that the old

4338
02:59:55,898 --> 02:59:59,550
genetics

4339
02:59:56,940 --> 03:00:01,710
have them right there just either just

4340
02:59:59,550 --> 03:00:04,220
under the surface or just right there

4341
03:00:01,709 --> 03:00:06,959
and the same population it's just that

4342
03:00:04,220 --> 03:00:09,149
nobody grows anything man everybody

4343
03:00:06,959 --> 03:00:11,489
grows the same things so they're

4344
03:00:09,149 --> 03:00:13,800
thinking like okay well I'm gonna use

4345
03:00:11,489 --> 03:00:16,530
this because it's the hot thing and not

4346
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:18,659
going back and going well hey dude did

4347
03:00:16,530 --> 03:00:20,159
you ever think that's why I'm excited to

4348
03:00:18,659 --> 03:00:25,050
see like what Bodhi is doing right now

4349
03:00:20,159 --> 03:00:27,209
and coastal because they're going back

4350
03:00:25,050 --> 03:00:30,510
into the old stuff to make new stuff

4351
03:00:27,209 --> 03:00:32,789
that you know I think I think in the

4352
03:00:30,511 --> 03:00:36,210
long term you know is gonna wind up

4353
03:00:32,790 --> 03:00:37,950
being there's gonna be some stuff that

4354
03:00:36,209 --> 03:00:39,630
comes out of there that's the new stuff

4355
03:00:37,950 --> 03:00:41,601
you know because there's no one else

4356
03:00:39,630 --> 03:00:44,069
doing it otherwise it's just basically

4357
03:00:41,601 --> 03:00:46,471
regurgitating other people's work as

4358
03:00:44,069 --> 03:00:48,810
it's like you know people make a cookies

4359
03:00:46,470 --> 03:00:50,761
cross and they're like look how resinous

4360
03:00:48,810 --> 03:00:53,729
it is I'm like wasn't cookies residence

4361
03:00:50,761 --> 03:00:55,290
though like did anything new happen here

4362
03:00:53,729 --> 03:00:57,149
are we just kind of doing this

4363
03:00:55,290 --> 03:01:00,061
everybody's doing the same thing it's

4364
03:00:57,149 --> 03:01:02,190
like it's like music you know and

4365
03:01:00,060 --> 03:01:04,529
everyone's doing down by the boardwalk

4366
03:01:02,190 --> 03:01:06,989
and it's just down by the boardwalk like

4367
03:01:04,530 --> 03:01:08,851
yeah it's old records but isn't this

4368
03:01:06,989 --> 03:01:09,239
just down by the boardwalk you know what

4369
03:01:08,851 --> 03:01:13,290
I mean

4370
03:01:09,239 --> 03:01:17,220
so III respect it both but I really

4371
03:01:13,290 --> 03:01:20,221
think that the modern guys really need

4372
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:24,479
to understand what the modern stuff is

4373
03:01:20,220 --> 03:01:27,209
it's just a good clone or a good cross

4374
03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:29,189
of something people have and I really

4375
03:01:27,209 --> 03:01:31,500
want to see people dig in and find all

4376
03:01:29,190 --> 03:01:34,980
the old stuff before it just doesn't

4377
03:01:31,500 --> 03:01:37,351
exist anymore you know yeah so I mean

4378
03:01:34,979 --> 03:01:39,449
with that in mind what old-school gems

4379
03:01:37,351 --> 03:01:42,181
have you got in the works first I mean

4380
03:01:39,450 --> 03:01:44,040
cuz you're known as someone who has you

4381
03:01:42,181 --> 03:01:46,771
know from time to time delved into their

4382
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:48,660
bag of goodies and I mean Bodi even

4383
03:01:46,771 --> 03:01:50,181
hinted at it saying that he likes he

4384
03:01:48,659 --> 03:01:52,591
likes all the old stuff you pull out

4385
03:01:50,181 --> 03:01:54,601
anything on the horizon you may be

4386
03:01:52,591 --> 03:01:56,159
thinking about popping maybe some new

4387
03:01:54,601 --> 03:01:58,860
schools some old school stuff gonna be

4388
03:01:56,159 --> 03:02:00,841
coming back you know I got a really

4389
03:01:58,860 --> 03:02:04,409
really neat collection of stuff that I

4390
03:02:00,841 --> 03:02:08,489
totally did not understand how neat it

4391
03:02:04,409 --> 03:02:10,739
was because at the time it was just like

4392
03:02:08,489 --> 03:02:12,809
these crosses of stuff people had given

4393
03:02:10,739 --> 03:02:15,209
me and I was like well I made the cross

4394
03:02:12,809 --> 03:02:17,459
but I'll just get back to Pier 1 and

4395
03:02:15,209 --> 03:02:19,199
then I didn't store him right because I

4396
03:02:17,459 --> 03:02:23,189
didn't want to grow them nobody wanted

4397
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:26,310
to grow them and then um you know I just

4398
03:02:23,190 --> 03:02:29,190
I knew like I know how to store seeds I

4399
03:02:26,309 --> 03:02:31,109
knew that I should and and I was just

4400
03:02:29,190 --> 03:02:33,170
like oh yeah whatever this is I

4401
03:02:31,110 --> 03:02:37,979
basically thought my stuff was trash

4402
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:41,489
because I was seeing other stuff or the

4403
03:02:37,978 --> 03:02:46,699
stuff that it had come from that was you

4404
03:02:41,489 --> 03:02:49,500
know either more consistent or more

4405
03:02:46,700 --> 03:02:52,770
marketable or whatever it was and then

4406
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:54,450
just the thing of mmm when things are

4407
03:02:52,770 --> 03:02:56,280
too close to you it's hard to see them

4408
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:58,979
it's hard to see the big picture like

4409
03:02:56,280 --> 03:03:01,050
you're used to it this is the you know

4410
03:02:58,978 --> 03:03:02,789
like I tell everybody whatever you smoke

4411
03:03:01,049 --> 03:03:05,939
all the time that's the Reggie that's

4412
03:03:02,790 --> 03:03:07,470
Rex you know like if you have it then

4413
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:10,290
you're gonna think it's Rex people who

4414
03:03:07,469 --> 03:03:11,819
only grow OG or like some of them still

4415
03:03:10,290 --> 03:03:13,260
like it but a lot of them are like I

4416
03:03:11,819 --> 03:03:15,478
kind of want to try something new

4417
03:03:13,260 --> 03:03:17,370
because this is just oh gee now and when

4418
03:03:15,478 --> 03:03:19,049
they first got it it was like oh my god

4419
03:03:17,370 --> 03:03:23,340
I got OG and now they're like you know

4420
03:03:19,049 --> 03:03:25,319
gee ok same old flavor so for me that's

4421
03:03:23,340 --> 03:03:28,020
how it was with the seeds that I had and

4422
03:03:25,319 --> 03:03:31,500
then it would be like oh this one's

4423
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:33,870
prone to PM or this one likes to mold or

4424
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:35,760
this one doesn't get tall enough and

4425
03:03:33,870 --> 03:03:37,650
then you make the hybrids and hybrids

4426
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:39,899
better so you don't plant the old seeds

4427
03:03:37,649 --> 03:03:42,539
and so man I got some seeds that

4428
03:03:39,899 --> 03:03:44,159
basically are still viable because I'm

4429
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:46,979
not saying I like store them in the

4430
03:03:44,159 --> 03:03:48,690
Attic in the heat they came up for 10

4431
03:03:46,978 --> 03:03:50,519
years but then all of a sudden I hit

4432
03:03:48,690 --> 03:03:52,620
like 12 years and they wouldn't come up

4433
03:03:50,520 --> 03:03:55,170
anymore they sprout a tail but they

4434
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:58,620
won't come out of the dirt and so I

4435
03:03:55,170 --> 03:04:00,690
basically need to link up with somebody

4436
03:03:58,620 --> 03:04:03,180
who and I have a couple leads right now

4437
03:04:00,690 --> 03:04:05,850
who can do the tissue culture where they

4438
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:08,550
either do the seeds and test-tubes with

4439
03:04:05,850 --> 03:04:10,440
the plant version of antibiotics that

4440
03:04:08,549 --> 03:04:13,920
prevent everything from attacking the

4441
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:16,100
seeds and and forming bacterial colonies

4442
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:19,909
and stuff while they're trying to sprout

4443
03:04:16,100 --> 03:04:22,109
and that give them a little extra

4444
03:04:19,909 --> 03:04:26,189
carbohydrates to replenish their

4445
03:04:22,109 --> 03:04:28,408
they're their stores and hormones to

4446
03:04:26,189 --> 03:04:30,449
really make them want to grow faster so

4447
03:04:28,408 --> 03:04:32,038
that they can really get out and then

4448
03:04:30,449 --> 03:04:34,408
there's another way you can do it where

4449
03:04:32,039 --> 03:04:37,319
you can actually cut the seat open get

4450
03:04:34,408 --> 03:04:40,078
inside the germ get viable cells and

4451
03:04:37,318 --> 03:04:42,748
grow them out as a callus in a petri

4452
03:04:40,078 --> 03:04:45,119
dish and then you can add hormones to

4453
03:04:42,748 --> 03:04:48,418
make those effectively become basically

4454
03:04:45,119 --> 03:04:51,418
like seeds or you can also encase the

4455
03:04:48,418 --> 03:04:53,279
cells through a process where you make

4456
03:04:51,418 --> 03:04:55,918
like artificial seeds and that's another

4457
03:04:53,279 --> 03:04:57,899
way to bring stuff back it does exist it

4458
03:04:55,918 --> 03:04:59,998
is practical it's been used for other

4459
03:04:57,898 --> 03:05:02,578
stuff I just have to find the right way

4460
03:04:59,998 --> 03:05:05,218
to do it and man I have some really neat

4461
03:05:02,578 --> 03:05:07,529
stuff I have the original f1 Paula

4462
03:05:05,218 --> 03:05:12,178
Nations that were the original black

4463
03:05:07,529 --> 03:05:15,349
line I have I have the old dirt purp

4464
03:05:12,179 --> 03:05:18,270
mark that I made you know stuff from 99

4465
03:05:15,349 --> 03:05:19,949
2000 2001 I have all this old stuff and

4466
03:05:18,270 --> 03:05:22,259
I have like a thousand of each and they

4467
03:05:19,949 --> 03:05:27,328
they're totally they're totally viable

4468
03:05:22,259 --> 03:05:29,369
I'm just afraid to risk losing losing

4469
03:05:27,328 --> 03:05:31,349
genetics out of them by trying to pop a

4470
03:05:29,369 --> 03:05:33,569
bunch only to get a few when I know that

4471
03:05:31,349 --> 03:05:36,238
in a laboratory they can come back so

4472
03:05:33,568 --> 03:05:38,578
that's one aspect of it the other aspect

4473
03:05:36,238 --> 03:05:40,978
of it is that I've been asking around to

4474
03:05:38,578 --> 03:05:43,588
four people and saying hey you know what

4475
03:05:40,978 --> 03:05:45,568
do you guys got who's got old seeds

4476
03:05:43,588 --> 03:05:47,849
still and there are some people and some

4477
03:05:45,568 --> 03:05:50,429
people don't want to part with them some

4478
03:05:47,849 --> 03:05:53,219
people don't want to share them even

4479
03:05:50,429 --> 03:05:55,259
though they have plenty and you know all

4480
03:05:53,218 --> 03:05:56,968
those I totally understand how when

4481
03:05:55,259 --> 03:05:59,638
people are where people are coming from

4482
03:05:56,968 --> 03:06:01,019
on stuff but like recently I scored this

4483
03:05:59,638 --> 03:06:05,548
one I don't know if you saw the post

4484
03:06:01,020 --> 03:06:07,588
that was the santa marta indica red vein

4485
03:06:05,549 --> 03:06:09,629
did you see those little plants yeah I

4486
03:06:07,588 --> 03:06:13,498
think I did I'm actually looking at them

4487
03:06:09,629 --> 03:06:15,599
now okay so so those ones there are a

4488
03:06:13,498 --> 03:06:17,568
really special one I you know I'm

4489
03:06:15,599 --> 03:06:20,549
talking to the guy and he's like yeah

4490
03:06:17,568 --> 03:06:24,179
1977 or 78 I get the santa marta cold

4491
03:06:20,549 --> 03:06:26,039
and i'm growing that and i in 1980 i go

4492
03:06:24,179 --> 03:06:27,838
to the bar and these guys smoke the best

4493
03:06:26,039 --> 03:06:29,429
joint i've ever tasted with me and

4494
03:06:27,838 --> 03:06:30,959
they're they're like he's like what is

4495
03:06:29,429 --> 03:06:33,418
that and they're like oh it's called

4496
03:06:30,959 --> 03:06:35,070
indica and then they give him like five

4497
03:06:33,418 --> 03:06:37,110
seeds and he crosses that one

4498
03:06:35,069 --> 03:06:38,761
the Santa Marta then you know a few

4499
03:06:37,110 --> 03:06:40,739
years five years later six years later

4500
03:06:38,761 --> 03:06:42,420
something he puts in the stuff that's

4501
03:06:40,739 --> 03:06:45,181
like what I call the perp that he called

4502
03:06:42,420 --> 03:06:46,890
the red veined because the stalks get

4503
03:06:45,181 --> 03:06:48,810
really red it's like you know you see it

4504
03:06:46,890 --> 03:06:51,899
like in DJ shorts blueberry except

4505
03:06:48,810 --> 03:06:54,060
instead of like instead of the purple of

4506
03:06:51,899 --> 03:06:55,619
it it's like red it's I think it's

4507
03:06:54,060 --> 03:06:57,779
different than what I call pert but it's

4508
03:06:55,620 --> 03:07:01,280
that same look of the where the stems

4509
03:06:57,780 --> 03:07:03,420
have color instead of being green and I

4510
03:07:01,280 --> 03:07:05,370
think it's what's in my black lime

4511
03:07:03,420 --> 03:07:07,860
honestly because it came from the same

4512
03:07:05,370 --> 03:07:09,360
area and it's really interesting because

4513
03:07:07,860 --> 03:07:11,851
there's these all these old things you

4514
03:07:09,360 --> 03:07:13,739
get and people tell you the story but

4515
03:07:11,851 --> 03:07:15,960
they only have the story they have you

4516
03:07:13,739 --> 03:07:18,390
know like I can't say without a doubt

4517
03:07:15,959 --> 03:07:20,039
that everything is only what is in it I

4518
03:07:18,390 --> 03:07:22,409
just know those things are in it for

4519
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:24,721
sure you know because back in the day

4520
03:07:22,409 --> 03:07:26,159
it's like oh this is so-and-so stuff and

4521
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:28,350
then you ask him what it is and he goes

4522
03:07:26,159 --> 03:07:29,729
no it's Afghani and you talked to him

4523
03:07:28,351 --> 03:07:31,710
years later and he goes oh no it's

4524
03:07:29,729 --> 03:07:34,739
Afghani and Burmese the Northern Lights

4525
03:07:31,709 --> 03:07:37,020
and you go oh okay it just behaves like

4526
03:07:34,739 --> 03:07:38,431
an Afghani so he called it an Afghani so

4527
03:07:37,021 --> 03:07:40,110
I know what it was cuz he thought I'm

4528
03:07:38,431 --> 03:07:42,390
just gonna grow them and grow dope you

4529
03:07:40,110 --> 03:07:44,159
know people don't know you have interest

4530
03:07:42,390 --> 03:07:46,920
in it so there's all these old things

4531
03:07:44,159 --> 03:07:49,670
that are like that and so that's what

4532
03:07:46,920 --> 03:07:52,261
I'm trying to track back down you know

4533
03:07:49,670 --> 03:07:54,181
but that's true that particular strain

4534
03:07:52,261 --> 03:07:57,060
you know he's like yeah test at 25

4535
03:07:54,181 --> 03:07:59,011
percent THC he goes I call it lemon Kush

4536
03:07:57,060 --> 03:08:00,479
I'm like there's other people who have

4537
03:07:59,011 --> 03:08:02,790
stuff called lemon cuz she's like well

4538
03:08:00,479 --> 03:08:04,379
name it for me man and then people will

4539
03:08:02,790 --> 03:08:06,511
know what it is and I'm like dude you

4540
03:08:04,379 --> 03:08:10,500
know I'm on social media I'm able to

4541
03:08:06,511 --> 03:08:13,140
show people stuff you know it's I know

4542
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:15,989
it's gonna be the bomb because this guy

4543
03:08:13,140 --> 03:08:19,529
is he's this old school dude who's like

4544
03:08:15,989 --> 03:08:23,940
an old school you know rock star party

4545
03:08:19,530 --> 03:08:25,950
animal badass dude from the area and you

4546
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:27,601
know he's I don't know how old he is I

4547
03:08:25,950 --> 03:08:29,820
don't want to date a mess being older

4548
03:08:27,601 --> 03:08:31,590
than his but you know he's like my mom

4549
03:08:29,819 --> 03:08:34,560
he's like 60 or something you know maybe

4550
03:08:31,590 --> 03:08:36,540
older maybe a little younger but he he

4551
03:08:34,560 --> 03:08:39,239
was a you know he was around growing

4552
03:08:36,540 --> 03:08:41,790
dope to get seeds in the 70s and he

4553
03:08:39,239 --> 03:08:43,649
didn't ever go he didn't ever do what I

4554
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:45,750
did with a lot of my stuff and go oh I'm

4555
03:08:43,649 --> 03:08:47,340
gonna cross this with OG or I'm gonna

4556
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:47,809
cross this with diesel or I'm gonna

4557
03:08:47,340 --> 03:08:49,520
cross

4558
03:08:47,809 --> 03:08:51,618
with our coal or I'm gonna cross this

4559
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:53,750
with whatever these clones are that came

4560
03:08:51,619 --> 03:08:56,659
floating around that everyone wanted you

4561
03:08:53,750 --> 03:08:58,790
know you try to make things be happening

4562
03:08:56,658 --> 03:09:00,469
for the time for the market for the

4563
03:08:58,790 --> 03:09:03,920
people who want to grow the seeds and

4564
03:09:00,469 --> 03:09:06,078
and be able to go and be able to have a

4565
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:07,879
reference you know like people want to

4566
03:09:06,078 --> 03:09:10,328
be able to tell people oh it's an OG

4567
03:09:07,879 --> 03:09:12,858
cross ok cool now they now people know

4568
03:09:10,328 --> 03:09:16,939
what to make of it when they show it to

4569
03:09:12,859 --> 03:09:18,619
them so it's old peer stuff I mean it's

4570
03:09:16,939 --> 03:09:20,658
not pure of course it's still a

4571
03:09:18,619 --> 03:09:23,960
three-way cross but it's a three-way

4572
03:09:20,658 --> 03:09:26,270
cross of strains that were around in the

4573
03:09:23,959 --> 03:09:29,419
70s and the early 80s and he's never

4574
03:09:26,270 --> 03:09:32,479
changed it and it's still tests at 25

4575
03:09:29,420 --> 03:09:34,908
percent THC and it's super resilient and

4576
03:09:32,478 --> 03:09:36,528
it gets huge yields and the weeds of

4577
03:09:34,908 --> 03:09:38,600
[ __ ] you smell the stem it smells like

4578
03:09:36,529 --> 03:09:41,060
gummy worms and now it's starting to

4579
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:43,818
develop into like a lemon-peel smell not

4580
03:09:41,059 --> 03:09:45,738
like a not like a lemony like what

4581
03:09:43,818 --> 03:09:49,039
people call lemon and we generally but

4582
03:09:45,738 --> 03:09:51,318
like real lemon peel and it's exciting

4583
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:54,199
to see when they were tiny little tiny

4584
03:09:51,318 --> 03:09:56,600
little sprouts they had more resin than

4585
03:09:54,199 --> 03:09:59,359
anything else in the greenhouse out of a

4586
03:09:56,600 --> 03:10:02,540
whole you know like five big tables full

4587
03:09:59,359 --> 03:10:03,828
of six inch pots so it's dead that's an

4588
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:05,540
exciting one that's something that I'm

4589
03:10:03,828 --> 03:10:07,879
doing something with and I asked him I'm

4590
03:10:05,540 --> 03:10:09,949
like dude do you know do I need to like

4591
03:10:07,879 --> 03:10:12,049
keep this tight or what he's on nah dude

4592
03:10:09,949 --> 03:10:15,710
blow it up popularize it put it out

4593
03:10:12,049 --> 03:10:17,750
there and you know so um I yeah so

4594
03:10:15,709 --> 03:10:18,948
that's one of those ones and then so you

4595
03:10:17,750 --> 03:10:21,559
know I've been trying to find things

4596
03:10:18,949 --> 03:10:24,050
that are like that and then you know for

4597
03:10:21,559 --> 03:10:27,469
me like a lot of my stuff it's just

4598
03:10:24,049 --> 03:10:29,448
worked poly hybrids so I made these poly

4599
03:10:27,469 --> 03:10:31,068
hybrids and then I bred them in

4600
03:10:29,449 --> 03:10:32,779
directions and now they're real strains

4601
03:10:31,068 --> 03:10:34,969
like they could have been there like

4602
03:10:32,779 --> 03:10:37,220
something you could have got from

4603
03:10:34,969 --> 03:10:40,368
someone back in the day that was a real

4604
03:10:37,219 --> 03:10:42,228
strain you know but as far as a lot of

4605
03:10:40,369 --> 03:10:44,420
the stuff that went into them it's not

4606
03:10:42,228 --> 03:10:48,738
you know it's not viable and so now

4607
03:10:44,420 --> 03:10:51,469
these these new true breeding hybrids

4608
03:10:48,738 --> 03:10:53,389
that I have they're like you know that's

4609
03:10:51,469 --> 03:10:54,948
where all this stuff is and honestly I

4610
03:10:53,389 --> 03:10:56,689
like the new ones better than the old

4611
03:10:54,949 --> 03:10:58,250
ones it's just I value the old ones

4612
03:10:56,689 --> 03:10:59,399
because they had other ways I could have

4613
03:10:58,250 --> 03:11:02,341
gone with them

4614
03:10:59,399 --> 03:11:03,779
yeah that's good well I think this

4615
03:11:02,341 --> 03:11:05,371
brings us to the last little bit where

4616
03:11:03,780 --> 03:11:08,311
we just got a few little quickfire

4617
03:11:05,370 --> 03:11:11,279
questions shall we blast through sure

4618
03:11:08,310 --> 03:11:16,261
Matt so first one what's your favorite

4619
03:11:11,280 --> 03:11:18,690
strain of all time ah man

4620
03:11:16,261 --> 03:11:20,581
I really liked this old-school stuff

4621
03:11:18,690 --> 03:11:23,310
that we thought was garlic but I don't

4622
03:11:20,581 --> 03:11:25,140
know if it was or not came through the

4623
03:11:23,310 --> 03:11:28,529
hog farm in the mid 90s it was

4624
03:11:25,140 --> 03:11:31,460
incredible it was just the most amazing

4625
03:11:28,530 --> 03:11:34,801
like definition of a broadleaf Afghani

4626
03:11:31,460 --> 03:11:38,100
the weed was completely solid white it

4627
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:40,680
was purple on the very inside the bud

4628
03:11:38,101 --> 03:11:42,569
actually was mostly like colorless

4629
03:11:40,681 --> 03:11:44,341
because it was so dense that light

4630
03:11:42,569 --> 03:11:47,761
didn't get in through the outside of the

4631
03:11:44,341 --> 03:11:50,791
bud after like a couple weeks in I never

4632
03:11:47,761 --> 03:11:53,220
got to grow it that was incredible

4633
03:11:50,790 --> 03:11:55,200
grymps grapes was incredible pissy

4634
03:11:53,220 --> 03:11:56,609
pungent favorito probably to this days

4635
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:59,670
we're not right up there with my

4636
03:11:56,610 --> 03:12:02,431
favorites as far as something that like

4637
03:11:59,671 --> 03:12:04,411
this is still around like what like

4638
03:12:02,431 --> 03:12:07,021
what's my favorite smoke what's my you

4639
03:12:04,411 --> 03:12:08,550
know like yeah if I had to only have one

4640
03:12:07,021 --> 03:12:11,971
thing probably something out of the

4641
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:14,760
black line the black line is for me

4642
03:12:11,970 --> 03:12:16,649
that's like just I don't know it's when

4643
03:12:14,761 --> 03:12:19,291
I smoke a lot that's what I want to

4644
03:12:16,649 --> 03:12:21,091
smoke black line you know so it's uh so

4645
03:12:19,290 --> 03:12:22,590
what's one strain that you used to have

4646
03:12:21,091 --> 03:12:29,371
but you've lost and you wish you could

4647
03:12:22,591 --> 03:12:31,291
get it back ah let me see like a seed

4648
03:12:29,370 --> 03:12:33,750
strain yeah I really liked the black

4649
03:12:31,290 --> 03:12:36,239
Afghani that I had that was really neat

4650
03:12:33,751 --> 03:12:40,319
I still have a bunch of the seeds they

4651
03:12:36,239 --> 03:12:42,001
just don't quite come up and that was a

4652
03:12:40,319 --> 03:12:44,989
neat one that I lost that I really

4653
03:12:42,001 --> 03:12:48,001
condemn like darn it I lost it and then

4654
03:12:44,989 --> 03:12:50,521
man the old my old Northern Lights clone

4655
03:12:48,001 --> 03:12:53,041
as far as a clone you thought was that

4656
03:12:50,521 --> 03:12:53,511
was really one that I just am bummed

4657
03:12:53,040 --> 03:12:57,090
about

4658
03:12:53,511 --> 03:12:58,681
yeah for sure all right here Tito you

4659
03:12:57,091 --> 03:13:01,319
brought up twice it must have been

4660
03:12:58,681 --> 03:13:03,860
special well it was it's it's a lot of

4661
03:13:01,319 --> 03:13:08,130
what the black line is is not cloned

4662
03:13:03,860 --> 03:13:10,291
okay yeah yeah so if you were just to

4663
03:13:08,130 --> 03:13:11,609
grow up and you could only have one pack

4664
03:13:10,290 --> 03:13:13,199
of seeds it's kind of

4665
03:13:11,610 --> 03:13:24,560
on the market which one pack would you

4666
03:13:13,200 --> 03:13:27,030
go with one pack of seeds jeez man

4667
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:28,529
you know I haven't grown a lot of people

4668
03:13:27,030 --> 03:13:30,989
seeds I know there's a lot of people

4669
03:13:28,530 --> 03:13:32,851
seeds who I might you know if I had that

4670
03:13:30,989 --> 03:13:35,011
if I had their stuff I might throw mine

4671
03:13:32,851 --> 03:13:36,601
away and I you know I haven't done a lot

4672
03:13:35,011 --> 03:13:38,341
of them and out of everything I've seen

4673
03:13:36,601 --> 03:13:42,690
I still I mean I'd have to say probably

4674
03:13:38,341 --> 03:13:44,640
like you know oh my lime one clone with

4675
03:13:42,690 --> 03:13:47,909
with something from it so just lime

4676
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:50,789
cross lime but as far as like from other

4677
03:13:47,909 --> 03:13:52,771
breeders dude I just don't I don't have

4678
03:13:50,790 --> 03:13:57,420
much reference I haven't grown a lot of

4679
03:13:52,771 --> 03:13:59,370
stuff from people and so it's kind of a

4680
03:13:57,420 --> 03:14:01,261
loaded question and that I'm gonna say

4681
03:13:59,370 --> 03:14:02,670
something from me because I'm so I'm

4682
03:14:01,261 --> 03:14:05,069
just not that experienced with seed

4683
03:14:02,670 --> 03:14:06,899
packs you know yeah no I understand

4684
03:14:05,069 --> 03:14:08,459
that's so good I'm sure I'm sure many

4685
03:14:06,899 --> 03:14:10,949
people would have picked you alarm cross

4686
03:14:08,459 --> 03:14:14,159
as well next one if you could go back to

4687
03:14:10,950 --> 03:14:19,320
one place in history and time to collect

4688
03:14:14,159 --> 03:14:21,750
see so what would they be and where man

4689
03:14:19,319 --> 03:14:29,159
for me I think I'd probably have to say

4690
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:33,091
like go back like probably to like the

4691
03:14:29,159 --> 03:14:38,670
50s and then go in the Hindu Kush region

4692
03:14:33,091 --> 03:14:42,210
and you know collect collect everything

4693
03:14:38,670 --> 03:14:44,761
there that was like what I know what I

4694
03:14:42,209 --> 03:14:46,590
saw here when I was growing up I know

4695
03:14:44,761 --> 03:14:48,649
that's the genetics you know it was

4696
03:14:46,591 --> 03:14:51,149
basically the Afghani before it got

4697
03:14:48,649 --> 03:14:55,050
before I got messed around with by

4698
03:14:51,149 --> 03:14:57,479
outside stuff and yeah okay you know

4699
03:14:55,050 --> 03:15:01,430
yeah back before anybody really brought

4700
03:14:57,479 --> 03:15:05,761
anything over yeah and so final question

4701
03:15:01,431 --> 03:15:07,620
which person or groups do you hold kind

4702
03:15:05,761 --> 03:15:11,601
of in the highest regard for the overall

4703
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:11,601
progression of cannabis throughout time

4704
03:15:12,148 --> 03:15:21,778
you know man

4705
03:15:18,498 --> 03:15:26,969
hippies for sure I gotta put hippies up

4706
03:15:21,779 --> 03:15:28,859
there because that's where you know a

4707
03:15:26,969 --> 03:15:31,318
lot of stuff happened in that part of

4708
03:15:28,859 --> 03:15:34,289
the counterculture coming from the you

4709
03:15:31,318 --> 03:15:36,448
know the 60s and the 70s and all those

4710
03:15:34,289 --> 03:15:39,659
people going through the 80s and the 90s

4711
03:15:36,449 --> 03:15:43,498
and all that but you know other than

4712
03:15:39,658 --> 03:15:46,288
that I'd say you know like um I really

4713
03:15:43,498 --> 03:15:48,629
think there's not enough value placed on

4714
03:15:46,289 --> 03:15:52,050
a lot of what people think of as

4715
03:15:48,629 --> 03:15:53,998
landrace in a lot of cases is from

4716
03:15:52,049 --> 03:15:55,799
places where the weed doesn't have to be

4717
03:15:53,998 --> 03:15:59,520
tended very much so people don't really

4718
03:15:55,799 --> 03:16:02,879
know that people are are influencing it

4719
03:15:59,520 --> 03:16:07,350
I think in places like Afghanistan and

4720
03:16:02,879 --> 03:16:10,969
Thailand and India and Africa I think

4721
03:16:07,350 --> 03:16:15,350
there was a lot of people who were

4722
03:16:10,969 --> 03:16:19,648
actually making selections in the field

4723
03:16:15,350 --> 03:16:22,559
and choosing which seeds got planted

4724
03:16:19,648 --> 03:16:26,430
over others and cutting plants they

4725
03:16:22,559 --> 03:16:28,019
didn't like and I think that I think a

4726
03:16:26,430 --> 03:16:31,889
lot of the land race stuff was actually

4727
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:34,078
being bred in a sense although you know

4728
03:16:31,889 --> 03:16:36,389
it's a land race cuz it's wild but I

4729
03:16:34,078 --> 03:16:39,059
think a lot of times it's it's wild

4730
03:16:36,389 --> 03:16:40,978
because people don't have to grow it but

4731
03:16:39,059 --> 03:16:44,368
they're still influencing the genetic

4732
03:16:40,978 --> 03:16:46,288
drift so you know basically the hippies

4733
03:16:44,369 --> 03:16:48,659
and all the you know those those are

4734
03:16:46,289 --> 03:16:51,449
those you know kind of counterculture

4735
03:16:48,658 --> 03:16:53,520
people and you know not to get too

4736
03:16:51,449 --> 03:16:56,399
specific basically just to kind of say

4737
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:58,649
yeah just like people who were like yeah

4738
03:16:56,398 --> 03:17:01,828
we're gonna smoke dope and hang out and

4739
03:16:58,648 --> 03:17:04,078
have a good time and enjoy life and

4740
03:17:01,828 --> 03:17:07,408
nature and the mountains and you know

4741
03:17:04,078 --> 03:17:09,090
and then those early people who kind of

4742
03:17:07,408 --> 03:17:11,010
get left out of the story like people

4743
03:17:09,090 --> 03:17:13,020
are like oh it was just good though good

4744
03:17:11,010 --> 03:17:14,189
weed was just good in Afghanistan it was

4745
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:16,199
just good in Thailand

4746
03:17:14,189 --> 03:17:18,328
I think people influence that you know

4747
03:17:16,199 --> 03:17:21,779
how to keep it from being hemp so I

4748
03:17:18,328 --> 03:17:23,699
think those you know those ain't more

4749
03:17:21,779 --> 03:17:25,800
ancient and traditional people and then

4750
03:17:23,699 --> 03:17:27,689
