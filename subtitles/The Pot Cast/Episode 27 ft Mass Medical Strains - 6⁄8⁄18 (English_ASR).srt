very excited to be here

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
so our deviant question from the first

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
question which is kind of becoming our

29
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,159
new first question what are you smoking

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
on at the moment

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
oh i actually just smoked on some star

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,118
people

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
that i grew

34
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,319
a couple months ago so it's really

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
really cute now

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,879
and it's a couple of my last mugs

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
because i

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,798
took a break from perpetual harvest so

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,239
i'm just like trying to make my last

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,159
stash last me until my next stuff but

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,679
yeah some star people i chopped in a

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
little bit early like eight weeks

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
instead of nine weeks so it was a little

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,719
bit racy but

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,559
really really tasty it's pretty much

46
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,118
been my favorite for the last

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
five years or so at least

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,280
and do you find that she kind of comes

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,399
into her prime at that point of curing

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,439
or it just happens to be where you're at

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,680
um i like it after about a month

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,359
month and a half yeah probably closer to

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,799
a month is like when it starts getting

54
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,959
like really really

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
really good um

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,719
but it's pretty tasty right off the bat

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,000
just because like

58
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,680
i don't know maybe because there's not

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,318
much chlorophyll it's like so purple

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,680
that like it it's got a unique flavor

61
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,039
pretty much when it's smokeable you know

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
yeah okay

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,878
and so you mentioned that you know you

64
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,199
took her eight weeks instead of nine

65
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,719
what is the range of the harvest window

66
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,318
for her like is it like somewhere

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,159
between eight and ten or just eight and

68
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,518
nine

69
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,120
um i pretty much always go nine weeks

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
with her because that's just what i

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
found is a sweet spot and i think that's

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,598
what pretty much everybody agrees is

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
like

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
right on nine weeks is perfect but

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,840
i don't know she was going a little bit

76
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,839
faster under the cobs so i chopped her

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,560
literally and it seems

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,800
pretty [ __ ] strong too so sometimes

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,878
under led i'll go just over eight weeks

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
and the cops seem to go even faster than

81
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,199
like the purples

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,158
and are you fully

83
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,238
sorry i was going to say are you

84
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,759
converted to the leds now or are you

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
just still toying around with it before

86
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,318
you transition

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
um i switched over most of my lights to

88
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,199
leds

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
and um

90
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:21,359
i've got a couple

91
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:24,079
uh i got cmhs and i got the ceramic hbs

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,879
from ortlocks that i'm testing out but

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
mostly led and i've been growing

94
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,079
for

95
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,519
years under different leds and stuff and

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
i've just always liked them a little bit

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
better than my hids

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,719
yeah okay

99
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,639
so

100
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,318
now if we jump back to our normal first

101
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,399
question what was your first experience

102
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,439
with cannabis

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,400
yeah this is a fun one so

104
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,400
um the first time i smoked was with a

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
friend from new york and

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,599
basically me and him were both thinking

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,039
about smoking weed because

108
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,878
um

109
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,798
at least for me i grew up

110
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,959
in kind of that mindset where like oh

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
you know weed is a drug and it's bad and

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,039
they taught you in school like

113
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,239
that it's a gateway drug and all that

114
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,560
crap so

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
initially i didn't think weed was like

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,318
anything i would ever touch and actually

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,319
one of my best friends like started

118
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,120
smoking weed when we were like

119
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,560
13 or 14 and then i didn't really like

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
hang out with him much after that

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,000
because i was like oh [ __ ] like he's a

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,439
bad person now and whatever and then a

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,519
few years later

124
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,360
i realized like damn a couple of my

125
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,758
older friends that i look up to that are

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,479
really smart and they're successful like

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,919
they smoke weed almost every single day

128
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,839
and they're awesome people like i

129
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,039
genuinely respect everything about them

130
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,198
like there's no way that wheat is bad

131
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
so i you know eventually i figured out

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,478
like weed is not that crazy ass drug

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
that they tell you like in

134
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,079
middle school and [ __ ] you know um

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
so

136
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,039
anyways

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,879
me and my friend

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,560
he came from new york to visit me for

139
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,240
like a week and he brought some weed and

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
he's like dude let's smoke i just smoked

141
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
last week for the first time and it's

142
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
awesome

143
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,520
so like we rolled up this joint it was

144
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,359
scentsy star he said and

145
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,038
i just remember like

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
we went deep into the woods because we

147
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,399
were all scared of getting caught and we

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,079
smoked it and

149
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,399
we came out of the woods and i was just

150
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,038
like waiting and i was like dude i'm not

151
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,000
seeing anything like where's the dragons

152
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,079
and [ __ ] flying around in my vision

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,959
he just started laughing he was like

154
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,719
you don't

155
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,159
see things it's not like that it's just

156
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
a feeling

157
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
and

158
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
so

159
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,759
i don't know i didn't feel anything

160
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
i wasn't

161
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,439
like i didn't know what the hell to

162
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,360
expect but i wasn't experiencing what i

163
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,800
expected and then

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
um

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
smoked a bunch of times after that

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
and i hadn't really been taught how to

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
inhale properly and then

168
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,918
um

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
actually i went to europe and i smoked a

170
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,120
few times there and still like you know

171
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
nothing really happened but i was like

172
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,079
yeah i like smoking you know it's chill

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,039
and it doesn't really do anything it's

174
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,560
fine

175
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,560
so i just smoked my friend and then

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
this is awesome my friend that i was

177
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
staying with in germany he gave me this

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
dvd and he was like dude you gotta watch

179
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,759
this video it's [ __ ] awesome and i

180
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,919
was like all right sure like i'll get to

181
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
it eventually and i never ended up

182
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,359
watching it and you kept asking me to

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,120
watch it and i was just like

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,319
yeah i forgot like i'll watch it

185
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
tomorrow

186
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,479
and then so i get home and i brought the

187
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
video home and i open it up

188
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,240
and there's like 2 grams of wheat in

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
there and i flew back with it not even

190
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
knowing

191
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,600
so

192
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,120
um and then this was awesome this is

193
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
where i actually got high for the first

194
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,519
time so i just learned how to properly

195
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,359
inhale and i rolled up two joints of it

196
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,599
and

197
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,160
i it was night time i just smoked both

198
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,520
of them to my face by myself and all of

199
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,039
a sudden it [ __ ] hit me like a train

200
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,719
and it just felt like

201
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,159
this feeling watch over me and i

202
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
immediately just thought i was going to

203
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,680
die and i was just freaking out like the

204
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
whole entire night i was just by myself

205
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
and then

206
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,879
like i thought i was giving myself

207
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,879
surgery at one point like it was

208
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,319
ridiculous because i just smoked way too

209
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,560
much and like

210
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,439
it just hit me super hard

211
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,360
and

212
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,879
that was a crazy memorable time just

213
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
because like the music that i listened

214
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,199
to that night just like stuck with me in

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
this special way and like i just

216
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
realized like damn this is some powerful

217
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,198
[ __ ] like

218
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
i stopped i didn't smoke after that for

219
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,120
a couple weeks and i don't know why i

220
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
even tried again but i ended up liking

221
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,160
it a lot after that

222
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,639
and so would you say that was the point

223
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
when you kind of really got into it or

224
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,879
like were you still sporadic in your

225
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:46,159
usage for a while

226
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,079
it was about it was a gradual thing like

227
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
i probably smoked once a week or once

228
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,439
every

229
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,199
couple weeks or something and then

230
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,560
just gradually got more into it like

231
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,038
when i started realizing there's

232
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,800
different strains and stuff and like ooh

233
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,079
this weed i like and the sweet i don't

234
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
like and like

235
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,359
this one has a different taste and stuff

236
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,799
like that like it started getting pretty

237
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
interesting

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,439
and

239
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
i don't know i didn't really think too

240
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,399
much about it because i was young but i

241
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,759
guess i just liked it for whatever

242
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,519
reason so

243
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,199
just kept smoking it

244
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,680
more and more

245
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
and so outside of the uh the scentsy

246
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,959
star you mentioned initially what were

247
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,799
some of the other strains that were

248
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,638
going around in that earliest times like

249
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
most notably you mentioned some of them

250
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,519
were catching your attention do you

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,720
remember specifically or was it just

252
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,838
kind of like the kind bud type of thing

253
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,800
yeah i remember a few different times um

254
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,800
like the best one that one of the best

255
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,120
smokes i've had in my life was way back

256
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,958
then it was this blueberry

257
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,039
and i got it twice

258
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,518
and i never ever got it again after that

259
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,000
but i remember it so distinctly

260
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,560
it just had this amazing like everything

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,159
about it the fur the texture like it was

262
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,039
cured really nice and i don't even know

263
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,879
like

264
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,639
anything about curing but i just knew

265
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,278
like damn the consistency of this it's

266
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,838
like juicy but it's not wet and it's

267
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,159
sticky as hell and it's like so

268
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,399
delicious and i was so good

269
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,240
and i've been growing blueberry plants

270
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,399
all the time looking for the hispino and

271
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,120
just never finding it but

272
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
whatever that was i'm still searching

273
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
that was

274
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
one of my favorites and then smaller i

275
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,480
mean

276
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,799
we got like cushion haze which were just

277
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,039
called kush and haze like there there

278
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,719
wasn't much of a name to it i remember

279
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,958
like my dealer was like yeah kush is

280
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,040
when it's good and haze is when it's not

281
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,359
so good and so i bought the haze and i

282
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,319
was like dude i love the haze

283
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
and turns out now like i'm really big

284
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,278
into cedivas

285
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,640
and back then i didn't even know there

286
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,639
was like different

287
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,240
indicas and sativas and the facts i just

288
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,759
knew there was like different names to

289
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,879
it and i never believed the name because

290
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,439
i didn't know if he was making it up but

291
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,360
that haze was pretty good stuff

292
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,680
yeah um

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,680
some ak-47

294
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,640
yeah okay

295
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,679
i mean that blueberry comment you made

296
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,278
is one we hear a lot it's almost like

297
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,039
you know blueberry is so prolific but

298
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,799
it's also like it's no one can really

299
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:16,639
find that one cut at the same time

300
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,719
yeah it's elusive for sure and um

301
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,519
i've noticed i've grown

302
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
blueberry from a few different breeders

303
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,278
and

304
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
i got one where it had that high and

305
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,039
maybe even had a better high

306
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
it was like one of the best highs ever

307
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,399
and it was every single time you smoked

308
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
it you just felt like how you felt when

309
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
you were like

310
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,278
10 years old like so pure and so amazed

311
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
and everything's so perfect and fun and

312
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,759
interesting like just the best mood ever

313
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,879
and super nostalgic

314
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,958
and

315
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,078
but the flavor was [ __ ] horrible and

316
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,319
it wasn't blueberry it was just like

317
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,239
something really good but it wasn't the

318
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,600
plant that i'm looking for

319
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,278
and

320
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,399
now i'm digging into

321
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,320
some clones from different people

322
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,480
so there's this one from new york which

323
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,120
i'm hoping is the one because a lot of

324
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,759
bud from new york comes up here but

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,120
we really know as we'll see

326
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,278
yeah okay

327
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,078
that's interesting you say that because

328
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,919
i often have thought to myself when dj

329
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,159
first made blueberry

330
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,679
how how long did it sit there before

331
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,600
they realized it was blueberry because i

332
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,278
can only imagine they didn't find the

333
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
insane blueberry fino in the first

334
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,480
couple of seeds they popped and so i

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
wouldn't be surprised you know what i

336
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,879
mean like i i think that more likely

337
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,479
than not they didn't know there was the

338
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,480
blueberry phenos in there for a while

339
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,559
yeah that's a good point i'm not really

340
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,759
sure like

341
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,759
um

342
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,078
i don't know how consistent his stock

343
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,240
was back then there is now or like

344
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,239
if his goal was the blueberry or if he

345
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,159
just found the blueberry and then kept

346
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
going with it or whatever like he said

347
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,120
there could have been all kinds of other

348
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,399
stuff in there too

349
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
yeah okay

350
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,278
so

351
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,600
obviously topic near and dear to the

352
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:05,278
heart of this show chem dog you know

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,278
you're in mass did you ever see it

354
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,720
dude so actually i'm not that into chem

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,200
personally but i've smoked something

356
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,519
grown by him apparently

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,440
and it was [ __ ] really strong because

358
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,959
i smoked one hit and i forgot i even

359
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,320
smoked and i was like what the [ __ ] is

360
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,078
happening to me

361
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,278
and then like i remembered that i smoked

362
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,799
it was just like it was such an

363
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,399
experience

364
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,000
um

365
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
and

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
one of my

367
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,760
kind of friends more of just an

368
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,079
acquaintance like a friend of a friend

369
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,120
apparently his dad is best friends with

370
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,719
captain dog and i was like [ __ ]

371
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,078
i can't tell this dude that i grow

372
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,839
because i don't really tell anybody

373
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,278
locally that i grow especially if i

374
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,720
don't know them well or like i think

375
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,240
they're baby and this kid is kind of

376
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
shady so i was like

377
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,720
i can't tell him that i grow like how

378
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,638
how do i get to meet kem without

379
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,879
dropping the fact that i'm a breeder and

380
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
stuff because i was just liking it so i

381
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,200
haven't

382
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,958
uh ran into him personally yet but i'm

383
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,399
growing a few different chemicals right

384
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,879
now so

385
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
we'll see what's what but i don't know

386
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,838
i'm

387
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,679
it's good wheat for sure but it's not

388
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,480
exactly my taste

389
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,319
so

390
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,159
i've never been super duper into it

391
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,680
personally

392
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,919
yeah no it's interesting it's a very

393
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,278
polarizing type of weed isn't it like

394
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,719
what is it about it that you're not a

395
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,159
fan of i think the most common thing

396
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,959
people say is it's just so

397
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,319
non-functional in many respects

398
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,000
all right yeah i'd probably agree with

399
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
that it's not very

400
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,559
functional it just kind of [ __ ] you up

401
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,000
and i don't know there's a lot of weed

402
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,039
that has that effect for me where it

403
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,720
just feels like damn i'm [ __ ] up like

404
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,879
and that's not what i'm looking for i

405
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,000
don't smoke to get [ __ ] up i smoke to

406
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:49,278
feel good i smoke to

407
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,600
relax i smoke to focus i smoke to feel

408
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,679
better whatever it is but i don't really

409
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
smoke to feel like i'm on drugs

410
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,159
specifically i mean sometimes like a

411
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
real nice trippy high is nice but

412
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,799
i don't know

413
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
i'm not trying to just feel like

414
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,479
debilitated

415
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,759
yeah i know what you mean it can be a

416
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
bit full on

417
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,600
so last one i've gotta ask about did you

418
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,599
ever see the mass super skunk grown up

419
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,959
i have not personally no

420
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,959
i wish

421
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,759
oh that's a bummer it's still like such

422
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,078
a small kind of select period an area

423
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,120
when it was around i think

424
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,359
yeah

425
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,440
i'll have to ask a few people about that

426
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
but yeah i haven't came across it i

427
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,279
don't know if anybody has it around here

428
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,919
if it's long gone

429
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,320
yeah i mean people say it's around but i

430
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,159
haven't seen it so i'd love to see it

431
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
anyway we kind of get back on track for

432
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,240
a second when did you kind of start to

433
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,838
grow yourself you know and more

434
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,560
importantly what were the first strains

435
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,560
you were growing out

436
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,078
yeah so

437
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,839
basically i always like like i told you

438
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,120
how i used to have the impression that

439
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,120
weed was like this really bad thing so

440
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
i also thought like if you grow you're

441
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
just the worst like you don't grow

442
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,879
you're gonna go to prison like growing

443
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,278
is very bad like it's it's a lot worse

444
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,720
than smoking so for a while i never even

445
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,639
thought about it

446
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
and then

447
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,720
one time it was funny it was actually my

448
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,639
mom she was like

449
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
she knows that i smoke and she's fine

450
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
with it but she was like scared i was

451
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,000
gonna get some lace sweet or something

452
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
and she was like you should grow i was

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,559
like

454
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,159
you think i should grow really like i've

455
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,278
been thinking about it but i thought it

456
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,958
was like

457
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,559
so dangerous and she's like now just

458
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,838
grow it's safer for you and blah blah

459
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,758
blah

460
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,639
i ended up growing because of that like

461
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,399
that was the final push

462
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,600
and basically

463
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,198
let's see well the first plants i grew

464
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
was

465
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,479
the seeds that actually led to star

466
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,159
pupil

467
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
and my friends had given me a bunch of

468
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,639
seeds and

469
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,800
basically they were thai and afghani

470
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
and he didn't really know anything about

471
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,278
him at all and i didn't know anything

472
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,959
about

473
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,958
anything really like

474
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,719
i just like i'll plant them in some solo

475
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,559
cups like you said to do and i put them

476
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
on my windowsill

477
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,958
and then

478
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
eventually like they were getting all

479
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,239
stringy and my friend was like dude you

480
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,278
gotta get that under light or put it

481
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,799
outside

482
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,799
and i was like

483
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,639
all right i went to a grocery store and

484
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
they were like are you a badger flower

485
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,278
and i was like i don't know man i just

486
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
need a light like i i did so much

487
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,399
reading and nothing made any sense to me

488
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
but i was just like

489
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,600
you know they're in they're in the cups

490
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
and they're

491
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,680
five inches tall but they're not doing

492
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,199
they're not growing fast and i had them

493
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,078
for like almost two months and they're

494
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,838
like

495
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,519
they look like two-week old season

496
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,480
so i got a light

497
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,639
put them in a closet and

498
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,720
i only had six plants so

499
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,000
um i ended up putting one of them

500
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
planting it out in the woods and the

501
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,360
rest of them that flowered out indoors

502
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
and

503
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,839
one of them was a male and by this point

504
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,039
i was obsessed like by the time they

505
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,880
were actually

506
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,278
getting to flower i was reading every

507
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,198
single day about growing and asking my

508
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,439
friends and learning stuff like

509
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,038
my friend told me um

510
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
that you could put fan on them to make

511
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,000
them stronger like you know because the

512
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,759
wind and stuff

513
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,558
and that just blew my mind because i was

514
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,439
like

515
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,678
people know [ __ ] about growing weed like

516
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,199
it was i didn't realize that there was

517
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
knowledge up there

518
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,318
and then

519
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
i just started getting obsessed and i

520
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,519
would like talk to people every day and

521
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,120
read and learn

522
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,639
and then so i was like all right i'm

523
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,558
even going to make some seeds it seems

524
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
easy enough so

525
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,639
each plant i just may see like one

526
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,240
bottom branch but i was mainly just

527
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
focusing on growing the plants because

528
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,759
like i said i had one male

529
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
and then

530
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,879
yeah so

531
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,640
one of the plants i actually named it

532
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
star pupil because it was super

533
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
symmetrical and it just looked so

534
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,120
awesome

535
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,038
and then so i just named each plant

536
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,678
something they just had funny names and

537
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,558
stuff and

538
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
um

539
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,279
basically i grew those out they were

540
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,759
awesome

541
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,440
the star pupil was like this half purple

542
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,279
half green kind of it's not the exact

543
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,720
star people i have now but it's the

544
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,720
mother to it

545
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
um but anyways it was

546
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
really nice it finished in 52 days and i

547
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
remember reading

548
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,599
that everything had to go eight weeks

549
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,840
that's just what i thought was like why

550
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,918
is it done sooner and why is this tall

551
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,599
one not finished yet and i had to let it

552
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,960
go longer and like

553
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,719
i was reading every day but there was

554
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,079
just so much to learn

555
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,319
and

556
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,079
so i harvested those and i smoked them

557
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,038
and cured them and saved the seeds off

558
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,240
each one labeled separately and all that

559
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,720
and then

560
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,880
my next run i was like all right autumn

561
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
flowers i've been reading autoflowers

562
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
are the best i can't wait to grow a song

563
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
and i ordered some

564
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,960
and i grew them and i was just like

565
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,480
what the [ __ ] is this

566
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,720
i was so disappointed with the

567
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,038
autoflowers in comparison to like the

568
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,600
first plants that i grew that was like

569
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,679
so amazing and super strong and they all

570
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,279
had their own unique character and then

571
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,519
i grew like four different strands of

572
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,918
autos that i purchased so i knew the

573
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,240
strain names and i was like

574
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,240
is blue dream and northern lights

575
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,079
the same as blueberry bliss like i don't

576
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,919
get it they're all the same

577
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,678
and i was like

578
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,919
i don't know if it's the autos or

579
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,519
strange or [ __ ] or what but i was

580
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,559
just figuring [ __ ] out so i was like all

581
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,400
right

582
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,839
i really like that star people playing

583
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,080
i'm just gonna grow a bunch of seeds

584
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,319
that i made off of that and then one of

585
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,000
them ended up being my star people and

586
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,439
i've been keeping the clone of her ever

587
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,839
since

588
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,679
so the the star people that you offer

589
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:35,199
now is that like an f2 of the initial

590
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,200
strain you made or where's it at

591
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,879
so that's actually an s1 the seeds that

592
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,000
i released and um

593
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
the thing is

594
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,119
i had this star people clone and i've

595
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,279
been growing it and it was super good

596
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,279
and i was like what if my clones don't

597
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:53,279
make it and what if i [ __ ] up and lose

598
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:56,000
it like i better make some seeds and

599
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,759
so i was like how do i get it

600
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
what's what's the best way to make seeds

601
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,558
of this like i just want this plant i

602
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,319
don't want to cross with anything else

603
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,079
because it might be worse or better or

604
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,038
different but i want this like this is

605
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,359
awesome

606
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,200
so i learned about like making feminized

607
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,558
seeds and how you could trust the plant

608
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
to themselves

609
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,200
and so basically

610
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,798
i made us ones of it and some people are

611
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,319
saying like if you grow out s once

612
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,359
they're going to be the exact same as

613
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,200
the mom

614
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,399
and other people were saying no they're

615
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,279
going to be all over the place and

616
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,120
they're going to hurt them and they're

617
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,639
going to suck i was like [ __ ] it i'll

618
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,000
just try it

619
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,000
and honestly i got really lucky that

620
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,200
for whatever reason when you s1 the star

621
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,440
pupil every single plant is like spot on

622
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,519
to the star pupils super super close to

623
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,519
the mother so

624
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,400
that's what um that's what the star

625
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,158
pupil seats are and then

626
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
since then obviously i got into actual

627
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
breeding and making regular seeds and

628
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,480
doing some line work and stuff like that

629
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,558
but starter pupil seeds they're always

630
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
just s ones because it's like

631
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,720
the most perfect representation of the

632
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,960
bomb

633
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
yeah that's awesome and so are you

634
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,558
considering doing like a back cross or

635
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,159
even like a cubing process down the line

636
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,480
yeah i'm actually working on some right

637
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,400
now and they're all

638
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,000
in seedling stage right now so i'm just

639
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,559
waiting to see what they do basically

640
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,240
and go from there um

641
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,918
i've done a lot of different outcrosses

642
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
and stuff and i'm working on some back

643
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,240
crosses and some femme back crosses with

644
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,200
a nice s1 that i found

645
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
and

646
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,440
just messing around with different

647
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
things to see what i can come up with

648
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,720
and so if you were to kind of think long

649
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,360
term about it and you were going to do

650
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,679
maybe an extended back crossing project

651
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,599
with the idea that the initial mail you

652
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,360
use is probably not going to be really

653
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,678
present after a few back crosses but

654
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,279
maybe some of the characteristics from

655
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,840
it could be like maybe things you could

656
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,918
improve on the star pupil with that in

657
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,599
mind what type of things would you be

658
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,600
looking for to bring you know if you

659
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,359
were going to do say a cube project you

660
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,719
know what is something maybe a male

661
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,359
could bring to the table that would be

662
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,519
an improvement

663
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,240
yeah definitely um

664
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,879
something that i like about a lot of the

665
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,919
other plants that i've created is that

666
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,159
um like for example the pu tang has a

667
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,080
really really nice stretch where you can

668
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,159
veg that thing to be like four and a

669
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,480
half tall and then you flower it and

670
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,679
it's like four and a half feet tall with

671
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,599
like

672
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,840
a [ __ ] ton of branches and it's just

673
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,000
like this monster plant where you don't

674
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,519
really have to veg it that long so

675
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,839
i would probably put something like that

676
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,240
into it just like some more vigor

677
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,599
um shorten up the veg time a little just

678
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,159
because that's the style that i usually

679
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,558
agree with for other stuff

680
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,960
um and then

681
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,399
it yields pretty good but you could i

682
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,200
mean i probably try to add a little bit

683
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
of yield to it

684
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,798
is yield something you consider when

685
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,678
you're breeding or is it really like a

686
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,599
peripheral consideration

687
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,080
um yield is

688
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,519
not too important but

689
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,439
i don't want to say i don't care about

690
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,918
it because if something yields really

691
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,558
low i'm gonna toss it unless it's just

692
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,640
super super special um

693
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,399
like the rick's pupil is my low sealing

694
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
strain which i don't even offer anymore

695
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
but it's such a

696
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,599
really good smoke so

697
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,879
um

698
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,158
it was worth you've been around for a

699
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,600
while

700
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,640
and then i kind of made things that i

701
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,038
think

702
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,280
were a little bit better and yielded a

703
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,919
lot better so it's like all right

704
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,519
um you know rick's people like

705
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,000
people who want it they can get it like

706
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,839
i'll make more as freebies but

707
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,839
i like everything to at least have like

708
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,678
a medium to high yield depending on what

709
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,359
it is but

710
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,200
the main thing that i really breed for

711
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,278
is like the vibe implant

712
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,080
how it is when you smoke it like what

713
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,159
you've

714
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,639
what you feel when you smoke it what you

715
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,520
experience how you feel after you smoked

716
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,038
it like you know some stuff you can

717
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,519
smoke it you feel great and then

718
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,960
afterwards you feel super drained and

719
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,200
shitty and

720
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,038
i don't even like that

721
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,480
i like something where you can smoke it

722
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,960
you enjoy it

723
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
and then you come down and you can

724
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
you know like

725
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,159
exist you don't have to smoke again to

726
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,759
feel good like you can you might even

727
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
feel better

728
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,679
after you've smoked it like you might

729
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,440
have a nice experience where you're like

730
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,960
life is [ __ ] awesome like i feel

731
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,558
uplifted now

732
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
even after you're not high anymore like

733
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,440
that's the kind of stuff i like stuff

734
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,440
that just leaves you feeling really good

735
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,038
and so out of your lineup what do you

736
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,880
think best represents that

737
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,278
um

738
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
probably the star pupil especially from

739
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,640
the feedback that i've been getting from

740
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,039
people lately like

741
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,799
it kind of blows my mind because

742
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,558
i really like it as a plant but i know

743
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,480
that everyone's different so every time

744
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,798
somebody else likes it as much as i do

745
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,839
it's like really really cool

746
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,480
um

747
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,918
besides the star pupil

748
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,759
i have

749
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,240
a couple of sativas like the deadly

750
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,599
sativa is really really powerful

751
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
and

752
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,918
that one's too much for local but if you

753
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,799
smoke a very small amount of it super

754
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,640
super uplifting and refreshing

755
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,278
and then

756
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,520
the prayer pupil for sure like i still

757
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,240
remember the first time that i smoked

758
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,400
that 33 vino that i got

759
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,640
and that was just such an uplifting

760
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,559
experience and like actually the old

761
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,960
timer's hey zoo it was a great night i

762
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,558
was up all night and smoked it at 10 and

763
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,720
probably stayed up till like six in the

764
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:32,240
morning from that [ __ ] and it was like

765
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,679
i like the stuff where you smoke it and

766
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,839
you make memories you know like you

767
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,840
remember when you smoked that strain

768
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,720
because it was so unique or such a good

769
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,639
time whatever not just like

770
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
something that blends in with the rest

771
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,919
and you fell asleep on couch or

772
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
something like that's not fun

773
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,360
old time is haze that's an interesting

774
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,278
one we don't hear about too much do you

775
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:59,839
plan on releasing any crosses with that

776
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,599
um i'm not sure so i made the cross just

777
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,839
to see what would happen because it was

778
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,639
a crazy plant you know like

779
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,558
took them 17 weeks of flower and then 19

780
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
for the green peanut

781
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,599
and i really like that 17-week purple

782
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
female

783
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,759
um

784
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,558
so

785
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,000
i made a few different beans on them and

786
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,440
i wasn't really thinking of releasing

787
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,278
them because i was just like these are

788
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,519
gonna be wacky or people aren't gonna

789
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,759
want this like you know the saying how

790
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,038
everyone says oh i want a really gnarly

791
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,720
sativa and then the other dude says no

792
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,359
you actually don't you just think you

793
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,640
want that it's always true like

794
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,959
when you get to that point where you're

795
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,159
like here these seeds will take 17 weeks

796
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,079
to flower you want to grow them

797
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,960
everybody says no even though they ask

798
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,199
for it until that point so

799
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,159
it's kind of like

800
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
people

801
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,039
people think they want it and i don't

802
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
know if they actually do

803
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,759
but

804
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,119
i made them kind for myself and for my

805
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,599
friends to dig through and see what

806
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,119
happens but i ended up getting a lot of

807
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,879
beans off them

808
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,439
off the magoo cross because that was a

809
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,240
pretty big plant so

810
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,840
maybe i mean i've only seen a few of

811
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,359
them grown out i'd like to see more of

812
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,480
them grown out and i got to grow some

813
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,319
myself

814
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,839
um because my friends have been growing

815
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,439
them so

816
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,519
yeah i want to see what those do and

817
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
then we'll go from there

818
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,398
they might become available i gave out

819
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,479
some as freebies so we'll see and then

820
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,558
the star people ultimate days those are

821
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,558
just for me and friends so

822
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,240
i've got some of those uh just starting

823
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,678
to flower now and i'm hoping to find

824
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,440
some cool clone only purple haze kind of

825
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,360
pupil haze whatever we'll see what

826
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,440
happens really

827
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,599
yeah that sounds interesting i mean just

828
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,278
out of curiosity with those old-timer

829
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,879
blue magoo crosses what did the

830
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,240
flowering time work out to be because

831
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
something i've noticed from toying

832
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,720
around with the magoo myself is it's

833
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,200
such a consistent eight week plan and so

834
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,558
when you pair it with that 17 weaker

835
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,319
does it just meet in the middle or do

836
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,639
you get some that just fall all over the

837
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,359
spectrum

838
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,640
um well like i said i've only seen a few

839
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,599
of them so far

840
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,520
and

841
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,759
basically it seems like there's a magoo

842
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,918
dominant fino that goes a little faster

843
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,679
but it's probably some kind of 10 12

844
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,759
weekish thing

845
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,278
and then the haze one

846
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,200
seems to be like

847
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,278
i think it's around 14 weeks or

848
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
something so it is a little bit shorter

849
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,359
but it's still super long so we kind of

850
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,360
met in the middle a little bit

851
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,158
yeah but i don't know how much variation

852
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,079
is going to actually be in those

853
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,278
okay and so if we just loop back to a

854
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,960
point you made a moment ago you

855
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,119
mentioned you enjoyed professor p's

856
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,798
photography are you into photography

857
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,599
slash would you want to get into it more

858
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,519
so eventually

859
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,798
yeah i'm definitely super into

860
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,918
photography

861
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,240
and

862
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,278
um he's definitely an inspiration of

863
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,000
mine

864
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,159
when it comes to photographing cannabis

865
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,079
plants and flowers and all that

866
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,640
um i've just always been drawn to the

867
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,720
way that he captures the flower

868
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,038
and the lighting like it's really hard

869
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,759
to get good lighting compared to just

870
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,119
like

871
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,000
average lighting like if you want to

872
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,759
make it look like one of his photos

873
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,679
you got to take 100 shots and got to be

874
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,278
moving two or three flashes around and

875
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,640
really like

876
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,319
trying hard and like that i like just

877
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,320
when you see a flower and then you try

878
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,278
to portray it the best way you possibly

879
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,960
can

880
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,038
that's really cool

881
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
and it's a lot of fun to me i'm usually

882
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,679
taking pictures in the garden almost

883
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
every day and i post way too much on

884
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,759
instagram

885
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
but

886
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,798
i don't know a lot of times i have asked

887
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,319
it because

888
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,839
i'm just trying to show the plant and i

889
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,599
don't take the plant out and put it in

890
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,918
front of a black background every single

891
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,519
day but i like the changes day to day

892
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,880
and flowers i'm always

893
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,519
shooting photos of everything i think

894
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,679
yeah so do you think there's a

895
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,480
really strong kind of link between

896
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,640
having good photos and like sales

897
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,159
because one might assume so but you also

898
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
might think oh there's some pretty big

899
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,320
name guys who don't really take good

900
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,000
photos so to speak

901
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,839
oh you know what's crazy is that a lot

902
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,839
of my half-assed cell phone pictures

903
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,918
that i post will end up getting like one

904
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,678
or two thousand likes and then i'll take

905
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,200
a photo that took me an hour to get the

906
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,080
perfect shot and it will get like 190

907
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
likes and like zero comments so

908
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,199
i don't know like i don't know what

909
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,559
people are looking for because i think

910
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,640
they're looking for some different

911
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,558
things in the photos compared to what

912
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,000
i'm looking for but

913
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,918
um that's why

914
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,599
i've been posting like

915
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,440
whatever photos

916
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,038
i take like some of them are just shitty

917
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,320
phone pictures

918
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,919
and

919
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,519
people love them for whatever reason

920
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,759
maybe because it's even more real it's

921
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,119
more of a real experience they feel like

922
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,398
damn that's what it would look like in

923
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,158
my garden

924
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,119
if i was looking at it like that's not

925
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,559
some

926
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,959
crazy high-def camera and photoshop and

927
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,639
unreal expectations like

928
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,640
like the modeling industry you know how

929
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,278
everything's like fake so maybe they

930
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,360
like seeing the real stuff more

931
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,798
and so i mean if we look at the opposite

932
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,759
end of what you were just talking about

933
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,000
how do you feel about breeders who

934
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,759
outright photoshop i mean do you think

935
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
like if whatever people want to do with

936
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,720
their photos that's cool by you or do

937
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,919
you think it should really kind of be a

938
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,919
true representation

939
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,000
nobody should photoshop their photos

940
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,679
um obviously people are putting filters

941
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
like instagram filters you got to

942
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,038
sharpen and the contrast and whatever

943
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,320
and

944
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,398
i think

945
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,480
most people i would hope and tell the

946
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,558
difference between like a realistic

947
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,159
photo versus like

948
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,960
when they put it in photoshop and they

949
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,440
change the hue and then you got this

950
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,679
these overly red pistols not like the

951
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,159
natural pink ones you can find like

952
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,038
sometimes you just see really really red

953
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,519
hairs with like a brownish tinge to the

954
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,038
bud and the leaves are like

955
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,839
they're not even red anymore they're

956
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,359
like

957
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,199
super just like

958
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,798
blown out and there's pixels in the

959
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,480
colors like if you see stuff like that

960
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,000
is photoshop and it's just complete

961
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,558
garbage

962
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,558
in my opinion you should be posting like

963
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,759
realistic photos

964
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,200
um

965
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,599
yeah and i like

966
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
professor p's photography and like team

967
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,079
terpene does a really nice job

968
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,959
especially with like his studio shots

969
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,720
and

970
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,558
a few other guys like

971
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,319
i like to see the stuff where they take

972
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,240
the time to put on a good lens and put

973
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,839
some nice fleshes in there

974
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,720
and get the angle right

975
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,359
but

976
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,839
you shouldn't really be photoshopping or

977
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,599
artificially modifying anything

978
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,199
unless it's just like light levels to

979
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,558
just you know make the background a

980
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,798
little darker or something like that's

981
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,558
fine but that's about it i don't want to

982
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,038
see modified colors i want to see what

983
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,879
it really looks like

984
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:44,480
yeah i know what you mean and i mean a

985
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,399
quick little shout out to uh photos i

986
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,720
love i was noticing the other days uh

987
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,639

988
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,480
photos yeah

989
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,000
that's actually i was thinking of him in

990
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,278
my head but i couldn't remember the name

991
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,519
while i was saying those other two

992
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,240
people yeah it was only this morning i

993
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,200
was like yeah he does some good photos

994
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,960
so

995
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,480
something i wanted to quickly jump on

996
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,360
what is your general growth style

997
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,440
because you mentioned you're into the

998
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,519
leds and the cobs but you know are you

999
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,519
organic are you bottled nutrients give

1000
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,519
us the rundown

1001
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,159
oh yeah i love to talk about this

1002
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,759
because to me it's so so important to

1003
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,600
grow organically

1004
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,398
so to answer your question i grow

1005
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,839
organically in soil

1006
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,158
and

1007
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,959
in my opinion that's the best way to

1008
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,559
grow period for a lot of reasons the

1009
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
first reason being

1010
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,678
for beginners

1011
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,519
and i actually

1012
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,080
learned this at the grow store they told

1013
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,000
me why they push organics to beginners

1014
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,359
because i was like every other grow

1015
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,880
store i go to

1016
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,879
they always try and sell you chemicals

1017
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,960
but the one that i shop at which is

1018
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,799
green harvest hydroponics they're

1019
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,679
awesome and

1020
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:51,278
they

1021
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,200
teach a lot of people to grow

1022
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,558
organically even when they're a first

1023
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,679
time grower

1024
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,000
and

1025
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,600
it's because it's just easier

1026
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,200
plain and simple you're not going to

1027
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,038
[ __ ] up if you

1028
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,120
are growing synthetically there's a good

1029
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,679
chance you can kill a plant by

1030
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,679
over fertilizing it or getting your

1031
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,878
whatever your chemicals all [ __ ] up

1032
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,599
whatever the hell they do um i mean i

1033
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,039
i think it's all kind of

1034
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,720
really

1035
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,759
i don't know since that growing is not

1036
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,678
my style i very very rarely smoke

1037
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,839
anything grown with nutrients at all

1038
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,320
because i'm super sensitive to it

1039
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,838
and i feel it in my body and i've met

1040
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,599
other people that are the same way and

1041
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:32,009
some people are way more sensitive than

1042
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,838
i am

1043
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,520
[Music]

1044
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,918
i met some people that are like i can't

1045
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,639
smoke weed because and then they'll name

1046
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,319
like

1047
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,559
something like oh it [ __ ] with my

1048
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,320
thyroid or it [ __ ] with my lungs or my

1049
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,199
throat and i feel it for the next two

1050
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,599
days

1051
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,118
and then i'm like try organic and i give

1052
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,039
them something organic just a little

1053
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,280
nugget and smoking and they're like i

1054
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,398
didn't have that problem i always have

1055
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,560
and i'm like yeah because you're

1056
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,199
probably reacting chemicals that are in

1057
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,358
the bud whether you know it or not

1058
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,719
99 of the wheat out there is grown with

1059
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,559
chemicals

1060
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,358
um

1061
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,078
and

1062
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,759
99 of the growers are taught that that's

1063
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,760
how you grow weed

1064
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,240
and when i had my first plants that i

1065
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,800
believed out they were in soil from my

1066
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,719
backyard which i put into pots and then

1067
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,920
they were under led lights

1068
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,159
and

1069
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,760
at one point i was having an issue

1070
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,480
and it turned out that my light was too

1071
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,560
close so it was like bleaching them

1072
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,358
and so i went to a grocery store a

1073
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,559
different store and i showed the photos

1074
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,559
and they were like

1075
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,159
dude bro you got to be hitting it with

1076
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,960
some newts bro your place is going to

1077
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,118
die and so they gave me some nudes and i

1078
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,480
poured them in and i fried the hell out

1079
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,079
of my plants

1080
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,480
and i lost like probably almost 50 of

1081
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,640
the leaves on them just within a few

1082
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,639
hours were totally like

1083
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,598
crinkled and crunched in yellow and

1084
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,358
white like super gnarly and that was the

1085
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,200
one and only time that i felt them any

1086
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,759
nutrients because i was like that's not

1087
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,919
natural what the hell did i just do

1088
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,400
and luckily they didn't die and i was

1089
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,720
able to keep growing but

1090
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,760
there's just so many things like that

1091
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,879
um so if you're a beginner or if you're

1092
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,560
learning

1093
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,920
it's just easier to go with organic but

1094
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,639
that's

1095
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,639
it's healthier too but i would say my

1096
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,960
favorite reason for growing organic is

1097
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,559
just getting the best expression out of

1098
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,838
the plant

1099
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,239
um

1100
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,599
and doing it first try doing a second

1101
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,199
try if you [ __ ] up a little bit um i see

1102
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,960
a lot of nutrient growers that are like

1103
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,118
yeah i'm on my six to run with this cut

1104
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,400
and i finally got dialed down

1105
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,800
and

1106
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,280
usually with organic the plant dials

1107
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,519
itself in because the plants choosing

1108
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,280
what it wants to take in from

1109
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,838
the soil

1110
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,680
and the roots are interacting with whole

1111
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,239
the living stuff in your soil those

1112
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,159
little microbes and whatever

1113
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,159
and

1114
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,078
you know plants do really well in

1115
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,279
organic and

1116
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,200
pretty consistently so um

1117
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,760
sometimes you run into an issue but

1118
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,239
usually it's straightforward you can get

1119
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,240
a plant whether it's a cedar a clone you

1120
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,479
put it in some good dirt and you grow it

1121
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,279
and it's incredibly simple

1122
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,320
and

1123
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,240
it takes 5-10 minutes a day you go water

1124
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,559
your plant you make sure your air is

1125
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,279
moving around you check all your basic

1126
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,000
things like temperature and humidity

1127
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,560
and

1128
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,480
it it's just foolproof so

1129
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,078
and you can scale it up i actually went

1130
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,400
to this giant

1131
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,960
operation in maine where it was

1132
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
no-till and it was like 99 lights or

1133
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,880
something like that

1134
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,639
and every single planet was organic just

1135
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,720
fed nothing but water

1136
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,799
and they were huge and they were doing

1137
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,118
major major production here they had a

1138
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,720
huge crew of people working every single

1139
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,160
day there so

1140
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,838
when people say you can't scale it up

1141
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,639
it's [ __ ] it's just that they don't

1142
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,960
know

1143
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,118
how to do it they haven't tried

1144
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
they haven't looked into it enough but

1145
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,559
yeah to me organic is just the best way

1146
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,320
to do it

1147
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,759
i 100 agree just to uh clarify does that

1148
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,838
mean that you're pretty much mostly like

1149
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,320
an amended soil and you just water only

1150
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,920
for the most part

1151
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,079
yeah exactly so

1152
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,720
my basic growing style is this um

1153
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,680
i get a super soil that's called mission

1154
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,838
mix

1155
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,919
and i've also used other soils that are

1156
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,519
similar and they all do about the same

1157
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,039
thing this is just the one that i like

1158
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,039
the most but

1159
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,519
um and brand works as long as it's

1160
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,880
specifically super soil versus not just

1161
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,639
like

1162
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,400
regular potting soil that's not going to

1163
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,838
have enough stuff it's not going to be

1164
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,760
tailored for the cannabis plant it's

1165
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:44,960
just kind of for growing so

1166
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,560
you want to get something that's made

1167
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,079
for growing weed

1168
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,599
plant it in there

1169
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,839
and

1170
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,000
basically

1171
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,759
if it's an indico plant

1172
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,480
i'm going to transplant it into its

1173
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,480
final container one or two weeks before

1174
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,358
i flip to flower

1175
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
and if it's a sativa plant where

1176
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:05,838
uh

1177
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,759
the roots will grow a lot more when you

1178
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,759
flip it into flower you can kind of

1179
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,520
transplant it right before flip like on

1180
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,440
the day of flip and then just

1181
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,719
put it into flour right there

1182
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,440
and that's just the basic technique for

1183
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,519
growing plants in super soil which

1184
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,119
always seems to work good for me

1185
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,320
and i've also got a bunch of no-till

1186
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,400
pots where

1187
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,920
i'm on a bunch of them are just second

1188
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,200
round right now but then i've got some

1189
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,358
better third fourth and fifth round

1190
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,279
and i'll just add some amendments to

1191
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,440
them each time they have worms living in

1192
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
them and they're bigger sized pots and

1193
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,320
they're awesome and then you don't have

1194
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,359
to throw away soil without binding soil

1195
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,599
oh yeah

1196
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,880
and so have you found that on those pots

1197
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
where you're on the

1198
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,480
fourth or the fifth cycle for example

1199
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,679
that it's kind of getting better with

1200
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
time because that's something which is

1201
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:57,838
commonly uh you know spouted by the

1202
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,838
organic uh preachers basically

1203
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,599
um

1204
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,639
a little i don't really know it kind of

1205
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,119
depends because some plants like them

1206
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,879
more than others and sometimes you run

1207
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,318
into a little issue where all of a

1208
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,200
sudden your plants aren't in a yellow

1209
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,960
and then next week looks good again so

1210
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,399
it's definitely kind of shifting around

1211
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,800
and

1212
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,400
constantly adjusting and stuff but

1213
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,720
everything ends up doing really well

1214
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,800
regardless of if it's like first round

1215
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,838
or fifth round they've all been doing

1216
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
pretty good

1217
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,719
yeah

1218
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,318
so when you do grow out those more

1219
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,559
sativa i mean that's pretty much all you

1220
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,880
grow do you find that they are a little

1221
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,838
more sensitive than say the odd indica

1222
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,838
that you run

1223
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,079
um

1224
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,000
sensitive maybe doesn't like

1225
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,039
hermaphroditic or

1226
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,039
oh um

1227
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,480
the only

1228
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,559
challenge i've had recently was those

1229
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,880
old timers hazes

1230
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,318
um they all got super deficient

1231
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,318
somewhere in week

1232
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,599
10 or 12 a flower and they were in a

1233
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,960
second round

1234
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,359
no-till pot

1235
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,318
and i was like all right i'm gonna save

1236
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,719
these then so i fed them with some

1237
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,480
um some teas like dragonfly earth

1238
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,679
medicine and i put some amendments into

1239
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,440
the soil

1240
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,358
and then they got way over fed right

1241
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,559
away and they just started frying and

1242
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,480
they like

1243
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,318
it totally went the opposite direction

1244
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,800
and i was like oh [ __ ] this is not going

1245
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,719
to go well and then a couple weeks later

1246
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,960
they bounced back and they started

1247
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,519
flowering more and putting out new

1248
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,440
flowers because it was just flowers

1249
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,838
forever so

1250
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,920
um that was definitely the most finicky

1251
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,000
thing that i've grown in a while most

1252
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,838
things are fairly simple

1253
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,880
the only

1254
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,719
way that i've [ __ ] up upon a sativa is

1255
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,200
not enough root space

1256
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,519
or not enough soil really

1257
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,919
um then it might get deficient before it

1258
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,079
finishes because if it's flowering 12

1259
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,280
weeks versus eight might need a little

1260
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,640
bit more nutrition to carry it that far

1261
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,560
yeah so

1262
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,078
i thought i've been pondering over for a

1263
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,599
while is

1264
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,039
every now and again i'll talk to a

1265
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,640
newbie and they'll be like oh and a

1266
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,000
group purple haze or like you know

1267
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,159
clearly like they haven't looked into

1268
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,400
the specifics at all and you kind of

1269
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,519
like no that's not a beginner's plan at

1270
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,720
all and then you're not even going to

1271
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,400
find the thing you're looking for but

1272
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,799
anyway i digress

1273
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,480
when you do grow out these haze plants

1274
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,400
or you know something akin to the purple

1275
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,800
haze so to speak these 17 weeks and

1276
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,639
whatnot i was trying to think what is it

1277
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,560
about these plants which specifically

1278
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,159
makes them hard to grow

1279
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,400
and i was thinking about it and i think

1280
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,000
the the best way i could pinpoint it is

1281
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,639
that it's kind of what you mentioned

1282
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,800
about if you give them extra nutrients

1283
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,239
they just start to bloom more growth and

1284
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,400
it can almost just stretch it out

1285
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,838
indefinitely do you think that is the

1286
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,440
primary challenge with these longer

1287
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,719
growing plants or do you think it's just

1288
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,599
a variety of other things as well

1289
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,838
um

1290
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,119
so the common thing that i hear from

1291
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,920
people

1292
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,680
is

1293
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,318
the first concern is always space

1294
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,480
they're like i have x amount of height i

1295
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,880
got five feet of height i can't grow

1296
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,639
sativas or

1297
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,559
i don't want to another thing is just

1298
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:11,440
the bloom times people don't have the

1299
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,119
actual patience to go that long which i

1300
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,639
do understand but

1301
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,318
the thing is you can put one of those in

1302
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,759
the corner and have the rest of your

1303
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,559
tent be like

1304
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,240
an eight week indica and then

1305
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,078
when those are done you rhyme and your

1306
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,318
old timer's haze is still going for

1307
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,839
another cycle or two of your next

1308
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:29,838
harvest and then those will finish up

1309
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,960
and then your haze is almost done

1310
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,799
so

1311
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,720
i mean the patience thing is like just

1312
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,318
dedicate a little corner to it and get

1313
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,000
used to it

1314
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,079
and for me when i'm growing long time

1315
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,400
satives i'm not really thinking about

1316
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,640
like when's it gonna be done

1317
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,119
it's a really really nice plant to be in

1318
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,199
the moment with and just appreciate that

1319
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,358
plant every day or whenever you feel

1320
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:54,318
like spending some time with it

1321
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,440
um just spread it and enjoy it and smell

1322
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:56,639
it

1323
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,480
because

1324
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,159
i don't know a lot of growing it's

1325
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,159
always like oh what am i gonna grow next

1326
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,879
what's what's coming down what's going

1327
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,480
in and you're always focusing on later

1328
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,119
and i always try to remind myself to

1329
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,920
like focus on the present how beautiful

1330
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,800
everything is like right now that i have

1331
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,720
so

1332
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,599
the sativas really teach you to do that

1333
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,039
because

1334
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,640
if you think about what's coming down

1335
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,199
you're just gonna stress out because

1336
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,719
it's not anytime soon but if you're

1337
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,559
looking at it and

1338
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,399
you're just appreciating it

1339
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,239
it's almost like a blast well it is a

1340
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,318
blast to the past but

1341
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,479
it's it's like a step backwards in

1342
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,639
cannabis evolution really because you

1343
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
see these they're not even bugs they're

1344
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,440
barely buds they're just strings of

1345
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,280
calyxes but they're all near each other

1346
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,800
and you can imagine like if you squish

1347
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,519
them next to each other it almost

1348
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,200
becomes like a modern bud

1349
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,960
and

1350
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,759
i don't know just stuff like that but i

1351
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,679
got a lot of topic from the question so

1352
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,839
what was the question again

1353
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,279
no that that's that's awesome let's keep

1354
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,759
going with this because that's like you

1355
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,440
just summarized exactly how i feel i was

1356
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,839
talking to a friend just the other day

1357
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,519
about how i was saying to them i don't

1358
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,039
even get excited about what i'm going to

1359
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,639
harvest because i've been thinking about

1360
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,079
that already for so long and now i'm

1361
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,000
already thinking about what's going in

1362
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,760
next and so by the time i'm actually

1363
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,119
harvesting the crop i'm already like i'm

1364
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,800
really excited for the seeds i'm

1365
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,160
germinating but what you said is

1366
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,160
essentially just kind of like

1367
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,759
mindfulness for cannabis growers right

1368
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,598
like live in the moment not in your head

1369
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,000
right

1370
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,240
yeah absolutely and that's actually why

1371
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,920
i took a break from doing perpetual

1372
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,799
because i've been perpetual since my

1373
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,039
third

1374
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,079
row ever and

1375
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,920
i just took my first perpetual break

1376
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,359
and that was the [ __ ] worst idea but

1377
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,838
i thought it would be awesome because i

1378
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,440
was like yeah really well it was a good

1379
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,119
idea because it made me appreciate

1380
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,519
everything a little more and slow down

1381
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,119
which was the goal of it but

1382
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,519
the problem was i didn't have stuff to

1383
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,880
smoke and i'm like trying to make these

1384
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,480
grams last a couple months but anyways

1385
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,800
it's

1386
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,800
you're always in the cycle of like

1387
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,960
you have stuff midway through bloom and

1388
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,800
then you've got this new

1389
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,280
bunch of strains that you're popping

1390
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,960
seeds of and you have stuff that's

1391
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,800
almost ready to go into flower that

1392
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,159
you're not even excited about anymore

1393
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,760
because you're more excited about your

1394
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,159
ceilings and you're just waiting for

1395
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,160
your flower to come down and that that's

1396
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,000
not a good place to be i've seen a lot

1397
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,799
of people that are in that kind of

1398
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,519
zone perpetually and

1399
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,880
it's it's more awesome to just

1400
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:31,440
treat every plant as something special

1401
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,119
that it is like when you're in flower go

1402
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,519
appreciate those flowers when you're in

1403
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,000
your drying or curing stage

1404
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,519
appreciate your work right there and

1405
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,679
don't give up like

1406
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:44,079
keep focusing on that as if it was your

1407
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,919
only plan because in that moment it is

1408
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,599
the plan in front of you is

1409
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,639
all you have

1410
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,119
so

1411
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,639
just kind of paying attention to every

1412
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,760
single stage and then you go into your

1413
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,679
bedroom

1414
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,280
and like you know don't just water them

1415
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,159
and be like all right boring you gotta

1416
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,400
really

1417
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,239
look at the structure and

1418
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,400
give them some stem rubs and smell them

1419
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,399
look at what kind of different funny

1420
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,838
leaves are on different plants and who's

1421
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,200
praying and who's grouping and

1422
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,199
like when you got a whole bunch of the

1423
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:14,639
same strain be like all right this one's

1424
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,919
a little stretchier and this one's

1425
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,159
shorter like

1426
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,760
just spend more time staring at your

1427
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,920
plants like

1428
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,880
all of them and be excited for them all

1429
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,159
because

1430
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,920
if you have a plant that you're not

1431
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,719
excited about you shouldn't be growing

1432
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,000
it

1433
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,480
and that's something i learned when i

1434
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,280
was like growing a really really lot of

1435
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,199
weed

1436
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,960
and half of it was stuff that i was just

1437
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,558
growing because i had it

1438
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,760
i didn't even want to smoke it because i

1439
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,440
didn't like it

1440
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,319
and then i learned like

1441
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,400
there's

1442
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,400
no room for those plants like just get

1443
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,400
them out of there give them away or

1444
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,680
if you have to just compost them and dry

1445
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,800
them out and put them back into your

1446
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,480
soil but

1447
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,400
don't grow something

1448
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,599
if the vibe isn't right don't grow it

1449
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,200
just

1450
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,039
because you have it grow because you

1451
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,078
want it and because you're excited about

1452
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,719
it and you'll have a lot more fun

1453
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,079
yeah definitely in the words of uh mr

1454
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,639
bob hemphill

1455
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,240
not library status

1456
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,000
but uh

1457
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,519
so then that brings me to the point then

1458
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,119
pheno hunting this is something near and

1459
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,559
dear to my heart because it loops back

1460
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
to something you just mentioned with

1461
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,800
organics it's it's so easy to finna hunt

1462
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,960
because as you said you do things right

1463
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,079
the plan presents itself to you

1464
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,480
so with that being said you know are you

1465
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,760
pretty ruthless with the pheno hunting

1466
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,358
things have to be pretty good to make

1467
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,359
the library status and then as a

1468
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:32,639
follow-up for people out there who are

1469
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:33,920
in that boat that you just mentioned

1470
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:35,838
where maybe they grow on some things

1471
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,760
they're not that keen about do you push

1472
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,279
people to fino hunt more like or do you

1473
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,200
think just find a few plants you like

1474
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,440
and then stick with them for a while or

1475
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,439
what's your gig

1476
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,960
yeah so

1477
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,240
when i'm clean one thing um i'm super

1478
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,599
super picky

1479
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,078
because

1480
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,760
um even if i'm not female hunting and

1481
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
i'm just trying to grow like

1482
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,440
one or two plants or something i'm still

1483
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:03,039
picky as hell but

1484
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,800
um the point is like a lot of people i

1485
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,239
understand because seats are expensive

1486
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,920
and whatever but

1487
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,279
a lot of people they won't throw away

1488
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,400
anything because they're just like oh

1489
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,640
you know like i paid for that or like

1490
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,480
it's a plant and i used to like never

1491
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:17,679
even want to buck a leaf off a plant in

1492
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,240
the first place because i was like i

1493
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:24,078
don't want to hurt it it's so special

1494
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,078
and now it's more of like

1495
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,079
i don't know i guess i call a lot of

1496
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,920
[ __ ] plants a lot of times if i'm

1497
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,240
pheno hunting something and i know i

1498
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,599
only have room to flower 20

1499
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,039
i'll start 250 beans anyways and weed

1500
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,880
them out through beds

1501
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,480
even if i'm just going to flower 10

1502
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,640
because like

1503
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,119
the more of the selection you have the

1504
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,039
better plant you're going to find unless

1505
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,760
you just get lucky you can also plant

1506
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,199
one single seed and get lucky find

1507
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,599
something really awesome and it don't

1508
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,519
happen but

1509
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,920
if you pop a whole bunch of seeds if you

1510
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,000
have the ability to whether you're gonna

1511
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,240
grow out all of them or maybe give some

1512
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,920
away friends like if i can't flower

1513
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,519
everything i'll give away a few nice

1514
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,280
looking ones to friends and be like hey

1515
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:10,079
if this is any good just get me a cup

1516
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,319
pack

1517
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,359
and it never ends up being anything good

1518
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:14,639
but

1519
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,239
uh

1520
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:17,759
usually

1521
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:19,039
at least with my own lens when i'm

1522
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,079
reading

1523
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,719
um i know what i'm looking for so

1524
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,760
i can weed out a lot in veg and then

1525
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,759
i know pretty good idea like

1526
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,359
which females i want to grow about just

1527
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,599
based on their growth patterns and then

1528
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:35,759
see if i find the flower

1529
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,160
on flower qualities that i'm looking for

1530
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,599
after that but there is a lot to be said

1531
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,318
in stem rub

1532
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,440
people don't really realize that

1533
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:47,838
um a stem rub on one specific day

1534
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,400
doesn't tell you much but if you stem

1535
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:53,199
rob every plant maybe every week let's

1536
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,519
say you got like 50 plants

1537
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,679
stem rub all of them every week and take

1538
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,039
notes on every single one because

1539
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,118
they're going to change

1540
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:04,639
and some of them will give you that hint

1541
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,480
that you're looking for like for example

1542
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:09,118
when i was looking for my prayer tower

1543
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,358
male i had grown prayer tower a few

1544
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,440
different times before and i knew which

1545
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,358
vino i liked i was trying to find a male

1546
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,280
that had that feel which is you know a

1547
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,159
little bit difficult

1548
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,480
and i was stem rubbing all the plants

1549
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:25,199
and on one specific day

1550
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,719
the male that ended up being the one had

1551
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,480
the smell i was looking for but it never

1552
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,159
had it again but none of the other

1553
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,760
plants ever had it

1554
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,239
and so i went with that one that was

1555
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,480
like this has to be the one it has this

1556
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:37,838
soapy hashy

1557
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,920
smell that i'm

1558
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,639
looking for it's like this creamy so i

1559
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,639
don't even know how to explain it but

1560
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,799
it ended up being the one and then

1561
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,920
it passed on the exact tricks i'm

1562
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,920
looking for

1563
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,079
in the flower department and i mean it

1564
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,838
checked all the other boxes too but

1565
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,359
that's just one example of how like the

1566
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:59,679
stem up can tell you a lot but it won't

1567
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,759
just tell you every day you gotta really

1568
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:03,358
check them out on different days

1569
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,599
stuff like that

1570
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,000
yeah i agree and something i've noticed

1571
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,880
and i'd love to run by you is

1572
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,358
you can actually get different uh smells

1573
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,960
whether you rub the stem at the new

1574
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:16,558
growth where you know the shoot is

1575
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,199
rather green versus say you know a

1576
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,599
little bit more woody harden growth down

1577
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,318
low do you take note of the differences

1578
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:27,039
or do that at all

1579
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,838
yeah i usually rub probably three

1580
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,880
quarters of the planet just by habit and

1581
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:32,719
then

1582
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,480
i don't know sometimes i'll check

1583
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,159
different parts of it and if i find

1584
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,679
something interesting i'll

1585
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,598
i'll take another figure and rub a

1586
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,519
different part of the plant like really

1587
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,200
look into it and then

1588
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,960
if there's no smell

1589
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,879
or not much smell i'll try and rub like

1590
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,119
a different part of it so

1591
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,838
definitely i think it's almost like how

1592
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,358
if you have a big clone or a big mom and

1593
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,279
you're taking clones

1594
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,719
and like one round all the top clones

1595
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,480
root and the bottoms don't poop that

1596
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,399
well and then the next round it's the

1597
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,679
other way around it's kind of like how

1598
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,240
the plant has different levels of

1599
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,399
hormones in different areas at different

1600
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,479
times so

1601
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,400
i guess it's similar to that where like

1602
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,480
one day the bottom might smell more one

1603
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,838
day the top might smell more or they

1604
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,800
might smell differently at different

1605
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:17,440
times

1606
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,960
just things moving around with the plant

1607
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,800
maybe it has to do with day and night

1608
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,119
too i don't really know

1609
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,039
yeah and i understand and so do you

1610
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,200
generally take clones from the top and

1611
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,039
the bottom or just wherever it seems to

1612
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,639
work at the time and what do you use to

1613
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,639
stimulate rooting given that you're

1614
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,679
organic

1615
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,598
oh yeah so clones on um

1616
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,759
i always used to take from the bottom

1617
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,960
because i learned that from the internet

1618
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,400
or from whoever it's like bottom clones

1619
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,838
root faster because they're closer to

1620
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,400
the roots

1621
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,880
and then the last year or two people

1622
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,318
like when i started telling people about

1623
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,920
that they're like dude you gotta take

1624
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,400
them from the top so you get way better

1625
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,159
clones so now i've been doing a bit of

1626
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,160
both because i've always had great

1627
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,239
plants from taking roots

1628
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,078
uh taking cuts from the bottom

1629
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,479
so i don't know you can do either way i

1630
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,079
don't even think it matters i mean i

1631
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,159
guess the next step would be to take a

1632
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,559
bottom clone and a top clone and flower

1633
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,920
them side by side and see if there's a

1634
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,760
difference but i really don't think

1635
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,760
there's gonna be as long as it's a

1636
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,559
healthy clone

1637
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,559
a healthy mother plant and it stays

1638
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,480
pretty healthy while rooting and going

1639
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,720
through that transformation or being a

1640
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,119
branch to an implant as long as it

1641
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:32,879
doesn't like almost die or something

1642
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,640
like it's it's gonna be fine um

1643
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,200
you know a clone is a clone as long as

1644
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:40,000
it's healthy and happy so

1645
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,039
yeah what i do for clones is very simple

1646
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,679
um

1647
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,358
just take an arrow cloner like it's a

1648
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,358
bucket full of water and there's an air

1649
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,519
stone and an air pump and

1650
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,719
the water is bubbling around

1651
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,440
and just takes some cuts like i don't

1652
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,199
know

1653
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,798
i used to take really small cards i

1654
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,879
didn't know any better and now i take a

1655
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,159
little bigger ones but

1656
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,280
at least

1657
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,358
probably

1658
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,440
six seven inches or something is good

1659
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,759
and like maybe ten inch cut is be nice

1660
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,920
usually the big ones are stronger plants

1661
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,960
from the get-go so

1662
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,960
um

1663
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,798
you know whatever it doesn't really

1664
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,880
matter that much but basically just cut

1665
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,960
off a branch and stick it in the water

1666
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,039
and then two or three weeks later as

1667
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,960
rooted it's really really easy you don't

1668
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,400
have to do anything

1669
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,079
one time

1670
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,920
i dipped them all in aloe and they'll

1671
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,680
die so it's like all right none of that

1672
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,358
like going back to straight water it

1673
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,399
works for me like i'm not gonna change

1674
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,798
anything

1675
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,200
and then one time

1676
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:39,280
um i had some really difficult cuts that

1677
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,199
i couldn't root i forget what strains

1678
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,440
they were but somebody was like yeah

1679
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:44,960
just pretend it's a deep water culture

1680
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,280
just throwing all the nuts in there like

1681
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,039
super diluted and i did that and they

1682
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,640
[ __ ] rooted like monsters and they

1683
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,558
were growing in the cloner and they had

1684
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:56,000
like these huge like

1685
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,240
unbelievable overkill roots so

1686
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,280
if you need a boost you can put [ __ ] in

1687
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,358
there but

1688
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,720
i never do because it's not organic like

1689
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,400
i did it that one time and i just

1690
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,558
couldn't get something to root or

1691
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,480
survive or whatever but

1692
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,798
um

1693
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,719
the only thing that i help them with

1694
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,559
sometimes i don't even do it every time

1695
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,199
but when i remember is i'll spray them

1696
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,798
with a foliar spray like the first four

1697
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,239
days or so

1698
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,480
and that'll just feed them a little bit

1699
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,919
but you don't even have to do that like

1700
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,358
i usually

1701
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,838
i just have like

1702
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:29,838
a separate layer like underneath one of

1703
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,440
the tables in my bedroom and i just have

1704
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,960
like lights under there and i put my

1705
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,559
corners under there and just fill them

1706
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,400
up and then

1707
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,839
you just have to remember to

1708
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,079
check the water maybe

1709
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,599
once a week like put some

1710
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,680
you know empty it out clean it out put

1711
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,640
some water in or just top it off once in

1712
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,879
a while

1713
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,480
and it's it's just waiting and basically

1714
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,240
forgetting and then remembering then

1715
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,159
they're done

1716
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:55,279
yeah and heck you can't get much more

1717
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,598
organic than plain water right

1718
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,280
do you generally like to push people to

1719
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,280
constantly be popping new seeds and

1720
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,960
pheno hunting or are you kind of okay

1721
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,440
with the idea that people just run the

1722
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,400
same thing for a while

1723
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,798
um

1724
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,400
luckily most of the people that i know

1725
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:13,119
not all of them but most of them are

1726
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,358
pretty into popping seeds and

1727
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,880
that's cool because i love giving them

1728
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,759
seeds and watching them grow them out

1729
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,358
but

1730
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,000
in general

1731
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:25,440
i definitely tell people

1732
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,480
never stop popping seeds um similar to

1733
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,159
like

1734
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,400
what bodhi said

1735
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:32,480
just every seed is its own

1736
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,760
plant and it's it's like

1737
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,240
such a special thing inside there

1738
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,319
and like yeah all these elite clones and

1739
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,919
popular clones are most of them are

1740
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:43,358
pretty good some of them

1741
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,760
whatever but

1742
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:47,759
i mean they're great plants but it's not

1743
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,680
that hard to find your own

1744
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,440
plants that are just as good or better

1745
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:55,279
or different and

1746
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:58,079
um in my opinion when you plant a seed

1747
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,000
that plant you know is really your plant

1748
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,680
it has an emotional bond with you and

1749
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,480
you have one with it

1750
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,239
and

1751
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,838
that plant is it's just going to be

1752
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,479
closer to you than the clone that you

1753
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,798
got from someone else no matter what

1754
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,519
you can love a clone too but

1755
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,719
when you watch a plant grow up from seed

1756
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,639
i mean

1757
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,879
you're tearing it like from birth you're

1758
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,639
literally giving it life and that plant

1759
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,838
is gonna work with you

1760
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,759
and

1761
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:25,920
um i forget where i heard it but

1762
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,040
somewhere in africa where they grow

1763
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,079
cannabis

1764
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,239
they say

1765
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,079
you have to grow your own cannabis for

1766
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,399
it to be the best for you and if

1767
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,318
somebody else grows it or if you steal

1768
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,720
it from someone or you take it or get it

1769
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:41,039
from someone it's not going to help you

1770
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,159
the same way as if you grow the plant

1771
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,558
for you

1772
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,879
because that plant is working for you

1773
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,400
and you are working for it and it's just

1774
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,280
a special bond

1775
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,358
but

1776
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,798
um anyways yeah so popping seeds is like

1777
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:56,719
you're gonna find all these unique

1778
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,559
plants every single plant you grow is

1779
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,159
gonna be something that nobody else has

1780
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,680
grown even though it's yeah it's the

1781
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,679
same strain and maybe something

1782
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,199
stabilizing whatever but

1783
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:07,519
you have

1784
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,798
that individual child

1785
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,880
that's

1786
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:14,000
your own plan and it's going to adapt to

1787
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,559
your environment immediately start

1788
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,519
expressing itself based on what you give

1789
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,400
it

1790
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,880
um including emotions actually but even

1791
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,400
just down to environment and all that

1792
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,480
and you're gonna find some really

1793
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,240
special plants and i never really

1794
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,679
thought it was that fun growing other

1795
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,199
clones because

1796
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,118
i was like

1797
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,759
you know why do i want to grow

1798
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,400
the same thing that the next guy has and

1799
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,280
the next guy and the next guy and

1800
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,480
5 000 people also had this

1801
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,240
like

1802
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,679
now i'm a little bit more open to it

1803
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:47,679
because i think it's cool to see what

1804
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,679
that plant is the same as seeing what

1805
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,440
any seed is it's like very cool it is

1806
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,519
another plant like let's see what's so

1807
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,280
good about it or like looks awesome

1808
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,798
smells awesome whenever i want to smoke

1809
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,839
it there's plenty of reasons to grow a

1810
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,559
clone for sure

1811
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:03,279
but

1812
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,160
growing seeds is just like

1813
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,079
that's

1814
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,598
that's how all those clones came to be

1815
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,599
obviously they came from seed that

1816
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,200
someone popped and you never know you

1817
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,160
might be the next person that pops a

1818
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:16,558
seed whether it's you under 500 you

1819
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,639
might pop that next elite clone only

1820
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,240
blah blah amazing plant that everyone

1821
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,039
wants to grow and smoke

1822
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,399
and

1823
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,239
if you don't pop seeds you'll never know

1824
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,200
that's exactly it

1825
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,879
so

1826
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:30,639
again looping back to a point you made

1827
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,039
earlier on you said that you know it's

1828
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:34,558
really important to you like the the

1829
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,880
vibe of if you're going to use someone

1830
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,040
else's work like their vibe things like

1831
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,640
that i guess that means that there's

1832
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,880
maybe certain people's work who you

1833
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,960
wouldn't want to work with but the flip

1834
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,720
side of that is how would you feel if

1835
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,240
someone who you didn't really vibe with

1836
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,519
they fell into that category of you

1837
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,279
wouldn't work with their gear because

1838
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:53,199
you don't agree with maybe personal

1839
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,200
aspects or whatever how would you feel

1840
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:57,919
if they then started to incorporate your

1841
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,358
work into their gear is that you know

1842
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,318
would that take you off or is it kind of

1843
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,318
just a part of the game

1844
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,359
um

1845
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,798
i mean i would have to be okay with it

1846
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:08,798
because

1847
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,798
honestly i believe anybody should be

1848
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:14,480
able to do whatever they want with

1849
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:16,559
whatever plan is in their possession so

1850
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,480
if somebody wanted to breed with my

1851
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,319
stuff luckily everybody that's bred with

1852
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,318
my strength so far has been friendly

1853
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,039
with me was really really nice and

1854
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:27,440
they've done some amazing work there's a

1855
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,920
stellar collision with demand seeds and

1856
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,000
that was something we agreed upon like

1857
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,519
hey grow these and breed with them and

1858
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,280
we'll do this collab kind of thing and

1859
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:36,639
whatever so

1860
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,160
that's just one of them there's a few

1861
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,960
others out there too and then there's

1862
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,639
some

1863
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,679
people that read with some of my stuff

1864
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:43,598
that

1865
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,358
like you know they didn't ask me but i

1866
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,280
saw it and i was just like holy [ __ ]

1867
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,440
that looks amazing like that's really

1868
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,519
cool i'm happy to see that like

1869
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,119
thanks for choosing my strain versus

1870
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,759
someone else's like that means a lot to

1871
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,119
me i think it's really cool

1872
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,200
um

1873
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,559
so i don't know i mean if somebody that

1874
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,798
i didn't like

1875
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,119
bread with one of my plants

1876
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,038
i'd probably like them a little more i

1877
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,680
don't really know like

1878
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,920
i i wouldn't be mad like it's fine i'd

1879
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:13,038
probably still be honored because it's

1880
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,960
just like

1881
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,079
you know they like that plant it works

1882
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,880
for them

1883
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,280
and

1884
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,798
they're gonna put their own twist to it

1885
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,079
maybe they'll even make something that i

1886
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:23,519
don't like like maybe they'll put

1887
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,798
cookies into it and i [ __ ] hate

1888
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,480
cookies but like if somebody

1889
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,000
you know they want to make their own

1890
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,760
version

1891
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,599
of whatever

1892
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,920
like let's say somebody wants to make a

1893
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:39,039
pupil hybrid with some

1894
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,639
with like an og or cookies or something

1895
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,480
it's like cool do it like i want to see

1896
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,318
what it comes out like i probably still

1897
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,559
grow it out even if i don't really like

1898
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,719
you i normally wouldn't grow plants from

1899
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,559
people i don't like but if there's like

1900
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,919
something really cool about it i can put

1901
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,960
things aside

1902
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,720
because

1903
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,720
i don't i try not to have problems with

1904
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,558
people like if they have a problem with

1905
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:59,759
me then maybe i'm not gonna like them so

1906
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,599
much but

1907
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,280
it's pretty

1908
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,359
i don't know there's a lot of love in

1909
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,839
scene so i try to focus on all the

1910
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:10,480
positives all the time

1911
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:12,639
yeah of course and so in general where

1912
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,039
do you sit on the issue of

1913
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,798
say permission or good grace i mean i

1914
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,960
know you mentioned earlier that you had

1915
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,199
the conversation with professor p

1916
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,199
is that kind of ideally how you would

1917
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,558
like it to go down

1918
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,480
with if you were going to use someone

1919
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,920
else's work or like for example let's

1920
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,679
just say you couldn't really get in

1921
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,838
contact with them would you just kind of

1922
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,078
go ahead like what would you be your

1923
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:36,078
protocol

1924
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,200
yeah so

1925
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,200
basically

1926
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,038
the best case scenario of course is one

1927
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,639
like that where you can talk to the

1928
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,240
person who's bred the client you want to

1929
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,159
work with and be like hey do you mind if

1930
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:48,479
i do this and then when i talk to them

1931
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,118
they even say like yeah these are going

1932
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,039
to be for sale at some point they might

1933
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,480
be sold as an f1 they might be work

1934
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,599
whatever it is i'll explain them what i

1935
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,440
want to do

1936
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,440
and then if they say that's okay then

1937
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,960
that's like the best case scenario and

1938
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,318
if they said it wasn't okay i wouldn't

1939
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,480
even do it at all

1940
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,000
but there's other cases where you just

1941
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,079
can't get in contact

1942
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,318
with the people or maybe it's something

1943
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:13,440
that's so used already that you're like

1944
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:16,000
[ __ ] it it's fine like gorilla glue 4 is

1945
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,920
the only like elite clone that i've read

1946
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,519
with and

1947
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,480
i was kind of like

1948
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:22,000
all right

1949
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,400
i don't think they'll get mad at me like

1950
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,159
there's 700 different glue hives out

1951
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,400
there already and like i actually feel

1952
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,558
like i can make something unique with it

1953
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,760
so i'm just gonna go for it like i think

1954
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,640
it's fine

1955
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,680
um

1956
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,400
and like

1957
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:38,159
puting was another i made a pupil tangy

1958
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,240
hybrid and i was like i can't get in

1959
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:41,838
contact with the tangy dudes and people

1960
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,239
who don't even know what the hell tangy

1961
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,719
is because maybe they

1962
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,399
took california orange and renamed it or

1963
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,439
you know there's that whole tangy drama

1964
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,200
nobody knows the exact truth behind

1965
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,280
what they did and if they really made it

1966
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,798
or if they just have it so i'm like all

1967
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,880
right tangies kind of free range

1968
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:00,639
everyone's breathing with that too like

1969
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,680
a time but

1970
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:06,078
um i definitely prefer a lot

1971
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,679
to breed with anything from somebody

1972
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,680
that i can talk to that i know

1973
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:12,318
personally um

1974
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,078
or that says like it's okay definitely

1975
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:16,000
the coolest way to do it because i need

1976
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,680
to know that like

1977
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,358
there's there's more good vibes in it

1978
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,279
that way like a lot of my words with

1979
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:23,838
some of d-man and stuff

1980
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,519
which i'm friends with him and i got to

1981
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:26,558
go to his place in canada which is

1982
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:27,358
really cool

1983
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,440
and

1984
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,199
he taught me so so much like a lot of my

1985
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,119
breeding knowledge comes from him over

1986
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:34,879
the years so

1987
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,079
it's really really cool to read with

1988
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,358
each other's stuff and it just puts like

1989
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,760
an extra

1990
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:44,078
piece of excitement in there every time

1991
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,680
you grow those plants it's like you have

1992
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,519
a little bit of the connection with that

1993
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,639
person too like even if it's just in

1994
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,079
your head or it's in the plant like

1995
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,440
i don't know right now i'm throwing some

1996
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,280
mr e pupils and so mr e is a cut from

1997
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,079
east coaster dam that he gave me breed

1998
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,319
with

1999
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,519
and growing those is so cool because

2000
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:03,279
it's like

2001
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,519
that's a super special plant that my

2002
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,440
friend held for 10 plus years

2003
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,119
and then he gifted it to me that i could

2004
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,200
breed with it because he wanted it to be

2005
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,318
available to other people

2006
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,598
and

2007
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,440
i don't know it's just that much more

2008
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,119
exciting to see like my plants come

2009
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,798
together with his plants when we're both

2010
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,559
friends and we both like our own plants

2011
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:21,440
in each other's plants like

2012
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,039
there's

2013
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,639
there's a lot of good vibes bouncing

2014
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,200
back and forth when you're

2015
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,038
collaborating like that

2016
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,159
yeah of course

2017
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,760
and so

2018
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:33,440
just kind of in line with what you just

2019
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,359
mentioned what are some genetics you

2020
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,480
don't currently have access to that

2021
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:40,000
you'd love to work with and why

2022
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,440
um

2023
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,159
um

2024
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,559
i want to check out some colombian golds

2025
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,199
because i've never grown or smoked that

2026
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,519
specifically i mean i've had it like

2027
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,919
in hybridized whatever but i haven't had

2028
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:56,559
this pure colombian gold yet

2029
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,599
um vietnam black like

2030
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:01,280
just some different land races um

2031
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,880
i don't know if i would necessarily

2032
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,519
breed with them or not it depends like

2033
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,640
how outrageously finicky they are

2034
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:07,679
or not

2035
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,639
but

2036
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:13,118
um because usually i tend to try to

2037
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:15,759
breed with something that's like

2038
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:18,880
pretty stable off the bat is because

2039
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,640
it's available like why would you

2040
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,280
not use something that you like that's

2041
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:24,480
already pretty damn good but

2042
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,798
um

2043
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,440
i believe everybody should try and grow

2044
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:31,038
out the craziest plants that they heard

2045
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,599
of through their like

2046
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,000
old ass uncle or whoever the hell is

2047
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,000
just like back in my day we smoke this

2048
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,599
and this and we came off a boat like

2049
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,599
when you hear a story like that and it

2050
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,400
speaks to you or it just sounds cool

2051
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,880
like

2052
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,400
seek out that plan because it's not as

2053
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,640
long gone as you might think like

2054
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,838
there's somebody preserving

2055
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:54,480
every single land race strain so

2056
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:57,519
that stuff is just awesome and sometimes

2057
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,798
it can be really good reading too

2058
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,798
uh what else what else

2059
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,119
uh

2060
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,960
as cheesy as it sounds i'm finally

2061
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,640
getting triangle kush because i've never

2062
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,358
had that going before

2063
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:13,358
and like i said i don't usually grow i

2064
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,880
don't usually breed with clones but

2065
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,600
that's one that i'm really excited to

2066
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,759
explore the possibilities because every

2067
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,880
single tk hybrid that i've smoked has

2068
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:25,679
been so so good and i've grown a few and

2069
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,359
seen a whole bunch of them growing and

2070
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,199
i don't know man like

2071
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:32,000
it's a classic and maybe it's a little

2072
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:35,198
overused but i think the star people put

2073
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,079
like a unique touch to it and i think

2074
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,759
um

2075
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:39,838
that'll be really cool so that's coming

2076
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,158
up soon well i don't want to tell people

2077
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,479
that but that's coming in a year or two

2078
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,318
if it works out well you know

2079
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,639
yeah i mean i don't think anyone's going

2080
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,719
to look down on you for liking tk it's

2081
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,119
it's easily my favorite of all the

2082
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,480
kush's and it it's just so solid i can

2083
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,039
when i when you smoke it you can

2084
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,678
understand why it's stood up but with

2085
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,920
that in mind are there any other ultra

2086
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,079
clone only you know almost even

2087
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,960
borderline hype strains that you would

2088
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:09,920
consider working with

2089
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:12,000
um i'm checking a few out at the moment

2090
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,000
like i said um

2091
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,158
how i got some clones i'm kind of doing

2092
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,279
a run of like a ton of clones just to

2093
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,439
see what i

2094
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,480
like actually at all like these elites

2095
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,479
and stuff

2096
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:24,000
just because i recently ran into like a

2097
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,599
few different people that are big on

2098
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,039
like having all these elite clones and

2099
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,440
stuff and they're just yeah you can have

2100
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:31,198
whatever the [ __ ] you want so

2101
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:33,759
i'm just like all right let's take in a

2102
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:35,119
whole bunch and i don't want to like

2103
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,960
tell people that i'm going to breed with

2104
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:39,119
them or not because chances are i'm not

2105
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,600
gonna unless something really vibes with

2106
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:43,119
me but i'm sure something will really

2107
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,239
fine with me so

2108
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:46,238
um

2109
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:49,519
i'm gonna be checking out

2110
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,798
i got like so much lavender i got tempty

2111
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,359
i got

2112
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:56,079
supposed to be 1091 but it's not so i'm

2113
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,440
still looking for 1091 a real one but

2114
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:58,479
that one cool

2115
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:00,559
but

2116
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:04,000
um

2117
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,199
looking through some blueberry clones

2118
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,920
uh

2119
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:10,238
purple punch i mean i don't think it's

2120
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,279
supposed to be very strong but it smells

2121
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,119
really good and it looks awesome so

2122
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,880
maybe one day i'll hit that with some

2123
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,158
heavy hitters but i don't know probably

2124
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,000
not

2125
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:21,359
i don't i don't think i need to

2126
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,479
because

2127
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:24,158
usually

2128
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:25,759
when i'm breeding i like to find stuff

2129
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:28,319
from seed from strains that i really

2130
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,000
like already and then work with that

2131
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,399
just because it's more unique like i

2132
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,439
don't want to create the same thing that

2133
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:37,359
somebody next door can create like

2134
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,198
or create something similar to like but

2135
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,960
i don't want to make the next purple

2136
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:44,079
part if there's already 30 different

2137
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,800
purple charges out there i'd rather like

2138
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:49,600
sprout a bunch of seeds of like

2139
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,760
anything and then find something i like

2140
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,320
and i'd rather oxidize with that just

2141
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,560
because nobody else has that pheno that

2142
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,719
strain because i grew it from seed

2143
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,039
and i liked it because of

2144
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,399
whatever reasons i liked it for versus

2145
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,439
like oh it's that clone that you can

2146
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,799
pick up at the shop for 20 bucks

2147
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:10,960
so with that being said are you somewhat

2148
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,119
kind of uh

2149
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,800
guard full of your clones given that you

2150
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:16,399
know you have gone through work to find

2151
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,800
the individual ones are you kind of of

2152
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,559
the mindset that you know to keep your

2153
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,640
work unique and

2154
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,840
in that regard you know still valuable

2155
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,520
in the consumer's eyes you want to

2156
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,840
somewhat limit the availability of the

2157
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,840
parents

2158
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,599
um so actually

2159
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,279
the only clone that i'm like that with

2160
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,199
is the star pupil

2161
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,840
because it's just such an amazing

2162
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,960
breeding cut like is it's just the world

2163
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,520
to me like

2164
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,079
it's it's an amazing amazing plant and

2165
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,760
so nobody has that um

2166
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,079
family members have that so in case i

2167
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,440
lose it i can get it back but nobody

2168
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:51,198
else has that

2169
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,639
no matter how much i trust them they

2170
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:55,919
just don't get it because then it's

2171
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,039
gonna get out um everything else i like

2172
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,920
to share

2173
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,479
because

2174
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,119
i'm really excited when i make a strain

2175
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,519
and then i find a really nice cut of it

2176
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,760
and it just represents exactly what it's

2177
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,280
going for i'm happy for people to grow

2178
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,960
that like especially if they don't want

2179
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,119
to dig through seeds i'll be like here

2180
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,880
try this cut like this is the thing on

2181
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,039
the front page of my

2182
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,039
catalog like this is that grow it out

2183
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:20,800
it's gonna look just like that and it's

2184
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,800
gonna smoke amazing

2185
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,560
you don't have to like you don't even

2186
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,880
have to dig through a pack of seeds like

2187
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,800
it's just here so i'm happy to share

2188
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,679
those really awesome plants that i get

2189
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,880
and

2190
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,560
some of them are actually going to be

2191
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,800
available soon through a few different

2192
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,199
clone exchanges so if

2193
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,840
you're lucky enough you'll be able to

2194
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:42,719
pick up a cut of like putang and ninja

2195
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,279
people rick's pupil

2196
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,119
um and then others in the future as i

2197
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,519
let him out slowly but

2198
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,439
usually like a few of my friends will

2199
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,760
get just about everything like even when

2200
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:56,158
i'm throwing other trains of whatever

2201
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,280
like looking for moms and female hunting

2202
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:59,119
stuff

2203
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,119
i definitely pass them off to friends so

2204
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,960
that if i want to get them back later i

2205
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,238
can or just

2206
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,480
like i know they're not going to get

2207
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:08,000
that far and if they do it's fine like

2208
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,599
if i don't want something out there i'm

2209
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,920
not going to let it out like the star

2210
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,600
people clone nobody has that so i don't

2211
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,679
have to worry about it and then i can't

2212
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,079
get mad because nothing you know nobody

2213
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:20,158
can do the wrong thing because it's just

2214
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,039
i believe everything

2215
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:22,960
is

2216
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,198
for every human everything is your own

2217
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,439
fault so whatever you do what

2218
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:28,879
circumstances you are you're in like

2219
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,158
it's because of something did or that

2220
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,520
you're doing or

2221
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:35,679
whatever like to an extent so

2222
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,600
yeah if you want people to grow your own

2223
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,760
let people grow your clone i don't want

2224
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,800
people to breathe with your clone don't

2225
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,920
let people have it and that's it

2226
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,320
yeah i think that's one of the most

2227
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,480
universal truths i've learned from all

2228
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,559
the interviews is that when you give

2229
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:53,119
something out even just to one friend

2230
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,800
it's out

2231
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:57,039
well yeah because i've been given clones

2232
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,960
by people that are like hey i'm not

2233
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:01,119
allowed to give you this like i'm gonna

2234
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,439
die if anyone finds out so just don't

2235
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:05,519
tell anyone that you have this

2236
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,039
and then i'm like alright cool thanks

2237
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,880
and then like all right don't trust that

2238
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,479
person with my clothes

2239
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,239
yeah no no

2240
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,599
i mean i would trust them with a clone

2241
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:15,759
to the extent that i know they might

2242
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,840
give it to somebody else usually that's

2243
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,280
fine with me but if it wasn't like

2244
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,800
that's your lesson right there you just

2245
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:23,039
learned that like

2246
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,119
you can't you can't trust people because

2247
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,640
every single person's gonna give you

2248
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,238
some kind of secret or like you know

2249
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,320
when you tell somebody a secret they

2250
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:32,158
tell one other person so

2251
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,158
every person you tell a secret to you're

2252
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,839
telling 10 people or like if you tell

2253
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,439
someone that you grow like 10 people

2254
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,119
find out

2255
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,279
it's along the same lines of that and

2256
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:43,198
it's fine like it's it's not even a bad

2257
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,039
thing it's just life it's like a lesson

2258
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:46,319
that everybody should just know about

2259
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,399
and

2260
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:50,479
you can compensate for it and good

2261
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:52,079
decisions

2262
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:53,519
yeah i agree

2263
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:55,600
so if we just loot back to a point you

2264
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,679
made you said uh you'd actually learnt a

2265
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,920
lot of things from d-man over the years

2266
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,440
d-man's well-known breeder for anyone

2267
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,560
who hasn't heard of him he's actually a

2268
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:04,238
little

2269
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,600
he's well recognized within the scene

2270
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,879
but i think he's a little lesser known

2271
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,199
which is a little bit of a shame because

2272
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,199
he's been around for ages but here's

2273
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:12,719
where the question is actually going was

2274
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,719
that initially when you were learning

2275
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,319
stuff from him was that via like online

2276
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,760
forums and stuff like were you around

2277
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,719
back then or was this much more of like

2278
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,920
a personal contact

2279
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,399
um

2280
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,000
no it was a little bit more recent i am

2281
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,799
on his forums

2282
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,439
but

2283
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,000
uh we started talking

2284
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,759
um basically i saw that he had

2285
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,359
acapulco gold

2286
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,520
which was like one of the strands that

2287
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,679
my mom had talked about

2288
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,280
from her day so

2289
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,800
it was a little before me like i never

2290
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:44,399
got to smoke it like

2291
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,920
fresh off the

2292
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,319
truck or wherever the hell it came from

2293
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,760
in a brick you know but

2294
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:51,439
um

2295
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,360
anyways i saw that he had that and i

2296
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:54,960
started talking to him and like

2297
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:56,079
somehow we just started talking to

2298
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,640
boston and

2299
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:00,640
now we just like text and stuff so

2300
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,640
anyways like he taught me a whole bunch

2301
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,840
of stuff because he was like dude what

2302
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,360
the hell like you're a little bit

2303
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,920
younger and you're interested in like

2304
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:09,839
these strains the land races like that's

2305
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,679
really cool like everybody these days

2306
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,920
just wants like

2307
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:16,319
og bush and stuff and you're here asking

2308
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,158
me about acapulco gold and like growing

2309
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,439
my panama's now

2310
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:21,599
anyways like

2311
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,719
we just got off to like

2312
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,560
we're like

2313
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,520
straight on the same foot right away and

2314
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,120
just like

2315
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,719
vibe super well

2316
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,319
and

2317
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,239
i was already like you know i was

2318
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,000
growing and making seeds a little and

2319
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,238
telling him about those and i sent him

2320
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,880
some of my star pupil swans

2321
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:40,959
and he was like dude i hate purple weed

2322
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,159
and i was like you do not understand i

2323
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,560
have something special here and like

2324
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,479
i'm not wasting time this [ __ ] is really

2325
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,039
strong and it's really enjoyable like

2326
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,678
it's not the same as most of the purple

2327
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,800
[ __ ] that's just purple and that's it

2328
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,800
like

2329
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,279
this is this is something i want you to

2330
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,880
try he tried it and he was like that's

2331
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,960
one of the first purples that i've

2332
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,079
really liked and he ended up asking me

2333
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,158
if he could breed with it because he

2334
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,399
liked it that much so

2335
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:10,799
it was cool like he gave me stuff that i

2336
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,639
really liked i gave him stuff that he

2337
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,800
ended up really liking too

2338
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:18,000
and uh one of my favorite strains of all

2339
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:20,400
time is hispanic powerhouse

2340
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,439
which is a panama red land race crossed

2341
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:22,719
with the

2342
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,960
f6

2343
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,920
g13 black widow

2344
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,239
and

2345
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,880
holy [ __ ] just

2346
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:34,319
i can't say enough about how [ __ ]

2347
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,719
amazing that strain is

2348
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,880
yeah wow i mean it's certainly been

2349
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,560
around for a long time

2350
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,600
raises an interesting question in my

2351
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,800
mind

2352
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,039
although you just mentioned you got the

2353
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,119
panama from d-man where do you go

2354
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:49,519
generally if you are looking to source

2355
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:53,840
these older genetics do you look to seed

2356
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,840
or just to kind of acquisition of clone

2357
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:58,959
um definitely to seeds

2358
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,679
because

2359
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,439
i don't usually take in many clones like

2360
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,199
i said um

2361
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:06,799
and when i do it's very rare for

2362
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,599
somebody to be like

2363
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,320
hey i got this clone of like

2364
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,079
i don't know 1980s like thai stick or

2365
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,079
something like i never see that in clone

2366
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,319
if i did i would take it for sure so if

2367
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:19,679
anybody's listening who has some

2368
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,439
you know

2369
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,760
hit me up but

2370
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,839
um yeah i'm usually digging through

2371
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,800
seeds

2372
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,279
and just

2373
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,679
getting them from random ass like

2374
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,079
sometimes there's like a random website

2375
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,079
in uh

2376
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,079
in denmark that has like all these cool

2377
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:40,079
land races and stuff

2378
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,158
and some of them are recent and some of

2379
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:44,760
them are really old they got like

2380
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:47,519
some jamaicans that are 1960 cross of

2381
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:50,239
1985 and pollination

2382
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,679
jamaican sativa they're like 14 to 20

2383
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:52,639
week flower

2384
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,239
so

2385
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,520
it was just like somebody sent me a link

2386
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:57,198
they're just like hey check out this

2387
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,199
website we have like all these cool

2388
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:01,359
things so i think the seeds are really

2389
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,359
really amazing because then if you don't

2390
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,880
find a good plant you can open pollinate

2391
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:06,960
and then eventually

2392
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,800
find something that's like

2393
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,880
a little bit reasonable to work with and

2394
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,920
go from there

2395
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,319
yeah for sure i mean it it it almost

2396
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:19,279
seems like you would never get offered a

2397
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,238
clone of tie right

2398
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:24,079
yeah

2399
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:25,919
i mean i wonder if anybody has like

2400
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,158
people definitely have some but i don't

2401
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,319
think it's that common like yeah you

2402
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:33,198
gotta remember most of these people are

2403
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:35,119
on the internet

2404
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:36,960
yeah oh yeah especially in europe

2405
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:39,679
there's a huge i think i was actually

2406
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,920
talking to kagu and he said there's in

2407
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:44,000
europe there's and spain specifically

2408
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,079
there's people who have like some of the

2409
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,079
best land races on earth and they hoard

2410
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:53,039
it and they do not want it to get out

2411
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:55,198
yeah i bet especially like

2412
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,198
i always wonder

2413
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,960
when all that [ __ ] went from

2414
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:01,198
here to the netherlands and then it all

2415
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,079
became like the same [ __ ]

2416
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:04,319
like

2417
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:05,600
all those breeders like they must have

2418
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:07,439
original

2419
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,760
parental stock that's actually a little

2420
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,238
bit more unique than the watertown dutch

2421
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,760
hybrids of today you know like

2422
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:15,839
there's got to be a lot of unique stuff

2423
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,840
still floating around

2424
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,319
yeah well like i mean the easiest

2425
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:23,119
example you can point to is that

2426
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:26,399
uh neville has said in interviews he's

2427
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,399
still got lots of stock

2428
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,359
yeah i bet he has some amazing things

2429
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,599
i know and i know there's there's like

2430
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,679
groups in california preservationists

2431
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,520
that have all these land races

2432
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,119
and they have clones and seeds and

2433
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,400
everything and they just don't give it

2434
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,158
out to anybody

2435
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:43,839
and on one hand it's awesome that

2436
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:44,879
they're preserving it but i'm a little

2437
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,719
like

2438
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,600
why wouldn't you share it like you know

2439
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,520
how much this means to people and like

2440
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,360
it could be kind of a fresh start for a

2441
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,120
gene pool for tons of people that want

2442
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:58,079
to [ __ ] around with it and try breeding

2443
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:59,039
a little or just preserve themselves too

2444
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:00,880
like

2445
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,639
i don't really i don't know i understand

2446
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,159
hoarding but

2447
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:08,319
it gets tricky when it's like dude

2448
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:10,638
you're hoarding like the last [ __ ]

2449
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:12,960
seeds of this strain that like yeah you

2450
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:14,560
could just let out people and it's like

2451
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,480
especially in seed forms like why

2452
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:20,080
wouldn't you

2453
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:21,919
yeah the last pure building blocks

2454
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:23,519
yeah exactly because it's so hard to

2455
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:27,039
find anything

2456
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:29,840
really like pure these days

2457
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:31,679
yeah so something i did wanted to ask is

2458
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,520
like much of your work it draws on

2459
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,679
strains which might broadly be

2460
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,920
considered old school in general things

2461
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:41,600
like even flow evelyn amnesia panama was

2462
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,800
this an intentional decision or is it

2463
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,800
just kind of how it worked out

2464
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,719
um i guess it's just the plants that

2465
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,840
vibe with me really

2466
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:54,880
i don't like a lot of the new school

2467
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,279
kind of stuff that much and

2468
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,359
like i grow a lot of plants and a lot of

2469
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,639
them never get to see the light of day

2470
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,399
because i'm just like

2471
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:04,079
[ __ ] this plant it sucks like i was

2472
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:06,238
smoking a few times and be like nope not

2473
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,359
my vibe next like

2474
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:09,279
um

2475
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,799
and it's mostly newer stuff that tends

2476
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:13,198
to

2477
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,279
blend together as like the strains you

2478
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,599
don't even remember growing after a year

2479
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:19,759
because they just weren't anything stand

2480
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,520
out and then a lot of these standout

2481
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,360
plants that i find

2482
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:27,040
tend to be like

2483
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:29,039
a haze or a panama or like

2484
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:30,000
you know just something a little bit

2485
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,800
older

2486
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,840
a little bit less common for sure

2487
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,199
um

2488
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,440
and it's usually because they have

2489
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:40,719
unique effects or unique flavors or a

2490
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,519
combination of those

2491
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,399
yeah

2492
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,080
so

2493
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:47,839
do you think that it's possible to

2494
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:50,238
through breeding with these old land

2495
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,440
races to kind of create the next sliced

2496
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:54,000
bread like something that's really

2497
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:56,000
unique really different it's gonna kind

2498
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,600
of spur off its own

2499
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,198
tree of lineage and whatnot or do you

2500
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,880
think that you can create something

2501
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,719
unique but it's not gonna have like the

2502
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,480
same impact as

2503
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,840
you know if you created like skunk back

2504
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,839
in the day or something like that

2505
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:13,198
um no you definitely you can change the

2506
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,800
world with the single hundred for sure

2507
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:16,158
it doesn't matter what year you're in

2508
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,760
you could do it right now you could do

2509
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,960
it ten years from now you can do it ten

2510
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,679
years ago

2511
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,359
um like

2512
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,119
i don't know for me

2513
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,039
like one example would be girl scout

2514
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,158
cookies which is a strain that i really

2515
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:29,279
don't like

2516
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:31,039
but

2517
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:33,439
if you think about it

2518
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:35,359
it's in so many things right now there's

2519
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,198
i could name tons of companies that

2520
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:38,880
exist solely because of girl scout

2521
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,479
cookies because their entire line is

2522
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,639
girl scout cookies crosses something

2523
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,238
across to something so

2524
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,159
for example whoever

2525
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:48,319
popped that girl's got a cookie seed and

2526
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:50,399
who knows what the real story is but

2527
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:53,519
there was a plan people liked it people

2528
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:55,119
read with it that's plain and simple so

2529
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,679
you know if i make something with a

2530
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,920
couple land races in it and somebody

2531
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,679
really really likes it or maybe it's a

2532
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,000
phone that gets out that's like super

2533
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,319
exceptional or maybe it's just seed

2534
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,679
stock that people agreed with like

2535
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:09,198
it doesn't really matter

2536
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,800
if you make something good or special

2537
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:13,279
that people like

2538
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,000
then it's gonna get used in hybrids just

2539
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,158
like

2540
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,960
you know chem dog is in a ton of things

2541
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:19,039
too

2542
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,880
and that's it's just because people

2543
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:21,920
liked it and that's about all there is

2544
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,440
to it

2545
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,840
and like with cookies it's not even

2546
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:28,719
stable and people still like it like you

2547
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,800
get so many herms off it but

2548
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,639
people like something about it and

2549
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,639
it made a big dent

2550
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:37,760
for there

2551
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:40,239
so with that in mind would you let a

2552
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,079
plant which was the next sliced bread to

2553
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:44,000
you but it happened to throw some nana's

2554
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,920
would that be like a red flag or would

2555
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,439
you just still go with it keeping in

2556
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,440
mind what we just said about cookies

2557
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,840
um

2558
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,319
in what regard because for example when

2559
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,560
i release seeds i make sure that they're

2560
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,479
pretty damn stable that they're not

2561
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,159
going to earn all over the place

2562
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:04,079
and i test them and i have other people

2563
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,759
test them in their environments and hear

2564
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,279
back from them like

2565
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,079
you know i did this and this and this

2566
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:12,158
and it survived it and whatever anyways

2567
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,960
um i believe first of all everybody

2568
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:15,119
should

2569
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,158
do some solid testing before releasing

2570
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:17,279
seeds

2571
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,198
unless you're saying that they're

2572
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,279
testers which is different like freebies

2573
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:22,638
whatever you can say like untested

2574
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:24,079
freebies

2575
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,319
but

2576
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:27,600
um if i'm releasing seeds i want to see

2577
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:29,759
it stable

2578
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,239
it's a clone

2579
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,400
i pretty much also want to see it be

2580
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:36,158
really stable because

2581
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,399
i don't want to give somebody a clone

2582
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:40,238
and then it turns their garden and like

2583
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:41,920
you know somebody's garden is sometimes

2584
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:43,198
they're livelihood and all they're just

2585
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,719
seated and

2586
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:46,319
they can't make rent the next month

2587
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,359
because they had to toss everything like

2588
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:48,399
that's

2589
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:50,158
not a good

2590
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:52,238
thing to happen so i mean you try to

2591
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,198
really minimize

2592
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:56,879
the possibility of like permanent [ __ ]

2593
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:59,039
and i guess the exception would be like

2594
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,039
sterile mandarins if you prove that the

2595
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:02,319
nanners have no viable pollen every

2596
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,479
single time

2597
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:06,079
and you try using that pollen to make a

2598
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:08,399
seed and make sure

2599
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:11,920
then like maybe in a clone only kind of

2600
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:13,279
thing it might be fine like i think

2601
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,039
chem d

2602
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:16,960
i was deported is gonna do that like

2603
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:19,039
it'll probably hurt but there won't be

2604
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,560
viable calling so don't worry about that

2605
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:21,279
kind of thing

2606
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,120
so

2607
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:24,639
i mean in that case it's totally fine i

2608
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:26,960
guess

2609
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,880
well i mean it certainly feels like the

2610
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,319
devil's kind of in the details and i was

2611
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,679
talking to me and gene about this at the

2612
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,198
emerald cup and

2613
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,319
he kind of raised this interesting

2614
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:36,559
question you know he said what if you

2615
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:39,759
create australian as a breeder and it's

2616
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:42,159
fire like dead set the best thing ever

2617
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,840
but like 50 you don't it's only like 50

2618
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,920
percent of the phenoes and the other 50

2619
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,920
percent like wilhelm and even if you

2620
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,399
work on it for a generation or two or

2621
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,639
reselect the parents it just seems to be

2622
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:55,679
the inevitable outcome like what do you

2623
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:55,679
do in that situation

2624
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,480
um

2625
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:03,119
i mean how much better is this strain

2626
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:06,718
than the next best strain that you have

2627
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:09,599
you know like really really good

2628
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:11,679
yeah i don't know i mean

2629
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,600
like once one solution that got thrown

2630
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:15,279
around was like you offer it with that

2631
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,760
information out there and maybe at a

2632
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:20,158
reduced price that was just one solution

2633
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,239
that got thrown around

2634
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:25,439
i usually see him at triple price with

2635
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:28,000
no warning but knocking it into that

2636
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:30,158
i see a lot of breeders putting out

2637
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,319
current packs for 300 bucks and they

2638
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:34,079
don't even have the warning on them but

2639
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:36,399
you hear it through people and then you

2640
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:39,119
try it and you see it's true but anyways

2641
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,399
yeah i think the right thing to do

2642
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,479
is either

2643
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:43,839
you don't release it or you release it

2644
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:45,119
with that warning

2645
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,279
and

2646
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:49,198
probably as a freebie with the warning

2647
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:49,880
like i don't know even if it's really

2648
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:51,279
[ __ ] good

2649
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,199
[Music]

2650
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:55,519
you don't have to sell it if it's if

2651
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:57,198
it's gonna cause problems

2652
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,880
and

2653
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:01,599
yeah i don't know i would

2654
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,199
i would probably say don't sell hermes

2655
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,679
stuff

2656
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:08,319
uh even if you haven't warned me it's

2657
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,000
probably just better not to because

2658
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:11,439
somebody is going to trade that pack and

2659
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,880
they're going to lose the warning the

2660
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:14,799
next person is going to get [ __ ] over

2661
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,119
and he's gonna be mad at you the breeder

2662
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,760
i don't know it's too much there's so

2663
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:21,840
many other good plants that

2664
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,079
you don't need to worry about crazy

2665
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,920
hermes

2666
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:27,679
yeah of course it's kind of like as

2667
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,840
we're having this conversation it dawns

2668
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,520
on me how like kind of funny it is like

2669
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,920
yeah you probably shouldn't sell hermes

2670
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,920
seeds

2671
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,439
so

2672
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:41,679
what do you think about this idea of

2673
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:44,158
breeders who release lions with new

2674
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:47,039
parents each cycle whether it be due to

2675
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:49,359
laziness or due to the fact that there

2676
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,439
could be some advantages to doing so do

2677
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:53,279
you think any potential advantages are

2678
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,519
offset by potential disadvantages or

2679
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:56,880
what do you think of that idea in

2680
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:58,800
general um if you're going to do that

2681
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,560
you just have to tell people

2682
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,159
and you have to test each generation

2683
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,560
before you release it so let's say

2684
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:07,439
you're first you make this new strain

2685
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,880
and then you release it and it's the f1s

2686
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:11,359
and then the next year you run out of

2687
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,920
those so you make some f2s like just

2688
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:16,559
tell people that it's f2s and then test

2689
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,079
those f2s and see like okay maybe

2690
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,800
there's a little bit different things

2691
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,399
coming out of here like explain that but

2692
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,079
the problem i have with a lot of seeds

2693
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,920
is that there's zero information when

2694
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:28,238
you buy them from a lot of breeders

2695
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,520
there's just a name and the cross and

2696
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,238
that's it

2697
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,560
and

2698
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,158
that kind of sucks because

2699
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,239
i don't know i try to give out the

2700
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:37,759
information on my strains that i would

2701
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,000
want to see if i was buying it from

2702
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,679
somebody else so like i'll put out as

2703
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,760
much information as i can think of and

2704
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,600
then if people ask me questions

2705
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,679
i'll even add that to my description

2706
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,800
where i can like on my website and stuff

2707
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:52,880
like try to be super thorough

2708
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,239
and

2709
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,840
i don't know just so people know what

2710
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:57,439
they're getting like if if you're buying

2711
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,199
a certain strain and then it's totally

2712
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,799
different from what you bought last year

2713
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:02,238
but it's from a breeder

2714
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,840
and it's because they use different

2715
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:05,039
parents like

2716
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,000
i don't know i would want to know that

2717
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,840
it's version two or version five like

2718
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,399
some some readers have like a couple

2719
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,079
versions of the same strain and they're

2720
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:16,399
labeled that and maybe there's not much

2721
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:19,198
info but at least you know like okay i

2722
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,719
grew e3 last year now i'm throwing v5

2723
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:23,039
versus like

2724
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,719
just expecting the same thing when it's

2725
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:26,079
not because no two parents are going to

2726
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,560
combine the same

2727
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,960
ever they might be close but

2728
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:34,800
definitely not the same

2729
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:37,439
yeah okay and how do you feel about f2s

2730
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,159
that get sold which then a kind of you

2731
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:40,399
know

2732
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:42,799
crazy high pricing because something i

2733
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:44,399
hear people which they say to me is is

2734
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,400
there's a bit of a question mark over

2735
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:48,399
the f2s in the sense that from a

2736
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:50,960
breeding point of view it could be more

2737
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:52,638
ideal but from a consumer point of view

2738
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,920
it's probably less ideal because as you

2739
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,679
loosely reference you're gonna get

2740
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,079
things popping up which probably not

2741
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,920
intended like i mean when you make an f1

2742
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:01,679
i don't think many people think about

2743
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,119
yeah so when i eventually make some f2s

2744
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,800
like i definitely want people to have

2745
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:06,800
one of these grandparent phenos popping

2746
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,079
up like i just think it's a totally not

2747
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,119
a thought that goes through your mind

2748
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:11,039
and so

2749
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:12,238
the the the criticism i hear is that you

2750
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,800
know effectively you're going to get

2751
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:16,559
less phenotypes which you would see in

2752
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,960
the f1 which is probably what you're

2753
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,199
looking for right and um and then

2754
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,279
likewise it's kind of like

2755
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:25,198
sometimes f2s can be done quite

2756
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:26,800
improperly with small selection pools

2757
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:30,678
and whatnot like how do you feel about

2758
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,679
the f2 offering in general

2759
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:35,439
i never understood why people

2760
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,560
asked for more money for an f2

2761
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:38,479
i always thought it should be the

2762
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,159
opposite i have two is like okay you got

2763
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:41,678
lazy you didn't keep your parents and

2764
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,399
you can't recreate the same seat so

2765
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:46,079
you're doing the next best thing you can

2766
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:47,519
or you can look at it the other way and

2767
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:49,039
say you're taking into generation

2768
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,440
forward and doing more work and more

2769
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:52,319
selections which is also true

2770
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:54,238
but

2771
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:56,238
in that case it kind of evens out it's

2772
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,439
like a plus and a minus but it really

2773
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:59,279
depends

2774
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,238
what your style is what you're trying to

2775
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:01,119
offer

2776
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,079
um

2777
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:04,880
like d-man likes to release f2s

2778
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:07,119
for

2779
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,279
almost a preservation type

2780
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:11,039
reason where it's like you have

2781
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:13,679
more phenos that are coming out and

2782
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:15,359
there's a little more variety

2783
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,359
than the solid f1 where there's just

2784
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,799
like say two phenols and four females

2785
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:20,639
that are very tight

2786
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,400
maybe your f2 will open it up a little

2787
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,800
bit and

2788
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:27,039
offer more diversity

2789
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,119
which in some cases is really important

2790
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:30,880
and in other cases it is your worst

2791
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:33,039
enemy it just depends what you want to

2792
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,560
grow and why so

2793
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:36,000
i think there's room for everything

2794
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,239
there's room for like

2795
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,319
super work lines there's room for solid

2796
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:42,559
f1s that can be reproduced by the

2797
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,840
breeder with the same pairs every time

2798
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:48,480
there's room for f2s and f3s and

2799
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,520
i like to use f2 sometimes like

2800
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:51,198
in

2801
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,040
an f1 hybrid you know like make

2802
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:55,119
something take it to f2 and then cross

2803
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,840
that f2 like find what you're looking

2804
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:59,599
for in f2 and just process it

2805
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,360
to another mother or something like that

2806
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,000
and sometimes you can pull out some

2807
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:04,960
really unique stuff that way

2808
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,359
um

2809
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,359
so i don't know there's there's

2810
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:11,039
there's just a reason for everything so

2811
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:13,279
it just depends what you're going for

2812
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:16,000
and why

2813
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:18,079
so i mean you referenced the the 300

2814
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,840
packs of seeds and i'm sure many people

2815
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:22,000
can think of even more expensive ones

2816
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,920
than that what's your position on seed

2817
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,520
pricing do you think that it should just

2818
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,199
be like a capitalist thing where you

2819
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,600
know people set their own prices and the

2820
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:31,359
market determines supply and demand or

2821
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,760
do you think that there should be some

2822
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:36,719
sort of i don't want to say like pricing

2823
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,880
structure but like essentially you know

2824
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,960
you can't just go ripping people off

2825
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,639
with f1s versus maybe some other project

2826
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:46,319
which has got a lot of work being put

2827
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,319
into it where do you sit on it

2828
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:51,279
yeah pricing is always tricky

2829
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,039
because like you said like you can price

2830
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:54,880
something and then just see people buy

2831
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,198
it or not but like

2832
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,920
in my opinion the best thing to do is

2833
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:01,039
like price fairly so whatever fair is to

2834
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,639
you

2835
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:06,880
and obviously everybody has different uh

2836
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,679
image of like what fare means like for

2837
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,279
me my prices had to go up like a year or

2838
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:13,119
two ago because

2839
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,039
it just wasn't cutting it i was working

2840
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:17,519
way too hard for what i was getting and

2841
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:19,279
it wasn't quite adding up so i just had

2842
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,440
to change it a little and i felt bad

2843
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:23,279
even raising it so i was like we'll see

2844
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,319
how it goes and i'll put it a little

2845
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:25,920
higher and

2846
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:27,679
that will allow me to do everything that

2847
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,158
i need to do and bring out some awesome

2848
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:32,639
stuff and hopefully people will be happy

2849
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:34,079
with it and then i saw people charging

2850
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:35,679
three or five times as much as i was

2851
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,600
charging anyways i was like all right i

2852
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:39,920
don't feel that bad like this is what's

2853
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,920
fair to me this works for me

2854
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,920
this will hopefully work for the people

2855
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,880
that want to grow my strains at least

2856
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,719
most of them can afford it um i don't

2857
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,480
know i think

2858
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,399
that's just me though like every breeder

2859
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:54,718
has their own five and some people's

2860
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,158
vibe is like let me charge 500 for this

2861
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,840
pack and only

2862
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:59,839
the people that really want it can have

2863
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,199
it and like i understand that like

2864
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,159
sometimes if i have something more

2865
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:04,000
limited

2866
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,599
it's almost on that kind of it's not

2867
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,960
going to be 500 bucks but it's going to

2868
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,880
be a little more expensive because

2869
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,239
there's so little amount of packs that

2870
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,639
it's like

2871
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,718
this is only going to exist one time and

2872
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,279
whoever can get this is like your only

2873
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,639
little chance and then it's just gone

2874
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:20,238
but

2875
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,000
for whatever reason like sometimes

2876
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:23,678
there's a mom that you can grow or a

2877
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,439
giant and you still get a very low

2878
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,039
amount of seeds off of it and then it's

2879
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:28,879
just like

2880
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:31,039
that this is what you're left with and

2881
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,719
like or maybe you lost the clone and it

2882
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,800
gets more rare because of that you never

2883
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:37,198
make the seeds again or

2884
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:39,520
you lost both parents and it's super out

2885
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:40,879
of the question or whatever like if

2886
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,760
something's rare

2887
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,920
maybe charge more or something

2888
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,159
super like if you put a [ __ ] ton of work

2889
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,719
into something and you can improve it

2890
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:53,198
and it's really really awesome like

2891
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:55,359
charge whatever you want for it but

2892
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:58,638
the only problem i have with c pricing

2893
01:35:55,359 --> 01:36:00,799
is when stuff is expensive and it's bad

2894
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,840
or it's unstable like there's a couple

2895
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,360
pretty

2896
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,840
well-known breeders out there that are

2897
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:07,198
charging anywhere from 100 to a few

2898
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,319
hundred bucks

2899
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,118
and

2900
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,118
their stuff is very loaded with hermes

2901
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:15,118
all over the place and undesirable

2902
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:16,639
phenotypes and

2903
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:18,559
you know there's there's certain ones

2904
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:21,279
that people just know i mean a lot of

2905
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:24,000
people don't know but people that know

2906
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,840
know that you're gonna pop five packs

2907
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,359
and you find that one keeper that looks

2908
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,719
like the photo and then

2909
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,079
that's gonna be your one that doesn't

2910
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,480
hurt and then hopefully from there it's

2911
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:34,319
good smoke if you're lucky and it's like

2912
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:35,439
why go through that [ __ ] when you

2913
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,079
like

2914
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:39,599
spend 70 bucks on like a body pack and

2915
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:42,880
just you know

2916
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:45,360
it's almost always something good

2917
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,039
yeah i can definitely attest to that and

2918
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:48,559
you you're kind of hitting on a point

2919
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:50,000
which i really wanted to bring up

2920
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,239
because something that i've noticed

2921
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,600
happens more often than not is that

2922
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:55,439
there are people

2923
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,960
maybe shady's not the right word but as

2924
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:58,238
you describe

2925
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,000
charging a lot for things which

2926
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:01,759
shouldn't be priced that high especially

2927
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,920
given there may be hermes or things like

2928
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,280
that and there are certainly lots of

2929
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,199
people within the scene and the

2930
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:09,439
community who are aware of this and

2931
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:11,599
aware of the the types of results you're

2932
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:13,279
going to get but more often than not

2933
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,119
nothing gets said because people don't

2934
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:16,639
want to rock the boat do you think that

2935
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:18,399
it's a bit of a mistake that we're in

2936
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,319
this mindset because

2937
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:22,399
so often you know it just seems like

2938
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:23,920
that's the case where people know the

2939
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,799
shady things that are going on but just

2940
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,800
no one says anything

2941
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:31,840
dude that's such a good point and it's

2942
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:34,479
really tough because as a breeder myself

2943
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,560
i don't want to make enemies and even

2944
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:38,959
just as a grower as a person who likes

2945
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,800
to plant i don't want to make enemies

2946
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:43,600
and i know that if i go call someone out

2947
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,560
on their [ __ ] that really quickly is

2948
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,239
going to be

2949
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,679
like all right this person doesn't like

2950
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:50,238
you but guess what all his friends

2951
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,760
[ __ ] hate you too and then you know

2952
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:53,678
it becomes a war

2953
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,119
and there's there's no time for that

2954
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,920
like

2955
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:59,679
i

2956
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:02,079
i don't know it's really tricky because

2957
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:04,399
the best thing that i can do is just do

2958
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:06,000
my best and try to encourage people like

2959
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:07,599
to see that but

2960
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,439
hey here's what i stand for and this is

2961
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,039
how i think things should be and if

2962
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:13,198
somebody asked me directly like do you

2963
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,399
have experience with so and so breeder

2964
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:19,198
or some strain i can tell i'm like yeah

2965
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,799
yeah it's all hermes unfortunately but

2966
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,279
whatever like

2967
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,480
i don't know it's pretty

2968
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:25,439
tricky

2969
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:27,439
just

2970
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:29,839
i don't know i don't think everyone

2971
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,519
should be as quiet about it as they are

2972
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,440
i do see people commenting once in a

2973
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,119
while that most people do stay quiet and

2974
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:37,118
i think it's just because

2975
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:39,118
people are scared of getting enemies and

2976
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:41,519
then like the more popular you get the

2977
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:43,039
more you don't want to have enemies

2978
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,880
like i don't know i totally stay out of

2979
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:46,560
drama whenever possible

2980
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,039
but at the same time i feel really bad

2981
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,480
for like the people who just don't know

2982
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,039
that they're about to waste their money

2983
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:55,599
on someone else's ear but like

2984
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,840
i don't know as as my own self i can't

2985
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:00,320
be like hey don't buy that strain by my

2986
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,560
string like mine stabilizes and like

2987
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:04,238
that just looks shitty so i'm not gonna

2988
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,840
do that

2989
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:07,759
yeah

2990
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,520
it's a tough one to navigate so i mean

2991
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,280
in general how do you feel about the

2992
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,560
state of our community in general i

2993
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,639
think at the moment

2994
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,800
we're kind of at a bit of a low point in

2995
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,880
terms of the internal drama like i think

2996
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,320
if you look back a couple months ago

2997
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,920
there was a lot of drama going on it

2998
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:23,599
seems like we're kind of you know things

2999
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,199
are all pretty chill at the moment do

3000
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,199
you think this is things are better this

3001
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:29,599
way or did you think like that the drama

3002
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:32,319
generates necessary conversation how do

3003
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,320
you feel about it

3004
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:34,399
um

3005
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,239
[Music]

3006
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:37,679
i don't know i probably missed whatever

3007
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:39,118
drama you're talking about because i

3008
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:42,319
think there's certain people that need

3009
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:44,799
to be called out that maybe haven't but

3010
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:47,118
i'm not going to do it um especially

3011
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,279
because i have no personal problems with

3012
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:51,519
them it's more of just seeing what's

3013
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:53,840
what people are doing whatever

3014
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:56,960
i don't know i i think dramas is

3015
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,079
not good but at the same time people

3016
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,560
need to

3017
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,399
know what's going on

3018
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,600
like

3019
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,519
um

3020
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,600
i don't know everybody's in their own

3021
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,280
kind of circles in their own zones and

3022
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,800
whatever

3023
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:13,439
and some people

3024
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,199
have a really wide scope and view of

3025
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:16,960
like

3026
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:19,279
what's going on with everyone and other

3027
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,039
people are like yeah i only follow like

3028
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,960
this guy this guy in this guy and that's

3029
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:24,639
all i know and i'm cool with it and

3030
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,840
that's fine too so

3031
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:28,960
there's like

3032
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:31,279
i don't i don't really know what's

3033
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,000
the big picture because i kind of stick

3034
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,840
like

3035
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,840
who i vibe with specifically

3036
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,360
and i usually ignore the drama just

3037
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,079
because like when there's drama i do

3038
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:43,359
know there's always two sides to it like

3039
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,359
even if one of them is your friend and

3040
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:47,039
one of them's your enemy like they both

3041
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:48,719
have partial truths and you don't know

3042
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,479
where to sit so it's like

3043
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:52,880
i'm gonna stay out of that personally

3044
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,638
and just go by like how that person's

3045
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,960
affected me directly or what i see

3046
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,480
directly from them and just

3047
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,840
take it from there

3048
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:01,519
yeah

3049
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,679
so one of the topics we love to chat

3050
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,000
about on this show the roadkill skunk

3051
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,679
you know very elusive origins hard to

3052
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,039
pin down everyone's got some cool

3053
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,880
stories about it do you have any

3054
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:13,359
experiences with the roadkill skunk by

3055
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,359
any chance

3056
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,320
yeah um

3057
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,400
my opinion on this going is that

3058
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,238
basically like there's

3059
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:24,879
everybody's searching for this strain

3060
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:26,718
that smells just like a skunk and i've

3061
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,600
had it a couple times

3062
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:31,439
um i mean i've had different trains that

3063
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,920
have that quality whether one of them

3064
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:36,158
was actually called skunk and a couple

3065
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,560
others were just other strains

3066
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:40,158
and something interesting that i noticed

3067
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,480
that i wanted to talk about with that

3068
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:44,238
was um

3069
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,638
a lot of times you could get a bag of

3070
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:49,439
wheat and it just smells like a skunk

3071
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:52,000
but that's like before you even open it

3072
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,039
and it smells super skunky through the

3073
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,198
bag

3074
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:57,679
and then when you open it and you smell

3075
01:41:55,198 --> 01:41:59,118
it sometimes it's totally different

3076
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,199
which would also mean that when you're

3077
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:02,719
growing in the plant it might totally

3078
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:04,559
not really smell like a skunk at the

3079
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,639
moment but then when you get in the

3080
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,480
right conditions whether it's

3081
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:10,400
in a bag or maybe in a certain

3082
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,959
temperature or something like that then

3083
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:15,679
the skunkiness comes out more

3084
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:17,600
and it seems like

3085
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:19,279
a lot of times that skunk smell

3086
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,520
experience is like smelling it through a

3087
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:24,000
bag or smelling it

3088
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,840
from a distance or something like that

3089
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,319
um because recently

3090
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,840
somebody gave me some blood and i

3091
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:31,198
smelled it like i just smelled the bag

3092
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,719
that he gave me i didn't even open it

3093
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:34,559
because it smelled so strong through and

3094
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:37,118
it was straight skunk and i was like

3095
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,119
dude this smells so skunky and he looked

3096
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:40,238
at me like i was an idiot

3097
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:43,679
like i didn't know what i was talking

3098
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:45,678
about and he's like what and then he's

3099
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:48,800
like dude take it out and smell it like

3100
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:50,480
it's totally butter it's creamy it's og

3101
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,239
it's not skunky at all

3102
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:54,319
and i opened it and i cracked it a

3103
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:55,839
little bit and he was so right it was

3104
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:57,920
completely different than when the bag

3105
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:00,719
was sealed and it was just like

3106
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:02,560
only those skunk turps were

3107
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:04,399
permeating through the bag or whatever

3108
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:07,280
so

3109
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:09,679
that's definitely a thing with the skunk

3110
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,880
i think it's certain terpenes that will

3111
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:13,359
come out

3112
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:15,440
in certain conditions and

3113
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:17,118
they can definitely be masked by other

3114
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:18,559
ones where you're actually like up close

3115
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:20,238
with the pod

3116
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,199
yeah see that's really interesting it's

3117
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:22,718
like

3118
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:24,399
i you know never had anyone really

3119
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,920
suggest that so that's some good food

3120
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,238
for thought but the first thing that

3121
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:30,399
jumps to mind for me is that it would

3122
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:32,000
almost indicate that maybe this skunky

3123
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:32,879
profile that people are chasing is

3124
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,039
actually

3125
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,118
a more simplistic one so to speak and as

3126
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,600
you said the bag is kind of filtering

3127
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:41,118
certain maybe more complex just for

3128
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,880
whatever reason terpenes that aren't

3129
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:44,559
making it through and and what we're

3130
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,480
looking for is actually more of a simple

3131
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:52,800
profile than a super complex one per se

3132
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:54,319
yeah definitely and it could be just a

3133
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,000
terpene that's

3134
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,000
like one single terpene or maybe a

3135
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,679
certain combination that really

3136
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,760
permeates through the bag and then like

3137
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:03,520
you said it's holding in all the finer

3138
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,960
more complex ones

3139
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,280
which may actually

3140
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:10,319
smell stronger once you do get to them

3141
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:10,319
by opening bags

3142
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,639
yeah okay that's yeah that's definitely

3143
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:16,238
some food for thought so did you ever

3144
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,840
smoke any growing up or do you have any

3145
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:20,879
cool stories about anything you smoked

3146
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,920
while growing up

3147
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,760
yeah um i mean i got

3148
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,440
skunked one time

3149
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,199
i don't know what skunk it was it was

3150
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:30,638
just skunk when i got it from the dude

3151
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:31,759
and it was just

3152
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:34,800
straight up

3153
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:36,880
that one smelled like a skunk even

3154
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,400
without the bag but especially through

3155
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,079
the bag like i was trying to hide this

3156
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:42,479
well i didn't know about glass jars yet

3157
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:44,559
because i was just starting to smoke and

3158
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:46,000
my whole everywhere everywhere i went

3159
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,600
with that thing just smelled like a

3160
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,679
skunk behind me

3161
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,960
but um

3162
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:54,480
yeah i got

3163
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,480
some cool stories um

3164
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:59,198
oh yeah this is a phone so

3165
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,959
one of the first few times that i smoked

3166
01:44:59,198 --> 01:45:03,519
it was back when like smoking was still

3167
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,079
an adventure it was like not casual yet

3168
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,760
for me and my friend so it was like

3169
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:10,559
dude i know this spot we can get some

3170
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,480
weed i was in um albany with a couple of

3171
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,280
friends like staying for a weekend with

3172
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:15,039
them

3173
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:16,719
and he was like you're not even to

3174
01:45:15,039 --> 01:45:19,679
believe this but i know where we can get

3175
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:21,520
this weed in the city there's like

3176
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,359
this house that you have to go to

3177
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,960
there's like kind of an apartment

3178
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:26,719
building and then

3179
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,158
you walk down this hall and then there's

3180
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:29,039
a door and you

3181
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:30,399
like

3182
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:32,000
knock on the door and it's called the

3183
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:33,839
knock knock house and the dude sticks

3184
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,679
his fingers through the thing and then

3185
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,679
he asks you what you want and i'm like

3186
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,719
dude that's so [ __ ] that's not a

3187
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:40,239
real thing

3188
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,000
and basically

3189
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:43,359
we went and

3190
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,039
it was like i know what street it's on

3191
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,839
we just got to find the right house like

3192
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:48,719
we'll just try it and so like give us a

3193
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,760
win

3194
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,279
and uh

3195
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,960
we went into those

3196
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:54,639
buildings like yes this red one here and

3197
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,960
we we go in and then we knock on this

3198
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,719
door nothing happens so he opens the

3199
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,639
door and we just walk in

3200
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:03,118
and we're just this dude's kitchen and

3201
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:04,960
he's just like smoking a bong

3202
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:06,238
and so we're like all right yeah this

3203
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,679
must be it

3204
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:09,678
so now we just like walked in some

3205
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,639
random person's apartment that was like

3206
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:14,239
not the right thing at all

3207
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,199
and he just happened to be smoking weed

3208
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:17,279
too

3209
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:18,879
and then

3210
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:20,319
we're just like oh sorry i think we're

3211
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,719
at the wrong place

3212
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:24,559
and we went back in the hall and then we

3213
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:25,679
went down the hall and found the actual

3214
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,800
one

3215
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:31,359
and i'm dead serious it was like my

3216
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,760
friend knocked on the door and this dude

3217
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,198
stuck his fingers through the mail slot

3218
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,280
like you know those like horizontal

3219
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:38,879
mailbot things yeah

3220
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:41,359
and he's like yo look inside here's the

3221
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,039
menu and it was like three things i

3222
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:44,158
don't remember what the first one was

3223
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:45,519
but it was

3224
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:48,238
it was like

3225
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,639
miz and then there was green crack and

3226
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:53,039
the miz was 10 a gram and the green

3227
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:56,000
crack was 25 which is the highest that

3228
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:57,519
i've ever paid for anything

3229
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,920
and

3230
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,679
my buddy was just like dude i hear the

3231
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,239
myths they spray with windex like we

3232
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:06,960
can't get the bids you gotta get the the

3233
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:09,039
good stuff and i was like holy [ __ ] all

3234
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,359
right so

3235
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:15,600
we we just got into the screen crack it

3236
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:17,359
was 25 bucks and i just remembered it so

3237
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:20,159
distinctly because it was like some of

3238
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,839
the strongest smelling stuff ever

3239
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:23,279
it was green with like these purple

3240
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,960
streaks in it

3241
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:26,960
and

3242
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,639
basically we put it in his car and we

3243
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,359
went around the city and stuff and then

3244
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:33,199
like when we were going back to his car

3245
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:34,639
we could smell it across the street and

3246
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:36,960
all his windows were up and everything

3247
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,079
it was a single gram in there so it was

3248
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,840
just like

3249
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,760
i don't know i wish

3250
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,199
somehow i could get that cut because

3251
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,600
like

3252
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:48,158
the intensity of the smell was so crazy

3253
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:50,159
and then when we smoked it like

3254
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:51,679
we all just started freaking out and we

3255
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:53,679
all thought it was laced and like they

3256
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,840
had smoked many many times more than i

3257
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,679
had at that point and they were just

3258
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,920
like i think this just lays dude like i

3259
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:02,399
feel the blood rushing through my like

3260
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:05,279
veins through my whole body and [ __ ]

3261
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:06,879
it was just wild but i've had a few

3262
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:09,679
different times like that in new york

3263
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,639
just getting like the most ridiculous

3264
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:12,480
ever

3265
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:15,118
and to this day i mean i don't know if

3266
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:16,638
it was laced or not but

3267
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,649
probably not

3268
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:21,739
because usually

3269
01:48:18,649 --> 01:48:21,739
[Music]

3270
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,719
yeah so something i wanted to bring up

3271
01:48:25,118 --> 01:48:29,039
because i know that you do dabble in it

3272
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,158
is like cobb led lightings could you

3273
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:31,760
give us a little bit of a rundown with

3274
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:34,319
your experience and any information you

3275
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,320
have to share

3276
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:39,679
oh yeah so

3277
01:48:36,319 --> 01:48:41,840
um basically cobb is a chip on board

3278
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:43,840
it's like these whole spectrum leds with

3279
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:47,119
the white light you can see everything

3280
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:49,039
like real color and all that and

3281
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:52,079
i saw these videos on youtube where this

3282
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:54,238
guy was like yeah i get like 1.8 1.9

3283
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,719
grams per watt with these

3284
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:58,158
and you have to build them yourself but

3285
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,560
they're better than any lights you can

3286
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:02,719
get out there and i'm just like

3287
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,000
what like that's crazy built like

3288
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:06,319
yourself i don't

3289
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,479
i don't get it it was super technical

3290
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:09,759
and all that but eventually i took the

3291
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:11,599
time to

3292
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,440
figure out what he was

3293
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,719
talking about and how it all worked and

3294
01:49:13,439 --> 01:49:16,079
stuff and

3295
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:18,158
um

3296
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,000
basically studied

3297
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:21,519
everything he was saying and all kinds

3298
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,840
of things about life spectrum for a

3299
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,800
couple weeks with my brother

3300
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,719
and

3301
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,880
we developed like a really good spectrum

3302
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,880
by like combining different chips and i

3303
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,400
built this light

3304
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,480
and i just

3305
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:36,238
started using it i was so blown away

3306
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:38,079
because i've always

3307
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,000
been at least like the last few years

3308
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:41,279
i've been using leds just because i like

3309
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,238
them a lot more

3310
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:47,599
than hps i always find like

3311
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:49,839
better more unique terpenes and

3312
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,400
just like less generic but i feel like

3313
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,920
the plant can express itself better

3314
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:55,839
under leds

3315
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,760
but then when i switch to the cobs it

3316
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,119
was like again it was like a whole

3317
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,880
nother level

3318
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:02,960
of like

3319
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,520
just the plants expressing to their

3320
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:07,920
fullest potential indoors i mean you

3321
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,520
would see stuff like outdoors you see

3322
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,679
pink hairs on some strains and then

3323
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,280
indoors you almost never see that and

3324
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,039
then under the cause i started seeing

3325
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,279
that like everything was praying and

3326
01:50:15,039 --> 01:50:19,118
flowering like a little bit faster and

3327
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:20,880
super healthy

3328
01:50:19,118 --> 01:50:22,639
and then

3329
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,039
yeah i'm just super hooked on the cob

3330
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:27,199
lighting because basically i chopped

3331
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:29,118
down a few plants under it and i'm like

3332
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:31,279
yeah you know this looks like

3333
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:33,359
x amount of blood like i don't know 100

3334
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:34,719
grams let's say for example and then

3335
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,039
like

3336
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:38,560
turns out to be like 200 like every

3337
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:42,000
single time it's like double what it

3338
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:43,199
looks like it's just like super dense

3339
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,359
super

3340
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:47,359
heavy yields and like

3341
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:48,238
the same or better quality than i'm used

3342
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:48,960
to

3343
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:51,279
so

3344
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,920
i recommend to people try out the cob

3345
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:55,039
lights they're just super crazy

3346
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,639
um

3347
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:59,118
and i switched like almost all my

3348
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,400
fixtures over to cobbs in the last

3349
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,960
year or so

3350
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:06,079
after using that one for

3351
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:07,118
maybe a year or something like that

3352
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:08,079
yeah okay

3353
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:10,000
um

3354
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:13,039
i recommend to people if they're growing

3355
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
under cobs make sure or even out any

3356
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:16,960
leds keep your temperatures at like 82

3357
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
degrees

3358
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,520
because

3359
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,599
if you go lower than that you're going

3360
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,520
to have like some nutrient deficiencies

3361
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:25,279
that are basically

3362
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,560
in short it's related to the leaf

3363
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:28,880
temperature

3364
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,639
um it has to do with the whole spectrum

3365
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,159
and what nutrients the plant needs a

3366
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:33,279
little bit more of because of the

3367
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:34,799
spectrum

3368
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:36,559
and anyways if you keep your

3369
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:39,039
temperatures like at least in the low

3370
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:41,360
80s you won't have any issues but if you

3371
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,279
keep them like 75 like

3372
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:45,039
hps temperatures

3373
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:46,960
you're gonna get like magnesium

3374
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:48,880
deficiencies and stuff so

3375
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,198
something to consider just for like

3376
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,039
really good results

3377
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:55,759
yeah that's awesome info have you

3378
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:59,198
fiddled around at all with the far red

3379
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:02,400
uv initiators at all

3380
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:04,559
yeah those are crazy actually so

3381
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:05,598
i put those in too

3382
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:08,400
and

3383
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:10,079
basically when i started um

3384
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:12,000
flowering with those they would go on

3385
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:13,118
for like 15 minutes right the lights go

3386
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,800
out and it

3387
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:18,880
simulates on like the sunset outside and

3388
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:20,880
it puts his plants to sleep faster and

3389
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,159
essentially gives them two hours more

3390
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,118
darkness

3391
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:26,559
according to whoever developed it

3392
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:28,238
and

3393
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:31,199
i was pretty skeptical but it was

3394
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:33,839
scientifically proven by all kinds of

3395
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:35,118
whoever the hell studies it and

3396
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,520
so

3397
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:41,279
sure enough it makes your plants flower

3398
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:43,840
really fast and i noticed that basically

3399
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:46,800
i think it was like day 14 looked like

3400
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,319
day 21 on like every play in the room

3401
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,320
and i did a whole bunch of different

3402
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:52,238
strains in there and just everything

3403
01:52:50,319 --> 01:52:54,719
flowered super fast

3404
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:56,879
um it's basically the initiation of

3405
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:59,679
flower the first few weeks that go a lot

3406
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,520
faster like you really notice in a few

3407
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:03,840
days like damn these things are already

3408
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:06,880
flowering and then like a week later

3409
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:09,119
it's like really really flowering so

3410
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,520
um i recommend those if you're trying to

3411
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:14,719
speed up your cycle by like

3412
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,560
five to seven days or so

3413
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:18,158
yeah wow that's some awesome info as

3414
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,320
well

3415
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:21,839
yeah and definitely for sativas because

3416
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:24,559
some sativas

3417
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,920
like um you know 11 hours of light or 10

3418
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:28,159
hours of light and i know a lot of

3419
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:30,719
growers just want to use 12 so

3420
01:53:28,158 --> 01:53:32,638
if you do that and you're basically

3421
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,480
giving them you're still getting another

3422
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,800
12 hours of life then you're giving them

3423
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:38,479
the equivalent to like 14 hours of dark

3424
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,000
or something like that

3425
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,000
just because they process the fact that

3426
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,118
it's nighttime sooner

3427
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,079
yeah

3428
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:46,079
a lot more flowers

3429
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,159
killer

3430
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:53,039
so

3431
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:55,118
in regards to your flowering cycle then

3432
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:57,039
besides the cobs and the far red

3433
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,238
initiator chip do you do anything

3434
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:59,599
outside of the norm when you're in

3435
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:01,359
flower

3436
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:02,639
yeah definitely so

3437
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,000
um

3438
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,279
i've always

3439
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,238
for the last few years i've been

3440
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:10,399
flowering under 11 hours of light and

3441
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:11,678
then 13 hours of dark

3442
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:14,799
and

3443
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:17,199
i heard it from dj short who said like

3444
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:19,279
yeah we'll kind of make your plans to be

3445
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:21,519
a little bit more sativa in

3446
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:23,198
characteristics even if you're growing

3447
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,960
indicas it will kind of

3448
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:27,359
give them a little energy a little kick

3449
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:28,880
to them and i thought that was

3450
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:30,559
interesting because it's kind of more of

3451
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,800
a tropical light cycle and that's where

3452
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:36,000
the plants evolved to these more

3453
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:37,679
sativa phenotypic expressions so i

3454
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,079
basically tried to side by side with a

3455
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:42,239
couple clones and

3456
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:46,158
one really cool thing was that

3457
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:48,959
this um his viper city og moxie which i

3458
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:50,719
only heard a couple times but

3459
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,560
under 12 hours of light and these are

3460
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:54,560
both under the same temperatures

3461
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,840
under 12 hours of light it was totally

3462
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,920
green

3463
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:59,760
and it smelled like super generic i

3464
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,960
don't like nothing memorable whatever

3465
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,239
and then like

3466
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,920
under 11 it went totally purple with

3467
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:08,399
like just

3468
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,239
insane like really really nice smell and

3469
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:12,079
color and everything and i was like damn

3470
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:14,079
that's the same clone

3471
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:16,880
in like the same just about the same

3472
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:19,760
environment just a different light cycle

3473
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:22,239
and it like really really improved the

3474
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:24,079
plant and it went a few days faster and

3475
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:28,000
flowered so it was like the same kind of

3476
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:30,479
ripeness on the tricones and all that so

3477
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,039
that was like my first

3478
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:35,359
um first time seeing that like damn this

3479
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:37,840
life cycle thing makes a difference and

3480
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:39,439
they both yield it very similar like

3481
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:41,920
a lot of people are scared they're like

3482
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:43,598
oh am i gonna lose yield and

3483
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,679
i think that might depend on what you're

3484
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:47,520
growing like maybe some plants will like

3485
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:51,440
it more and some won't but

3486
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:53,679
i've been flowering under 11 hours and

3487
01:55:51,439 --> 01:55:55,039
combined with the cos i've seen over 2

3488
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:57,840
grams per watt

3489
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:59,519
type of yield so i don't think it really

3490
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,679
reduces yield

3491
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,560
um but i definitely noticed that a lot

3492
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:05,440
of

3493
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:07,360
what i grow is very like uplifting even

3494
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:10,079
when i grow into because it's pretty

3495
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:12,158
functional and stuff like that so

3496
01:56:10,079 --> 01:56:15,359
um i do like growing and breeding under

3497
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:17,279
11 hours and then i veg under 17 because

3498
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:19,839
the best cycle has the same effect it's

3499
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:21,759
kind of it's going to kind of like

3500
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,520
make your plant evolve over time you

3501
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,280
know whatever conditions you keep a

3502
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,560
clone in especially if it's for many

3503
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:27,439
many years

3504
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,840
um

3505
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:32,399
like if you're doing 24 hours versus 18

3506
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:34,800
or 17 it's just gonna the plant's gonna

3507
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:36,158
shift ever so slightly

3508
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,679
just from being in a different

3509
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:39,359
environment

3510
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:41,520
yeah so

3511
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:43,198
outside of that legendary green crack

3512
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:46,880
did you ever have any other cuts which

3513
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:46,879
left a lasting impression in your mind

3514
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:51,598
yeah there was um

3515
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,439
this one time i smoked a spliff of white

3516
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:55,199
widow and i don't usually

3517
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:57,919
mix with typical but once in a while i

3518
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:59,678
would back then and

3519
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,800
actually i like the thing that bodhi

3520
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,960
said about

3521
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,960
mixing cannabis and taco where it kind

3522
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,960
of gives you that grounding effect and

3523
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:08,960
like that masculinizing effect towards

3524
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,719
like a feminine plant so

3525
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:13,599
once in a great while if you smoke a

3526
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:16,639
split it can be super super

3527
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:18,000
therapeutic but anyways it was this

3528
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:20,239
white widow

3529
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,319
smoked into a spliff and i just remember

3530
01:57:20,238 --> 01:57:24,479
like as soon as we were done smoking it

3531
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:25,439
or in the woods we just sat down on the

3532
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:27,039
ground

3533
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:28,799
didn't talk for like

3534
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:30,880
half an hour

3535
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,679
and it was just like the one of the most

3536
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:35,199
psychedelic smokes that ever had

3537
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,800
and

3538
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:38,960
it's funny because you know white widow

3539
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,840
is like the pretty common strain

3540
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,719
i guess like in the commercial

3541
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,039
uh

3542
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:46,719
field whatever you want to call it and

3543
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:48,158
but it's never really that good these

3544
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:49,760
days

3545
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:51,198
and this white widow i smoked it a

3546
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,520
couple times but this first time i

3547
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:54,799
smoked it especially it was always so

3548
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,199
good but

3549
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,679
like i just remember

3550
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:02,158
like not being able to read like letters

3551
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:03,599
and [ __ ] because it was just like

3552
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:05,920
i don't know it's just like this whole

3553
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:07,440
different headspace that was so foreign

3554
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,039
and like

3555
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:10,559
it wasn't even uncomfortable that i

3556
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:12,719
couldn't read anything it was just like

3557
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:15,039
every letter was a picture and like

3558
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:17,118
super super trippy so

3559
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:18,880
i don't know like i've grown white widow

3560
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:21,279
and i've smoked white moves since then

3561
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,760
from plenty of places and plenty of

3562
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:24,800
different seasons or whatever

3563
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,679
and

3564
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:29,599
i just never found a white widow that

3565
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:31,599
came close to that one

3566
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:33,760
and that was it wasn't that long ago

3567
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:35,840
that white widow i don't know probably

3568
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:38,239
eight years ago or something

3569
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,480
maybe nine years ago i don't know

3570
01:58:38,238 --> 01:58:40,479
but

3571
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:45,840
yeah i don't know where's the white

3572
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:49,840
where's a good white widow

3573
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,840
yeah i'd like to know that too

3574
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,118
yeah all the other ones i've sold lately

3575
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:55,440
either

3576
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:56,399
put you to sleep or they're super bland

3577
01:58:55,439 --> 01:58:58,559
and like

3578
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,839
not really much flavor or much effect

3579
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:05,039
just like regular

3580
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:06,319
speed i smoked some white rhino a while

3581
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:07,840
back like not that long back probably

3582
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:09,118
about a year ago

3583
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,599
and um

3584
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:13,439
[ __ ] it was good man it like

3585
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:15,199
wasn't the same in a lot of ways but

3586
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:17,519
there was a lot of aspects of it that

3587
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:19,039
reminded me of smoking skelly in the

3588
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:21,119
states and it was just such a

3589
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,800
mind-blowing thing i was like what no

3590
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:24,880
way

3591
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:27,199
oh that's awesome i love when you just

3592
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,400
get something that's like even if it's

3593
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:29,678
not the same it's like close to

3594
01:59:28,399 --> 01:59:32,000
something you had in the past that was

3595
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:34,960
so reminiscent and that's like

3596
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,960
just amazing no matter what it is

3597
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:39,118
yeah just bring it back

3598
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,920
so if we kind of jump to a slightly

3599
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:44,319
related topic but a little bit off field

3600
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,840
living in massachusetts what's it like

3601
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:47,599
with the medical laws there i mean i

3602
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,679
know things have changed recently but

3603
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:51,199
for the longest period of time

3604
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:52,719
people had always said that it was you

3605
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:54,238
know it wasn't the most friendly state

3606
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:58,158
to be and how have you found it and how

3607
01:59:54,238 --> 02:00:00,559
does it look for you going forward

3608
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:00,559
um

3609
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:06,639
it's interesting it's definitely

3610
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:09,599
less chill than some places and it's a

3611
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:11,760
lot better than a lot of places and i'm

3612
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:13,599
super super grateful to be where i am

3613
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,800
and at this time

3614
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:17,360
um

3615
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,960
like it's a relatively safe environment

3616
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:20,639
to do what i do

3617
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,920
sometimes it's a little scary and

3618
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:23,599
there's always

3619
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,279
you know it's definitely not perfect

3620
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:26,800
like at our weed events you can't have

3621
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:28,960
weed you can

3622
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,800
there's seeds and stuff but like

3623
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:32,639
we're doing a

3624
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,320
event at canacon which is like this

3625
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:35,760
event in boston

3626
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:37,920
and they're like yeah you can't bring

3627
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:38,880
flower to display like i wanted to bring

3628
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,199
a little

3629
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,960
branch of star pupil flowering and

3630
02:00:41,198 --> 02:00:44,079
putting water so people could smell it

3631
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:45,760
and see

3632
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:47,840
what it's like and they're just like you

3633
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,000
absolutely cannot do that you can't give

3634
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,039
away what you can't display like no thc

3635
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,960
allowed

3636
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:57,439
and i'm like okay fine like whatever you

3637
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,840
know it's not the end of the world but

3638
02:00:57,439 --> 02:01:01,359
in in that kind of sense it's a serious

3639
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,960
environment here

3640
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:06,399
but it makes sense because to me

3641
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:08,000
massachusetts at least the area i'm in

3642
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:09,839
it's a lot of people that don't like

3643
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,920
weed and it's a miracle that have we've

3644
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:13,679
legalized here so

3645
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,079
i'm pretty grateful for the whole thing

3646
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:18,079
and our medical programs like

3647
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:19,679
better than some places although it's

3648
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:21,439
not the best it's definitely not the

3649
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:23,440
worst so

3650
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:25,759
to me it's like wherever in the world

3651
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:28,319
you are you you adapt

3652
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,159
you either move or you adapt so whatever

3653
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:33,198
works for you

3654
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:35,519
you you work with it or you find a way

3655
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:36,559
and uh

3656
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,639
our whole

3657
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,960
legalization thing is like a huge mess

3658
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:40,960
here

3659
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:45,599
and so

3660
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:48,079
something i wanted to ask you was that

3661
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:49,360
we don't see you at a stack of events

3662
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:51,599
however you know obviously you just

3663
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:53,598
mentioned the cannacon is this more of a

3664
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:55,679
geographical location issue or are you

3665
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:58,319
just not so into like the high times and

3666
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:58,319
all that stuff

3667
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:02,238
um actually i've been to a bunch of

3668
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:04,559
events but i don't usually i don't want

3669
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:07,118
to join my face like

3670
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:09,360
as i don't know i'm the overly paranoid

3671
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:12,079
person because i learned from people

3672
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:14,960
that grew in like total prohibition and

3673
02:02:12,079 --> 02:02:17,679
i learned from the books that teach you

3674
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:20,880
like the craziest ass way of staying

3675
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:23,359
safe so you don't get caught and so even

3676
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:25,118
like meeting people from online i never

3677
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:26,880
met anyone until a couple years ago

3678
02:02:25,118 --> 02:02:28,399
because i was so scared that like the

3679
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,400
first person i mean it's just gonna be

3680
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:33,279
that agent that's gonna take me away

3681
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:35,439
forever from my family and possessions

3682
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:39,359
just like [ __ ] up my life so

3683
02:02:35,439 --> 02:02:41,678
it's still a transition of being like

3684
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:44,238
realizing like things are okay you can

3685
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:46,079
talk to people like i was scared as hell

3686
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:47,759
to do this interview but i so badly want

3687
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:49,359
to like talk about all these things that

3688
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,320
i loved so

3689
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:52,479
like

3690
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:54,960
i don't know things are

3691
02:02:52,479 --> 02:02:56,799
things are safer than i thought but at

3692
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,439
the same time there's always

3693
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,360
that risk because it's like

3694
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:04,960
everything in massachusetts and in this

3695
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:06,479
country is just gray area so

3696
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,158
all like you know everything on

3697
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:10,959
instagram you see these people posting

3698
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:12,238
selfies with like 5 000 clients behind

3699
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,158
them they're like

3700
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:16,479
this is my full name and i'm growing 5

3701
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:18,960
000 cannabis plants and look how awesome

3702
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:20,959
i am and it's like

3703
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,960
only so many people can do that before

3704
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,880
one of them just gets like

3705
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:26,480
taken to jail you know like i'm like

3706
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:29,359
what the [ __ ] are you guys doing like

3707
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:31,678
this shit's a little sketchy don't you

3708
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:33,920
think so i don't know

3709
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:36,319
that's kind of why i've been more

3710
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:37,520
private the whole time

3711
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:39,679
just because i've been a little

3712
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:41,599
uncomfortable with the whole like

3713
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:44,399
how public can you really go before like

3714
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:46,480
something bad happens to you

3715
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:48,158
and so moving forward do you think you

3716
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:50,158
will be a bit more out in the open or

3717
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:53,039
are you just kind of gonna still kind of

3718
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:55,598
take care of yourself

3719
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:58,000
um i mean i'm pretty private myself i

3720
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:59,199
have a pretty small circle of people and

3721
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,078
then

3722
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:01,839
um

3723
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:02,799
i'd like to be at more events and stuff

3724
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:05,199
like that

3725
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:07,440
i usually when i go to events it's

3726
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:09,118
usually just like there's a couple

3727
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:11,118
specific people i want to meet that are

3728
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:13,198
either at the event or going to the

3729
02:04:11,118 --> 02:04:15,359
event as like a

3730
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:16,960
person going to the event so it's like

3731
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:18,399
you know like someone on instagram is

3732
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,239
like yeah we've been talking for a year

3733
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:21,839
like we should link up

3734
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:23,919
going to this event

3735
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,319
um so i'll usually go to events and do

3736
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,078
that like in private but i'm not like

3737
02:04:26,319 --> 02:04:30,479
wearing a huge red flag that's like hey

3738
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:32,158
i'm mass medical strength and

3739
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:33,839
the last couple events like some people

3740
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:35,279
started coming up to me and be like hey

3741
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:37,679
mass medical strands and i'm like oh

3742
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:40,559
[ __ ] people are learning who i am

3743
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:43,920
i'm scared but it's i don't know we'll

3744
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:46,000
see we'll see where it goes i definitely

3745
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,760
would like to be

3746
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,158
more public because

3747
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,920
i like talking about plants and sharing

3748
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:55,198
all these good things and stuff like

3749
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:56,960
that so there's like a lot of good stuff

3750
02:04:55,198 --> 02:04:57,919
but just gotta stay safe at the same

3751
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,118
time

3752
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:00,560
yeah okay

3753
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:03,279
and so the last question about

3754
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:05,280
massachusetts do you have access to labs

3755
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:07,118
and the testing facilities that people

3756
02:05:05,279 --> 02:05:09,198
in say california or colorado have

3757
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:11,920
access to and do you utilize them do you

3758
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:14,559
see the value in it

3759
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,520
yeah really awesome um

3760
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:17,119
so like

3761
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:18,880
you can just go to a lab and bring your

3762
02:05:17,118 --> 02:05:20,319
weed there and they test it for you like

3763
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,639
within a few days and you don't have to

3764
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:24,479
tell them who you even are like you can

3765
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:26,159
i put mass medical strains i don't have

3766
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:27,519
to give an id or my real name or

3767
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:28,879
anything and then

3768
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,079
you know they just put it online and

3769
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:32,960
they email it to you or whatever you

3770
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:34,719
want them to do but it's super relaxed

3771
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,639
in that sense

3772
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,480
you can learn a lot about your growing

3773
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:41,039
and your strains and

3774
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:42,638
the effects a little bit i mean

3775
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:45,679
effects are more subjective and

3776
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:47,359
experiential but you can still get some

3777
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:48,480
interesting numbers out of everything

3778
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:49,920
and then

3779
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:51,359
you know like

3780
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,960
you grow something you're like why does

3781
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:54,639
this smell like this okay it has this

3782
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:56,560
terpene and then you're like

3783
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:57,840
what does this terpene do

3784
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,440
medicinally

3785
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,840
and then you're like oh [ __ ] it boosts

3786
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:03,519
memory no no wonder like this strain

3787
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,360
always like really helps me when i need

3788
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,880
to think or remember [ __ ] it's like

3789
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:07,598
that's why

3790
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,359
and

3791
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:11,599
you can kind of

3792
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,598
learn a little bit more about the plant

3793
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:16,319
through the lab results

3794
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:18,319
sometimes but then other times i mean

3795
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:21,920
i've had really strong [ __ ] test out at

3796
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:22,960
like 10 to 15 on occasion so that's thc

3797
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,480
so

3798
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:26,560
you know there's more to it than lab

3799
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:29,039
results at the same time but they're

3800
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,480
really really awesome in general

3801
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:31,439
yeah okay

3802
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:33,678
so something i'd love to talk to

3803
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:35,279
everyone about clone deterioration or

3804
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:36,158
genetic drift however you want to term

3805
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:37,679
it

3806
02:06:36,158 --> 02:06:42,399
do you believe in it or do you think

3807
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:42,399
it's just uh it's just poor maintenance

3808
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:45,840
um

3809
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:47,679
so all my clones pretty much get treated

3810
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,199
the same and i treat them pretty well

3811
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,560
overall like you know keeping them

3812
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:52,719
healthy and then

3813
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:54,880
i always take extra clones and just keep

3814
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,639
the healthiest rooted one and you know

3815
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,719
some pretty good cloning practices and

3816
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:59,840
keeping it in a nice environment as best

3817
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:01,439
as i can

3818
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,679
and i've noticed

3819
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,039
most clones stay the same and then you

3820
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:06,399
know when you grow a clone differently

3821
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:08,238
you're going to get slightly different

3822
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:10,000
expressions off of it

3823
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:12,319
and sometimes you can

3824
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,158
get really something different off it if

3825
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:15,759
you change something drastically but

3826
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:17,118
then if you go back to what you're doing

3827
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:18,639
before it goes back to how it grew

3828
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:19,839
before so you're not really changing

3829
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:20,800
anything you're just flowering

3830
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:22,000
differently

3831
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:23,520
and then

3832
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,479
on the other hand

3833
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,920
i had a cut of the evelyn and every

3834
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:29,919
single time i grew it it was a

3835
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,520
completely different plant one time it

3836
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:33,599
was

3837
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:35,440
almost entirely green

3838
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:37,440
one time it was like

3839
02:07:35,439 --> 02:07:39,118
totally black one time it was red and

3840
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:40,719
one time it was purple and there was

3841
02:07:39,118 --> 02:07:42,399
little different smells coming out and

3842
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:44,880
it's like

3843
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:47,118
every generation that i grew it it just

3844
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:49,199
changed and it wasn't the environment

3845
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:52,960
changing it was just

3846
02:07:49,198 --> 02:07:55,118
maybe getting older or something

3847
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:56,800
and then a friend of mine said oh yeah

3848
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:58,719
like all the stuff i've grown from that

3849
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,560
breeder does the same thing that genetic

3850
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:01,520
line like they just change over time as

3851
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,119
clones

3852
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,360
and

3853
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:08,158
um so i think genetically there's

3854
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:10,799
certain plants that may drift over times

3855
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:12,960
because they're not expecting to live

3856
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:15,039
for multiple years because usually

3857
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:16,719
cannabis outside will die in the winter

3858
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:18,479
so especially like

3859
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:20,000
i don't know i would assume something

3860
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:22,718
that

3861
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,238
originates from like a more tropical uh

3862
02:08:22,719 --> 02:08:27,118
not tropical like

3863
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:28,799
a more like cold ass climate

3864
02:08:27,118 --> 02:08:30,799
uh where it would never have the chance

3865
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,199
to live a year and then it lives a year

3866
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,320
and might start doing some weird [ __ ]

3867
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:37,118
versus

3868
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:39,198
other plants so they don't really care

3869
02:08:37,118 --> 02:08:40,479
um but then if you keep a clone in cheap

3870
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:43,519
condition

3871
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:45,519
unhealthy whatever problems like

3872
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:48,400
it can deteriorate but i think you can

3873
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:49,760
also revive it for sure it's pretty easy

3874
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:51,519
i mean if you know how to grow

3875
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:52,480
organically it's pretty easy to bring it

3876
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,880
back

3877
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:57,439
you just grow it healthy for a while you

3878
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,279
can put it outside in the sun for like a

3879
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:01,759
month or two and then take clones off it

3880
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:03,279
and bring it back inside and obviously

3881
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,199
make sure it doesn't have any bugs that

3882
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:06,719
you're going to bring in but

3883
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,359
the sun really does wonders for

3884
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:10,319
rejuvenating cuts when you need to

3885
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:12,559
and

3886
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:14,238
really like if i get a clone and it's

3887
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:16,239
grown synthetically

3888
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:17,759
and like let's say it comes in

3889
02:09:16,238 --> 02:09:19,678
some soil or whatever and i know there's

3890
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,440
salts in there like

3891
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:23,920
i'll grow it for a bit i'll transplant

3892
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:26,078
it up to like some organic soil but

3893
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:27,840
the salts are already in there to me so

3894
02:09:26,078 --> 02:09:30,158
i'm like i'm gonna grow it big and then

3895
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:32,239
take some new clones grow those totally

3896
02:09:30,158 --> 02:09:33,359
organically and then i'll flower it so

3897
02:09:32,238 --> 02:09:34,879
that it's

3898
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:36,479
kind of cleaning up and kind of getting

3899
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:38,400
towards my growing style a little bit

3900
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:40,799
more and like at the same time it's

3901
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:43,839
adapting to my led and my little bit

3902
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:46,960
more grow rooms and all that stuff

3903
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:49,440
yeah makes sense so you reference not

3904
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:52,158
bringing any bugs inside if that were to

3905
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:55,279
happen what would your ipm treatment or

3906
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:55,279
go-to regime be

3907
02:09:55,439 --> 02:09:59,198
um

3908
02:09:56,479 --> 02:10:01,598
pretty much beneficial predators have

3909
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:03,279
been the best thing that i've ever used

3910
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:05,679
um

3911
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:07,519
like i used to use azamax and edge

3912
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:08,880
because it was supposed to be organic

3913
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:10,480
and then

3914
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:12,159
now they're they came out

3915
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:14,399
saying like yeah there's also these

3916
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:16,078
banned pesticides secretly in here so

3917
02:10:14,399 --> 02:10:18,399
you know stopped using that real quick

3918
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:20,559
and i was like [ __ ] but luckily i had

3919
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:22,078
only used that veg because

3920
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,719
in flour you never want to spray

3921
02:10:22,078 --> 02:10:26,238
anything like even foliar sprays and

3922
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,078
flowers like you're going to smoke at

3923
02:10:26,238 --> 02:10:30,718
the end and people don't realize that

3924
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:31,920
but anyways um

3925
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:34,880
basically

3926
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:37,520
my number one ipm is like i generally

3927
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:39,760
don't take in clones and i don't go in

3928
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:41,119
my room unless i'm clean like i usually

3929
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:42,960
take care of the gardens in the morning

3930
02:10:41,118 --> 02:10:46,078
so i'll just take a shower before i go

3931
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:47,599
in and i'll leave you have like a garden

3932
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:49,439
outfit that i'll wear for like a couple

3933
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:51,520
weeks at a time like just when i go in

3934
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:53,039
there and then i'll change out a bit

3935
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,280
like keep it clean

3936
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:57,599
or you know just don't go in there like

3937
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:00,479
if if you've been in a grow or if you've

3938
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:02,239
been outside even like if you've touched

3939
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:02,959
any plants like dude there's gotta be

3940
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:04,638
some

3941
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:06,960
some eggs on your skin or some [ __ ]

3942
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:08,719
that's gonna like [ __ ] up your grow so i

3943
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,960
just stay super clean when i go in there

3944
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:12,560
so that i don't have to spray anything

3945
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:15,760
and i don't have to constantly buy

3946
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:17,920
predator bugs to take care of issues

3947
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:19,440
and then you know sometimes something

3948
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:21,359
will come in i'll get like some thrips

3949
02:11:19,439 --> 02:11:23,279
or aphids or whatever and you can get

3950
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:26,078
these predator bugs that will eat them

3951
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:27,840
all and they literally eat all of them

3952
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:29,039
till they're super gone and you won't

3953
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,520
see them again

3954
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:33,679
and that's just the best because

3955
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,520
there's no chemicals involved at all and

3956
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:38,158
it's the most natural way it's the same

3957
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:41,360
thing that happens outside

3958
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:42,719
yeah i agree and just as a little point

3959
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:44,319
i wanted to add in there i've heard a

3960
02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:46,319
few people like

3961
02:11:44,319 --> 02:11:48,238
i guess like the undertone in their

3962
02:11:46,319 --> 02:11:50,078
voices they've been critical of predator

3963
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:52,000
mites and they're like yeah but what

3964
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:53,359
about like the predator mites pooing and

3965
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,359
stuff like that

3966
02:11:53,359 --> 02:11:56,799
and uh the the thing i wanted to quickly

3967
02:11:55,359 --> 02:11:58,799
point out is that

3968
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,639
the predator mites largely are not on

3969
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,960
the buds they're on the leaves and you

3970
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:04,560
don't you don't smoke those really and

3971
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:07,118
the amount they poo is minimal because

3972
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:09,920
they bio-convert into like recreating

3973
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:12,238
babies instead of pooping heaps so yeah

3974
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:13,440
just a little fyi for anyone out there

3975
02:12:12,238 --> 02:12:14,718
who's wondering because that's something

3976
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:16,479
i always hear they're like aren't you

3977
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:18,000
just like solving one problem but it's

3978
02:12:16,479 --> 02:12:20,959
like causing the same problem in a way

3979
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,800
and it's like well not really but um

3980
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:24,319
anyway just to jump to a bit of a

3981
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,639
different topic

3982
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:29,118
what do you think will be some of the

3983
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:30,960
future varieties and or flavors that are

3984
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:33,279
going to storm the scene and do you try

3985
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:36,399
to predict that to a certain extent like

3986
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:38,639
i mean imagine if you had made putang

3987
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:40,078
back when tanji had first came out you

3988
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:42,000
know you can only assume that it would

3989
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:44,399
have rid that wave of popularity a

3990
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,880
little more do you actively think about

3991
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:49,118
that at all

3992
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:50,800
no because honestly like even though i

3993
02:12:49,118 --> 02:12:52,319
really see it's for people to grow and

3994
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,079
stuff i'm pretty much just breeding for

3995
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:56,000
myself for what i want to make and what

3996
02:12:54,078 --> 02:12:57,279
i like and think is good

3997
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,880
and

3998
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:00,238
um

3999
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:02,560
i don't really know what's out there

4000
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:04,399
sometimes for weed like there was

4001
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:06,079
a lot of times like i'll go like half a

4002
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:08,238
year or a year without smoking like

4003
02:13:06,078 --> 02:13:09,840
anybody else's weed and then at one

4004
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:11,198
point i'm like what is weed supposed to

4005
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:13,199
be like like let me get some weed from

4006
02:13:11,198 --> 02:13:14,719
somewhere else just like make sure i'm

4007
02:13:13,198 --> 02:13:16,879
still doing a good job like i don't even

4008
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:19,359
know anymore like what

4009
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:20,960
other people's weed is like so a lot of

4010
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:22,399
times i'm in my own world with that just

4011
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:23,920
because there's not that many organic

4012
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:27,519
growers out here

4013
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:28,960
um that i know personally at least so

4014
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,560
um

4015
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,158
and then like with the scene and all

4016
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,320
that what they want i don't really know

4017
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:36,078
what the [ __ ] they want because i feel

4018
02:13:34,319 --> 02:13:37,039
like the people

4019
02:13:36,078 --> 02:13:39,759
uh

4020
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:41,359
seek out my like really unique strains

4021
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,639
or their kind of land race base like

4022
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:44,399
they're people that are looking for

4023
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:45,440
something different than the norm

4024
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:47,039
and then

4025
02:13:45,439 --> 02:13:48,479
i mean people that are looking for star

4026
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:50,560
people they just want to believe that

4027
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:52,399
gets them high and that's tasty and all

4028
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:53,199
that so

4029
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:54,399
like

4030
02:13:53,198 --> 02:13:56,238
i don't know i feel like i have

4031
02:13:54,399 --> 02:13:58,399
something for just about everyone like

4032
02:13:56,238 --> 02:14:00,479
that's part of why i read with the glue

4033
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:03,198
at one point was because like

4034
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:04,799
i knew i had a way to improve it and a

4035
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:06,638
way to kind of

4036
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,800
use something popular and good that

4037
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:10,560
people want to like put my own twist to

4038
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:12,560
it so

4039
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:14,639
usually i just kind of make what i want

4040
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:17,840
to see because i don't know like

4041
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:18,719
when i go to a dispensary is all this

4042
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:20,560
like

4043
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:22,880
most of the menu is stuff that i don't

4044
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:24,719
want to smoke so i just don't go there

4045
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,520
and just like this is [ __ ]

4046
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:29,520
everything's gas i don't really like gas

4047
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:31,040
everything's cookies i can't smoke

4048
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,320
cookies because it just has a bad

4049
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:34,719
reaction with

4050
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:36,559
my physiology i just freak out when even

4051
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:38,880
if it's in a cross like my body's just

4052
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:40,400
like no don't soak that so i learned

4053
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,880
after 15

4054
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:44,078
you know different cookies crosses that

4055
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:46,159
like okay

4056
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:47,920
it just doesn't buy with you just don't

4057
02:14:46,158 --> 02:14:50,158
smoke that so

4058
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:52,158
a big variety of what's out there i just

4059
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:54,559
don't smoke and i just smoke what i want

4060
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:57,439
to smoke and then like if i hear

4061
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:59,920
something cool like oh [ __ ] like this

4062
02:14:57,439 --> 02:15:01,039
grower just grew like an old school haze

4063
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:03,359
or like

4064
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:06,800
some

4065
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:09,039
wacky hybrid of like nigerian something

4066
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:10,960
i'm like dude hell yeah like i'll try

4067
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:12,479
some of that but i'm not gonna go try

4068
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:14,319
like

4069
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:15,839
a wedding cake or something like

4070
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:16,799
something something like that you know

4071
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,159
it's just not

4072
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:20,320
for me so

4073
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:22,078
even though it's the trendy stuff right

4074
02:15:20,319 --> 02:15:24,319
now but most of the trendy stuff is like

4075
02:15:22,078 --> 02:15:26,479
not what i'm into

4076
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:28,399
and so i don't know why but this just

4077
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:30,000
springs to mind just kind of loosely

4078
02:15:28,399 --> 02:15:31,920
referencing earlier on when you were

4079
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,599
talking to d-man and saying this you

4080
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:36,239
know star people's not like other purple

4081
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:39,119
weed would you ever consider doing like

4082
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:40,959
a star purple a star people sorry

4083
02:15:39,118 --> 02:15:43,039
cross two like a purple strand like you

4084
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:46,480
know an urkel or a granddaddy purple

4085
02:15:43,039 --> 02:15:46,479
like just for the lols

4086
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:50,480
yeah um i actually have

4087
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,520
a little thing in the works right now

4088
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:53,439
with that

4089
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:54,960
because i found a purple that i really

4090
02:15:53,439 --> 02:15:57,439
liked

4091
02:15:54,960 --> 02:16:00,560
um from inspector he sent me a bunch of

4092
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:02,559
his mendo f1 to work with and

4093
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:04,560
it's a mendo purse cross with his

4094
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:05,520
pakistani

4095
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:07,199
and um

4096
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,040
they were really really unique because

4097
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:11,198
to me at least they did not smell like a

4098
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:13,039
purple i also grew like some endo perps

4099
02:16:11,198 --> 02:16:14,638
test ones just to get an idea of like

4100
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:16,639
the mango prayers because i hadn't grown

4101
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:18,319
the clone but

4102
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:19,760
i got an idea for that but then i grew

4103
02:16:18,319 --> 02:16:22,319
up

4104
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:24,320
the f ones which were the regular seeds

4105
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:26,479
with the the [ __ ] cross

4106
02:16:24,319 --> 02:16:28,960
and i really liked them i was like damn

4107
02:16:26,479 --> 02:16:31,359
this is another purple that like

4108
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:33,200
you know it gets you actually high it

4109
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:34,558
had a really unique effect for me i

4110
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:37,280
couldn't go in the grow room when i

4111
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:39,679
smoked it which kind of sucked but

4112
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:41,280
what would happen is the life is [ __ ]

4113
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:42,960
through the strobing thing in my vision

4114
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,920
whenever i would smoke it

4115
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:46,159
and

4116
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,760
that's you know it was uncomfortable but

4117
02:16:46,159 --> 02:16:49,280
at the same time like dude give that to

4118
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:51,760
people that want to party and they're

4119
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:53,920
going to love you you know if it really

4120
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,318
like [ __ ] your vision that's like a

4121
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:57,760
unique effect versus just like

4122
02:16:56,318 --> 02:16:59,679
a normal high it's like if there's

4123
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:02,239
something more to it

4124
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:04,159
and the flavor was really really cool

4125
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:05,679
i was having so much trouble describing

4126
02:17:04,159 --> 02:17:07,840
it but

4127
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:10,159
it was a really really bright it wasn't

4128
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:11,760
much of a purple smell until i cured it

4129
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:14,718
for like two months

4130
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:17,920
but it was really bright and like

4131
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:20,159
i don't know creamy vanilla was a little

4132
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,519
tiny dash of lemon in the background and

4133
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:23,359
like

4134
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:25,040
i don't know it smelled like the color

4135
02:17:23,359 --> 02:17:26,960
white for whatever reason it was like

4136
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:28,960
didn't smell like the color purple

4137
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:30,718
and

4138
02:17:28,959 --> 02:17:32,239
those are really really cool plants so

4139
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:33,839
it's like this

4140
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:35,599
and they're beautiful they look a little

4141
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:38,079
like star pupil although the flower

4142
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:39,120
structure was very different it had the

4143
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:41,439
same

4144
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:43,519
kind of purple that starts in the center

4145
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:45,120
and it's just purple the whole time it

4146
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:47,200
looked pretty similar

4147
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:48,960
um and it had its own unique leaf

4148
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:50,800
structure that i hadn't seen in other

4149
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:53,199
stuff so just like this is unique enough

4150
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:55,438
to cross with the star pupil

4151
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:56,559
and just see what purple craziness comes

4152
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:58,800
out so

4153
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:00,879
right now i'm flowering a few of those

4154
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:02,239
out and somebody's hunting like a

4155
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:03,759
hundred of them so i'm gonna see what

4156
02:18:02,239 --> 02:18:05,039
comes out of there

4157
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:06,719
and

4158
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:08,639
throw a few more of them and hopefully

4159
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:10,558
that'll be a release in the future i

4160
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:13,039
want to call it the valedictorian if

4161
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:14,959
it's as good as i expect

4162
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,920
that's a good name

4163
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:17,598
so

4164
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:20,558
what would be your advice for an

4165
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:20,558
aspiring breeder

4166
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:26,399
oh yeah that's a fun one so

4167
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:28,398
i love when people want to breed because

4168
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:30,159
like breeding is a huge part of growing

4169
02:18:28,398 --> 02:18:31,039
for me it always has been just because

4170
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:33,359
like

4171
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,960
i always end up just like making a

4172
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:37,040
little two seeds on the side while i was

4173
02:18:34,959 --> 02:18:39,279
growing stuff for smoke and i think it's

4174
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:41,120
a really important part of growing

4175
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:43,439
um

4176
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:46,240
if you want to read i think

4177
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:47,120
you should have a goal to start with

4178
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:48,879
like

4179
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:51,200
that goal just has to be a vision of

4180
02:18:48,879 --> 02:18:53,119
like what type of plant you want or what

4181
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,800
you want to see happen let's say you

4182
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:56,719
have like

4183
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:59,279
two strains you like and you just think

4184
02:18:56,718 --> 02:19:01,759
like what if the combine is like that's

4185
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:03,120
a goal already like you're thinking

4186
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:05,359
you're getting somewhere like you have

4187
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:07,439
to have a reason to do what you do not

4188
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:10,000
just like all right i picked up these

4189
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:11,840
ten clones and like i popped one seed

4190
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,519
out of a packet bought and it's a male

4191
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,439
so i'll just hit everything like that's

4192
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:17,519
not the way to do it

4193
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:19,280
um you gotta have a little bit of a goal

4194
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:22,239
and then a little bit of plan how you're

4195
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:23,920
gonna like do decent job versus doing a

4196
02:19:22,239 --> 02:19:27,280
shitty job you know

4197
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:28,558
and to me i tell people like

4198
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:31,280
usually

4199
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:34,398
like grow some plants that you know you

4200
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,840
like let's say you buy a pack of seeds

4201
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:37,760
from breeder

4202
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:39,679
and you like that strain you let's say

4203
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:41,200
even you pop half the pack

4204
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:42,638
and you like them

4205
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,399
you've found that they're they're all

4206
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:45,518
pretty similar and they smell good and

4207
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,760
whatever

4208
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:50,000
and you're like damn this is awesome

4209
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:52,159
and then i have like this female of this

4210
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:55,040
other strain that i really like and like

4211
02:19:52,159 --> 02:19:56,719
i see them matching up nicely like

4212
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,399
this one has this trade and this one is

4213
02:19:56,719 --> 02:19:59,519
that trade and i think it'll combine

4214
02:19:58,398 --> 02:20:01,680
good

4215
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:04,079
and you know maybe revisit those seats

4216
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,600
maybe buy another couple

4217
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:06,799
buy another couple packs if you can

4218
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:08,318
afford it

4219
02:20:06,799 --> 02:20:09,840
um

4220
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:11,920
and like look through all the mails and

4221
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:13,359
find a male that you can cross with your

4222
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:15,280
other female of a different strain that

4223
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:16,559
you think will work well

4224
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:18,079
and then

4225
02:20:16,559 --> 02:20:20,478
don't just be like all right i'm done

4226
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:22,719
like growing out don't just grow one

4227
02:20:20,478 --> 02:20:24,239
grow like as many as you can

4228
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:26,478
and give them the people to grow because

4229
02:20:24,239 --> 02:20:27,920
you're not gonna be able to grow

4230
02:20:26,478 --> 02:20:29,679
probably all of them you know you're

4231
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:31,520
probably gonna be able to grow

4232
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:33,439
however many fit in grow room but if you

4233
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:35,120
can pass them out to 10 friends

4234
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:37,920
you're going to start seeing what's

4235
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:40,319
really in there what you created

4236
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:42,799
and to me there's like nothing more

4237
02:20:40,318 --> 02:20:45,119
beautiful than combining two plants and

4238
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:47,920
then growing them out and seeing that

4239
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:50,000
combination like that you did and seeing

4240
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:52,159
like oh [ __ ] like there's the benching

4241
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,600
in the smell from the star pupil but

4242
02:20:52,159 --> 02:20:56,239
then there's

4243
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:58,479
like the overwhelming sativa effect from

4244
02:20:56,239 --> 02:21:00,239
the amnesia haze and the

4245
02:20:58,478 --> 02:21:01,840
flowers are purple but they now they're

4246
02:21:00,239 --> 02:21:03,600
smelling like haze but the stem road

4247
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:05,920
smells like pupils

4248
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:08,079
it's like super [ __ ] exciting when

4249
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:10,318
you're growing out your crosses

4250
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:12,719
and you're just seeing the best traits

4251
02:21:10,318 --> 02:21:14,879
of all plants that you found and put

4252
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:16,318
into that cross itself

4253
02:21:14,879 --> 02:21:18,239
and

4254
02:21:16,318 --> 02:21:20,318
another thing i would say is like

4255
02:21:18,239 --> 02:21:23,039
research the genetic background of your

4256
02:21:20,318 --> 02:21:25,359
strains and take some time to learn

4257
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:26,640
which strains have hermes tendencies and

4258
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:28,399
which don't

4259
02:21:26,639 --> 02:21:30,318
because

4260
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:32,639
sometimes like i don't know you might

4261
02:21:30,318 --> 02:21:34,159
find something that you like as a plant

4262
02:21:32,639 --> 02:21:36,639
and you don't realize like three

4263
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:39,520
generations back it has cookies in it

4264
02:21:36,639 --> 02:21:42,079
just because the f1 cross you got

4265
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:44,000
was stable when you grew it doesn't mean

4266
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:46,079
that there's hermey disasters waiting to

4267
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,359
happen in your next outcross because

4268
02:21:46,079 --> 02:21:48,559
chances are that's what's going to

4269
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:51,359
happen

4270
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:53,840
if you work with sketchy things

4271
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:56,880
sometimes so i don't know do some

4272
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:59,040
research behind everything like

4273
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:00,799
learning the lineage really helps you

4274
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:02,880
get a feel for the plant and kind of

4275
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:04,719
expect what you might find

4276
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:06,879
especially if you dive deeper into more

4277
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:09,438
generations and stuff like that and i

4278
02:22:06,879 --> 02:22:11,599
like to look at like seed finder is a

4279
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:12,720
pretty good website like i know some

4280
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,479
people say like they're not that

4281
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:16,159
accurate but

4282
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:18,159
a lot of their stuff's accurate and then

4283
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:21,439
go you know go to a second or a third

4284
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:24,000
source and see if it matches up and if

4285
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:26,318
you know the real lineage of your strain

4286
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,280
based on like how many people say what

4287
02:22:26,318 --> 02:22:29,199
and

4288
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:31,680
hopefully you know what's in it at least

4289
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:33,439
maybe it's all wrong but usually you can

4290
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:34,880
get a good idea

4291
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:36,398
and

4292
02:22:34,879 --> 02:22:38,000
find the planets that vibe with you

4293
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:40,959
don't create what you think people want

4294
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,159
to see create what you want to see

4295
02:22:40,959 --> 02:22:44,000
because

4296
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:46,079
i don't know people sometimes people

4297
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,439
maybe even lack the confidence to know

4298
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:49,200
that like

4299
02:22:47,439 --> 02:22:50,720
their opinion matters

4300
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:52,800
just as much as like some famous

4301
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:54,239
attitudes opinion like you're equal

4302
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:56,079
people dude

4303
02:22:54,239 --> 02:22:58,239
if you want something

4304
02:22:56,079 --> 02:23:00,799
do it and create it and

4305
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:03,039
it's gonna be awesome like if you're the

4306
02:23:00,799 --> 02:23:04,799
only one that likes some weird ass treat

4307
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:05,600
read for that weird-ass trade and make

4308
02:23:04,799 --> 02:23:07,119
it

4309
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:08,720
and you're gonna find people that love

4310
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:10,319
it too and they're gonna be really happy

4311
02:23:08,719 --> 02:23:12,719
because they thought the only ones that

4312
02:23:10,318 --> 02:23:15,840
wanted that

4313
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:18,000
yeah sounds like some good plans so

4314
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,960
what's your thoughts on breeding with a

4315
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,040
mother

4316
02:23:18,959 --> 02:23:23,039
that was originally a feminized seed

4317
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:28,318
oh yeah this is a fun one so

4318
02:23:26,159 --> 02:23:30,639
i'll tell you right now it does not

4319
02:23:28,318 --> 02:23:33,039
matter if your plant came from ephemera

4320
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:35,439
reg seed it matters

4321
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:36,479
that exact pheno that plant that you're

4322
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:39,280
dealing with

4323
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:40,318
how stable it is and how stable it is in

4324
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:42,239
a cross

4325
02:23:40,318 --> 02:23:44,478
and it's plain and simple

4326
02:23:42,239 --> 02:23:46,478
you could have a really nice mom from a

4327
02:23:44,478 --> 02:23:48,559
regular seed and depending whatever

4328
02:23:46,478 --> 02:23:50,318
genetics are in that it might not be

4329
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:52,559
good for breeding or it might be awesome

4330
02:23:50,318 --> 02:23:53,920
for breeding and the same goes for femme

4331
02:23:52,559 --> 02:23:55,680
seed

4332
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:58,799
it could be super stable when you breed

4333
02:23:55,680 --> 02:24:01,520
with it or it could be super harmy but

4334
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:04,000
i tell people do a run with your moms or

4335
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:06,319
stress test the hell out of them and see

4336
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,760
who croaks you know like [ __ ] with your

4337
02:24:06,318 --> 02:24:09,600
lights in the middle of the night turn

4338
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:11,760
them on for a little for like half an

4339
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:13,200
hour like every couple weeks during

4340
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:14,960
flower like

4341
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:16,720
if you can [ __ ] with your temperatures

4342
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:19,119
like just shot your heat off or shut off

4343
02:24:16,719 --> 02:24:21,279
your ac and let it go wild for like a

4344
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,280
few days and like

4345
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:24,720
i don't know maybe let them almost die

4346
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:26,079
for like not watering them and then

4347
02:24:24,719 --> 02:24:28,559
water them like just enough that they

4348
02:24:26,079 --> 02:24:29,359
bounce back i do all kinds of weird [ __ ]

4349
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:32,000
like

4350
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:33,200
just as a test to see how stable your

4351
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,079
plants are

4352
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,840
and

4353
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:38,318
usually once you've done that like you

4354
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:39,840
have at least a much better chance that

4355
02:24:38,318 --> 02:24:41,680
they're gonna outcross well because they

4356
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:43,920
seem to be stable although it's not

4357
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:47,200
always the case you definitely just have

4358
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:49,920
to grow up whatever cross you make but

4359
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:51,840
um it's no secret that you need a pupil

4360
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:54,318
the amnesia haze came from them seed

4361
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:56,159
from royal queen seeds and i was not

4362
02:24:54,318 --> 02:24:58,000
planning on breeding with it but i just

4363
02:24:56,159 --> 02:25:00,398
found some amazing pheno and i was like

4364
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,879
[ __ ] it let's see what happens and

4365
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:04,879
i was totally expecting it to be like

4366
02:25:02,879 --> 02:25:07,039
some sketchy-ass hermit cross because it

4367
02:25:04,879 --> 02:25:09,358
was a fence seed but

4368
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:10,479
they all came out super stable and super

4369
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:11,439
amazing

4370
02:25:10,478 --> 02:25:14,000
and

4371
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:16,159
that mom was a really really good plant

4372
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,639
and it was so so vigorous didn't matter

4373
02:25:16,159 --> 02:25:20,398
that it was from the fmc it was insanely

4374
02:25:18,639 --> 02:25:22,719
vigorous so

4375
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:24,639
i don't know i i see a lot of things

4376
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:27,599
come from fantasies and see a lot of

4377
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:30,159
good things come from egg seeds too

4378
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:32,079
yeah i can definitely attest to that

4379
02:25:30,159 --> 02:25:34,318
so in regards to being more of a

4380
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:36,318
well-established breeder these days do

4381
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:38,159
you find that there's any difficulty in

4382
02:25:36,318 --> 02:25:39,439
dealing with multiple seed banks is

4383
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:41,039
there at times where you wish you were

4384
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:42,880
just going through one or do you kind of

4385
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:45,120
like being able to spread your work out

4386
02:25:42,879 --> 02:25:45,119
a bit

4387
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:50,079
um i like being able to spread it out

4388
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:51,760
because for whatever reason like

4389
02:25:50,079 --> 02:25:54,959
customers seem to have their own

4390
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:56,960
preference like some some growers are

4391
02:25:54,959 --> 02:25:59,119
just like when's it coming to neptune

4392
02:25:56,959 --> 02:26:00,879
and i'm like dude it's a seed bank and

4393
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:02,240
this seed bank like if you want it go

4394
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:03,679
get it before it's gone because it's

4395
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:06,000
limited and they're like i'm gonna wait

4396
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:08,639
till neptune gets it or like i'm gonna

4397
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,879
wait till the east coast gets it and

4398
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:12,398
sometimes they're not even like locally

4399
02:26:10,879 --> 02:26:15,119
from that area it's just like where they

4400
02:26:12,398 --> 02:26:16,719
prefer to shop for whatever reason so

4401
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:18,720
it's kind of cool to

4402
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:20,398
spread them out to different places and

4403
02:26:18,719 --> 02:26:22,000
different people and like

4404
02:26:20,398 --> 02:26:24,398
you know some of the seed banks are

4405
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,719
close friends of mine so it's like they

4406
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,159
in my book they come first like it first

4407
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:30,318
dibs on whatever

4408
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:32,478
and then the people who take like a

4409
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:34,799
month to answer me like it's their fault

4410
02:26:32,478 --> 02:26:36,719
if they miss a drop or something but

4411
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:38,398
people are just going to get them

4412
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:40,398
like it's kind of first come first serve

4413
02:26:38,398 --> 02:26:41,599
like i reach out to everybody and tell

4414
02:26:40,398 --> 02:26:43,358
them like all right these are coming

4415
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,960
next and then

4416
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:46,840
get them if you want them don't get them

4417
02:26:44,959 --> 02:26:49,358
if you don't but this is what's

4418
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:51,520
happening i try to like tag the seed

4419
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:52,559
banks that only have this train when

4420
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:54,079
it's

4421
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:56,478
available and stuff it's hard to keep

4422
02:26:54,079 --> 02:26:58,318
track obviously so sometimes i just have

4423
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:00,398
them all and i'm like just look through

4424
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:04,000
them see if you can find it

4425
02:27:00,398 --> 02:27:04,799
yeah but yeah i like it

4426
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,719
so

4427
02:27:04,799 --> 02:27:08,478
on to our last question before the short

4428
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:10,318
fire ones

4429
02:27:08,478 --> 02:27:11,840
who is someone because you mentioned

4430
02:27:10,318 --> 02:27:13,279
earlier you've done some collabs before

4431
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:15,359
but who are some breeders who you would

4432
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:17,280
love to do a collab with going forward

4433
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:19,359
and more importantly how would you

4434
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:20,880
logistically envision the project go

4435
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:22,640
down would you want it to be like you

4436
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:25,759
select one parent they select the other

4437
02:27:22,639 --> 02:27:27,279
or how would you want to do it

4438
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:28,960
um

4439
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:30,399
definitely would love to do a collab

4440
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:31,839
with bobotie

4441
02:27:30,398 --> 02:27:34,239
just because

4442
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:36,799
i find that he vibes i vibe with him

4443
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:38,799
like with his whole philosophy and his

4444
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:41,279
way of doing things

4445
02:27:38,799 --> 02:27:42,879
from his vision of the planet and

4446
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:45,120
kind of

4447
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:47,199
yet pretty much he's one of my favorite

4448
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:48,960
readers so

4449
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:50,800
i would like to do something with him if

4450
02:27:48,959 --> 02:27:53,358
he was down for it like i mean i've read

4451
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:55,679
with some of his work before so i would

4452
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:57,600
love to see him read some of mine and it

4453
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:00,559
could go any way that works you know

4454
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:02,880
like send him a cut or something uh send

4455
02:28:00,559 --> 02:28:04,398
him seeds to hunt through and

4456
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:08,478
you know maybe hit it with one of his

4457
02:28:04,398 --> 02:28:11,039
males on in his own program or whatever

4458
02:28:08,478 --> 02:28:13,599
or maybe he send me something special to

4459
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:15,439
work with um

4460
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:17,040
and then you know same with any other

4461
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:19,680
reader if i was going to collab like

4462
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:21,760
something like that like right now um

4463
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:25,200
i didn't even really realize how it was

4464
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:29,520
a collab but i sent dragon's flame

4465
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:31,040
um affino of d-man's panama powerhouse

4466
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:32,239
and then d-man was like yeah he can

4467
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,680
breathe with it and i was like yeah you

4468
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:35,600
can breed with it and then all of a

4469
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:38,398
sudden i was like oh [ __ ] we're we're

4470
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:40,479
collaborating aren't we cool hell yeah

4471
02:28:38,398 --> 02:28:42,239
and i talked to him a lot he's a cool

4472
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:44,079
dude with like some really unique

4473
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:47,760
paintings going on

4474
02:28:44,079 --> 02:28:49,840
and he does really really large humps so

4475
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:50,960
um he's got some awesome selections for

4476
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:53,200
sure so

4477
02:28:50,959 --> 02:28:54,559
now he's he released this pan dragon

4478
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:56,000
which is

4479
02:28:54,559 --> 02:28:57,920
basically it's a cool out of the three

4480
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,239
of us because i hunted

4481
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:01,120
the pen with a powerhouse that demand

4482
02:29:00,239 --> 02:29:04,000
bread

4483
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:06,640
and dragon flame across it with his

4484
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,959
dragon stash mail so

4485
02:29:06,639 --> 02:29:12,000
stuff like that's really cool and then

4486
02:29:08,959 --> 02:29:13,759
who else would i want to work with

4487
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,760
definitely more stuff with d-man i was

4488
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:17,520
really impressed with his stellar

4489
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:19,920
collision which was

4490
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,960
a star pupil cross with power load

4491
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:23,280
and

4492
02:29:20,959 --> 02:29:26,000
that [ __ ] was a power load dude it was

4493
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:28,079
[ __ ] strong i was so surprised that

4494
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,239
just like how ridiculous those plants

4495
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:32,799
were like these huge baseball bats but

4496
02:29:30,239 --> 02:29:34,398
then it was potent too and i was like

4497
02:29:32,799 --> 02:29:37,039
damn you nailed it

4498
02:29:34,398 --> 02:29:38,799
really really nice so

4499
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:40,720
collab is always fun i'm always open to

4500
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:42,639
it like any breeder that

4501
02:29:40,719 --> 02:29:45,279
vibes with me like

4502
02:29:42,639 --> 02:29:47,680
if i don't know they pretty much have to

4503
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:50,840
not like cookies and then they're in

4504
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:50,840
i think

4505
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:54,079
all right

4506
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,239
i like people that grow organically and

4507
02:29:54,079 --> 02:29:57,120
like have a decent sense for the planet

4508
02:29:56,239 --> 02:30:00,000
and

4509
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:01,120
pretty respectful and like

4510
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,120
i don't know

4511
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:05,040
i i think the vibe just has a lot to do

4512
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:06,960
with everything and the breeding

4513
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:09,200
practices too

4514
02:30:06,959 --> 02:30:10,879
yeah of course it all follows through

4515
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,399
so on to our last set of questions the

4516
02:30:10,879 --> 02:30:14,799
quick fire ones

4517
02:30:12,398 --> 02:30:17,879
firstly what is your favorite strain at

4518
02:30:14,799 --> 02:30:17,879
the moment

4519
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:22,000
damn

4520
02:30:20,159 --> 02:30:23,680
um

4521
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,600
it totally depends on my mood it's

4522
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:29,680
either star pupil panama powerhouse

4523
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:32,800
uh

4524
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:34,479
mr e is a go-to because it's always

4525
02:30:32,799 --> 02:30:36,318
comfortable

4526
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:37,760
if i'm like super anxious i'll just

4527
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:39,840
smoke mr d

4528
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:41,760
and i never get too i'm always just like

4529
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:44,239
perfectly grounded but at the same time

4530
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:46,478
it's pretty damn strong so that's a

4531
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:48,879
really special plant too those are like

4532
02:30:46,478 --> 02:30:50,879
my top three at the moment

4533
02:30:48,879 --> 02:30:53,199
yeah okay and so now to get a bit more

4534
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:55,839
specific favorite strain of all time

4535
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:55,840
only one

4536
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:02,319
damn

4537
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:05,120
i gotta go with my baby star pupil

4538
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:06,959
because that thing is it's just too

4539
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,520
special i don't know it's brought me on

4540
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:10,959
so many journeys and brought me so much

4541
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:12,640
happiness and

4542
02:31:10,959 --> 02:31:13,438
to so many other people too it's just

4543
02:31:12,639 --> 02:31:15,439
like

4544
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:18,398
super good vibes all around and somehow

4545
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:20,880
i never get bored of it growing it like

4546
02:31:18,398 --> 02:31:24,239
so many times so i guess the one but

4547
02:31:20,879 --> 02:31:26,000
there's a lot of close seconds for sure

4548
02:31:24,239 --> 02:31:28,079
so conversely on the other end of the

4549
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:31,200
spectrum what's the strain which just

4550
02:31:28,079 --> 02:31:33,280
least jived with you

4551
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:35,439
oh it's definitely girl scout cookies

4552
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:37,439
and i'll elaborate on that because i

4553
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:39,040
don't want people to just like not

4554
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:41,040
understand

4555
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:42,800
um

4556
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:44,640
basically

4557
02:31:42,799 --> 02:31:46,000
it's like the strain that to me when you

4558
02:31:44,639 --> 02:31:47,039
hit something with the girl scout

4559
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,520
cookies

4560
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:51,600
it just becomes cookies

4561
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:53,439
and obviously we'll have like different

4562
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:56,079
expressions based on what you process

4563
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:59,280
with a little bit but like i always can

4564
02:31:56,079 --> 02:32:01,039
pick out the cookies like in one toke i

4565
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,560
can just taste it or just smelling the

4566
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:05,040
bud like it's just

4567
02:32:02,559 --> 02:32:06,318
the cookies are very dominating strain

4568
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:08,560
to me

4569
02:32:06,318 --> 02:32:11,840
um even when it seems not to be like i

4570
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:13,600
can just pick it out and

4571
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:16,000
it's it's not just that it hurts and all

4572
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:18,559
that is like i physically

4573
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:21,040
can't smoke it personally because like

4574
02:32:18,559 --> 02:32:23,840
it gives me this crazy depression

4575
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,600
anxiety like bad head

4576
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:28,079
and it comes through in the crosses too

4577
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:30,239
so whatever reason like i don't like

4578
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:32,639
that strain and then

4579
02:32:30,239 --> 02:32:34,239
to make it worse like everybody started

4580
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:36,159
breeding with it and putting it in

4581
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:39,039
everything and

4582
02:32:36,159 --> 02:32:41,439
i swear it's like every other plant i

4583
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:42,800
see in my explore page is like hey that

4584
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:44,479
looks good but it kind of looks like

4585
02:32:42,799 --> 02:32:46,239
cookie i wonder what it is and then i

4586
02:32:44,478 --> 02:32:48,239
click on it and it's like

4587
02:32:46,239 --> 02:32:49,760
something something cookies or something

4588
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:52,159
else with something across the cookies

4589
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:54,478
in the background there's so many

4590
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:56,159
breeders using it and it makes it so

4591
02:32:54,478 --> 02:32:58,719
that i can't smoke half the weed that's

4592
02:32:56,159 --> 02:33:00,719
out there and i try to be open-minded so

4593
02:32:58,719 --> 02:33:03,519
i always smoke it and then

4594
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:05,358
i have a bad time every [ __ ] time and

4595
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:07,280
there was two cookies

4596
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:09,280
there was two cookies crosses that i

4597
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:11,439
liked out of

4598
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:13,120
i've documented at least 15 that i've

4599
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:14,800
tried but i've probably tried more than

4600
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:16,640
that because i don't usually write down

4601
02:33:14,799 --> 02:33:18,639
when i smoke [ __ ] but

4602
02:33:16,639 --> 02:33:20,799
i've smoked a lot of cookies and i only

4603
02:33:18,639 --> 02:33:22,398
like to go ever

4604
02:33:20,799 --> 02:33:24,639
and they were like pretty far out

4605
02:33:22,398 --> 02:33:27,119
crossed and the ones that i liked

4606
02:33:24,639 --> 02:33:29,119
yeah um and yeah i don't know it's just

4607
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:31,200
like [ __ ] up the g pool really bad

4608
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:32,880
because

4609
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:34,640
i don't know cross anything into

4610
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:36,079
everything and then you lose diversity

4611
02:33:34,639 --> 02:33:36,959
and you can never

4612
02:33:36,079 --> 02:33:38,879
get it

4613
02:33:36,959 --> 02:33:39,679
back fully because it's in there it's

4614
02:33:38,879 --> 02:33:41,759
like

4615
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:43,600
i don't know imagine there was a gmo

4616
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:44,800
strain and everyone was like [ __ ] gmos

4617
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:46,640
and then like

4618
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:49,279
if every other strain had that in there

4619
02:33:46,639 --> 02:33:51,599
it would be a huge issue so

4620
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:53,040
to me is contamination

4621
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:55,520
and it's simply a strain that i don't

4622
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:57,840
like and i appreciate i respect the fact

4623
02:33:55,520 --> 02:34:00,079
that people do like it because for a lot

4624
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:02,159
of people the girl scout cookies is like

4625
02:34:00,079 --> 02:34:03,680
good medicine or it's a good plan or

4626
02:34:02,159 --> 02:34:06,000
whatever they like about it and i

4627
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:07,920
completely respect that because whatever

4628
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,439
my favorite might be could be their

4629
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:12,079
least favorite i don't know like

4630
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:14,318
everybody has their own body and

4631
02:34:12,079 --> 02:34:16,959
everything works differently for them so

4632
02:34:14,318 --> 02:34:19,199
i respect the plant but i feel like it's

4633
02:34:16,959 --> 02:34:21,679
way way overused and it's really causing

4634
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:23,280
problems in breeding and then

4635
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:25,359
diversity and like when you go to

4636
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:26,560
dispensary and restraint is like the

4637
02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:27,680
same thing

4638
02:34:26,559 --> 02:34:29,039
when it's

4639
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:30,960
three quarters of them are just a

4640
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:32,800
cookie's cross and then the one you

4641
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:35,279
think isn't a cookie's cross you look it

4642
02:34:32,799 --> 02:34:38,000
up and it is

4643
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:38,800
that's a thorough answer i like that

4644
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,760
so

4645
02:34:38,799 --> 02:34:43,840
if you could only grow one land race

4646
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:46,398
strain for the rest of your life which

4647
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:48,880
one would it be

4648
02:34:46,398 --> 02:34:49,559
oh [ __ ]

4649
02:34:48,879 --> 02:34:51,199
um

4650
02:34:49,559 --> 02:34:52,639
[Music]

4651
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:54,319
see that's tricky because first i went

4652
02:34:52,639 --> 02:34:56,239
to panama and then i was like dude

4653
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:58,719
sometimes panama's way too [ __ ]

4654
02:34:56,239 --> 02:35:00,318
strong like it's for my whole life

4655
02:34:58,719 --> 02:35:02,239
i'm just going to go crazy if i only

4656
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:03,600
smoke that so

4657
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:06,398
i mean

4658
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:08,239
can i grow the strains on the side

4659
02:35:06,398 --> 02:35:10,639
to balance it out

4660
02:35:08,239 --> 02:35:10,639
okay

4661
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:15,760
um damn

4662
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:17,280
that's super tricky

4663
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:18,800
because like that's a favorite of mine

4664
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,239
but that's too strong

4665
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:22,079
honestly like i need something more

4666
02:35:20,239 --> 02:35:23,520
mellow that i can chill with so that i

4667
02:35:22,079 --> 02:35:27,280
can smoke it

4668
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:30,159
like whenever i need to what's smoothing

4669
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:30,159
probably like

4670
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:34,799
some purple type of packs to any land

4671
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:35,839
race just because like they're not that

4672
02:35:34,799 --> 02:35:38,159
strong

4673
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:40,559
and i love strong weed but

4674
02:35:38,159 --> 02:35:42,559
if i was stuck with something forever

4675
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:44,879
i would have to go with something that's

4676
02:35:42,559 --> 02:35:47,359
a little bit mellower just

4677
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:49,279
like for my own sandy because a lot of

4678
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:51,200
the stuff that i breed i can't smoke it

4679
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:53,680
every day it's like when i want an

4680
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:55,600
experience or like whenever when i'm in

4681
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,280
the right mindset i can smoke them days

4682
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:59,200
and days in a row but then other times

4683
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:01,280
like give me something mellow like this

4684
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:03,920
shit's too strong the land races are

4685
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:05,359
pretty wild sometimes

4686
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:06,960
yeah that's that's a good pick i was

4687
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:08,640
kind of thinking in my mind the [ __ ]

4688
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:11,279
because of those reasons you mentioned

4689
02:36:08,639 --> 02:36:13,439
plus you can even find some like uh

4690
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:15,840
narrow leaf packies as well so you know

4691
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:17,120
goes both ways sometimes yeah

4692
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:19,439
so definitely

4693
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:21,040
next question what's the biggest mistake

4694
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:23,840
you see people making when they're

4695
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,840
starting to breed

4696
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:26,719
um

4697
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:27,760
[Music]

4698
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:30,559
not

4699
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:32,000
using enough selection because i see so

4700
02:36:30,559 --> 02:36:34,719
many people

4701
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,239
that they pop two pack two seeds out of

4702
02:36:34,719 --> 02:36:37,760
like one pack let's say like they're

4703
02:36:36,239 --> 02:36:40,159
growing a few different strains but each

4704
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:41,920
one they only pop like one or two seeds

4705
02:36:40,159 --> 02:36:43,359
and then like

4706
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:45,840
something gives them a mail and they're

4707
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:48,239
just like that's my mail and while that

4708
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:50,799
can work that's just a crapshoot like if

4709
02:36:48,239 --> 02:36:53,439
you're lucky that won't work but

4710
02:36:50,799 --> 02:36:55,840
nine out of ten times if you select a

4711
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:58,720
male out of like

4712
02:36:55,840 --> 02:37:00,079
even ten males instead of one male

4713
02:36:58,719 --> 02:37:02,398
you can look for something that you're

4714
02:37:00,079 --> 02:37:03,520
looking for rather than just using what

4715
02:37:02,398 --> 02:37:05,039
you have

4716
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:07,600
and the same goes for females too

4717
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:09,439
actually i mean i really love hunting

4718
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:11,600
males and i could get into that little

4719
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:13,920
what i like to look for but

4720
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:15,600
first i want to say that

4721
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:17,280
people uh

4722
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:18,479
i don't know i see a lot of beginner

4723
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:20,640
breeders like

4724
02:37:18,478 --> 02:37:22,478
they pop one or a few seeds and they got

4725
02:37:20,639 --> 02:37:24,239
like one staple female and they just

4726
02:37:22,478 --> 02:37:26,000
like go and breed with it

4727
02:37:24,239 --> 02:37:27,840
and it's not like the worst i did

4728
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,439
because like you could for sure make

4729
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:30,880
something good and if you're just doing

4730
02:37:29,439 --> 02:37:33,040
it for yourself and your friends it's

4731
02:37:30,879 --> 02:37:34,959
cool but

4732
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:37,120
there's so much more

4733
02:37:34,959 --> 02:37:39,039
potential and more fun really if you can

4734
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:40,160
do a larger gene pool

4735
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:41,520
and

4736
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:43,119
people always say like they don't have

4737
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:44,840
the space and blah blah blah but just

4738
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:46,800
grow smaller plants and grow more of

4739
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:48,159
them and

4740
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:50,000
look for like

4741
02:37:48,159 --> 02:37:52,559
something special like i think you have

4742
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,079
to know this planet a little bit more

4743
02:37:52,559 --> 02:37:57,199
like you can start breeding when you

4744
02:37:54,079 --> 02:37:59,120
start growing for sure but you have to

4745
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:01,840
keep an eye on the plant

4746
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:03,760
as a species and see what variations are

4747
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:04,960
in there and what you like and what you

4748
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:06,318
don't like

4749
02:38:04,959 --> 02:38:08,799
and that's how you're going to create

4750
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:12,000
something a little bit better

4751
02:38:08,799 --> 02:38:13,358
is by weeding out the bad ones and like

4752
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,840
a lot of people will say like yeah i

4753
02:38:13,359 --> 02:38:17,439
have this one plant and it's pretty it's

4754
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,600
not strong but it has all these other

4755
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:20,880
traits and the flavor sucks and then

4756
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:22,880
i'll cross over this and try to make it

4757
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:24,799
better and i'm like dude if you have a

4758
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:26,799
bigger selection you'd probably find a

4759
02:38:24,799 --> 02:38:30,079
stronger one to work with to begin with

4760
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:32,398
that has maybe a better flavor and then

4761
02:38:30,079 --> 02:38:34,478
like work with a good plant and another

4762
02:38:32,398 --> 02:38:36,318
good plant make those better don't work

4763
02:38:34,478 --> 02:38:38,000
with a sheep plant and a decent plant

4764
02:38:36,318 --> 02:38:40,318
and try to make cold because you

4765
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:42,398
certainly can but it's just more work

4766
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:44,079
and like at this point there's so much

4767
02:38:42,398 --> 02:38:45,039
good stuff out there like just pick a

4768
02:38:44,079 --> 02:38:46,719
good one

4769
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:49,359
like find a good one take the time to

4770
02:38:46,719 --> 02:38:52,000
find special plants and then you'll

4771
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:54,079
create some really cool stuff

4772
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,760
yeah for sure and i mean you just kind

4773
02:38:54,079 --> 02:38:57,520
of said yourself you'd love to talk

4774
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:59,920
about some our selection stuff why don't

4775
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:04,640
we do it before we wrap it up

4776
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:04,639
okay so mail selection right yeah

4777
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:08,478
yeah so

4778
02:39:06,959 --> 02:39:11,438
basically

4779
02:39:08,478 --> 02:39:14,879
i try to look at the male plants as if

4780
02:39:11,439 --> 02:39:17,200
they were female plants and for kind of

4781
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:19,119
the same things you would look for

4782
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,280
the only thing is that you can't smoke

4783
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:22,560
it i mean people say you can try to

4784
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:24,319
smoke it but

4785
02:39:22,559 --> 02:39:25,600
there's no buds to smoke it's plain and

4786
02:39:24,318 --> 02:39:26,959
simple you're not going to go smoking

4787
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:28,720
your nails really

4788
02:39:26,959 --> 02:39:32,000
to get high so

4789
02:39:28,719 --> 02:39:33,760
um my first piece of advice is like

4790
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,520
generally grow

4791
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:37,520
hunt milk of the strain that you've

4792
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:39,439
already grown before and smoke the

4793
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:41,520
females or at least if you haven't run

4794
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:42,960
it you've smoked a female of it and you

4795
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,399
know what it's like

4796
02:39:42,959 --> 02:39:45,438
and

4797
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:48,318
um

4798
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:50,000
pay attention to like the pheno of the

4799
02:39:48,318 --> 02:39:52,239
female in that strain that you're

4800
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,079
looking for especially if it's like a

4801
02:39:52,239 --> 02:39:55,199
polyhybrid that may have a few different

4802
02:39:54,079 --> 02:39:56,959
phenoes

4803
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:58,640
you might want to select male that kind

4804
02:39:56,959 --> 02:40:00,079
of seems to match up with the female

4805
02:39:58,639 --> 02:40:01,358
that you like

4806
02:40:00,079 --> 02:40:03,439
um

4807
02:40:01,359 --> 02:40:05,040
and you have to do all of this

4808
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:08,000
with all your other senses you can't

4809
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:09,920
smoke it but the male plant is just as

4810
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,920
much of a cannabis plant as the female

4811
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:13,680
plant and

4812
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:15,359
when you first start flowering males

4813
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,840
like a lot of people just like okay well

4814
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:19,680
there's pollen that's uses it but

4815
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:22,079
i don't know that's kind of early to

4816
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:24,960
make your decision because

4817
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:26,318
the male flowers develop over time and

4818
02:40:24,959 --> 02:40:28,318
sometimes they'll start dropping a

4819
02:40:26,318 --> 02:40:30,318
little pollen but they're not fully

4820
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:33,119
grown yet you haven't seen like

4821
02:40:30,318 --> 02:40:34,398
how it really stacks and how

4822
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:37,279
if it gets

4823
02:40:34,398 --> 02:40:38,398
resonance and trichomes and

4824
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:40,079
what it

4825
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:41,680
you know like there's a lot more to see

4826
02:40:40,079 --> 02:40:44,398
so

4827
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:46,479
i recommend first of all get like

4828
02:40:44,398 --> 02:40:48,559
a strain you like start a bunch of seeds

4829
02:40:46,478 --> 02:40:50,000
of it you can even call the females if

4830
02:40:48,559 --> 02:40:52,000
you don't have time for that or give

4831
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,318
them away or whatever but like you want

4832
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,318
a lot of males to look through and you

4833
02:40:54,318 --> 02:40:58,478
can do it you have to like squeeze them

4834
02:40:56,318 --> 02:41:00,879
in a two by four or four by four or

4835
02:40:58,478 --> 02:41:03,199
whatever like small areas fine small

4836
02:41:00,879 --> 02:41:05,519
plants are fine but like the more plants

4837
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:07,279
the better like flower in a two or three

4838
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:09,840
gallon if you can like to keep them

4839
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:11,279
small but still get a decent expression

4840
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:13,279
off of them

4841
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:15,439
you could flower them in a soiled bed if

4842
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:16,960
you want then you can do way more plants

4843
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:20,159
that way like

4844
02:41:16,959 --> 02:41:23,039
in a 4x4 bed i like to start 250 seeds

4845
02:41:20,159 --> 02:41:26,079
and then narrow it down to like 30 to 50

4846
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:27,840
final plants to hit flower with

4847
02:41:26,079 --> 02:41:29,520
um and then you can really look through

4848
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:31,520
the phenos as they're flowering and you

4849
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:33,840
can clone off of whatever you need and

4850
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:35,840
you can re-veg a male clone too you just

4851
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:38,159
gotta keep picking off the pollen sacks

4852
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:40,079
but it works usually

4853
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:42,840
um

4854
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:45,120
and let's see so flour a whole bunch of

4855
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:46,799
those find

4856
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:48,399
you gotta stem rub them like i said

4857
02:41:46,799 --> 02:41:50,079
earlier stem rub them like probably

4858
02:41:48,398 --> 02:41:50,959
every week or so

4859
02:41:50,079 --> 02:41:52,398
um

4860
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:53,919
starting pretty early you know when

4861
02:41:52,398 --> 02:41:55,599
they're a few notes tall and they start

4862
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:56,799
smelling pretty good

4863
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:58,880
i love

4864
02:41:56,799 --> 02:42:02,079
to hunt males under full spectrum

4865
02:41:58,879 --> 02:42:03,759
lighting especially as cmh because

4866
02:42:02,079 --> 02:42:06,000
you can really smell

4867
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:08,000
the turbines a lot more with that kind

4868
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,159
of lighting maybe it's the uv maybe it's

4869
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,239
the full spectrum but

4870
02:42:10,159 --> 02:42:14,559
when you get really really stinky plants

4871
02:42:12,239 --> 02:42:17,039
you get a really good clue to like

4872
02:42:14,559 --> 02:42:19,278
what what if you know that maybe or like

4873
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:22,160
the intensity of you is big with the

4874
02:42:19,279 --> 02:42:23,680
male that that can help a lot to pass on

4875
02:42:22,159 --> 02:42:25,840
to the next generation and get you

4876
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:27,359
something really really

4877
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:29,359
um

4878
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:30,960
and

4879
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:32,640
let's see

4880
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:34,719
there's a lot of growth

4881
02:42:32,639 --> 02:42:36,478
characteristics and veg that are pretty

4882
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:38,799
important when you're going through big

4883
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:41,039
selections like if you're starting a few

4884
02:42:38,799 --> 02:42:43,278
hundred in solo cups

4885
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:44,640
and they're ready for transplant this is

4886
02:42:43,279 --> 02:42:46,079
where you're gonna throw half of them

4887
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:47,680
out because you're gonna look at the

4888
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:48,879
root development as you take them out of

4889
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,680
the cup

4890
02:42:48,879 --> 02:42:51,679
and

4891
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:53,120
everything that has half-assed roots

4892
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:54,720
doesn't matter how good the plant is

4893
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:57,279
it's not perfect to get rid of it you

4894
02:42:54,719 --> 02:42:59,119
gotta call it a lot of plants so that

4895
02:42:57,279 --> 02:43:00,000
you're just ending up with the best one

4896
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:01,840
so

4897
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:04,000
even if each stage of transplant you

4898
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:05,920
have to weed out half the plants just to

4899
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:09,600
fit your space like that's good because

4900
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:12,079
you're only gonna keep the best and

4901
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:14,239
um yeah root development is big just

4902
02:43:12,079 --> 02:43:16,478
because you want the best plant you can

4903
02:43:14,239 --> 02:43:18,799
get in like every aspect and something

4904
02:43:16,478 --> 02:43:21,840
that grows roots fast probably going to

4905
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:23,358
grow above ground faster too

4906
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,040
um

4907
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:27,439
let's see

4908
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:29,120
the first males that show sex i always

4909
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:30,398
kill those no matter what

4910
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:33,600
like when you're just in veg and

4911
02:43:30,398 --> 02:43:35,199
everybody's showing female male like

4912
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:37,680
there's usually one day where like you

4913
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:39,840
know maybe a few of the mail show like

4914
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:41,120
it doesn't matter just get rid of those

4915
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:42,239
um

4916
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:44,720
and

4917
02:43:42,239 --> 02:43:47,680
usually the later showing males

4918
02:43:44,719 --> 02:43:49,599
are better or more recessive

4919
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:51,200
um all of these things by the way you

4920
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:53,760
have to test in your cross because they

4921
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:56,240
can be totally wrong sometimes the male

4922
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:58,478
will not pass on what you think it will

4923
02:43:56,239 --> 02:43:59,760
um and it depends on the cross across it

4924
02:43:58,478 --> 02:44:02,239
with a few different things and see what

4925
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:04,639
happens and grow those all out but these

4926
02:44:02,239 --> 02:44:06,719
tips will help you get like at least

4927
02:44:04,639 --> 02:44:07,920
one of the best males of your stock that

4928
02:44:06,719 --> 02:44:09,679
you're working with and you might want

4929
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:10,960
to try a few different ones on like a

4930
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:14,318
few different branches and label

4931
02:44:10,959 --> 02:44:16,318
everything and keep the clones but

4932
02:44:14,318 --> 02:44:18,639
then going into flower you want to see

4933
02:44:16,318 --> 02:44:21,278
like does a stack hard like a female

4934
02:44:18,639 --> 02:44:23,920
does it stretch super shitty lanky and

4935
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:26,000
weak or does it have like a little more

4936
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:27,920
better structure like more branching for

4937
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:30,159
the same size plants

4938
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:31,680
usually a good thing like i don't know

4939
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:33,119
there's a certain structure i'd like to

4940
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:34,559
look for but

4941
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,560
it's

4942
02:44:34,559 --> 02:44:39,439
you know look for a good planet don't

4943
02:44:36,559 --> 02:44:42,000
just take one male that you have because

4944
02:44:39,439 --> 02:44:45,200
you have two seeds go through a lot of

4945
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:48,159
males whatever you can afford to do

4946
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:50,159
and like just find that awesome plant

4947
02:44:48,159 --> 02:44:52,318
like almost every mail that i've ever

4948
02:44:50,159 --> 02:44:53,920
used has been super resinous and i've

4949
02:44:52,318 --> 02:44:55,760
heard other breeds breeders saying that

4950
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:57,680
they've never seen a residence male and

4951
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:58,719
i'm like how i see them all the time

4952
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:00,398
like

4953
02:44:58,719 --> 02:45:02,159
they're out there they're

4954
02:45:00,398 --> 02:45:03,680
maybe it depends what

4955
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:06,159
jeans you're working with because some

4956
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:08,318
strands may just have one but

4957
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:11,039
i think the bigger selection the better

4958
02:45:08,318 --> 02:45:12,959
things you're gonna find so

4959
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:15,600
go for big selection look for female

4960
02:45:12,959 --> 02:45:18,079
qualities um the smell is super

4961
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:20,318
important the intensity of the smell

4962
02:45:18,079 --> 02:45:22,239
and just the growth habits maybe i don't

4963
02:45:20,318 --> 02:45:23,760
pick the very tallest male either but

4964
02:45:22,239 --> 02:45:26,478
something in the middle

4965
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:28,719
a little vigorous is nice

4966
02:45:26,478 --> 02:45:30,559
yeah wow that was a really comprehensive

4967
02:45:28,719 --> 02:45:32,639
little run down do you think that maybe

4968
02:45:30,559 --> 02:45:34,719
some of the reason a lot of people

4969
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:35,920
uh don't see those resinous males is

4970
02:45:34,719 --> 02:45:37,519
because

4971
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:39,359
maybe they might claim to but they just

4972
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:40,640
don't really let the flowers bloom that

4973
02:45:39,359 --> 02:45:41,680
long because that's something i noticed

4974
02:45:40,639 --> 02:45:43,278
you know a lot of people as you

4975
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:45,760
mentioned will be pretty quick to cull

4976
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:48,079
the mail off

4977
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:50,559
yeah um well like

4978
02:45:48,079 --> 02:45:54,719
when i did the blue magoo mails and i

4979
02:45:50,559 --> 02:45:56,478
had like 23 22 males there was three

4980
02:45:54,719 --> 02:45:59,199
resonant ones that are straight up

4981
02:45:56,478 --> 02:46:01,278
frosty veg so i knew right off the bat

4982
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,880
and then i was flowering those three and

4983
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:03,840
a few others and just those three were

4984
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:06,159
like

4985
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:09,040
pretty caked on some areas like really

4986
02:46:06,159 --> 02:46:10,639
frosty before pollen even came out

4987
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:12,880
um and that might have been kind of an

4988
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:14,159
exception for like early early frosty

4989
02:46:12,879 --> 02:46:16,398
ones but

4990
02:46:14,159 --> 02:46:17,520
um

4991
02:46:16,398 --> 02:46:18,879
definitely

4992
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:20,800
some of the males that i thought were

4993
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:22,719
like that's good but oh well it's not

4994
02:46:20,799 --> 02:46:24,879
frosty like then they turned out to be

4995
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:26,719
frosty leader flower too so that's

4996
02:46:24,879 --> 02:46:28,318
definitely a good point like people

4997
02:46:26,719 --> 02:46:30,559
might make their selections to her just

4998
02:46:28,318 --> 02:46:31,840
because it started dropping pollen but

4999
02:46:30,559 --> 02:46:33,278
you just gotta keep it somewhere

5000
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:34,639
separate and like bring it in when

5001
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:36,880
you're ready to use it when you know

5002
02:46:34,639 --> 02:46:39,039
it's the right choice

5003
02:46:36,879 --> 02:46:41,438
yeah solid advice

5004
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:43,760
so we'll jump back now to the actual

5005
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:46,000
last question of our interview

5006
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:48,478
and it is if you could go back to any

5007
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,639
one place any moment in time presumably

5008
02:46:48,478 --> 02:46:53,599
to collect seeds or maybe a clone

5009
02:46:50,639 --> 02:46:55,680
where would you go and why

5010
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:58,479
oh i like that the clone part i never

5011
02:46:55,680 --> 02:47:01,040
thought about that

5012
02:46:58,478 --> 02:47:04,799
but uh yeah

5013
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:06,720
probably like i don't know india always

5014
02:47:04,799 --> 02:47:08,478
seemed to vibe with me maybe it's just

5015
02:47:06,719 --> 02:47:10,639
the imagery that i've been exposed to

5016
02:47:08,478 --> 02:47:12,559
but it just seems like such a beautiful

5017
02:47:10,639 --> 02:47:14,799
place where like some

5018
02:47:12,559 --> 02:47:16,559
beautiful plants with amazing vibes have

5019
02:47:14,799 --> 02:47:18,239
to come from so probably like the

5020
02:47:16,559 --> 02:47:19,519
mountains in india

5021
02:47:18,239 --> 02:47:21,840
and when

5022
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:21,840
probably

5023
02:47:22,079 --> 02:47:24,959
i don't know how long they've been

5024
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:27,520
cultivating there but i know they've

5025
02:47:24,959 --> 02:47:30,478
been for a while so like

5026
02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:30,479
i would want to go

5027
02:47:30,719 --> 02:47:34,639
before like

5028
02:47:32,639 --> 02:47:36,239
white people started breeding i guess

5029
02:47:34,639 --> 02:47:40,239
before we like [ __ ] everything up with

5030
02:47:36,239 --> 02:47:42,079
our poly hybrids so anytime before

5031
02:47:40,239 --> 02:47:43,840
i don't know even the early 1900s i'm

5032
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:46,719
sure like there was some great like

5033
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:48,880
locally bred stuff that wasn't like

5034
02:47:46,719 --> 02:47:51,039
super hybridized but just like nice

5035
02:47:48,879 --> 02:47:52,318
selections that came from land race in

5036
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:54,000
the area

5037
02:47:52,318 --> 02:47:56,719
like you know like a good air like a

5038
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:58,559
family heirloom somewhere in the 100

5039
02:47:56,719 --> 02:48:00,719
years ago that would be really really

5040
02:47:58,559 --> 02:48:02,398
really cool

5041
02:48:00,719 --> 02:48:03,760
yeah for sure i think there's a lot of

5042
02:48:02,398 --> 02:48:07,039
stuff locked away in india that we

5043
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:08,719
haven't seen yet so to speak

5044
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:10,880
yeah definitely there's all these people

5045
02:48:08,719 --> 02:48:12,799
living in the mountains that have their

5046
02:48:10,879 --> 02:48:15,199
strains that they grow there and there's

5047
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:17,599
a lot of wild strains and

5048
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:18,319
there's there's like remote locations

5049
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,920
and

5050
02:48:18,318 --> 02:48:21,680
really really

5051
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:23,439
interesting things that are hiding from

5052
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:25,279
civilization which

5053
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:26,318
probably is for the best so we don't

5054
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:28,479
ruin it

5055
02:48:26,318 --> 02:48:30,159
like by bringing our own seeds in there

5056
02:48:28,478 --> 02:48:31,840
and stuff

5057
02:48:30,159 --> 02:48:34,239
yeah right

5058
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:36,159
so i think that one um that might bring

5059
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:37,439
us about to the end of it was there any

5060
02:48:36,159 --> 02:48:39,680
shout outs or comments you wanted to

5061
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:39,680
make

5062
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:42,800
um

5063
02:48:40,879 --> 02:48:44,398
yeah shout out to everybody that's

5064
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:45,599
growing organically

5065
02:48:44,398 --> 02:48:47,278
because

5066
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:48,399
it's like the single most important

5067
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:49,760
thing

5068
02:48:48,398 --> 02:48:50,478
um

5069
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:53,680
and

5070
02:48:50,478 --> 02:48:55,679
grow for like grow with good vibes and

5071
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:57,040
good intentions really

5072
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:58,559
um

5073
02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:01,200
it's like

5074
02:48:58,559 --> 02:49:02,719
i don't know organic and good vibes like

5075
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:05,200
so some people it's just gonna sound

5076
02:49:02,719 --> 02:49:07,278
like hippie trash whatever but

5077
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:09,120
seriously think about it it's the

5078
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:11,279
