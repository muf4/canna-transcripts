welcome back to part two of our chat

hope you're excited to get back into it

87
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,760
let's do it

88
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:46,259
speaking of that joint you're obviously

89
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,120
aware you're quite lucky to be smoking

90
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,239
original Haze you know not many people

91
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,980
are able to say they've had that I guess

92
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,719
the question is how would you describe

93
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,500
it like how do you describe the effect

94
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,878
what's the flavors you get and um do you

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,680
think it's the sort of thing that's for

96
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,018
everyone or it's only for a certain type

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,879
of smoker

98
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,920
um I think if more people had access to

99
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,579
it they would really enjoy it uh it's

100
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:15,780
spicy it's like uh an incense almost

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,419
it's a not really sweet but it has Sweet

102
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,579
Tones but

103
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,439
um the high is really energetic I mean

104
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,759
the part I like about it is if I smoke

105
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,040
Haze in the morning it really

106
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,220
invigorates me to want to go do the

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,520
dishes you know get to work you know

108
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,500
jump on my tasks uh I don't really know

109
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,198
what it is because I've tested it like I

110
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,720
I I've tested Haze and tested OG Kush

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,360
and I would have thought the OG Kush was

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,699
more potent than the than the haze but

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,240
the OG Kush that I grew that time I

114
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:51,600
think came back like 21.66 and the haze

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,879
that I tested was at like 24.9 and I was

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,040
just like and I and they were growing

117
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,779
same soil same system same same same

118
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,180
everything

119
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,219
um all by me so

120
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,860
you know you don't I don't know I don't

121
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,660
know like it's not just the THC in a way

122
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,479
that's that's something in the Synergy

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,060
of the terpenes uh and the terpenes

124
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,099
played this really important role

125
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,139
um Skunk Man Sam uses a really good

126
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,879
analogy that when you get high it's like

127
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,680
getting into an airplane when you get

128
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,959
into that airplane the cannabinoids are

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,819
the engines that bring you up to your

130
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,638
height and then the terpenes are the

131
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,439
Rudders that that will shape the flow of

132
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,538
it the softness of your Landing the

133
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,939
whole thing and without the terpenes the

134
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,819
cannabinoids don't really feel as good

135
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,459
and anybody listening to this can can

136
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,800
actually uh try it themselves they

137
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,839
literally could take a good bud smoke

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,478
half of it leave it on the coffee table

139
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,418
for a couple days let it dry up all the

140
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,000
cannabinoids are still present but the

141
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,859
terpenes will have been lost and when

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,478
the terpenes are lost it won't have the

143
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,660
same high it won't have the same taste

144
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,879
it won't have the same flavor and it

145
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,620
changes even though all the cannabinoids

146
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,300
are still there so I think it really

147
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,699
shows that there's this true importance

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,918
on when it comes to the Synergy between

149
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,020
the terpenes and the modulation that

150
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,579
they create with the cannabinoids so I

151
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,099
urge more people especially the ones

152
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,198
that buy my seeds to start selecting uh

153
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,780
on organoleptic testing rather than

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,699
analytical testing because at the end of

155
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,038
the day the machine's not the one buying

156
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,900
the weed you know it's the human so if

157
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,779
if something doesn't really

158
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:30,239
you know have that Allure to it you're

159
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,219
gonna pass on it and I think that a lot

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,038
of breeders are going to find out that

161
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,440
the Market's going to drive the product

162
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,079
towards the quality that the market can

163
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,418
get so you know it's going to be about a

164
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,758
fact more than it's about bag appeal or

165
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:46,859
anything else and or about more than a

166
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,240
name more than anything you know when I

167
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,220
started selling pot when I was 12

168
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,439
everybody would always ask me what's it

169
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,699
like you know is what's this one like

170
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,500
and it's

171
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,900
it's like it's a little different to

172
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,439
everybody but the haze is really not

173
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,779
narcotic uh more Spacey more of that

174
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,519
like you get high you get high and you

175
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,839
get high some more and you get forgetful

176
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,240
and you get Giddy and you're like

177
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,478
looking for the ice cream and I don't

178
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,418
know it's it's the fun high uh the

179
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,519
Northern Lights is more heavy more like

180
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,680
whoa you know like more go sit in the

181
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,799
hot tub and grab the remote control and

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,819
relax or go to bed early like that more

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,000
narcotic like effect and um

184
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,439
so the haze to me is

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,879
I don't know I think more people are

186
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,399
gonna love it and I think more people

187
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,620
are gonna breed with it I've sold quite

188
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,978
a few seeds in the last two and a half

189
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,199
years of it and um I'm hoping more and

190
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,899
more and more people start introducing

191
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,639
it into their uh crosses because it's

192
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:51,000
been kind of long enough now about two

193
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,560
seasons since I offered it in 2019 that

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,538
people have been able to know you know

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,098
grow it and work with it

196
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,259
so I personally think we're going to

197
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,000
start seeing more and more of it

198
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,439
um you know my kind of my joke when I

199
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,598
started doing this was I want to Haze

200
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,519
the world

201
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,959
you know that would be cool to see for

202
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,698
sure and it's something that I noticed

203
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,038
about the photos you'd post on your

204
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,439
Instagram was that the buds were sort of

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,478
a lot more plump and I guess just fatter

206
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,279
than I was expecting I think in a lot of

207
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,500
people's minds like myself you imagine

208
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,318
sort of like you're gonna get one tiny

209
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,720
piddly little joint per Branch I guess

210
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,759
the question arises do you think maybe

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,280
it yields more than what people expect

212
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,280
or it is very much like what

213
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,519
no it blew my mind uh that's a great

214
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:38,580
that's great you know I I actually

215
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,319
hesitated to post all the variations of

216
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,399
photos I was getting from the variety

217
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,879
because some of them look so unlike what

218
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,559
people think Hayes is and they get set

219
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,659
in their mind there's an old quote that

220
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,458
I used to write into all of the Emperors

221
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,740
no clothes books that I used to give

222
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,899
away and there's hundreds of them and it

223
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,200
was by Daniel borenstein and the quote

224
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:03,720
is the greatest obstacle to Discovery is

225
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,519
not ignorance it is the illusion of

226
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,200
knowledge

227
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,940
and I used to write that in all the

228
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,140
books because I felt it summarized the

229
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,240
message we were putting out about

230
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,639
cannabis being in Shroud and lies that

231
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,620
only the noble could see and that was

232
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,838
the whole mission of The Emperor's no

233
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,580
clothes for those people listening the

234
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,339
book was named the emperor is no clothes

235
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,500
from the the Fable The Emperor's New

236
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,260
Clothes where the emperor was sold cloth

237
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,139
that only the noble could see and Jack

238
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:34,559
felt that cannabis was in shrouded in

239
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,720
lies that only the noble could see and

240
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,018
he named the book The Emperor wears no

241
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,080
clothes because it was really anyone who

242
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,259
looked at this would see that it really

243
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,080
wasn't what they protected to be so

244
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,759
that said

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,639
um

246
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,559
I feel as if a lot of people have these

247
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,480
uh pre-existing Notions about original

248
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,879
Haze and because they haven't had

249
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,980
experience with the variety uh only

250
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,679
hybrids of the variety for the most part

251
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,680
uh they really don't know what it's like

252
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,299
and I I say to people that uh original

253
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,399
Haze and skunk one are like Polar

254
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,199
Opposites uh skunk one is a relatively

255
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,440
true reading super uniform super

256
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,040
consistent uh original hay seeds are

257
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,899
like inbred F God knows what at this

258
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,659
point you know I asked Sam he's like who

259
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,278
knows f11 who knows and how many

260
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,159
generations of times he's brought them

261
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,500
together but he was doing so because he

262
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,778
wanted to maintain the variety within

263
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,458
the variety so that he could come

264
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,259
through it phenotype wise and pick

265
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,899
things to work with

266
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:43,439
um which makes pure sense to me and uh

267
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,740
when I grow them out I found phenotypes

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,540
that go from literally eight nine weeks

269
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:53,459
that are I would say mid uh like leaflet

270
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,099
but back again I've grown a greenhouse

271
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,379
micro fairly big plants I mean I I

272
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,839
posted so no light sleeves that were so

273
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,879
gigantic biggest I've ever seen in all

274
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,680
my years growing uh this last run with

275
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,179
Northern Lights Number Two it was also

276
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,278
the one that morphed into looking like

277
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:10,379
Duck's foot but the more I research it

278
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,360
Duck's foot has a narrower more like

279
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,000
dare I say sativa but I hate to but a

280
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,339
more narrow leaflet um and this one was

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,940
just plain fat is just ridiculous so um

282
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,399
but

283
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,140
the haze itself has a lot of variation

284
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,539
and you get everything from these like

285
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,480
16 week narrow narrow narrow leaflet

286
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:33,539
very few florets on the on the on the

287
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,278
stem to stuff that's pretty beefy uh one

288
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,919
of the females out of the entire

289
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,259
Greenhouse turned purple and it wasn't

290
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,240
because it was cold my Greenhouse has

291
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:46,019
completely environmentally controlled

292
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,120
and I was just like damn and I had Rob

293
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,519
Clark here visiting during the Harvest

294
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,440
and he was down there taking photos and

295
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,019
just enjoying the [ __ ] out of it because

296
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,760
you know this he was he went to the

297
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,100
University of Santa Cruz in the 70s he

298
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,679
was around the he used to trim Haze when

299
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,620
he was in college like he's closer to

300
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,859
this than any of us really and I don't

301
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,139
doubt he had his hands in making the

302
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,500
seeds that I was given because he worked

303
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,600
at the time at you know and he was in

304
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,220
charge of the greenhouses so he knew

305
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,800
exactly what I was growing because I

306
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,800
don't doubt he made the seeds with with

307
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,179
Skunk Man Sam so uh he was just having a

308
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,799
blast and when he saw the purple when he

309
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:27,179
was the one that was like oh this is you

310
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,099
know people used to love this one

311
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,859
because it had like a silvery kind of

312
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,379
purplish to it you see color expressions

313
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,500
in them um start to come out

314
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,000
um I I love it and uh I had Mishka hair

315
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,220
you know who used to be Neville's

316
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,659
girlfriend a little bit and she was

317
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,360
sitting at my desk and we were talking

318
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,620
about the origin of haze and I I sold

319
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,259
her straight up I said it's not with

320
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,259
Neville it's with Sam it's with Santa

321
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,360
Cruz I says come downstairs and touch

322
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,639
these plants they were not in flower at

323
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,980
the time and you tell me what they are

324
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,700
and me and Mishka went downstairs and

325
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,220
she touched the plants and she

326
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,079
immediately smelled it went oh yeah yeah

327
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,480
and I was like right I got these from

328
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:12,479
the same person Neville did

329
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,220
you know is there any surprise because I

330
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,500
guess Scentsy named a variety that has

331
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,079
Haze in it after Michigan in the last

332
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,480
few years so that's what she was

333
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:25,199
wondering about this and she was the one

334
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,600
that showed me uh she gave me a pre-copy

335
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,639
of a book before uh it was released and

336
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
it has the interview at Neville and it's

337
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,700
interesting because in the interview

338
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,278
Neville

339
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,399
isn't listening to himself because in it

340
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:41,278
he says that you couldn't improve A's by

341
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,458
breeding it together that's what Sam

342
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,799
told him so the only way Sam would know

343
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,778
that you can't improve it by breeding it

344
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,120
together is if he did it

345
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:54,120
so when Neville was talking about these

346
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,000
seeds from 1969

347
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,720
the original siege that I have are from

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,179
that 1969 cross that Sam kept isolated

349
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,379
from all his other work and reproduced

350
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:09,419
as that 69 cross the seeds or the plants

351
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:13,078
I believe that's that Neville was given

352
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:15,899
to male plants in 1987. those came from

353
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:18,000
these original Haze seeds from one of

354
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,820
those Generations you get what I'm

355
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,078
saying so the the seeds I got from Sam

356
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:28,139
were also from that IBL preservation and

357
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:31,259
are basically brothers and sisters

358
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,120
cousins sort of of those original seeds

359
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,679
that go all the way back

360
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,440
um and

361
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,299
you know they they kind of are what they

362
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,920
are if that makes sense you know and and

363
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,719
what I find unique about the original

364
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,899
Haze is out of everything in my

365
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,420
collection they are the only seeds that

366
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,980
I have that have no Afghan influence in

367
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:51,539
them

368
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,420
um yeah that's that's a really

369
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:56,519
interesting point to make and you sort

370
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,159
of touch on the broader topic of the

371
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,159
genetics within the strains we discuss

372
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,078
and there's a lot of for a long time I

373
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,719
used to hear people talk about Haze as

374
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,939
though it wasn't until the tie was

375
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,980
crossed into it at the end that it truly

376
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,839
became Haze and then in more recent

377
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,639
discussions with people in the know I

378
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,779
realize that that obviously wasn't quite

379
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,480
correct because a lot of people talk

380
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:22,198
about Haze as like the real Colombian

381
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,360
Rich sort of psychedelic high that those

382
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,639
cultivars bring to it all I guess what

383
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,820
I'm wondering is at what point did you

384
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,339
think it was Haze do you think the

385
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,560
commonly discussed Indian genetics are

386
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,060
actually in there at all and finally

387
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,919
what are your thoughts on the different

388
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,319
phenos you just reference you know the

389
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,939
blue the silver the purple were they

390
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,820
were they real things or was it just

391
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,500
potluck uh according to skunk band Sam

392
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,980
the original hitters was a three-way

393
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,059
Colombian combination uh that was based

394
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,720
around three different there was

395
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,338
controversa which meant red basically uh

396
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,459
and then there was a silver and I think

397
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,699
a blue and uh and I sucked for some

398
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,018
Stone right now

399
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:07,379
tell me the same damn answer every time

400
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:10,078
but uh but at three-way Colombian and um

401
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,740
and every single year what kind of

402
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:17,638
ruined Hayes and by the mid 70s they had

403
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,500
outcrossed that 1969 first hybrid uh so

404
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,899
many times that it really wasn't hazy

405
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,958
anymore uh it had a Mexican crossed with

406
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,698
it it had Thai cross with it every

407
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,159
single year was a different outcross

408
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:33,479
because they were trying to improve it

409
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:35,819
um and you know by 76 77 according this

410
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,879
company and Sam they gave up growing it

411
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,920
because he introduced skunk one which

412
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,379
was two-thirds tropical one-third Afghan

413
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,698
uh Colombian golden Acapulco Gold but it

414
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,338
was coming down late August early

415
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:48,659
September and it changed the game I mean

416
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,120
and you know if you're a commercial

417
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,159
Cropper you gotta wait until November

418
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,360
December to get down what you could be

419
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,000
pulling down at the beginning of

420
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,919
September same location there's no

421
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,778
there's no question so they didn't want

422
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,399
to expose themselves to get busted and

423
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:04,619
they started switching over to this

424
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,199
amazing [ __ ] weed that was some van

425
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:10,259
Sams and they stopped growing Haze and

426
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,179
by the late 70s Hayes was was nothing

427
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,338
but a legend on a lot of levels in the

428
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,679
genetics world but lost

429
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,359
even by the people who originally held

430
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,220
them because they didn't preserve them

431
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,859
like Sam did

432
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,838
yeah wow that's so interesting I had

433
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,099
another question sort of similar but I

434
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:27,838
think you sort of answered already where

435
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,659
I was going to ask you about the photos

436
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,819
we see on your Instagram where it's like

437
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,019
Hayes cross to tie and I guess I was

438
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,538
sort of wondering like is that an extra

439
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,179
tire Cross or sounds like it's the first

440
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:42,000
one I don't have a Thai cross I don't I

441
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:45,120
well wait a minute I have skunks uh

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,700
skunk ears Ty uh he calls it thunk Thai

443
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,259
hey skunk called stunk uh but I'm not

444
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,960
growing that right now I have seeds of

445
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:55,019
it I have grown that in I think I grew

446
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,600
at like 2014 or 2015. I have a lot of

447
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:00,000
seeds of it he he was very generous back

448
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,699
in 2012 and he he sent me home with

449
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,319
enough to play with for a while and for

450
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,660
the first few years I would just grow

451
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,099
some of the seeds and just do fennel

452
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,480
hunts and then save a planet and throw

453
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:11,519
the rest away

454
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,400
um it wasn't really until I started AGC

455
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,500
code that I uh considered IBL in them

456
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
and trying to bring them back to the

457
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,160
community I didn't feel like it was my

458
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,980
variety to do that with especially

459
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,600
really after the story he told me about

460
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,419
uh how he viewed his relationship with

461
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,219
Neville and why Neville didn't have all

462
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,020
the seeds of Hayes and Neville made up

463
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,360
the story it like it kind of made sense

464
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:37,679
and uh so I didn't want to be that guy

465
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,000
and uh and I wasn't and uh so but I

466
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,740
think that trying to get these out to

467
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,599
the world is a good thing I think that

468
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,460
you know trying to you know save these

469
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,058
and spread these around is a good thing

470
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,400
um Sam himself uh did too I mean for I

471
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,740
would say late late 80s early 90s he was

472
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
still selling seeds by the kilo probably

473
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,720
to a lot of the Dutch breeders and uh by

474
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,179
that time uh the green team which was

475
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,120
which was Bernard and positronics which

476
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,798
became positronics he was our Bernard

477
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,639
was clearly

478
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:11,579
you know knocking off remaking f2ing

479
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,580
f3ing f4ing everything that he had ever

480
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,259
got from Sam which was quite a bit you

481
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,259
know what I mean he he got the whole

482
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:22,859
collection it's clear to me that Bernard

483
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:25,259
and the Green Team uh Bernard had Hayes

484
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,779
before Neville did Bernard had Hayes

485
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,179
probably right from 85 onward but had

486
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:32,460
very little interest in it you know what

487
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm saying because it was again did you

488
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,900
know his favorite variety was something

489
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,900
called Citron which I would it was like

490
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,120
a little bit uh it took a little longer

491
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,220
than maybe B-52 which at the time was

492
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,859
like a chronic which was like a a big

493
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,500
bud like a like a super skunk time super

494
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:53,339
Cropper type thing uh wasn't my favorite

495
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,319
but you know Bernard was looking for uh

496
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:56,759
stuff that fit what he was trying to do

497
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,980
which was you know promoting door

498
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,500
cultivation and you know a lot of little

499
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,880
lollipop plants and you know and I love

500
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,240
it I mean the first time I walked into

501
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,340
positronics has and and saw all those

502
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,798
little plants in the perfect little you

503
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:13,798
know square meters and you know I I

504
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,440
immediately thought to myself oh that's

505
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,900
how you're supposed to do it and my life

506
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,940
was never the same I I never grew I

507
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,160
never grew the same after that once I

508
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,240
realized how efficient it was to grow

509
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,400
smaller plants that had less veg time I

510
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,579
was no going back you know what I mean

511
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,860
just so that's also why I got busted

512
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,298
with so many plants I mean there's a

513
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,759
picture of me staying in front of a wall

514
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:40,679
of clones on the back of my book and I

515
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,279
got busted I think with like 4 100

516
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,980
plants or whatever at the time uh it was

517
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:50,279
just because I you know see green it's

518
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,019
the most efficient way to grow and uh

519
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,639
that's why I think that uh these

520
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:55,798
tropical equatorials have come back too

521
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,380
because one of the tips Neville gave me

522
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:00,298
and my friend Tom was don't give it any

523
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,520
pre-grow if you have plans that take

524
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:05,339
over 10 11 weeks to finish flowering

525
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,339
move them straight from rooting into

526
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:10,139
flowering and allow them to grow and

527
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:13,019
flower simultaneously because even

528
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,000
though uh they're in flour they will

529
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,379
um they will grow continually as they're

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,480
flowering and you'll still get plants

531
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
that are almost a meter tall after 11

532
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,798
weeks if not taller even though they

533
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,899
started off you know

534
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,918
you know barely a few centimeters tall

535
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,840
in comparison where they ended up so

536
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,179
it was good advice and I still pass that

537
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,339
along to people to this day because if

538
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,900
you take a bunch of Equatorial Tropicals

539
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:38,759
and put them in when they're you know

540
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,759
just a day or two after rooting and pop

541
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,259
them next to each other you can get

542
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,720
fantastic harvests you know 20 plus

543
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,980
grams per plant you know in a tight

544
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,679
close uh grouping that way exceeds what

545
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,839
you would get from you know six weeks

546
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,519
ago and letting it go up and then having

547
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,798
a bunch of wasted space at the bottom

548
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,519
it's way more efficient

549
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,319
yeah some solid advice there for sure I

550
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,658
guess just to quickly wrap up the haze

551
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,240
part I was wondering there's obviously

552
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,600
no notable Haze cuts that go around but

553
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,460
there are a few uh nl5 hazes that have

554
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,558
got a bit of a reputation I guess I was

555
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,100
wondering if you had tried any of the

556
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,759
notable ones like the A5 the C5 or even

557
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:26,099
like the Cuban black Haze by any chance

558
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,379
uh keeping A's I have uh I think it's

559
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,839
nl5 uh you know when you look at the

560
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,880
dating of it I believe that late 80s

561
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,579
early 90s nl5 was a hugely popular

562
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,799
variety and that a lot of people were

563
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,199
growing at and

564
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,200
um some of the others tend to disappoint

565
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,179
a bit uh I like Cali Mist a lot I think

566
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,500
that uh but you know it was funny I was

567
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,320
having a conversation with Simon once

568
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,119
and he didn't think that the long

569
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,339
flowering female that he used in the

570
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,979
original combination was Haze and I was

571
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:59,480
just like what did you think it was and

572
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,779
he said Colombian and I went well

573
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,839
I think it is you know like but you know

574
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,940
I it just it's interesting how

575
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,099
the names change and people don't really

576
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,298
realize what they have sometimes and

577
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,759
even though they're using it

578
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:16,079
successfully and you know I think Hayes

579
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,058
has been amazing I mean my two favorite

580
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,699
Haze plants when I lived in Amsterdam

581
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,139
was I know five days uh Neville's Hayes

582
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,298
wasn't out yet

583
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,460
um or you just started to to release it

584
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:29,819
actually uh at the tolstrock greenhouse

585
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,919
uh if I remember correctly and and the

586
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,798
Cali missed you know I liked now those

587
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,299
Haze though over nl5 by Hayes nl5 by

588
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,400
Hayes was great but it was more known to

589
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,259
lights when he crossed it when he

590
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,440
crossed the nl5 by his back to that his

591
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:45,839
a I think it it made it spicier made it

592
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,179
more hazy and I liked it better yielded

593
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,879
less and it took I think a little longer

594
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,919
but it was worth the wait and worth the

595
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
loss of yield do you think we'll ever

596
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,659
see Neville's Hayes make a comeback it's

597
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,460
something which is really always popular

598
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,980
among the heads

599
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,819
I have a lot of stuff close

600
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,500
um I

601
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,960
you know it's funny because like I have

602
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,940
the genetics it's like bacon brownies uh

603
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,860
and then it comes to selecting the

604
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,080
proper salt and the proper sugar and the

605
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,939
proper molasses the proper wheat you

606
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:16,918
know to make your your cookie just the

607
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,720
way you remember it and I think that

608
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,640
this is similar and I mean we can't go

609
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,919
back and smell those phenotypes that he

610
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,480
had but for those of us that have been

611
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,759
around the genetics I mean we can test

612
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,819
The Prodigy and see if it reminds us and

613
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,679
you know for me I mean I already have a

614
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:34,019
lot of those hazy combinations most of

615
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,620
the stuff I'm smoking uh would remind

616
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:40,440
you or anybody who wasn't familiar with

617
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:43,859
like oh that this is that Haze because

618
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:48,058
it's overwhelms the uh gassiness of the

619
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:50,699
NL with the spicy uh overtones of the

620
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:52,500
haze you know what I mean so like if you

621
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,538
came over I think you would be in Haze

622
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,000
Heaven over here because I've I've

623
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:58,740
touched it to damage everything

624
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,179
um but now that I'm growing the NL and I

625
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,940
have a lot of stuff that has not been

626
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,340
touched to the to the NL but

627
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,159
you know it's been hard to resist I was

628
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:10,259
doing the room for my head and I I was

629
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,820
in the middle of flowering the um

630
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,079
meaning I was doing a room for my head I

631
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:14,700
was doing a room seedless because I only

632
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,558
use one male at a time at my facility

633
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,860
because I'm I'm not trying to [ __ ]

634
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,359
around and uh and I had the NLT going in

635
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,000
the greenhouse

636
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,379
and I took a branch of it and I brought

637
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,179
it into the room that I was going to do

638
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,220
seedless and shook it over the plants is

639
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,620
because even though I had original Haze

640
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,659
going and I had these skunk Haze crosses

641
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,879
I had going and I had these super glue

642
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,559
uh I crossed with on Hayes and then did

643
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,020
a selection across that selection to

644
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,879
original Haze to try to pump up the haze

645
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,980
again kind of going for that Neville

646
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,200
Haze Vibe if you will

647
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,298
um I liked it but then I just hit it

648
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,580
with the ml2 because now I can't wait

649
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,440
you know I was like frigate instead of

650
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:55,500
getting the sensimili I'll just get to

651
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,320
play with the seeds because the nl2 is

652
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,599
so impressive and I want to see what the

653
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,158
effects are with this male against a lot

654
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,678
of these other genetics that I'm so

655
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,659
familiar with to see how it you know how

656
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,880
it dominates The Prodigy that comes off

657
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:10,799
of it and how it affects it like what

658
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,299
kind of sense I get what kind of body I

659
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,460
get from the buds what kind of like

660
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:16,500
width I get from the leaves and things

661
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,500
like that and I just did a combination

662
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,259
of original Haze as the female crossed

663
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,058
with NO2 as the male in this and it's

664
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:25,619
hanging up right now and it's funny

665
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:27,720
because I keep going down there and I

666
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:30,239
keep I just can't I go downstairs

667
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,339
sometimes just to go to the ace plant to

668
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,079
just smell them because they they you

669
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,839
get an upper from smelling them it's

670
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,639
weird like I get happy just smelling the

671
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,319
[ __ ] thing so

672
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,419
um but it's that unique everything else

673
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,918
I mean I don't know the skunks that are

674
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,380
down there smell sweet the super gal

675
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,240
smell gassy but that haze just I don't

676
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,299
know man calls my name

677
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,319
that's special that's cool to hear I

678
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:53,940
think it's going to be a neat

679
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,298
combination because the genetics are

680
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,980
dissimilar and the we'll see we'll we'll

681
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,839
see how it comes out but it's kind of

682
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,480
close to what Neville was doing back

683
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,000
then with the NL depending on which but

684
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,038
I think he used the nl2 a lot I think NL

685
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,038
did because it was the one that was

686
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:14,038
spectacular and um

687
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,500
and I just did the opposite of what he

688
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,179
did instead of a nl5 female CrossFit

689
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,519
behave male I went with the original

690
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,860
Haze female and called it with a NO2

691
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,319
male uh so we're gonna start seeing how

692
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,119
some of these things pop up and you know

693
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,619
I already like it one of the Super Glue

694
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,119
by on Hayes was on the cover of Girl

695
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:32,639
magazine a lot of the people has grown

696
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:36,178
it love it because it has that Afghan

697
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,400
but it has that spice interesting so I

698
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,220
mean can you give us a little bit of a

699
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,080
rundown on the different smells and

700
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,179
effects from the different airlines you

701
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:48,298
have

702
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,820
um uh the purest indicus heavy the nl2

703
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:54,480
is heavy the nl5 is a little more light

704
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:56,819
uh meaning like when I say light like

705
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,640
uh for more tropical plants I get more

706
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,839
of a like a I don't know like a like a

707
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,640
light High I don't know how to put it

708
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,220
like it's more in your head and you're

709
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,278
just kind of like happy High uh a lot of

710
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,940
the stuff like the NL is more physically

711
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:14,220
relaxing I I my neck pain recedes more

712
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,019
but I can't say that the haze doesn't

713
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,298
make my neck pain go away it's just that

714
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:19,980
I guess so high I forget about it but

715
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:21,960
the NHL feels like it actually looks

716
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,079
like I don't forget about it but I feel

717
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,419
kind of chill you know so

718
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,000
um I I think there's the

719
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,700
you know the NyQuil compared to caffeine

720
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,179
effect I I would consider Haze is more

721
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,480
like in my body acts as a caffeine uh

722
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:43,140
and the NLS the purest Indica is just

723
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,538
very resony and it's when I broke up the

724
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,700
buds it my fingers smell like import

725
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,679
hash like if you've ever been a hamster

726
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,980
and you smoke like Ching Hassan hash and

727
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,500
[ __ ] like that like it it just like it

728
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,259
just had it smells like [ __ ] hash man

729
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,119
it like smells like old glass and I love

730
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,619
it and then the flowers smell kind of

731
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,519
skunky stinky when they were growing

732
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,479
which reminds me of the 80s too because

733
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,519
you know that's

734
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,519
you know that's what it kind of smelled

735
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,038
like and when the when it would cure it

736
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,200
would it would depend on when you you

737
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:18,538
got it so like depending on how fresh

738
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,399
the flowers were gonna depend on how

739
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,679
much of the terpenes they were emitting

740
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,359
at any given time so if you were getting

741
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,500
pot from your friend it was growing in

742
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,199
their closet they probably weren't

743
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,659
waiting that long uh for the dry and the

744
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,159
Cure because we were all so excited and

745
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,360
you were actually getting cannabis it

746
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
was probably two or three weeks from

747
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,259
being cut down a lot of the times and

748
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,240
when you smell it smell it was so

749
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:42,179
overwhelming and so strong

750
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:45,359
um but but now with the legal Market we

751
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:47,220
get Pockets like [ __ ] months old you

752
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,079
know what I mean it's like cured and

753
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,259
dried it wasn't even handled well and

754
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:56,639
they you know like it's unbelievable and

755
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:59,220
it's different so I I just think uh

756
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,799
and not the best at describing the

757
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,500
flavors and tastes and stuff but more of

758
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,898
the highs and the excitement I get from

759
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,398
it but I like the northern lights and I

760
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:10,979
like feeling relaxed but I like the

761
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,199
hazes and I like feeling creative too

762
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,759
yeah look they sound fantastic and I'm

763
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,038
I'm with you I think I'm more of a

764
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,440
highest guy than a Kush guy so to speak

765
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,179
but as a follow-up question to that can

766
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,640
we ever expect to maybe see any

767
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:27,000
feminized work from you or specifically

768
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,799
s ones of any of these lines the NLS or

769
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,640
the purest indicas

770
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:36,298
yeah actually totally uh so the plants

771
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,919
some the plants in my future uh are to

772
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:40,379
start collecting a lot of these clone

773
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,480
only cultivars that are floating around

774
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,220
um you know and as one of them so other

775
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,019
people can experience green crack and

776
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,778
train wreck and other things

777
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,819
um Mel Frank already does that he not

778
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:54,599
only makes us ones he's been breeding

779
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:58,439
with female pollen uh for a long time

780
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:00,298
and he makes Crosses by so uh he'll take

781
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,340
his females that he likes and then he'll

782
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,319
reverse them he will collect the pollen

783
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:05,939
he will stall the pollen and then he

784
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,980
will administer that pollen on another

785
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,980
plant that he likes and he will do

786
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,599
female feminized breeding

787
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,759
so

788
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:16,619
you know but he's I mean this is Mel

789
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,058
Frank I mean I expect him to be a little

790
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,219
ahead of the curve when it comes to what

791
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:23,940
he does first time he he showed me

792
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,579
something it was S1 F1 and S1 F2 and I

793
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,740
went

794
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:29,699
no this isn't how it could be and he

795
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,440
goes well I don't know what else you'd

796
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,240
call it I collected a pollen from one

797
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,740
plant and I brought it to the other and

798
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,298
I was just like

799
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,679
really and I was like and that's why the

800
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:39,359
name's like this he's like well I put

801
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,519
the the plant that I collect the female

802
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,199
plant that I collected the pollen from

803
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,778
as the second name because it would be

804
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,278
the male right it was like right and he

805
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,480
was like and it was the second time I do

806
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,179
it so what do you think I should call it

807
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,240
other than enough too I was like

808
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:55,500
I get it I get it so you know you pop

809
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,359
those seeds you've read those seeds

810
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,798
togethers here you get like it dealing

811
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,058
with them is so much fun I'm the first

812
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,980
person in his whole life that he's

813
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:04,139
allowed to sell the seeds and it's kind

814
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,940
of an honor to say the very least and um

815
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,620
and I learned something from him every

816
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,840
time we talk which is fortunately for

817
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,819
you know quite often but

818
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,439
um he's been releasing us I've had S1

819
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:14,819
seeds of his since I've been selling

820
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,399
seeds because he's had them for a long

821
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:19,798
time and we have the bread uh feminized

822
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,019
bread so we he's still doing that he's

823
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:23,519
making more feminized GDP seeds I

824
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,519
couldn't keep him in stock last time he

825
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,259
gave them to me I'm expecting more soon

826
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,359
um but then what I'm also going to do is

827
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,898
uh the guy that's famous for GDP

828
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:36,658
actually gave the seeds to him back some

829
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:38,819
years back and I know the guy myself his

830
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,919
name's Ken and I'm gonna try to get the

831
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:43,859
cutting that's been floating around of

832
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,360
GDP and then ask when that there's a lot

833
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,519
of plants that are on our Hit List to

834
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,778
kind of collect and ask one because I

835
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,579
think they're great breeding material

836
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,319
and people have this you know deserve a

837
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,699
right to work with them and I don't want

838
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,019
to cross them with something because I

839
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,880
want them to be

840
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,500
as close to what they are and the only

841
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,480
way I can like put them in a seed form

842
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,000
is to ask one of them

843
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,798
um the plants that the seed varieties

844
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,200
that I got from skunk band sand that I

845
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,099
can't reproduce like thunk Thai hey

846
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,720
skunk

847
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,000
um I'm just gonna go through my seeds do

848
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,278
selections pick the best examples and

849
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,740
then S1 those so that people can

850
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,240
experience those as well I asked them if

851
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,319
I could do that and he was totally cool

852
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,038
with it

853
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,200
um because I don't know another way of

854
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:27,298
releasing proper representations of them

855
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,679
except to this woman you know you know

856
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:30,298
what I mean so

857
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,159
um I think that's going to be fun I mean

858
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,259
at this rate with the seed collection I

859
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,179
have and the plans I have I could only

860
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,619
hope to have like three more lifetimes

861
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,360
at least

862
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:41,158
if I'm lucky

863
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,019
watching the grass grow that's all I

864
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,760
want to do

865
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,980
stand around work and watch the news

866
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,259
it's a good life it's a good life so

867
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:52,200
sounds like you got a lot of exciting

868
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:54,058
breeding projects sort of in the mix my

869
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,940
question is which one are you most

870
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:58,798
excited for and are gonna start next not

871
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,278
hasn't started yet but it's gonna be the

872
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:04,639
next one to get the wheels churning

873
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,839
um well I

874
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,780
well breeding projects are going to

875
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:13,139
supersede me uh I I don't feel like I'm

876
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,179
breeding when I'm when I'm f2ing uh you

877
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,659
know through permission uh some of the

878
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,220
original Haze or the skunk or or or the

879
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,539
um northern lights I don't really feel

880
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,459
that's breeding

881
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,599
um I feel it's preserving and I'm and

882
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,338
I'm grateful I'm part of the

883
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,139
preservation of these genetics and I'm

884
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:31,139
asking them onto other people I'm gonna

885
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,639
do that again uh with nl5 because I ran

886
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,320
out of nl5 seeds and everybody's

887
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,300
freaking out over them um then I'm gonna

888
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,119
do it with the purest Indica because

889
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,220
Greg really wants to see more people get

890
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,460
purist indica and experience the

891
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:48,539
medicine and it's the best Afghan I've

892
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:51,599
ever grown in my life and I think people

893
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:54,418
deserve it it's so beautiful it's so

894
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,180
nice it's just like leathery leaves and

895
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:59,579
just crusty crusty buds of flour of

896
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,960
resin and I just I'm in love I'm in love

897
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:02,819
with how it smells I'm in love with how

898
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,858
it smells after it dries

899
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,019
um after that

900
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:11,279
um my goal was actually to spend more

901
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:14,219
time going through uh more hay seats and

902
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,200
selecting more phenotypes of haze and

903
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,598
and spending more time with these

904
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,299
because uh all the seeds that Greg sent

905
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,359
me I've cloned and uh so I have all

906
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,859
those genetics and I want to just spend

907
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,199
more time going through all of the

908
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:30,119
different sister phenotypes and and

909
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,460
really getting to know them for for

910
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,140
their differences and then I really want

911
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,420
to spend more time breeding together

912
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,338
with original Haze because you know I

913
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,039
mean I think the real key to f1s is

914
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:44,159
dissimilar genetics if you really want

915
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,900
to get some fantastic hybridization and

916
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,460
so that's kind of you know I'm trying to

917
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,019
do what everybody else isn't doing which

918
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,280
is breeding together closely related

919
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,280
plants

920
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,320
you know so uh and I have that unique

921
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,640
opportunity to do that and I'm not

922
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,140
trying to be a joke about it I'm trying

923
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,500
to give the opportunity to other people

924
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:03,598
so that they can also

925
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,980
um experience these genetics and I I

926
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,260
think there's a lot of artists in the

927
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,480
world you know I wrote in Neville's

928
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,040
article I saw him as an artist you know

929
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,679
even though we didn't invent red blue

930
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,900
gold he what he created with it was

931
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,338
beautiful and we can appreciate his art

932
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,900
you know but it doesn't mean other

933
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:21,900
people can't come along with the primary

934
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,780
colors and recreate similar combinations

935
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,900
that maybe are even more spectacular

936
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,820
yeah certainly certainly so I'm just

937
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,099
going to change topic for a moment I was

938
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,220
curious to know how was it that you came

939
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,019
about to be the editor of the emperor

940
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:38,578
where's no clothes did you have a close

941
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,460
relationship with Jack before that or

942
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:45,180
was that the start of the relationship

943
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,619
it was 1993 and I'd read his book uh and

944
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,759
I was living in San Diego and political

945
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:50,099
Pacific Beach

946
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,900
and the book really blew me away it

947
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,119
reinforced a lot of the decisions I'd

948
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,220
made for a while I'd have you know

949
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,500
hippie guilt about you being a pothead

950
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:01,078
and you know kept it secret like I was

951
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,838
you know less than someone and not less

952
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,640
than Society you know and uh frowned

953
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,099
upon and when I read his book it was

954
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:11,759
like Liberation and I called the number

955
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,320
on the back it was January of 1994 and

956
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
this girl named summer answered the

957
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,320
phone and started explaining to me that

958
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,140
they were doing an initiative to

959
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,619
legalize marijuana in Kemp and I should

960
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:24,719
come up and help and I was stunned and

961
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,960
uh I wanted to maybe go say hi to him

962
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,059
buy him lunch I don't know like I had

963
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,400
I had had good money at the time so I

964
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,719
could afford to go buy them lunch in L.A

965
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,599
or something and I hope to just say

966
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,039
thank you and when I got there I saw

967
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,619
what they were doing and I was sitting

968
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,358
there one day and uh it was lit

969
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,880
literally the first day I got there and

970
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,759
then Jack walked in the office and he

971
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,180
goes on who the [ __ ] are you

972
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,820
set up who the [ __ ] are you and he was

973
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:57,239
like ah I'm Jack Harris what are you

974
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,440
even wondering and uh and uh he liked it

975
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,838
he said what are you from the East Coast

976
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,338
I said yeah and he said you want to

977
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,739
smoke the best goddamn part you've ever

978
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:06,239
smoked in your life and I had a I had a

979
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,399
cannabis collection at the time and I

980
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,799
had a duffel bag full of different like

981
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,720
eights and quarters maybe 20 to 30 of

982
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,599
them and I said sure

983
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,838
oh the headphones died

984
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,539
uh one minute let me get my phone I have

985
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,099
another set of headphones what's that

986
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:24,960
I followed him in a group of hippies

987
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,338
into the back room and he sat down and

988
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,500
he showed me this really great pot

989
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,078
probably a Hindu Kush grown in Northern

990
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,480
California by a gentleman named Richard

991
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,680
Davis and um through on the traveling

992
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,539
hat museum

993
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,759
and it was great and then I started

994
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,920
pulling out all these different types of

995
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,040
weed that like some of them would stick

996
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,500
to the baggy and [ __ ] and Jack is a real

997
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:48,119
pothead he wanted to smoke all that [ __ ]

998
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,119
he wasn't gonna let me out of his sight

999
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,519
till he smoked all my weed and we sat

1000
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,740
there getting high and um and then he

1001
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,000
brought me over to his place uh like

1002
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,098
because because he was like you're not

1003
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,719
driving back to San Diego I said no he

1004
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,460
said don't go get a hotel you can crash

1005
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,459
at my house I have a couch and I said

1006
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,380
okay so we went to his place and uh he

1007
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,139
whipped out the Bible bro and starts

1008
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,180
teaching me about the etymology of

1009
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,739
letters and words and [ __ ] because this

1010
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:17,159
is what he was tripping on at the time

1011
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:20,399
and we sat up all night long literally

1012
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,659
reading the Bible and and and him

1013
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,240
teaching me all the different

1014
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:26,759
interpretations of what he thought it

1015
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,239
really meant and uh really deep [ __ ] and

1016
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,920
uh that morning we went and got food it

1017
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:36,118
was the last time in my life I ate

1018
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,338
chicken and um and we were inseparable

1019
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,640
after that that day we became best

1020
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:43,139
friends and uh we started just I started

1021
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:45,539
working on the initiative I became the

1022
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:49,440
San Diego coordinator and uh I worked

1023
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:52,440
with him 94 uh into 95. um he's the one

1024
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,720
that introduced me to Dennis prone and

1025
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,940
Browning Mary and Chris Conrad Mickey

1026
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,239
Norris and they're the ones that you

1027
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,380
know helped uh put together Ben dronkers

1028
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,419
um

1029
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,980
Museum in Amsterdam

1030
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,440
um he's going to introduced me to Ben

1031
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,539
and the whole Holland scene and high

1032
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,300
times and you know traveling around with

1033
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:15,358
Jack was like you know having backstage

1034
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,880
passed to everything we did and and I

1035
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,880
made a lot of friends and um I was

1036
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,140
really inspired by everybody I met and

1037
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,260
that's why I started the San Diego

1038
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:26,639
Compassion Club in 1995 because you know

1039
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,920
while we were meeting all these people

1040
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,598
it was just really heavy duty to meet

1041
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,960
people that would legitimately really

1042
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,700
sick and not be able to give them some

1043
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,460
weed I would always give them whatever I

1044
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:39,960
had I just couldn't say no I mean when I

1045
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,820
was a little kid my mother didn't charge

1046
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,760
me before the medicine I needed you know

1047
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,980
she just gave me the thought and uh I

1048
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,900
just can't imagine

1049
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:52,079
denying somebody

1050
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:55,079
something that can alleviate their their

1051
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,339
their ills if you have it just I don't

1052
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,260
know maybe it comes from being a little

1053
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:00,539
kid being sick all the time but I have a

1054
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,099
lot of empathy for people so uh when I

1055
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,619
started the San Diego Compassion Club we

1056
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:07,740
did not sell marijuana we redistributed

1057
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,440
donated cannabis uh to people that were

1058
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,000
sick you know and um we made Edibles and

1059
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,338
gave them away and

1060
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,219
you know everything we could do to to

1061
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:18,539
you know I don't know it's just when

1062
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:20,399
when you're on the front lines of the

1063
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:22,259
activism you end up meeting people that

1064
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,420
have cancer and that have AIDS and they

1065
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,859
have these different conditions and I

1066
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,480
don't know how you feel inclined to help

1067
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,799
and uh so I started the San Diego

1068
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,119
Compassion Club

1069
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,880
in April March April of 1995 and I got

1070
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,720
busted shortly thereafter and

1071
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,480
um

1072
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,459
you know so it's been a struggle the

1073
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,679
whole way through I ended up getting

1074
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,199
busted in Ohio with 30 pounds of

1075
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,779
cannabis heading to Rhode Island because

1076
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,059
I was gonna start another one I wanted

1077
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,180
to do one in my hometown

1078
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:57,539
um and and so I got busted in Ohio along

1079
00:41:54,179 --> 00:42:00,059
the way but because I had uh and this is

1080
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:02,699
a Twist uh when in 1994 when I was in

1081
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,980
Holland I got a doctor's uh prescription

1082
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:09,598
for medical cannabis from Rotterdam

1083
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,639
physician named drusel and he saw my

1084
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,338
spinal fusion and and felt like my

1085
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,900
medical use canvas was quite legit so he

1086
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:19,320
wrote me an actual prescription for 10

1087
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,838
grams a day and I didn't believe that it

1088
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,059
was legitimate until I went home and did

1089
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,799
some studying at the University of

1090
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,480
California they have a law library

1091
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,240
that's really good and I was able to

1092
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,539
look up things like this the uh

1093
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,399
a single 3D Geneva Convention the

1094
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:37,858
psychotropic substances I was able to

1095
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,200
look up Customs laws believe it or not

1096
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:42,900
they did not prohibit the importation of

1097
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,939
medical cannabis because if you look up

1098
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,519
the way that internationally cannabis

1099
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:51,858
was handled it fell under the Opium

1100
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:55,079
rules in the um the

1101
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:57,779
first treaty and because of that if you

1102
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,980
had opium prescribed legally by a

1103
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,680
country you could bring it to another

1104
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,838
country under the prescription rules so

1105
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,118
it was really unique and cannabis fell

1106
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,920
on to this but nobody was doing it

1107
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,260
um so I was one of the first people that

1108
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,720
actually challenged it uh the laws that

1109
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,780
is it and went back to Holland and

1110
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:18,059
brought back medical cannabis I um

1111
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,200
I'll be musica is a woman that gets

1112
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:21,000
medical marijuana from the federal

1113
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,219
government she's got glaucoma she's an

1114
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,960
old activist she's in her 80s now she

1115
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:25,919
does no longer gets cannabis from the

1116
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,019
government because they're given her

1117
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,119
swag but

1118
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,800
um she was one of my first friends as an

1119
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,200
as an activist and it's a real big

1120
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,318
inspiration and

1121
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:39,419
um LV would would get in trouble with

1122
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:41,039
cops but she'd have her prescription and

1123
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,960
they would not know what to do with this

1124
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,759
crazy old lady you know she was crazy in

1125
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,559
a good way but she was very boisterous

1126
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,480
and loud and wouldn't give up and get in

1127
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,578
her face and they just wanted to get

1128
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,338
away from her and I saw the prescription

1129
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:55,680
as a real important thing so what

1130
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:57,299
happened is I came back from the

1131
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,639
Netherlands with no prescription well

1132
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,200
with the prescription but with no pot

1133
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,239
um and then I was driving up from San

1134
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,739
Diego to L.A and there's a checkpoint uh

1135
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,679
it's supposed to be for immigration they

1136
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:09,659
say but it's really not but so they they

1137
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,519
they would it's at Santa no Fray it's

1138
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:13,500

00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,480
pan Camp Pendleton

1140
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,420
um and it's like this random checkpoint

1142
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,680

1143
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:25,680
and I had pot on me and I had my

1144
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:28,318
prescription and I demanded to keep my

1145
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,799
pot or arrest me and they didn't know

1146
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,659

1147
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,280
this human moment and says listen man I

1148

1149
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,780

1152
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,239

1153
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,880

1154
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,199
your weed and I was like okay I know I

1155
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,539
was like leave me what's in the backpack

1156
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:54,059
and take what's in the bigger bag it's

1157
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:55,980
bigger anyway and because I had I hate

1158
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,019
to say it I had kind bud and then I had

1159
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,579
Mexican import wheat I used to give away

1160
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:02,400
the Mexican import weed and share the

1161
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,380
kind of Bud with Jack so he did it and

1162
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,059
uh I went up to Jackson I was just like

1163
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,519
dude he didn't know what to do with this

1164
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:10,019
[ __ ] piece of paper and me and LV

1165
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,960
with Elvie was there at the time and we

1166
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:15,119
were all like this could be huge so then

1167
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,440
uh LV and I and Richard Davis the guy

1168
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,818
that threw that pot went up to the

1169
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,900
Sacramento law library and did all the

1170
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:20,759
study and we could we came to a

1171
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,900
conclusion that there's a lot of

1172
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,560
legitimacy to an international

1173
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,300
prescription uh so then LV went back

1174
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,639
home to Florida and she used to

1175
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,060
routinely debate the DEA crazy as it

1176
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:34,618
sounds but um she invited me and Florida

1177
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,299
normal which stood for the National

1178
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:39,119
Organization to reform marijuana laws

1179
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,760
invited me out to go debate the DEA with

1180
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,079
LV I have this on video and I went out

1181
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,359
there and I debated the southeast

1182
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,220
quadrant leader and I basically asked

1183
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,539
him will you asked me if I go to the

1184
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:51,539
Netherlands and pick up my prescription

1185
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:54,000
to fly back and he said no and I said

1186
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:55,739
really okay and I said it was like 300

1187
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,480
people there I said you're all my

1188
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:59,219
witness I will fly to the Netherlands

1189
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,659
tomorrow I will pick up my prescription

1190
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,358
I'll fly back and we see if I get

1191
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:06,779
arrested and he looked at me like if

1192
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:09,659
looks could kill kid I would zap you

1193
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,040
right now and I went back to Ellie's

1194
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,980
place I called

1195
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:17,159
uh at the time Martin Airlines which was

1196
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,800
owned by KLM is Dutch owned and uh they

1197
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,118
allowed smoking on planes and when I

1198
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,680
called they said would you like smoking

1199
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,180
or non-smoking I said you can smoke on

1200
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,578
an airplane I said yeah International

1201
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:28,019
flight's over nine and a half hours and

1202
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,300
I said well I have a prescription from

1203
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,858
my Dutch physician from medical cannabis

1204
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,380
and I'm supposed to smoke it about every

1205
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:36,239
two hours would that be acceptable and

1206
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,680
she said are you willing to provide a

1207
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,559
copy of your prescription to the

1208
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,539
stewardess I said oh yeah and she said

1209
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,940
then I don't think it's a problem at all

1210
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:48,059
so but you have to sit in a smoking

1211
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,460
section so I literally smoked weed from

1212
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,318
Florida to the Netherlands in the

1213
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,240
smoking section legally after giving

1214
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,579
them my prescription it was [ __ ]

1215
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,739
great and uh I felt like Freedom was

1216
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:01,140
happening and I flew back and they

1217
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:02,818
didn't arrest me I declared it

1218
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:05,879
um they freaked out a little bit they

1219
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:07,440
wanted me to sign this for him that said

1220
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,220
hmm

1221
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,838
that I uh that I failed to declare a

1222
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:15,598
controlled substance and I said no no no

1223
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:17,400
I want the form that says I declared the

1224
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,318
controlled substance and you're taking

1225
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,358
away my prescribed medicine I'll sign

1226
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:23,940
that form but I don't think you have it

1227
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,679
and they freaked out and they let me

1228
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,659
walk out they didn't even search my

1229
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,000
other bag they would just like go away

1230
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:32,159
and the guy actually said good luck to

1231
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,838
you and secondary it was amazing he

1232
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,098
walked me out the double doors and I

1233
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:36,960
realized wow there's a lot of power to

1234
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:39,180
this so that's when I came back home and

1235
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,818
I went right back up to Dennis and and

1236
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:45,118
really Dr Todd mccarria who was one of

1237
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:47,039
the OG doctors that wrote the the hemp

1238
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,780
drug commission report and was really

1239
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,659
one of him and Lester grinspoon first

1240
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,440
real First physicians on this in America

1241
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:57,480
and um he saw it too so he prescribed me

1242
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,720
he gave me a recommendation for cannabis

1243
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,460
as well and then I got busted and uh

1244
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,318
it's interesting because as soon as Dr

1245
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,338
Todd mccarria gave me a prescription he

1246
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,079
started giving a lot of people

1247
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:08,699
prescriptions like but they weren't they

1248
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,920
were recommendations or they were

1249
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:12,899
letters of condition because at the time

1250
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,460
all that Dennis required wasn't a

1251
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,700
prescription wasn't a recommendation

1252
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:20,818
until 1996 it was just a a letter of

1253
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:23,098
your condition that was it you know

1254
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:24,539
um but that's kind of like I don't know

1255
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,160
it's a little much you know you don't

1256
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:27,659
want to go to Silver hey I got AIDS hey

1257
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,759
I got cancer it's none of their business

1258
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:31,980
you know so it's a little invasive

1259
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,060
um but Dr mccarria was one of my good

1260
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,039
friends and he started writing me

1261
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,199
prescriptions and for a little while in

1262
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,599
California at the very beginning of 1995

1263
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:42,000
I was the only person that I knew that

1264
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,220
had a doctor's note in California that

1265
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,639
was using it to try to validate their

1266
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:49,679
their their controlled carry of cannabis

1267
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,759
LV did have a prescription but she was

1268
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,699
getting her [ __ ] from the federal

1269
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,079
government I was not I was I was just

1270
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:56,759
trying to assert that my doctor would

1271
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,880
back it up and then what happened is I

1272
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,319
got busted in Ohio and the public

1273
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,099
defender was more like a public

1274
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:07,259
Pretender and I got flustered and the

1275
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,760
the judge saw that and he asked me if I

1276
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,400
had something to say so I stood up while

1277
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,960
I was still Chained and explained that I

1278
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,818
was a medical cannabis patient and then

1279
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,960
I had an international prescription and

1280
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,400
that they should look at this on the

1281
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,559
merits of the law and not on their

1282
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,519
opinions you know and base it all on

1283
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:25,440
fact and he liked it and he accepted the

1284
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,500
the single treaty Geneva Convention he

1285
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,079
accepted the the

1286
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:33,599
Customs laws he accepted the the second

1287
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,818
79 psychotropic substances because it

1288
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,079
also you come to the realization that

1289
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:39,239
they were not trying to prohibit the

1290
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:41,640
medical usefulness of cannabis or opium

1291
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:44,098
they were trying to prohibit the

1292
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:47,219
potential narcotic nuisance of it so

1293
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:49,318
they really never intended to uh inhibit

1294
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:51,239
medical use per se and they couldn't

1295
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:52,920
have if they wanted to because everybody

1296
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,679
would have met what the [ __ ] is that you

1297
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,400
know but but realistically that's how it

1298
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:01,318
stood so the judge in Ohio said if I

1299
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,480
could get one American doctor to

1300
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:05,699
validate my judge positions prescription

1301
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,358
he'd let me use cannabis while I was

1302
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:11,519
incarcerated and I went home and called

1303
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,039
my good friend who's a lawyer in Ohio

1304
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,679
and he called Dr Todd mccurria Dr John

1305
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,539
Mogan who wrote marijuana Miss marijuana

1306
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,559
facts and he called Dr Lester grinsman

1307
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:21,358
development I want to be considered and

1308
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,578
everyone medicine and all three of them

1309
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,719
wrote me notes that at night and said

1310
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,220
that they had personal you know

1311
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,719
knowledge of me and they've met me and

1312
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:30,358
that they were friends with me and that

1313
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,799
they all backed it up Dr John Morgan who

1314
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:34,559
was a professor at the City University

1315
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:37,019
of New York actually called the FDA and

1316
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,940
said question If a person an American

1317
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:40,980
goes to Europe and picks up a schedule

1318
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,780
and substance under prescription can

1319
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,420
they bring it back they said yeah three

1320
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,220
months Supply he said interesting what

1321
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,599
if it's cannabis they said well I don't

1322
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:50,699
see why not but what country is

1323
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:53,039
prescribing cannabis he said the

1324
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,779
Netherlands and John told me later he

1325
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,400
said it was funny because the guy

1326
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,920
laughed and he said I guess he found the

1327
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,960
hole in the dike and they laughed on it

1328
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,639
and he wrote that in the letter not the

1329
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,740
part about the the hole in the dark but

1330
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,960
that he contacted the FDA and they

1331
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:07,979
assured him that the importation of a

1332
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,539
schedule one substance under

1333
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,539
prescription from a foreign country for

1334
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:14,338
30 days prize most absolutely legal and

1335
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:16,739
the judge in Ohio didn't know what to do

1336
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:19,799
so it's been released me and it was

1337
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:22,199
amazing because the AP Associated Press

1338
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,300
sat in on this and when the judge didn't

1339
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:26,460
give me the pot she released the story

1340
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,339
and the front page of the newspaper said

1341
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,099
inmate smoke pot at ccno and then the

1342
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:33,420
USA Today picked it up and made this

1343
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,579
great editorial about why medical

1344
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,200
cannabis should be legal they started

1345
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:39,000
off with Todd McCormick left his home to

1346
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,439
help seriously ill people the only

1347
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,719
problem is to help he intended to

1348
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,280
deliver is illegal and then they ended

1349
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,500
it by saying sick people deserve help

1350
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,480
not a ticket to jail it was [ __ ]

1351
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,000
great and then after that the New York

1352
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,159
Times picked up the story and the truck

1353
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,159
in Ohio just dismissed the case was like

1354
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:57,899
go away and when they released me they

1355
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,578
told me you have to leave the state it's

1356
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,280
really quite funny and then I was like

1357
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,359
what about my pot and he goes I knew

1358
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,220
you're going to say that it was my

1359
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:06,838
public Pretender he goes I don't have to

1360
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,818
handle that for you that's a civil

1361
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:10,199
matter and I only do criminal work so

1362
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,380
you're on your own with that you can go

1363
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:16,679
sue the city and I was just like

1364
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,318
hmm and um so I left and then High Times

1365
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,299
flew me over because then I basically

1366
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:24,539
showed 60 minutes which is a pretty big

1367
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,859
news station uh around Amsterdam and

1368
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:28,199
brought him to my doctor and everything

1369
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:30,598
and had like the more serious side of

1370
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,980
the ha of the High Times event and they

1371
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,900
were so impressed that they actually

1372
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,699
didn't add any of that to the story

1373
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,960
because they didn't want to discredit

1374
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:38,519
what I was doing because they really

1375
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,420
thought it was valid it was really quite

1376
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:41,519
cool

1377
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,480
um so I'm only in a clip of it uh which

1378
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,818
is funny

1379
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,318
um but and I spent days with them

1380
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:47,818
um High Times literally flew me out

1381
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,719
there so I could spend time with Molly

1382
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:53,579
Schaefer uh so but while I was there

1383
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,439
um the judge was deciding on whether or

1384
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,059
not he gave me permission to go back the

1385
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,920
judge released my passport let me fly

1386
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:00,180
back to the Netherlands uh he was

1387
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,260
deciding if he was going to let me

1388
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:03,118
basically

1389
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,460
um if he's gonna prosecute me or not and

1390
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,280
uh so I while I was in Holland ended up

1391
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,039
getting a job for High Life magazine and

1392
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,140
became their first uh English editor of

1393
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,079
their English edition of high life which

1394
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:18,118
was really an honor and really cool so I

1395
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,859
put out an issue with them

1396
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,079
um but I hated the winter and I hated

1397
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:23,578
the cold and I hated the rain and all

1398
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,980
the hash and Holland couldn't make me

1399
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:28,400
want to stay so that's why after a year

1400
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:32,280
I ended up moving back to California

1401
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,760
mainly chasing the summer and um

1402
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,619
it was quite an experience but that but

1403
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,059
then I went to LA and had the most crazy

1404
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:41,640
experience because I met a

1405
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:44,519
multi-millionaire publisher who had

1406
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,078
actually contracted AIDS in cancer and

1407
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,838
he was working on a book about medical

1408
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,200
cannabis and he titled it a question of

1409
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:54,000
compassion and ironically I named my

1410
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,460
place the San Diego Cannabis Compassion

1411
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,219
Club and in the media I always used to

1412
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,079
say that it was a it was not a question

1413
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:02,639
of capitalism it was more a question of

1414
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,900
compassion you know are you going to let

1415
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,900
somebody suffer if you can help them

1416
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,539
that seems rather you know mean and he

1417
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,039
liked that and when I met him and I was

1418
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,480
in his office and I said well the

1419
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,199
question of compassion where did you get

1420
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,039
that

1421
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:18,719
uh title he said oh I stole it and I

1422
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,639
said really and he goes yeah come here

1423
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,259
and he shows me this big computer and he

1424
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,058
goes yeah look it up and he looks up the

1425
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,000
newspaper article he goes see you San

1426
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:29,700
Diego Union Tribune somebody named

1427
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,980
Todd McCormick and he was like kid

1428
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,899
you're supposed to be here right now and

1429
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:36,240
it was really funny and uh and it was

1430
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,818
like we just had this meeting and he was

1431
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,558
just he he wanted me to write a book he

1432
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:43,619
wanted me to make a grow video and he

1433
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,960
wanted me to go around the country going

1434
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:48,059
to like lectures and teaching people how

1435
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,119
to grow their own medicine so he got the

1436
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:52,920
website growmedicine.com and and that

1437
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,079
was what the whole concept was going to

1438
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,599
be gave me a quarter million dollars and

1439
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:01,440
I went and looked for a place to live

1440
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,119
and that's how I happened to trip into

1441
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,300
the Bel Air mansion that looked like a

1442
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,818
castle and just we had passed prop 60

1443
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,640
props 215

1444
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:14,519
and I was naive and thought it mattered

1445
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:15,960
and I didn't understand federalism as

1446
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,239
well at the time and I didn't understand

1447
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,039
that it did not create a positive

1448
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,139
conflict between the feds in the state

1449
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,058
of California so I got some

1450
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:26,400
misinformation from a good attorney that

1451
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:28,200
if I didn't sell pot I really couldn't

1452
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,900
be prosecuted

1453
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,578
um so I didn't sell pot but then I was

1454
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,500
prosecuted because even though they

1455
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,839
didn't have me for actually selling pot

1456
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,539
they charged me with intent to

1457
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:41,519
distribute

1458
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:43,800
so they got into my head and they knew

1459
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,780
that overwriting books and putting out

1460
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,760
movies and traveling around as a

1461
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,519
lecturer that I really wanted to just

1462
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,819
sell pot so that was the basis they

1463
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,679
prosecuted me on and um it was crazy

1464
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:59,818
initially they held me on a million

1465
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:02,578
dollar bail for over 4 000 plants and um

1466
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:05,699
my friends at the time uh was Woody

1467
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:08,700
Harrelson the the actor and Larry Flynt

1468
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:12,539
the publisher and they arrested me at 7

1469
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:15,199
pm and by 6 a.m I had I had Larry's

1470
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:17,159
Attorneys at the police station

1471
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,618
introducing themselves as my new

1472
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:22,019
attorneys and trying to help me get out

1473
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,200
of the place and um

1474
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:26,639
and Woody posted my bond in cash it was

1475
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:30,299
lowered to half a million dollars and

1476
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:32,578
Woody posted it in cash and uh which was

1477
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,960
pretty incredible I you know never would

1478
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:35,460
have expected to have that kind of

1479
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,220
support and uh

1480
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,699
and went on to fight them for years I

1481
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:44,519
fought them 97 98 99

1482
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:46,439
and uh they kind of railroaded me they

1483
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,780
took away my medical necessity defense

1484
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,220
they said I couldn't raise uh couldn't

1485
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,859
say the word medical before the word

1486
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,959
marijuana they redacted my book how to

1487
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:57,719
grow medical marijuana

1488
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:01,639
um it was really just like they just

1489
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:05,159
the truth didn't matter and um

1490
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:06,838
basically they gave me the they faced a

1491
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,078
10-year mandatory minimum if I go to

1492
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:13,558
trial and I was going to lose or I could

1493
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,359
do a five-year sentence and retain my

1494
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,160
appeal rights and at the time I was

1495
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:18,719
naive and I still believe that appeal

1496
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,239
could win

1497
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:24,058
um or they wanted me to release my

1498
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:26,759
appeal rights plead guilty and go in and

1499
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:29,339
plead to the judge for [ __ ] you know

1500
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,460
to be easy on me and it's just not me

1501
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:34,139
man and I I wasn't gonna go grovel I

1502
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,720
wasn't going to denounce cannabis I

1503
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:38,879
wasn't gonna debrief I wasn't I just

1504
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,558
wasn't going to play their game so I

1505
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,119
accepted the five-year sentence with the

1506
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,099
hopes that I could appeal the sentence

1507
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,500
did and I lost

1508
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:49,559
um and then while I was traveling to the

1509
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:51,480
airport in December of 99 I got a

1510
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,119
traffic ticket and they used the traffic

1511
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:57,780
ticket to revoke my half million dollar

1512
00:57:54,119 --> 00:58:00,720
Bond and uh pulled me back into jail

1513
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,339
and uh I started my five-year prison

1514
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,618
sentence because really they just wanted

1515
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:07,679
a pound of Flesh they didn't care how

1516
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:11,099
they got it if that makes sense and um I

1517
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:13,618
self-surrendered on January 3rd 2000 and

1518
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:15,900
started doing five years it sucked and

1519
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:17,519
then after a year and a half they sent

1520
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,099
my lawyer in to ask me if I would

1521
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,019
debrief it means cooperate and I said

1522
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:24,480
[ __ ] no and I sat there for another

1523
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:26,099
three and a half years because if you

1524
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,619
don't cooperate

1525
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:32,338
you do time which really boils down to

1526
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:35,280
it that simple so I just ate [ __ ] and

1527
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:37,440
you know sat in prison but I'm glad I

1528
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,780
did I wouldn't have had been able to

1529
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,420
live myself if I hadn't so

1530
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,460
you know I mean it was

1531
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,519
it was difficult

1532
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:49,500
but I'm grateful at how it all worked

1533
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,880
out you know like there's a line in A

1534
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,980
Grateful Dead song where they sang

1535
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,420
sometimes you get Shone the light and

1536
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,420
the greatest

1537
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:00,358
and then sometimes you get shown the

1538
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,000
light in the strangest of places if you

1539
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:04,739
look at it right and that's exactly how

1540
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,079
I felt like even though I was being

1541
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:09,118
prosecuted I had a lot of support and

1542
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:11,280
love from my friends they were there

1543
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,500
when I got out and

1544
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,819
you know you never want to [ __ ] up and

1545
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,798
and find out you don't have friends

1546
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:18,779
there for you but to have something

1547
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,880
happen and find out you're surrounded by

1548
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,660
people that care about you is really a

1549
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,519
beautiful experience and um and I'm so

1550
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:28,558
grateful for it for that element of it

1551
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:31,380
to this day as weird as it may sound

1552
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,720
I've always felt like cancer was

1553
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,700
a beautiful beneficial experience that I

1554
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:38,338
had a hard time appreciating while I was

1555
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:40,259
going through it but I'm grateful that I

1556
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:42,719
went through it you know because I think

1557
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,339
it made me the person I am today and I'm

1558
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,679
proud of myself so

1559
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:49,318
but you know would you want to see a

1560
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:51,719
little kid have cancer never mind over

1561
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:54,298
and over and over again [ __ ] no you know

1562
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:55,739
but if somebody had a magic wand and

1563
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:57,838
said they could wave it over my head and

1564
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:59,939
take away my cancer experience I would

1565
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:03,659
break the wand

1566
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:06,838
yeah wow what a what a beautiful life

1567
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:09,420
story and the way you've gone on to

1568
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:13,019
accept it or just uh almost

1569
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:16,619
inspirational I guess after you got out

1570
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:18,838
at what point did the idea of AG seed

1571
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:20,880
code cross your mind was there a

1572
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:22,920
specific moment where you thought God I

1573
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,079
gotta do something with this when did it

1574
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,260
all start

1575
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,960
my intention when I came home in the 90s

1576
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,339
was to start a seed company because I

1577
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,099
had been collecting genetics in

1578
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:36,838
Amsterdam and I had been collecting

1579
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:38,160
genetics from California for years and I

1580
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:40,318
had a lot of great connections in

1581
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,578
California for genetics so when I came

1582
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,440
home

1583
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:46,260
um that was part of what I was doing was

1584
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,420
was growing out varieties and and

1585
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,980
starting breeding and making seeds I was

1586
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,720
trying to convince my publisher that I

1587
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,900
needed at the time like a quarter

1588
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:57,659
million dollar gcms and a technician to

1589
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,700
run it because I wasn't educated and how

1590
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:01,379
to run it but I needed the output I

1591
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:03,358
needed the data that would come out of

1592
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:06,539
it as I was working because I needed

1593
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,279
continual monitoring of my genetics uh

1594
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:10,259
because I saw them as little

1595
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,540
Laboratories and I wanted to look into

1596
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,700
the laboratory window and see what the

1597
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:16,739
chemistry was that the lab technician

1598
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:19,078
was making on that day because I feel

1599
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:21,419
that the carbolic acid profiles build up

1600
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:23,760
and break down over the course of the

1601
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,798
flower and instead of just taking it at

1602
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,079
one point and looking at what and Peak

1603
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:30,539
and saying there it is I didn't I wanted

1604
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,039
to test daily if I could afford it

1605
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:34,619
um and looked at it all the way past

1606
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,838
Pete to you know Rejuvenation and and

1607
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:38,880
just take an honest look at the way that

1608
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:40,920
at the time the Terrapins were not part

1609
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,500
of the conversation but just the way the

1610
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:47,639
carbolic acids built up and broke down

1611
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:49,798
um I I I I came home

1612
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,779
when I was working in Amsterdam and I

1613
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:53,818
had the job I became good friends with

1614
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:55,798
Robert Clark who was a historian we all

1615
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:58,259
know and he was working on hashish at

1616
01:01:55,798 --> 01:02:02,039
the time and he schooled me on so much

1617
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:05,400
so I came home a student of Rob's and I

1618
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:08,279
was very enthusiastic I I had first

1619
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,559
tried CBD in Amsterdam when he gave me

1620
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,780
some cannabis that was CBD and had no

1621
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,880
THC because he wanted to see if it

1622
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,160
helped my neck pain because he felt like

1623
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,440
my medical condition was obviously

1624
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:21,598
legitimate and he just wanted my

1625
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,039
feedback so the first time I ever used

1626
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,700
it was

1627
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:28,558
from Rob and uh he taught me so much

1628
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:30,779
about the complexity of the cannabinoids

1629
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,339
the profiles the resin glands he was

1630
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,339
working on hash Asian if you drive

1631
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:39,960
hashish it's just such a [ __ ] awesome

1632
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:42,539
book and um and I I was right there so I

1633
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:45,599
hadn't the professor as my drinking

1634
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:47,519
buddy almost nightly for quite a long

1635
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,019
time while I lived in Amsterdam I can't

1636
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,539
count the amount of nights that we spent

1637
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:53,460
together and between spending time with

1638
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:54,779
him and old dad because he wanted to

1639
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,199
spend time with all that Holloway

1640
01:02:54,780 --> 01:03:00,119
because Ed had come to Holland before

1641
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:02,939
Rob did and Ed was already legendary

1642
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:04,500
when he left and you know he was one of

1643
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,940
the old-timers there wasn't many guys

1644
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,980
like Greg that were actually growing

1645
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:12,240
cannabis in the 60s that are still

1646
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:14,219
around and had turned 80 in 1996 so he

1647
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:16,318
was [ __ ] old and he was a really

1648
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:19,379
smart guy dude he was

1649
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:21,239
he was on the team of Engineers that

1650
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,000
broke the speed of sound out at Edwards

1651
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:26,759
Air Force Base in the late 50s and he

1652
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,280
took an early retirement from

1653
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,920
um either General Dynamics or one of

1654
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,140
these big companies and when it in the

1655
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,380
early 60s his kids were coming back from

1656
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:39,598
the First tours of Vietnam and his wife

1657
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,579
he said was drinking and she had what he

1658
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,559
called the empty nest syndrome because

1659
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:46,740
their kids were gone at college and now

1660
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:48,298
at War and he when his kids came home

1661
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:51,118
they brought him some Vietnamese and

1662
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:53,880
Cambodian cannabis and Ed wasn't a drink

1663
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:56,099
or any [ __ ] loved the weed and he

1664
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,539
told me that after a few years he

1665
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,599
couldn't stand his wife's drinking

1666
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:02,719
anymore and he left her everything but a

1667
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:07,079
couple of his favorite airplanes because

1668
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:09,959
he owned his own airplanes and

1669
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:12,480
um he started flying around going to

1670
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,699
military bases in places where cannabis

1671
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,440
was indigenous and he could land and

1672
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:17,879
just say hey I'm doing research and they

1673
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,059
didn't question him because he had

1674
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,500
clearance from his job that he still

1675
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:24,839
kind of worked for it because he was an

1676
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,539
engineer and he collected cannabis

1677
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:31,139
genetics through the 60s until the 70s

1678
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:34,019
and old Ed then met Bernard Bruning when

1679
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:36,058
Bernard started the Mellow Yellow and Ed

1680
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:37,980
was credited with teaching Bernard and

1681
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:40,500
all these young hippies at the time how

1682
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,000
to grow seedless cannabis and how he

1683
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,280
helped them improve the quality of

1684
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,500
cannabis they grew and at the time they

1685
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,079
called him old Ed because he was already

1686
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,539
in his 40s and 50s when they were still

1687
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:55,260
in their early 20s and when I met him he

1688
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:57,420
was 79 turned 80 in 96 when I was with

1689
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,040
him and then when I left and came back

1690
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:02,039
to California we had a very good

1691
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,619
friendship he left and he went to my

1692
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:08,099
house in Bel Air and he went home to his

1693
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:10,260
family and got a cold so he didn't come

1694
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:12,298
back to the mansion right away and I got

1695
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,099
raided and he fortunately wasn't there

1696
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:16,920
when I got raided

1697
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:19,140
um but we still were friends even after

1698
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,760
that he was that he didn't come back and

1699
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:22,920
live with me while I was prosecuted of

1700
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,200
course but I did pick him up and he did

1701
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,480
stay with me when I was in uh various

1702
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:30,298
places in LA because one of his

1703
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,798
daughters lives out outside of La so I

1704
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:34,019
go pick him up and hang out with the old

1705
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:36,059
man I absolutely adored him I would I

1706
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:38,460
would squeeze cannabis and hold it to

1707
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:41,480
his nose and he'd give me countries of

1708
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:45,480
origin not names it was [ __ ] awesome

1709
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,858
I love I loved spending time I started

1710
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:50,699
martial arts when I was 12 and I've

1711
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:54,000
always appreciated uh our elders and I

1712
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:58,199
see guys like skunk man Sam and and Greg

1713
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,358
and and old Ed and Rob and Mel Frank and

1714
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:03,179
you know they were they were the people

1715
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:06,119
I looked up to when it came to

1716
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:09,179
you know information and experience

1717
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:10,858
wow what an incredible story I uh I

1718
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:13,558
didn't know any of that that's that's so

1719
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:16,980
very enlightening and you just mentioned

1720
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:21,019
Mel Frank there I was wondering what was

1721
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,019
the first seeds you ever got from Mel

1722
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,740
and funny enough

1723
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:28,798
a weird thing you say that because uh in

1724
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:30,239
1996 when I met him at the at the 96

1725
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:31,858
Cannabis Cup

1726
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,118
um I told him I was coming home I was

1727
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:35,038
coming home to California and I would

1728
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,660
look him up when I got there so when I

1729
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,740
came back and I got that place in Bel

1730
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,719
Air

1731
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:42,179
um he was invited over but he never made

1732
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:43,858
it and he invited me over to pick up

1733
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:46,558
some of these skunk seeds that he had

1734
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:49,380
made the summer before which is this

1735
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,059
1996 skunk seeds so I drove over there

1736
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,858
and I picked them up and I drove home

1737
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:56,039
and I got busted like two weeks later so

1738
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:59,578
I lost them uh and then I go to prison

1739
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:02,280
I get out of prison uh years go by I

1740
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:06,000
move out of LA and Jim would always come

1741
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:08,400
visit me uh I I don't know I just always

1742
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,440
had hangout houses so he would just make

1743
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,000
his way to come see me and then when I

1744
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,858
moved up here I have a really big house

1745
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,358
and he would come and stay with me and

1746
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:17,400
we'd go to cannabis cups and the other

1747
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:18,420
cannabis events so we would always be

1748
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,460
buddies

1749
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:24,119
um so

1750
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:26,400
I I get this idea like the AG Seed Co

1751
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,079
happened when the farm bill passed and I

1752
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,000
realized that you know hey seeds are

1753
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,200
legal you know because all plant parts

1754
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,760
of the plant that contain less than

1755
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,159
three tenths of a percent THC were now

1756
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,720
taken out of the CSA and seeds contain

1757
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:38,940
zero cannabinoids so I saw an

1758
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,379
opportunity there as well as maybe maybe

1759
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,619
take other people a little while figure

1760
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:46,318
it out but seeds are legal so

1761
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:49,019
um I was like hmm and uh because we

1762
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,818
passed prop 64 here in California I'm

1763
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:52,380
legally growing the seeds everyone in

1764
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:53,940
the state of California over the age of

1765
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,619
21 doesn't even need a doctor's note

1766
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,900
they can legally grow six plants

1767
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,880
cannabis and you can get could amount of

1768
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,740
seeds off of six plants cannabis so

1769
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,960
technically you can legally grow your

1770
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:05,838
seeds in some ways because they're not

1771
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,699
federally illegal or anything like that

1772
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:11,099
they're much like heirloom tomato seeds

1773
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:12,899
where it's you know you can grow tomato

1774
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:15,599
seeds and then sell them on what we call

1775
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,520
eBay and it's not really a big deal and

1776
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,798
I I think the same is with cannabis

1777
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,960
seeds now because I don't know of any

1778
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:24,778
prosecutions are going specifically for

1779
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,060
seeds I mean there's no drug content it

1780
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:29,880
they're not really manufactured I mean

1781
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,699
they're a product of nature to say the

1782
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,560
very least and I think it's a difficult

1783
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:36,479
case for a prosecutor and I don't think

1784
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,580
a prosecutor really wants to prosecute

1785
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,500
somebody for like a few grams of seeds

1786
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:42,298
so as long as you pay your taxes and

1787
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,520
you're not you know

1788
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:47,278
getting caught selling kilos of butter

1789
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,739
hash out to the world I don't I don't

1790
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,940
think it's that dangerous to sell seeds

1791
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:52,559
anymore

1792
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:54,178
um lots and lots of seed companies have

1793
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,759
popped up believe it or not if you drive

1794
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:59,520
up what we have called Interstate 5 up

1795
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:03,420
in Oregon there are full-size billboards

1796
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:07,080
with 1-800 number websites for seeds so

1797
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:09,298
it's changing really big over here and

1798
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:10,920
uh so I started selling seeds and when I

1799
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:13,439
contacted Jim I was already in contact

1800
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,259
with Jim but I made a catalog and I sent

1801
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,838
it over to him and like the dad he is he

1802
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:22,259
corrected my grammar and sent it back to

1803
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:23,880
me and uh I only messed up like a comma

1804
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,738
and something else it was really pretty

1805
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,798
good like I got like pretty much a 99

1806
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:30,000
and uh and I was just like and I said to

1807
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,380
him I said you know man you should let

1808
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,880
me sell your seeds too they're not going

1809
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,838
to do anybody any good sitting in your

1810
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,640
refrigerator

1811
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,738
and he said you're right he said come

1812
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,440
over and get some so I drove all the way

1813
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:42,718
back down to LA and uh when I got there

1814
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:44,039
I had a Deja Vu because I hadn't visited

1815
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,179
him and it felt like a long time and

1816
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:47,039
said hey man how long you've been living

1817
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:48,779
in this house

1818
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,819
he said I moved into it just a couple

1819
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:52,620
years before you first visited it and I

1820
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,420
said really he goes yeah and it was cute

1821
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:55,800
because at the time he had some cheese

1822
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:58,920
on table he goes yeah remember you came

1823
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,020
up here to pick up these exact seeds and

1824
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,359
I went wow talk about life Interrupted

1825
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,760
he goes yeah you know because here we

1826
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,799
were 23 years later and I was just

1827
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,159
picking up the seeds just to do the same

1828
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,659
[ __ ] thing I was gonna do in 1997 and

1829
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:15,238
um they were still sitting in the

1830
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:16,979
refrigerator for me which was

1831
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:19,139
kind of a touching thing I know it

1832
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:21,000
sounds weird but like sometimes it's the

1833
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:24,420
little things in life that

1834
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,679
just blow you away and uh he didn't

1835
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:31,020
particularly save those seeds for me

1836
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:33,060
but he still had someone I was able to

1837
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:36,719
come back and get some so

1838
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:39,120
you know he's just I don't know man I

1839
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,960
absolutely adore Mel Frank he's I think

1840
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:45,179
one of the nice coolest kindest humblest

1841
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:47,880
best historians best photographers his

1842
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:50,520
cannabis photography back in the 70s is

1843
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,400
stunning his use of the camera is is

1844
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:55,860
magnificent and I don't know anybody

1845
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:58,979
with as good a photos

1846
01:10:55,859 --> 01:11:02,698
from the 1970s and early 80s of cannabis

1847
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:06,299
as as he as as Mel Frank his real name

1848
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:08,579
is Jim Goodwin of course but you know so

1849
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:11,039
I I that's kind of how it all started

1850
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:13,738
really and I didn't expect the skunk one

1851
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:16,198
seeds to smell anything but sweet and

1852
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:18,658
when I grew them I he gave me multiple

1853
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:21,419
he gave me 2010 seeds too that he made

1854
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:22,259
in 2010 and those did sell smell sweet

1855
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,359
um

1856
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,039
but when I stopped and started thinking

1857
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:28,319
about the genetics I kind of found it

1858
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:31,198
kind of like not too particular because

1859
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:33,840
him being friends with Skunk Man Sam and

1860
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:36,719
them both being old heads he would have

1861
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,279
most likely gave him seeds from the

1862
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,920
selections that would have been more

1863
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:43,139
like what what Jim would like rather

1864
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,658
than the newer stuff which was more

1865
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:48,060
fruity you know what I mean so kind of

1866
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:52,500
not surprised that it was more Afghan

1867
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:55,560
dominant rather than the uh the Acapulco

1868
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:59,579
Gold slash Plumbing gold because as he

1869
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:02,640
was doing his selections I think that

1870
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:05,238
there was a certain amount of time where

1871
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:08,100
skunk one was uh

1872
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:10,619
evolving we would say you know what I

1873
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:13,560
mean from from really stinky and and

1874
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:17,099
accurate probably a lot more thiols than

1875
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:21,060
it has now to a lot less thiols and a

1876
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:23,520
lot more fruity kind of uh you know that

1877
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,679
passion fruit kind of yummy terpenes

1878
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,980
that you smell and you just want to keep

1879
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,840
keep smelling at least that's my opinion

1880
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:32,579
of the evolution after talking to them

1881
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,500
both but they're kind of old and when

1882
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:37,800
I've asked Skunk Man Sam what he gave

1883
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:39,840
himself I don't remember and then you

1884
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,600
know when you asked

1885
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,980
um now you know kind of you know they

1886
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,500
know there's skunk seeds they know

1887
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:49,678
they're the skunk one seeds but

1888
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:51,479
we're along the line I don't know and

1889
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,600
and I don't know how old they were in

1890
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:57,238
1988 but I would easily think that they

1891
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,699
could have predated Sam moving there in

1892
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,559
85 because by mid 88 he'd only been

1893
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:05,158
there for like let's say two and a half

1894
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:07,380
years you know part of 85 86 87 and now

1895
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:10,019
you're into 88 so it could have easily

1896
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,539
been seeds that he had had that pre that

1897
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:14,219
goat went back to Santa Cruz since

1898
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:17,158
before he went over there and started

1899
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:19,500
doing more selections and redefining

1900
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:21,479
what became skunk one

1901
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,520
because you understand the evolution of

1902
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:25,019
species in a way you get exactly what

1903
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,520
I'm saying you know a lot of people

1904
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,860
don't they think it was like a light

1905
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,500
bulb turning on and it's like it doesn't

1906
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:33,420
work that way you know I think we slowly

1907
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,279
moved away from the files you know what

1908
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:37,199
I mean like I think that it's still

1909
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,840
present I just think they're present in

1910
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:41,219
my nude amounts

1911
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,840
yeah certainly I mean I've I've

1912
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:44,119
considered that sort of thing for a long

1913
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,679
time but it's good to hear that

1914
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:48,960
validated by your similar thoughts on it

1915
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,000
at all I was interested in asking you if

1916
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:54,060
you could give us a little rundown of

1917
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,340
the skunk you offer I guess I hear a lot

1918
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:59,039
of people in the past few years talk

1919
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,380
about skunkers though it's cool because

1920
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,819
it's this good strain but it's also like

1921
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:04,980
one of those older ones which like

1922
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:07,619
tended to yield quite nicely and a lot

1923
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:11,698
of people these days are really over the

1924
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:13,679
lower exotic plant yields do you think

1925
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,899
that skunk could be something for those

1926
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,619
type people

1927
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:21,359
I think a lot of people yeah I've I've

1928
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:24,119
saw quite a few skunk seeds since I've

1929
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,859
released them these uh these seeds that

1930
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:27,300
are currently available are the seeds

1931
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:30,719
that have only been reproduced twice

1932
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:33,480
since the 80s once in in 1996 and again

1933
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,380
by me in 2019 2020

1934
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:37,439
um

1935
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:39,179
they are old cannabis I mean I don't I

1936
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,738
don't know another way to put it they

1937
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:42,658
haven't had any outside influence

1938
01:14:40,738 --> 01:14:45,658
they've been uh inbred with themselves

1939
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:47,339
twice uh once in 96 months and they are

1940
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:48,960
old pot I don't know another way put it

1941
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:51,239
a lot of people have been growing them

1942
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,880
out love them a lot of people have been

1943
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:56,759
you know talking about finding skunks

1944
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,520
scent and taste in Aroma a lot of people

1945
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,840
want to shoot them down but I don't I

1946
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,340
think it's like the haze the more people

1947
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,659
that get the genetics the more people

1948
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,699
are going to have to shut up and realize

1949
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:07,439
they're still around and I I think

1950
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:09,599
that's the similar situation with

1951
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:12,119
thyal's present in the skunk they're

1952
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,579
still around I mean it's impossible for

1953
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:16,679
me to believe that that these terpene

1954
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:19,198
and by all combinations that were

1955
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:21,119
existing 30 years ago just disappeared

1956
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:22,979
it's not that they disappeared it's just

1957
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,559
that we slowly bred away for them in

1958
01:15:22,979 --> 01:15:28,319
favor of higher cannabinoid combinations

1959
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,780
with sweeter more aromatic scents it's

1960
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:33,420
really that simple and as we did that it

1961
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:35,939
made our Gardens easier to hide because

1962
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:38,158
now it took on a sweet floral a

1963
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:40,439
fragrance rather than a stinky skunky

1964
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:43,079
nasty what's that dead [ __ ] in your

1965
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:44,399
backyard fragrance and and that made a

1966
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:46,260
big difference in the way that we were

1967
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,479
able to cultivate cannabis in urban

1968
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,159
communities and I think a lot of people

1969
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,500
don't get that

1970
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:55,379
um and until you know the 90s and Beyond

1971
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:57,060
when carbon filters became the norm a

1972
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,159
lot of people were staking up their

1973
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:01,980
rooms in their neighborhoods trying to

1974
01:15:59,158 --> 01:16:03,479
grow this stuff I know I did you know my

1975
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:06,059
friend once who used to sleep over all

1976
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:09,238
the time he used to say to me bro now

1977
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:10,920
when I smell a skunk he's like I like it

1978
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:12,899
because it reminds me of your bedroom

1979
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,819
and your garden and I was like oh that's

1980
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:16,500
kind of funny you know but you know when

1981
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:18,238
we're a teenager we used to sit up in my

1982
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:20,880
bedroom and smoke weed because my

1983
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:22,799
grandma used to let us so it was the

1984
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,679
hangout spot you know you know what it's

1985
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,440
like when you're 14 15 16 years old you

1986
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,539
got nowhere to go and um it was funny

1987
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:32,579
but you know and it's funny how you

1988
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:35,760
start to like scents like now when I

1989
01:16:32,579 --> 01:16:37,319
smell skunk I like it it I like it

1990
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,260
they're like on the side of the road it

1991
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:41,939
makes me reminds me of old weed and the

1992
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,159
skunk I have still reminds me of will

1993
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:45,719
read there's still files present in it

1994
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:46,979
you know I just tell anybody that

1995
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:48,239
doesn't believe it just freaking grow

1996
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:51,119
them

1997
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:51,839
you tell me after you've flowered it you

1998
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:54,658
know

1999
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,719
yeah I agree it's interesting because we

2000
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:59,698
don't see files in any other mixture

2001
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:01,859
other than like on their own like it's

2002
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:05,099
like you know people talk as if there's

2003
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:07,139
one roadkill skunk and then nothing else

2004
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:10,079
like it do you think we'll ever see it

2005
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:13,140
mixed with other things

2006
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:16,738
yeah you know the the rks that I got

2007
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:17,940
from Jaime in Alaska to me is just very

2008
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:20,579
Afghan

2009
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:22,379
um it it's a decent smoke it's a

2010
01:17:20,579 --> 01:17:23,579
beautiful bud I've taken high quality

2011
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,920
photos of it and shared them people

2012
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:29,640
loved it my girlfriend likes to smoke it

2013
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:33,779
it's peppery uh it's not my favorite um

2014
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:36,840
but I'm a haze head and um but it's just

2015
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:38,519
not overwhelming and and you know I have

2016
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,719
to them and I saw the small batch of

2017
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,420
them and people that have grown them

2018
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,039
have agreed with me but you know people

2019
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:46,079
are still condemning oh you can't have

2020
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:48,179
them like it's the Holy Grail or

2021
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,880
something silly but you know you still

2022
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:52,739
see these skunk problems in hemp Fields

2023
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,840
so when I say problems make the

2024
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:56,639
overwhelming scent of skunk or something

2025
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:59,039
rancid or acrid

2026
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,020
um so there's still files in high

2027
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:04,158
numbers so you know these people that

2028
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,780
are growing large amounts of of low THC

2029
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:10,019
cannabis are also having neighbors

2030
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:12,479
complain about the smell of skunk and

2031
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:14,640
it's just not from a small batch it's

2032
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,339
from [ __ ] Hempfield

2033
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,440
um so that just tells me they're present

2034
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:22,440
uh it's just a matter of us breeding

2035
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:26,460
them up if we really want them back

2036
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:27,839
um I I say this though you know just

2037
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,640
like there's a Synergy between the

2038
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,199
terpenes and the cannabinoids there

2039
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,060
might be more of a Synergy between the

2040
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:35,879
dials and the cannabinoids and the

2041
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:37,860
terpenes that we know right now and we

2042
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,859
perhaps are underestimating so it might

2043
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:44,339
be worth it for people to take the time

2044
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:47,099
to try to detect files and to try to

2045
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:50,100
bring back that funky musty stinky smell

2046
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:52,260
like I say it in two words because like

2047
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,880
I I I feel like it's already very

2048
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,739
present in the skunk one seeds that I'm

2049
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,840
offering and that I have and that people

2050
01:18:55,738 --> 01:18:58,799
are reporting the same thing I am

2051
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,960
um

2052
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,520
but you could do more with it you know

2053
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,079
if somebody were to take tens of

2054
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,280
thousands of these seeds or thousands of

2055
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,500
these seeds and start really going

2056
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:09,658
through them you're going to find the

2057
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,279
Einsteins the Real Genius plants in

2058
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:13,259
there and you're going to find the

2059
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,359
tripping combinations that are one in a

2060
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:17,460
thousand or one in a whatever you know

2061
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:20,099
one in whatever your lottery ticket ends

2062
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:23,039
up being and you and if you have the

2063
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:25,260
ability to clone it and carry on those

2064
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,179
genetics maybe the whole Community could

2065
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,039
share them because I have a feeling

2066
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:31,079
unfortunately a lot of times when these

2067
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:33,539
good plants pop up they may fall into

2068
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:36,119
the hands of people that are not making

2069
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:39,060
cuttings are not making seeds are not

2070
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:41,279
sharing it I've had a lot of my great

2071
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:43,140
friends in Northern California hand me

2072
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,119
one of the best buds I've ever smoked

2073
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:47,640
and then I say can I get a cutting and

2074
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,738
they say oh dude that's that's the plan

2075
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,079
I cut that down I don't have cuttings of

2076
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:53,759
it and I do like really he's like dude I

2077
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,500
had 100 of them and it's like I get it

2078
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,600
and then they're not home to take care

2079
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:59,340
of the cuttings it's not there it's not

2080
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,980
the way they do their they did thing

2081
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:03,239
back in the 90s you know what I mean hey

2082
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:04,738
they leave and they have to go sell

2083
01:20:03,238 --> 01:20:06,539
their weed it gets cold up there there's

2084
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:08,339
no point of being up where you don't

2085
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:09,899
have electricity and you have outdoor

2086
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,940
Plumbing in the winter if you don't have

2087
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:13,559
to be and a lot of my friends used to go

2088
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:16,439
up open up their places in the spring

2089
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:18,539
crop out leave in the fall and spend

2090
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:20,879

2125
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:46,319
backyard and smoked weed together and he

2126
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,920
talked to me about how he first smoked

2127
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:52,380
cannabis in the 1950s when the beets the

2128
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:56,039

2131
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:04,619
he ate cookies because he couldn't smoke

2132
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:07,559
weed comfortably around a lot of the

2133
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:10,140
people that were in the magazine so he

2134
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,960
had cookies made and he would secretly

2135
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:16,140
eat cannabis Edibles that was his trip

2136
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,260
and I was the amazing experience man I

2137
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:22,079
mean I met him

2138
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:23,699
97 I guess and then started going he

2139
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,679
allowed me to come over I guess the

2140

first time I had dinner with him was in

2141

Playboy parties 98.99 which was a lot of

2143
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:37,439
fun and um it was really quite touching

2144
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,239
um I actually have a picture of him and

2145
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,460
the woman that was his assistant on the

2146
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:44,339
wall because uh Joanie was her name and

2147
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:46,859

2148
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,719
um she was a cannabis user and

2149
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:52,198
unbelievably she came down with cancer

2150
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,460
in 1999 and during the summer of 99 I

2151
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:56,158
was the one bringing her her medicine

2152
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:58,800
and spending time with her and

2153
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:00,359
um she passed away in September and I

2154
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,060
attended a funeral at the Playboy

2155
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:05,219
Mansion it was pretty heavy and I spent

2156

my last weekend at the Playboy Mansion

2157
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:09,960

2159
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,500
New Year's Eve and then I had myself I

2160

didn't even tell half I had to go to

2161

2162
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:20,219
to ruin this evening I just felt so bad

2163
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:23,219
about projecting my sadness onto my

2164
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:24,779
friends that only the few people I was

2165

there with actually knew that I had to

2166
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:28,198
go to prison on Monday because I just

2167
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:31,560
didn't want to ruin anybody's New Year's

2168

Eve I mean it's [ __ ] 1999 2000 I

2169

01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,019
and um

2171

it was sad and uh when I got out of

2172
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:42,060

2173
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:44,579
use the Playboy Mansion to raise money

2174
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:46,260
uh for the legalization effort and I

2175

01:26:30,779 --> 01:26:35,340
was there too she spoke about AIDS

2250
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,500
active activism Mickey Hart spoke about

2251
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:40,679
uh deforestation and why we have to stop

2252
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,658
deforesting and um it was really cool I

2253
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:45,119
was actually pretty blown away like the

2254
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:47,879
[ __ ] I grew up listening to Woodstock on

2255
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:50,039
my mom's albums and here I was like

2256
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:52,380
meeting Michael Lang and [ __ ] wearing

2257
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:55,560
it all access pass and going out on

2258
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:57,300
stage as myself talking about weed and

2259
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:59,280
nobody knew who I was which was really

2260
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:02,039
quite strange you know because I'm not a

2261
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:04,619
musician I'm not famous and any on any

2262
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:07,139
level but I showed a short video of me

2263
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:09,000
getting busted and a little bit of

2264
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,980
History of cannabis and then I started

2265
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,439
talking and people just clicked and they

2266
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:15,539
loved it and the whole little thing went

2267
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:17,219
over really well but uh while I was

2268
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:19,800
being prosecuted I really turned it into

2269
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:22,079
a soap box believe it or not I tore it

2270
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,840
around to almost all not all of them but

2271
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:27,119
quite a few of the major universities

2272
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,980
um speaking about legalizing cannabis uh

2273
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:31,439
we created this group called Spitfire

2274
01:27:28,979 --> 01:27:33,899
which was a active musicians and

2275
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:36,719
activists it was the idea of Zach de la

2276
01:27:33,899 --> 01:27:38,579
Rocha of Rage Against the Machine and he

2277
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,079
had the idea of like putting rock stars

2278
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:41,579
and activists together and going to

2279
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:43,500
colleges because then the kids would

2280
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:45,238
show up and listen to the rock stars and

2281
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:48,420
maybe you know get a little bit taken

2282
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:51,059
away from the activists so it was cool

2283
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:53,399
man I toured with Woody Harrelson

2284
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:54,960
um you know Chris novacelle of Nirvana

2285
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:57,119
he spoke about

2286
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,619
um censorship and music Amy Ray of the

2287
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:00,479
Indigo Girls she spoke about gay and

2288
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:03,179
lesbian rights Kennedy she spoke about

2289
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,799
conservative issues Jello Biafra of the

2290
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:06,420
Dead Kennedys he was just [ __ ]

2291
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,800
Dynamic and spoke about everything that

2292
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,020
blew our behind

2293
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,000
um we had quite a few people Andy Dick

2294
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:14,159
was on tour with us on Mickey Hart

2295
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,079
joined us for an event it was really

2296
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:18,119
quite cool because the women that put it

2297
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:20,279
together was normally a music uh

2298
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:22,319
industry like she would produce concerts

2299
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:25,139
so she knew all these like Red Hot Chili

2300
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:27,599
she knew everybody and she so she so she

2301
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,920
could just put put us like you know what

2302
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,320
the [ __ ] am I doing touring around with

2303
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,179
a guy from Nirvana but but it was great

2304
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:35,579
and me and Chris became good friends and

2305
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:39,359
still friends still friends last time I

2306
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:40,619
checked I mean so I I think the world of

2307
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:42,599
them really he does this thing called

2308
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:45,539
fear vote and he's trying to get uh

2309
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,120
ranked Choice voting passed in in North

2310
01:28:45,539 --> 01:28:50,158
America where your vote always counts

2311
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:52,319
meaning that you pick your favorites and

2312
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,939
then if your first one doesn't win all

2313
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:56,219
your votes go to your second choice and

2314
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:58,859
then it just creates a situation where

2315
01:28:56,219 --> 01:29:00,600
every vote counts it's really cool uh

2316
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:03,479
the politicians are scared [ __ ] of it

2317
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:06,239
because it's not just 50 50 at that

2318
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:08,279
point it's like you can't be an [ __ ]

2319
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,198
because if the person you're you you

2320
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:12,719
would you wouldn't you would get the

2321
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:14,819
votes from as their second choice if you

2322
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,800
don't do good it's really cool I love

2323
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:18,479
the work he does politically but it was

2324
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,300
[ __ ] Dynamic and I got to do a lot of

2325
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,859
fun [ __ ] uh when I got out of prison I

2326
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:26,340
was really more determined to be an

2327
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:27,779
activist than I was ever and uh I met up

2328
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:29,219
with some guys from Canada we made the

2329
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,719
first documentary called the union the

2330
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:31,980
business behind getting high that did

2331
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:33,420
really well for us and then I got the

2332
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:35,399
opportunity to produce Playboy parties

2333
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,260
and that went really well for us and

2334
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:38,879
then I rented a hundred thousand square

2335
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,980
feet at the Los Angeles Convention

2336
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,980
Center in 2009

2337
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:46,738
and I held the first THC Expo I had

2338
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:48,479
almost 300 companies and I had over 40

2339
01:29:46,738 --> 01:29:51,059
000 people show up that first Saturday

2340
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:53,459
uh that the fire marshal almost shut me

2341
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:55,860
down multiple times it was really quite

2342
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:58,260
amazing and um

2343
01:29:55,859 --> 01:30:00,000
Tommy Chong is somebody I met in the

2344
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:04,500
neighborhood of La when I moved to Bel

2345
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,119
Air I started meeting celebrities and um

2346
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:08,939
kind of strange like that but you just

2347
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:10,619
meet your neighbors and if if you are

2348
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:12,419
friendly with them you never know you

2349
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:14,399
make friends in the strangest places so

2350
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:16,800
Tommy and I became kind of buddies like

2351
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:18,779
shared numbers and would talk and um

2352
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,400
Tommy was very supportive of me before I

2353
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:22,079
went to prison because he felt like what

2354
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,539
the prosecution was just [ __ ]

2355
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:26,279
horrible and then they prosecuted him

2356
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:27,960
for bongs while I was in prison I

2357
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:30,119
couldn't believe it Tommy and I went

2358
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,920
through the same halfway house within a

2359
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:34,260
few months of each other and stayed in

2360
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,739
touch after we got out of prison and um

2361
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:39,179
and he was helpful with the Playboy

2362
01:30:37,738 --> 01:30:40,439
parties in the way that he was helped

2363
01:30:39,179 --> 01:30:41,760
trying to help me connect with other

2364
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:43,559
celebrities because

2365
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,000
we were just trying to get them to try

2366
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,739
to speak up and get involved I mean

2367
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,899
we're not rich like Nike we can't just

2368
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:50,579
hire Michael Jordan I gotta like sit

2369
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:52,259
down with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and try to

2370
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:54,300
like guilt him into saying good things

2371
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:55,679
about medical cannabis even though he

2372
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,880
uses medical cannabis for his own

2373
01:30:55,679 --> 01:31:00,119
headaches

2374
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,579
um and um true story actually and uh but

2375
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:04,319
the funny part is is realistically the

2376
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:06,059
the party wasn't the point it was the

2377
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,619
networking that was important you know

2378
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:09,239
what I mean because it gave us like a

2379
01:31:07,619 --> 01:31:10,738
hey can I talk to you about our activism

2380
01:31:09,238 --> 01:31:12,718
and would you donate or would you help

2381
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:14,039
out Tommy was always down to help out

2382
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,600
but he never wanted to come to the

2383
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:20,519
parties because he hated being like

2384
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,320
signature mode and he just hated it but

2385
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,540
he always came to the pre-planning

2386
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:26,698
parties which was really more like

2387
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:30,060
touching to me that he was like

2388
01:31:26,698 --> 01:31:32,399
he cared he's a great great person I can

2389
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:34,860
adore Tommy Chong but I called him up

2390
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:37,619
one day and he has an electric hot rod

2391
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:39,479
and I said uh I was high I'm always high

2392
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:41,039
but I said um

2393
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:43,859
hey Tommy do you still have your

2394
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:46,319
electric hot rod and he's like yeah and

2395
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:48,599
they said hey can I borrow it and he got

2396
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:49,500
real quiet for a good minute and he's

2397
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,079
like

2398
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:54,060
yeah yeah I suppose you can he's like

2399
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,979
where is it you want to go Todd I said

2400
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:58,320
oh Tommy I'm not trying to go anywhere I

2401
01:31:55,979 --> 01:31:59,879
rented the LA Convention Center and I'm

2402
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,039
gonna hold like the first indoor

2403
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,020
cannabis convention on the large scale

2404
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:05,340
here in North America and I want to put

2405

2409
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:13,679
electric hot rod to me it's like the

2410
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:15,420
environmental side of you that nobody

2411
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:18,480
knows like he drives a blacked out Prius

2412
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:20,340
like he he's he's not a flashy dude he's

2413
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,819
not wearing Rolexes and [ __ ] gold

2414
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:25,500
watches and he's not that dude he's like

2415
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:28,439
environmentalist like politically cool

2416
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:29,579
like he's just like they say when you

2417
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:31,500
meet your Heroes you're often

2418
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:33,059
disappointed if you get to meet Tommy

2419
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,800
you'll be nothing but blown away because

2420
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,659
he's just such a good person his

2421
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:39,779
family's so cool his kids are so cool

2422
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:42,179
he's just amazing and um

2423
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:43,738
and he let me borrow his car man I I he

2424
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:44,819
he hooked me up with hippie Motors and

2425
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:46,678
they delivered the car to the lake

2426
01:32:44,819 --> 01:32:48,599
convention center and he came down that

2427
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:51,300
day to see what I was up to and I opened

2428
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,219
the doors and the place got flooded and

2429
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:55,320
he was so proud of me it was [ __ ]

2430
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:57,179
great I got countless photos of him like

2431
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:59,059
giving me hugs and being happier than

2432
01:32:57,179 --> 01:33:01,619
anything because it it felt like

2433
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:03,840
Vindication you know like here we are

2434
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:07,079
standing here as a demographic that

2435
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,659
can't be ignored and um it felt good it

2436
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:11,939
was a real powerful moment Woody flew

2437
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:13,500
out from Ohio from Hawaii just to come

2438
01:33:11,939 --> 01:33:16,079
to my event

2439
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:18,119
um you know it it was really quite

2440
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,158
touching like my friends

2441
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:21,899
have been great friends like I feel

2442
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,420
nothing but blessed for the people I've

2443
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:26,099
had in my life and so so fortunate and

2444
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,859
you know not just because they're famous

2445
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,900
just because they're such good people uh

2446
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:32,639
on such a spectrum of of doing good

2447
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:36,539
things in the community on different

2448
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:38,340
levels and um it's been beautiful and uh

2449
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:40,380
and then I did my second documentary

2450
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:43,440
with the same guys we did the culture

2451
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,520
High uh which included uh really a great

2452
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:47,099
cast

2453
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,380
um in 2012 I happen to be getting the

2454
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,900
Cannabis culture award from Ben dronkers

2455
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:54,300
with uh Richard Branson and Dr Lester

2456
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:55,979
grinspoon and I used the opportunity to

2457
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,960
ask Richard Branson if you'd consider

2458
01:33:55,979 --> 01:34:00,779
being in our second documentary

2459
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,819
and he said maybe and then he said yes

2460
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:05,219
and then when he saw the film he liked

2461
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:07,439
it so much that he took it on his own

2462
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:10,198
accord and launched it for us on October

2463
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:12,439
1st 2014 which was pretty incredible

2464
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:15,299
when he wrote this beautiful blog about

2465
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,979
legalizing uh can you know cannabis and

2466
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:19,020
what's going on with the war on drugs

2467
01:34:16,979 --> 01:34:20,339
and I mean it was really amazing because

2468
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,659
you can't get a billionaire to do

2469
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:24,659
anything he doesn't want to do if he

2470
01:34:21,658 --> 01:34:28,138
doesn't want to do it and to have that

2471
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:30,960
Purity was just incredible and uh I

2472
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:33,199
think a lot of because of that he helped

2473
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:36,600
us uh get a lot of international press

2474
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:39,178
and then uh it was picked up by Netflix

2475
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:42,600
and it was shown in 70 countries in 15

2476
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:46,020
languages for three years uh with you

2477
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:49,380
know various uh transcriptions in the in

2478
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:50,699
voiceovers so it was it I don't know

2479
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:53,460
this whole way through and then

2480
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:55,198
unfortunately when Jack died in 2010 his

2481
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:57,420
publisher contacted me and said hey

2482
01:34:55,198 --> 01:35:00,000
you're it you know we got to put the

2483
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:03,060
book back out and um at that point we

2484
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,179
only had the 11th Edition done so

2485
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:09,659
um I put together the 12th edition of

2486
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:12,119
the book and I reached out to a bunch of

2487
01:35:09,658 --> 01:35:14,460
our friends like like Woody and Tommy

2488
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:16,679
and Vivian mcpeek of Hempfest and Debbie

2489
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:19,439
colesbury of can

2490
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:21,779
um and I asked them to write uh

2491
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:25,319
memorials to Jack Steve Hager of High

2492
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:28,259
Times uh Steve Bloom I think I got in

2493
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:30,359
there too uh maybe Malcolm McKinnon as

2494
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:32,400
well I'd have to go through the list but

2495
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:34,439
uh they were all really nice to me I

2496
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:36,000
mean Tommy when I wrote to him and asked

2497
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:38,399
him to write a memorial for Jack Herer

2498
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,859
he didn't answer my email with a yes or

2499
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:42,599
a no he just wrote it and sent it back

2500
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:45,420
that was his reply

2501
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,920
and I was just like wow and uh

2502
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:48,960
and I don't know it was touching because

2503
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,158
Jack touched all our lives I mean I used

2504
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:53,100
to say that he didn't just touch our

2505
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:54,899
lives he penetrated our lives and it was

2506
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,960
beautiful to know him and to be so close

2507
01:35:54,899 --> 01:36:00,119
to him and you know I I'm honored to

2508
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:02,520
still be close to all of his kids and

2509
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:04,380
you know I wish he was still here I love

2510
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,440
him very much he was the father I never

2511
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,539
had on a lot of levels I mean Jack was

2512
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:11,219
great and um

2513
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:13,800
yeah I wish we still had him here today

2514
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:16,439
for sure and uh I think he'd be really

2515
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,239
proud to see legalization and the

2516
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:21,178
changes that have occurred I mean for

2517
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:23,099
Jack it was not about you know

2518
01:36:21,179 --> 01:36:24,840
protecting the prophets of farmers it

2519
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:27,179
was about liberating the people that

2520
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:31,079
were affected by the drug war and that

2521
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:31,079
were sitting in prison and

2522
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:37,260
and you know he made me promise that I

2523
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:39,779
would fight as an activist until I was

2524
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:44,159
84 or dead

2525
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:46,198
and uh I don't know I just feel like a

2526
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:49,259
lot of my

2527
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:51,539
passion and determination came from him

2528
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:54,360
I don't know

2529
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:56,340
yeah I know

2530
01:36:54,359 --> 01:36:59,460
he was someone that really touched my

2531
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,840
life and and many others in such a

2532
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:02,819
positive way I think a lot of us are

2533
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:04,679
really activists

2534
01:37:02,819 --> 01:37:07,619
um would say that it was reading the

2535
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:09,840
emperor where's no clothes at

2536
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:12,119
kicked us in the ass and really

2537
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,279
motivated us to do something

2538
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:16,979
about the Injustice it was Cannabis

2539
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:20,460
prohibition and uh yeah

2540
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:22,919
and then in 2011 uh on a brighter note

2541
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:25,800
Seattle had faster and 20 years old

2542
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:28,139
so I helped Vivian mcpeek put together a

2543
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,119
20 chapter book uh called protestable

2544
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:32,579
which kind of stands for protested

2545
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:35,219
festival and um we wanted to highlight

2546
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:38,939
all the work that Seattle hand Fest had

2547
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:40,679
done to to work to legalize and um

2548
01:37:38,939 --> 01:37:42,779
it's been a hell of a journey to be

2549
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:43,679
really blunt I mean

2550
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:45,420
um

2551
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,699
I don't know I'm proud of where we are

2552
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:49,380
now I'm glad to see The Liberation I'm

2553
01:37:47,698 --> 01:37:51,960
happy to see cannabis stories I believe

2554
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:54,480
in cannabinoids that it will help

2555
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:56,880
Society like it's helped me and I wish

2556
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:59,819
more people had access to cannabis

2557
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:01,560
because I believe that if they did you

2558
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:04,380
know society would be a much more

2559
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:06,860
beautiful place and less people would be

2560
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:10,199
addicted to Pharmaceuticals and alcohol

2561
01:38:06,859 --> 01:38:12,000
and various substances that you know you

2562
01:38:10,198 --> 01:38:13,799
just don't need if you have good herb in

2563
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,319
your life so

2564
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:18,360
yeah a hell of a journey so

2565
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:21,119
you know here we are now and I feel like

2566
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:25,019
even selling seeds is a form of activism

2567
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:26,819
because you know I'm you know I've lived

2568
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:28,860
in the same place for 11 years I've only

2569
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:30,539
been selling seeds for two and a half my

2570
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:32,519
life hasn't really changed since I

2571
01:38:30,539 --> 01:38:33,359
started selling seeds

2572
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,219
um

2573
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,619
it's really not about the money it's

2574
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:40,380
really just about trying to like do good

2575
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:44,340
for a community that's meant a lot to me

2576
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:45,900
for a long time and that's you know kind

2577
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,739
of helped me survive I mean I don't

2578
01:38:45,899 --> 01:38:48,779
think

2579
01:38:46,738 --> 01:38:51,839
I would be where I am today if it wasn't

2580
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:53,519
for cannabis or the insightful doctors

2581
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,619
that I had that were willing to give me

2582
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,719
cannabis over opiates

2583
01:38:55,619 --> 01:38:59,340
you know and I'm I'm just really

2584
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:01,859
grateful it's

2585
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:04,260
you know so I cannabis is my form of

2586
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:06,179
appreciation and I think the best way I

2587
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,440
can honor it is to spread the seeds

2588
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:09,800
around and give other people the

2589
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:12,719
opportunity of growing and experiencing

2590
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:15,060
you know the varieties that have come

2591
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,760
through me you know and I didn't invent

2592
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:19,139
cannabis so I can breed it together all

2593
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,360
I want but

2594
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:22,920
you know I'm not going to be one of

2595
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:25,799
these guys that thinks he's cool or

2596
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,000
[ __ ] rock star breeder any of that I

2597
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,360
think

2598
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,119
you know everybody should do it and I'm

2599
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:34,859
just grateful to be the bridge between

2600
01:39:32,119 --> 01:39:38,340
you know these old Growers these old

2601
01:39:34,859 --> 01:39:41,099
breeders and a new generation

2602
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:43,980
what a powerful recount there of your

2603
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,539
life story that's incredible to say the

2604
01:39:43,979 --> 01:39:47,099
least you know and then thanks so much

2605
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:49,260
for sharing the the very personal

2606
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:52,980
relationship you have with Jack that's

2607
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:55,079
really inspiring we had just a small

2608
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:57,119
number of questions left including our

2609
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:59,279
rapid fire ones so we're sort of on the

2610
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:01,198
tail end of it all I appreciate your

2611
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:03,000
time sure sure it's been fun talking to

2612
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:05,039
me you know kovitz kept us in the house

2613
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,539
and I used to go to coffee shops and

2614
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:08,760
meet strangers and talk to them for

2615
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:11,279
hours and become friends and it was

2616
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:12,480
great and I you know haven't been out of

2617
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:14,698
the house in a while just meet my

2618
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,799
girlfriend working all the time so it's

2619
01:40:14,698 --> 01:40:19,559
kind of nice to to have been talking to

2620
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,659
you and going over this stuff is

2621
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:23,940
I I didn't realize I haven't talked

2622
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:26,039
about Jack in a while so

2623
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:28,799
my own surprises in this conversation

2624
01:40:26,039 --> 01:40:31,019
but thanks for uh entertaining it and I

2625
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,579
hope that people take something from it

2626
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:35,040
uh

2627
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:37,500
to say the least look I'm sure they will

2628
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:39,899
it's been great from my position that's

2629
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,520
for sure I it's I think I could probably

2630
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:44,039
guess the answer to this question but I

2631
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,800
haven't asked you what style of growing

2632
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:51,359
do you like are you a soil Organics guy

2633
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:53,460
how do you do it yeah I I organic pots

2634
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:56,219
um I got LED lights and I get drip run

2635
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:57,600
to waste irrigation I use dosatrons I

2636
01:40:56,219 --> 01:40:59,460
you know

2637
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:03,239
um but

2638
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:06,000
I use a Roots organic 707 as a medium I

2639
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:07,500
love it I I swear by it uh I think it's

2640
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,060
a very good company they put out a very

2641
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:11,460
good product

2642
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:14,699
um I use some of uh aryan's Greenhouse

2643
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:17,880
powder feeding I like his uh bio line

2644
01:41:14,698 --> 01:41:20,819
and his his mineral line both very good

2645
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:23,520
um I use those in addition uh I don't

2646
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:25,500
really spray much on my plants I you

2647
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,739
know I like extracts and I don't want

2648
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:30,719
anything on the flowers other than water

2649
01:41:28,738 --> 01:41:32,519
um you know as far as growing tips I

2650
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,840
would say that a long time ago I started

2651
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:37,139
using

2652
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,239
um ionized water which is electronically

2653
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:41,760
ionized for its acidity or alkalinity

2654
01:41:39,238 --> 01:41:45,299
and you can use this water to either

2655
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:47,520
degrease or basically debug and it

2656
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:48,960
doesn't leave anything behind so I've

2657
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,540
been recommending to my friends that

2658
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,399
they buy these uh water ionizers and

2659
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:55,560
they start to use like high alkaline

2660
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:58,500
water in order to rinse off powder and

2661
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,840
mildew in acidic water to deal with bugs

2662
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:03,000
because

2663
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:05,880
showed us that we killed the insects but

2664
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,679
acid rain also kills the insects so if

2665
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:10,319
you use an acidic water you can actually

2666
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,600
do it without harming the plants uh the

2667
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:14,819
alkaline water though I am very hesitant

2668
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:18,600
to spray on flowering plants because the

2669
01:42:14,819 --> 01:42:20,279
alkalinity will emulsify the oils uh so

2670
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:24,480
you want to use it more sparingly than

2671
01:42:20,279 --> 01:42:25,079
the acidic water but it works great

2672
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:28,319
um

2673
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:30,600
I've uh you know also if anybody's still

2674
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:33,238
deep this deep and new listening

2675
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:35,579
um I recommend using hemp seed oil as a

2676
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:37,379
solvent to dissolve the trichrome heads

2677
01:42:35,579 --> 01:42:39,779
on the Cannabis flowers that people grow

2678
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:43,319
20 years ago I was sitting home rather

2679
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:46,198
stoned and I I was using a Marinol and I

2680
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:48,179
had used an A B epoxy that day which is

2681
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:51,118
you know two parts resin that makes a

2682
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:53,460
hard bind and I was thinking [ __ ]

2683
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:56,579
synthetic molecules suspended and sesame

2684
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:58,980
oil what if I used organic cannabinoids

2685
01:42:56,579 --> 01:43:00,779
and suspended them in hemp seed oil so I

2686
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:02,879
went and I scooped up some resin powder

2687
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:06,238
and I put it in some hemp seed oil that

2688
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:08,819
I had heating up in a frying pan and it

2689
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:10,979
melted into the hemp seed oil and

2690
01:43:08,819 --> 01:43:13,019
decarboxylated and I put it on muffins

2691
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:15,359
like it was a butter and I got really

2692
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,400
high and um

2693
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:20,460
I started playing with putting the

2694
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:21,479
grinding up the Cannabis or just using

2695
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:25,439
my

2696
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:27,959
um because I have uh Siege screens you

2697
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:30,059
know 60 mesh and 150 mesh and a bunch in

2698
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:32,219
between so I would collect my resin

2699
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:34,679
powder and uh if you just put resin

2700
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:36,960
powder in a jar of hemp seed oil

2701
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:39,239
um and you agitate it a little the hemp

2702
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,639
seed oil being an oil will break down

2703
01:43:39,238 --> 01:43:43,919
the trichrome which is also an oil and

2704
01:43:41,639 --> 01:43:46,440
it will release the acids and the tri

2705
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,359
and the terpenes into the oil and then

2706
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:50,158
you can take like a like a stainless

2707
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:52,380
steel strainer or whatever you want and

2708
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:56,099
you can actually strain the hemp seed

2709
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:59,039
oil of any of the thicker waxes that

2710
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:02,699
didn't dissolve with the hemp seed oil

2711
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:05,300
as easily and you can get that out and

2712
01:44:02,698 --> 01:44:07,399
then what you have left is

2713
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:09,960
phytocannabinoid infused

2714
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:12,420
non-de-carboxylated and all the terpenes

2715
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,920
in in the hemp seed oil and you can do

2716
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:16,679
this in your refrigerator it takes like

2717
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,359
10 to 20 days sometimes for the oil to

2718
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:21,118
break down the trichromes but once it

2719
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:23,219
does it's so much better than all you

2720
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:25,439
know like an alcoholic

2721
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:27,239
um ethanol extract because you know

2722
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:29,939
alcohol doesn't evaporate off to like a

2723
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:32,218
buck set 170 degrees Fahrenheit and by

2724
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:34,198
the time it does it's evaporated away

2725
01:44:32,219 --> 01:44:37,079
most of the more you know monotropenes

2726
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:38,579
and it has decarboxylated the

2727
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:42,479
cannabinoids

2728
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:45,439
um so I had this realization that if we

2729
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:47,059
could consume uh higher amounts of

2730
01:44:45,439 --> 01:44:49,919
phytocannabinoids without

2731
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:52,320
decarboxylating them we might find that

2732
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,658
it's a better medicine for a lot of

2733
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,039
people who are not trying to get uh like

2734
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:58,979
loopy like if you have a little kid

2735
01:44:56,039 --> 01:45:00,658
that's housing seizures or like me a

2736
01:44:58,979 --> 01:45:02,399
little kid at the time that was going

2737
01:45:00,658 --> 01:45:04,559
through chemo you probably don't want

2738
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,379
them all stoned out but if you can

2739
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,300
actually give him

2740
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:11,819
phytocannabinoids in hemp seed oil

2741
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:13,739
um which in itself has a perfect balance

2742
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:16,259
of essential fatty acids

2743
01:45:13,738 --> 01:45:18,959
um then you can actually medicate the

2744
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,579
child without drugging the child for

2745
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,800
lack of better terminology but people

2746
01:45:20,579 --> 01:45:25,738
would get it and that can be very

2747
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,300
beneficial because cancer patients have

2748
01:45:25,738 --> 01:45:28,579
shown that using like a thousand

2749
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:32,279
milligrams of

2750
01:45:28,579 --> 01:45:34,319
decarboxylated THC was beneficial for

2751
01:45:32,279 --> 01:45:36,779
the anti-inflammatory effects of like

2752
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:39,059
reducing tumor sizes and my thought is

2753
01:45:36,779 --> 01:45:41,219
that you can actually take thousands of

2754
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:43,500
milligrams of phytocannabinoids that are

2755
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:45,420
not decarboxylated and have the

2756
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:47,399
anti-inflammation properties without

2757
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:50,340
being completely sleeping for the next

2758
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:52,379
48 hours which is nice if you you know

2759
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,760
if you're dying you want to be awake for

2760
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:55,980
most of the rest of your life you know

2761
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:59,400
and not completely drugged out in loopy

2762
01:45:55,979 --> 01:46:01,439
so um I really recommend that people

2763
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:03,118
start looking at that you know home

2764
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,879
growing is blowing up now that it's

2765
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,679
legal and people have the ability of of

2766
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:09,900
making their own medicine instead of

2767
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,539
going out and buying it you know eighty

2768
01:46:09,899 --> 01:46:14,158
dollars an eighth in a jar they can have

2769
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:16,920
big branches of it for practically

2770
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:19,198
nothing so you know once they have an

2771
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:20,960
abundance of cannabis I'm starting to

2772
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,939
look at hemp seed oil

2773
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:26,000
and pressure serving it is is much

2774
01:46:23,939 --> 01:46:28,138
better because if you make jars of

2775
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,300
phytocannabinoid infused hemp seed oil

2776
01:46:28,139 --> 01:46:31,560
you can keep that in cold storage for a

2777
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,420
very long time and those

2778
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,679
phytocannabinoids and terpenes will

2779
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,618
remain

2780
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:41,100
um very violent viable and that the oil

2781
01:46:37,618 --> 01:46:44,460
smells amazing man some

2782
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:46,440
flower chirping combinations smell so

2783
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:49,739
good with the Nutty scent of hemp seed

2784
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:51,238
oil it's crazy it's just absolutely

2785
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:51,899
wonderful

2786
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:54,959
um

2787
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:56,238
so my little bit of advice to anyone is

2788
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,439
to listen

2789
01:46:56,238 --> 01:47:00,479
that's great I'm gonna have to give that

2790
01:46:58,439 --> 01:47:03,238
a try myself actually

2791
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:05,519
we've spoken a lot about some of the

2792
01:47:03,238 --> 01:47:07,559
more old school strains and so I would

2793
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,239
be Keen to hear what are your thoughts

2794
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,940
specifically on the new stuff you know

2795
01:47:09,238 --> 01:47:14,698
the hype exotic stuff so you're a fan of

2796
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:16,618
it are you not a fan of it and will we

2797
01:47:14,698 --> 01:47:19,399
ever see any of it Blended in with some

2798
01:47:16,618 --> 01:47:19,399
of your lines

2799
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,539
um sure I'm I love cannabis I'm a big

2800
01:47:22,979 --> 01:47:25,559
pothead I mean I probably smoke four

2801
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:29,760
joints but we've been sitting here

2802
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:32,039
talking but I I love pot I mean the

2803
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,420
my complaints about the pot that has

2804
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:35,039
been floating around prior to me

2805
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:38,100
starting AG is that it's all very

2806
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,479
similar and I think that is you know it

2807
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:41,880
doesn't it's not good for the community

2808
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:43,799
to the degree in which there's a lot

2809
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,300
more diversity in the genetics that I've

2810
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:48,539
experienced that we're seeing in the

2811
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:50,340
marketplace so I'm trying to affect that

2812
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:52,859
um

2813
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:55,920
it's just that in a way

2814
01:47:52,859 --> 01:47:58,618
I don't think the high is as good as it

2815
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:01,139
could be in on many levels I mean I

2816
01:47:58,618 --> 01:48:02,519
unfortunately think that

2817
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:03,840
you know unless you grow your own

2818
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,940
cannabis you you kind of don't

2819
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,980
understand what I'm saying but there's

2820
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:10,500
so much that happens negatively to

2821
01:48:07,979 --> 01:48:13,259
cannabis in post-harvest it's really

2822
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:14,698
handling that ruins Paul's pot and when

2823
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,840
people get it and they don't dry it

2824
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:18,359
correctly and they lose some of those

2825
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:20,639
terpenes in a Flash cure or a flash dry

2826
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:22,500
and they bottle it up or it was too

2827
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:25,020
moist and it kind of gets that funky

2828
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:27,840
little smell that doesn't go away

2829
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:30,300
um if it's not handle property properly

2830
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:33,239
the variety itself isn't going to matter

2831
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:36,659
and and and I've joked with people that

2832
01:48:33,238 --> 01:48:38,698
I can go pick hemp and cure it and dry

2833
01:48:36,658 --> 01:48:40,979
it properly and it'll smoke and taste

2834
01:48:38,698 --> 01:48:43,678
and smell better than some of the stuff

2835
01:48:40,979 --> 01:48:46,618
I get from commercial Farms just because

2836
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:49,319
if you put the time into retaining the

2837
01:48:46,618 --> 01:48:52,559
terpenes and the oil content and doing

2838
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:53,698
that slow dry and slow cure because a

2839
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,340
lot of people don't understand well even

2840
01:48:53,698 --> 01:48:59,279
what's a cure well the flour is covered

2841
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:01,440
with oil and think of it like varnish on

2842
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:02,759
a piece of wood if you put varnish fish

2843
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,979
on a piece of wood and you leave the

2844
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:07,139
piece of wood in the Sun the the wood

2845
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:10,259
soaks up the varnish and there's no

2846
01:49:07,139 --> 01:49:12,719
protective layer and if it rains on it

2847
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,520
it kind of doesn't really uh repel it

2848
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:15,779
but if you take that same varnished

2849
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,960
piece of wood and you put it in the

2850
01:49:15,779 --> 01:49:21,779
shade and that that coat of oil doesn't

2851
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,399
soak in but it thickens it then becomes

2852
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:25,219
a protectant to the wood and you can

2853
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:28,319
pour water on it and it just runs off

2854
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:31,139
that happens on a microscopic level on

2855
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:33,960
cannabis flowers and when people allow

2856
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:37,560
that that thin covering of oil residue

2857
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:40,139
to that waxiness to harden up it

2858
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:42,420
protects the humidity that that's left

2859
01:49:40,139 --> 01:49:45,659
should be less than 10 percent but then

2860
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:48,539
the bud has body it has flavor it has

2861
01:49:45,658 --> 01:49:52,259
terpenes present and it's a really good

2862
01:49:48,539 --> 01:49:55,260
smoke and I'm you know I'm I like fresh

2863
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:57,840
pot I like smoking weed a week after I

2864
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:59,400
cut it down and I can barely get it to

2865
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:02,279
burn but it burns perfect because

2866
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:05,099
there's so much oil content but then I

2867
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:07,079
also like pot that I've let sit in the

2868
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:09,539
freaking you know can a troll for eight

2869
01:50:07,079 --> 01:50:11,519
months or whatever like like literally I

2870
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:13,439
have a lot of old weed I have our chaos

2871
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:15,480
from last year I smoked some of it

2872
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:18,419
earlier today and I still like it but

2873
01:50:15,479 --> 01:50:20,759
it's a year it's September last year so

2874
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:23,940
now it's a year and a month old

2875
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:26,100
um so but I don't sell it so I end up

2876
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:28,019
with bags of weed you know and then they

2877
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:30,119
turn brown after they oxidize because

2878
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:32,820
the lights cut to them and you know and

2879
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:34,799
it's freaking hilarious but if if you

2880
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:37,439
cure it well and those oils are still

2881
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:41,400
present the quality of it lasts a lot

2882
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:43,678
longer so you know a lot of how you're

2883
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:45,359
going to feel cannabis is is determined

2884
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,520
by how well it was handled and how well

2885
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,500
it was cured before it got to your plate

2886
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:52,320
and um

2887
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:54,658
yeah so I think if everybody if you had

2888
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:56,819
every clone that all these people were

2889
01:50:54,658 --> 01:50:58,859
growing all the new stuff I bet you'd

2890
01:50:56,819 --> 01:51:00,479
grow great weed with it I bet you grow

2891
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:02,399
it and you might leave it a little

2892
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,939
longer you might bring it into late

2893
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:07,738
stage you might let the little you know

2894
01:51:04,939 --> 01:51:10,138
little pistols wither away and turn into

2895
01:51:07,738 --> 01:51:11,698
little resin Globs like you might treat

2896
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:13,500
it a little differently than the grower

2897
01:51:11,698 --> 01:51:15,359
that you got it from and you might like

2898
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,859
it a little you might on the other side

2899
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:18,779
you might Harvest it a little early

2900
01:51:16,859 --> 01:51:22,139
might like like the high a little

2901
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:23,759
lighter and and that dial a high is

2902
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:25,739
something a lot of people don't realize

2903
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:28,139
either because like if you harvest early

2904
01:51:25,738 --> 01:51:31,319
you get a different Sensation from the

2905
01:51:28,139 --> 01:51:34,020
smoke if you harvest it late stage and

2906
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:36,840
you know you can I you know take things

2907
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:40,080
like Haze and let it go really late

2908
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:42,719
stage and it's really trippy man and you

2909
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:46,019
could take like afghanis and harvest

2910
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:48,840
them early like week six week seven and

2911
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:50,699
they're not heavy body highs they're

2912
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:54,179
really almost kind hazy where they're

2913
01:51:50,698 --> 01:51:56,219
like light and trippy so trying to teach

2914
01:51:54,179 --> 01:51:58,199
people that there's so much more than

2915
01:51:56,219 --> 01:52:00,600
one-dimensional cannabis it's been kind

2916
01:51:58,198 --> 01:52:02,460
of tough because a lot of people don't

2917
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:03,360
they just don't see the Spectrum you

2918
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:05,819
know like you were saying they think

2919
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:08,460
there's one there's one rks there was

2920
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:10,439
one skunk and it's like no man it was a

2921
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:12,779
body of plants it was like I don't even

2922
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:14,399
know what region but but when I talked

2923
01:52:12,779 --> 01:52:16,559
to Rob Clark and I talked to Skunk Man

2924
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:19,379
Sam you know Skunk Man Sam has gone

2925
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:21,300
through Afghanistan and collected seeds

2926
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:22,560
I believe them I don't know many other

2927
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:25,500
people that have been there and done

2928
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,119
that so and he has the genetics so what

2929
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:31,139
the [ __ ] you know take his experience

2930
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:33,000
and you know it's what it is but when

2931
01:52:31,139 --> 01:52:34,800
all those Afghans started coming over it

2932
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,560
was this region that produced these

2933
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:39,480
these plants that were like that and

2934
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:41,039
I think that a lot of people are going

2935
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:43,138
to find them again you know I think that

2936
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:44,939
if you know if ever this world goes to

2937
01:52:43,139 --> 01:52:47,760
peace and stuff maybe

2938
01:52:44,939 --> 01:52:50,819
we would find a lot of these absolutely

2939
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:54,239
amazing Hindu Kush Indian varieties

2940
01:52:50,819 --> 01:52:56,460
Chinese varieties Afghan Pakistan I mean

2941
01:52:54,238 --> 01:52:58,678
these these this is the birthplace of

2942
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:00,480
cannabis people this is where we need to

2943
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:05,399
go back and start looking around I mean

2944
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:07,259
the Himalayas Nepal I mean I every time

2945
01:53:05,399 --> 01:53:09,000
I I see people that are in foreign

2946
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:11,159
countries like this and they contact me

2947
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,800
for seeds I'm like no no no you should

2948
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:16,019
be going out and collecting seeds and

2949
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:17,639
geographically collecting those so you

2950
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:19,560
know where they came from what region

2951
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:21,239
y'all got to give people up but make

2952
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:23,159
them available bring them out of the

2953
01:53:21,238 --> 01:53:25,379
bring them to Market you know because

2954
01:53:23,158 --> 01:53:27,899
that's what we need to have happen again

2955
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:30,300
you know I would love to be able to buy

2956
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:33,719
seeds from Thailand tomorrow on Amazon

2957
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:36,360
and then actually come from Thailand you

2958
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:40,079
know or some seeds from Colombia or some

2959
01:53:36,359 --> 01:53:41,099
from Michoacan or Acapulco I please you

2960
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:43,859
know

2961
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:46,199
it'd be great I would be thrilled that

2962
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:48,198
the only sad part is that I think

2963
01:53:46,198 --> 01:53:50,759
there's been a lot of you know

2964
01:53:48,198 --> 01:53:52,439
European seed Merchant influence in

2965
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:54,780
almost all the Cannabis producing

2966
01:53:52,439 --> 01:53:57,238
regions around the world and

2967
01:53:54,779 --> 01:53:59,939
unfortunately almost all of it has been

2968
01:53:57,238 --> 01:54:03,259
contaminated with uh

2969
01:53:59,939 --> 01:54:06,658
good intention genetics

2970
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:08,760
so when we move on to our final

2971
01:54:06,658 --> 01:54:10,799
questions we have a few fan submitted

2972
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:13,619
questions that I think are interesting

2973
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,600
and the first one is how far do you plan

2974
01:54:13,618 --> 01:54:17,460
on taking the Northern Lights lines like

2975
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:20,340
do you see yourself going to like an F5

2976
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:22,859
and F6 sort of thing and as a follow-up

2977
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:25,860
would you ever release the famous

2978
01:54:22,859 --> 01:54:28,198
northern light as an S1 I think maybe

2979
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:29,759
they're referring to purest Indica the

2980
01:54:28,198 --> 01:54:31,079
purest Indica

2981
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,760
um you know what's funny is Greg told me

2982
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:35,639
that he didn't send purest Indica in the

2983
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:37,500
Neville and uh I get it and um

2984
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:39,900
I'm going to release it because it's

2985
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:42,000
Greg's wishes and I feel like I'm just

2986
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:43,500
like you know I was on the phone with

2987
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,899
Craig earlier today you know whatever

2988
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:47,520
you want me to do is fine you know I

2989
01:54:45,899 --> 01:54:49,439
feel like I'm more of a conduit than I

2990
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,960
am you know the the

2991
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:53,819
you know I'm trusted and I'm lucky I I

2992
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:55,260
I'm grateful that these people like me

2993
01:54:53,819 --> 01:54:56,759
and I'm grateful that they've entrusted

2994
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:58,739
me with the genetics I don't know

2995
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:00,719
another way to put it I am going to

2996
01:54:58,738 --> 01:55:03,238
release pierced Indica like I released

2997
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:05,039
you know instead of just hybrids I kind

2998
01:55:03,238 --> 01:55:07,319
of wanted people to have the ability to

2999
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:09,600
have these things isolated

3000
01:55:07,319 --> 01:55:11,639
um and as an F2 is the only way I can do

3001
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:14,039
it realistically other than S1 in them

3002
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:16,739
and S1 in them kind of takes away the

3003
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:18,600
mailid ability of people to breed and

3004
01:55:16,738 --> 01:55:20,218
I'm I'm really not trying to stifle

3005
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:22,739
other people's ability to work with

3006
01:55:20,219 --> 01:55:27,179
these genetics I'm trying to enable it

3007
01:55:22,738 --> 01:55:29,158
and um I do you know something that gets

3008
01:55:27,179 --> 01:55:32,100
confused though is taking things F2 F3

3009
01:55:29,158 --> 01:55:34,559
F4 F5 does not necessarily make them

3010
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:36,719
better it does not necessarily make them

3011
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:40,500
more stable according to Rob and

3012
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:42,300
marijuana botany uh it creates more uh

3013
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:45,300
really uh

3014
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:47,760
uh more variation within the prodigies

3015
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:51,060
the further you get into this inbreeding

3016
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:54,119
so uh you're always you know cannabis is

3017
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:56,460
an obligant outcrosser just like humans

3018
01:55:54,118 --> 01:55:59,039
it doesn't want to be inbred with its

3019
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:01,020
family it wants to be outcrossed if you

3020
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:02,399
really want to make good things

3021
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:04,679
um I'm definitely going to make the

3022
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:07,198
genetics I have available to people as I

3023
01:56:04,679 --> 01:56:12,060
have been like you know F2 and the haze

3024
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:14,039
the skunk and um the NL but I've been

3025
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:15,659
selling hybrids of my own since I

3026
01:56:14,039 --> 01:56:17,819
started they were the first things I

3027
01:56:15,658 --> 01:56:20,158
started selling for the where the

3028
01:56:17,819 --> 01:56:22,380
crosses with on Haze and I'm going to

3029
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:25,198
continue to be making you know I'm just

3030
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:27,779
so into it like I'm going to constantly

3031
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:30,539
release the genetics because you know

3032
01:56:27,779 --> 01:56:32,279
you only live so long and you know I'd

3033
01:56:30,539 --> 01:56:34,198
like to you know leave as big of a mark

3034
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:35,639
on the planet as I can in a positive way

3035
01:56:34,198 --> 01:56:38,579
before I check out which I will

3036
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:40,500
inevitably do at some point so you know

3037
01:56:38,579 --> 01:56:43,198
trying to get it out there is cool and

3038
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:46,020
you know as long as I'm improving what

3039
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:48,118
I'm doing I'm gonna keep doing it but

3040
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:50,520
like trying to you know these people

3041
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:52,139
that are like oh F 99 or whatever it's

3042
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:55,139
like cut out with the [ __ ] really

3043
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:57,000
you know I mean I'm happy with the

3044
01:56:55,139 --> 01:56:59,760
really good F1 inconsistency and

3045
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,039
uniformity like you know head over heels

3046
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:04,079
for the serious seeds offerings that

3047
01:57:02,039 --> 01:57:06,899
Simon puts out because they're true f1s

3048
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:09,479
and uh and he'll always put out awesome

3049
01:57:06,899 --> 01:57:11,279
weed because they're true f1s and uh and

3050
01:57:09,479 --> 01:57:14,459
I'll make I'll always be making F ones

3051
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:16,979
and S ones and when it's appropriate

3052
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:20,340
like it is right now I'll be making f2s

3053
01:57:16,979 --> 01:57:23,098
but I don't see myself

3054
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:25,440
you know I don't know you know once

3055
01:57:23,099 --> 01:57:27,659
you've once you have I I'll make

3056
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,579
original hay seeds again when I run low

3057
01:57:27,658 --> 01:57:31,618
on the amount I've already made if that

3058
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:34,139
makes sense but there's no need for me

3059
01:57:31,618 --> 01:57:36,238
to to replicate it now while I still

3060
01:57:34,139 --> 01:57:38,340
have pretty good quantity of original AC

3061
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:41,158
it's for 2019

3062
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:43,860
um but I will in the future I mean I you

3063
01:57:41,158 --> 01:57:46,738
know I have dreams of of

3064
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:48,899
you know I've you know I want all the

3065
01:57:46,738 --> 01:57:51,658
plants all the plants I'm a gardener you

3066
01:57:48,899 --> 01:57:53,460
know I I you know people like how can

3067
01:57:51,658 --> 01:57:57,000
you have 4 000 plants and what else and

3068
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:58,618
I'm like so easy like I was partying all

3069
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,899
the time too if I had actually been

3070
01:57:58,618 --> 01:58:03,359
focused I would have had 40 000 flights

3071
01:58:00,899 --> 01:58:05,098
in that [ __ ] place I it's just you

3072
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:06,479
just you want all the phenotypes you

3073
01:58:05,099 --> 01:58:08,520
want to go through all of them you want

3074
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:11,339
to try all of them you know and what's

3075
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:14,280
funny is I would have thrown 90 of those

3076
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:16,319
plants away and only taken the 10 that I

3077
01:58:14,279 --> 01:58:18,840
really liked if I had left to my own

3078
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:21,118
devices and allowed to continue on what

3079
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:22,739
I was doing and now it's the same way I

3080
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:25,920
go through [ __ ] tons of plants I throw

3081
01:58:22,738 --> 01:58:28,138
[ __ ] tons of plants away though like you

3082
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,899
know I won't replicate anything that I

3083
01:58:28,139 --> 01:58:34,500
don't fall in love with you know so if

3084
01:58:30,899 --> 01:58:37,259
it and testing to me is not as important

3085
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:39,960
as falling in love with it if

3086
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:41,820
if it doesn't you know if it doesn't

3087
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:43,439
appeal to the human I really don't care

3088
01:58:41,819 --> 01:58:45,719
if it appeals to the machine

3089
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:47,698
you know I'm not doing this to have fast

3090
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:50,039
quarter mile times or the highest THC

3091
01:58:47,698 --> 01:58:53,279
levels you know I I think a lot of

3092
01:58:50,039 --> 01:58:55,920
that's missing the point entirely

3093
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:57,599
yeah no very comprehensive I like that

3094
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,520
and it sort of segues nicely into the

3095
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:01,860
next question which is if you had to

3096
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,780
give a generalized answer where would

3097
01:59:01,859 --> 01:59:05,399
you like to see the future of breeding

3098
01:59:03,779 --> 01:59:07,738
going

3099
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:10,920
quality over quantity

3100
01:59:07,738 --> 01:59:13,618
you know that's my goal I mean I'm

3101
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:15,899
I I think that we're gonna see the

3102
01:59:13,618 --> 01:59:18,238
bottleneck kind of come off and we're

3103
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:21,299
going to see cannabis varieties you know

3104
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:24,359
from all weeks of its potential uh start

3105
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:25,679
to surface as time goes on and more and

3106
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:28,500
more and more people are going to

3107
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:30,779
realize that you know there's a lot more

3108
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:32,760
you know it's cannabis than just you

3109
01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:35,639
know quick thick buds that are full of

3110
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:37,980
resin you know there's nuances to these

3111
01:59:35,639 --> 01:59:40,920
terpenes and these you know subtle

3112
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:42,959
cannabinoid combinations that are

3113
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:44,940
amazing I mean Mel Frank told me one of

3114
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:47,340
his favorite varieties that he grew and

3115
01:59:44,939 --> 01:59:50,098
he smoked he got tested and he came back

3116
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:51,719
at like sub nine percent THC and he was

3117
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:55,440
like

3118
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:57,000
didn't expect that you know but the way

3119
01:59:55,439 --> 02:00:00,419
it smelled the way it tasted the way it

3120
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,118
made him feel felt great and

3121
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:04,739
you know that's that you know if that

3122
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:06,719
makes sense you know what I mean like

3123
02:00:04,738 --> 02:00:08,638
really I guess it isn't just THC at the

3124
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:11,460
end of the conversation that matters

3125
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,659
it's did you enjoy it and if you didn't

3126
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:14,158
enjoy you're probably not going to smoke

3127
02:00:12,658 --> 02:00:15,658
any more of it but if you did enjoy it

3128
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:17,339
you'd probably be quick to roll up

3129
02:00:15,658 --> 02:00:20,879
another you know second or third joint

3130
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:24,179
do a second or third dab you know

3131
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:26,400
yeah he hear quality over quantity for

3132
02:00:24,179 --> 02:00:28,679
sure final fan submitted question we

3133
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:30,839
have is how did you develop your cloning

3134
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:32,399
Tech with the domes and the fluorescent

3135
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,079
lighting or did you get that from

3136
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:37,679
someone else

3137
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:40,618
I was all Tech I mean um so I don't use

3138
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:43,260
domes downstairs right now I have a a

3139
02:00:40,618 --> 02:00:46,319
humidity controlled room I I monitor my

3140
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:50,520
BPD levels I keep my mother room at

3141
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:56,359
around 72 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and I

3142
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:59,880
keep my humidity around 70 you know uh

3143
02:00:56,359 --> 02:01:02,158
and if you keep your humidity levels at

3144
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:04,800
high the plants don't wither

3145
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:07,019
um the domes are when I was living in La

3146
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,420
it's a lot more dry so if you were

3147
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:11,520
looking at that rack of uh shells that

3148
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:14,039
was from the the sake that was from

3149
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:16,020
select strains when I started my Nursery

3150
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:17,099
um that was one of the Clone racks for

3151
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:20,099
my Nursery

3152
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:21,900
um but Ellie's a really dry place so in

3153
02:01:20,099 --> 02:01:24,060
order to compensate for the dryness I

3154
02:01:21,899 --> 02:01:25,679
can't humidify the whole room and I had

3155
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:28,520
hardwood floors and you don't want to

3156
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:31,618
humidify a room with hardwood floors so

3157
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:32,699
so I just use domes and they work rather

3158
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:33,960
good

3159
02:01:32,698 --> 02:01:37,500
um

3160
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:39,118
cloning's easy I mean I've it my problem

3161
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:40,859
has been I've had too green of a thumb

3162
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:42,839
you know it's gotten me in trouble over

3163
02:01:40,859 --> 02:01:44,819
and over again I got out of prison in

3164
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:46,500
2004 and in between all the activism

3165
02:01:44,819 --> 02:01:51,359
that I explained I got prosecuted in

3166
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:53,639
2006 2009 uh and also 2013 through 2017

3167
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:57,359
uh for cultivating cannabis I was rated

3168
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:59,219
in 20 2006 2009 and 2012 and I wouldn't

3169
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:03,299
cooperate so

3170
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:03,899
I got prosecuted every single time and

3171
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:05,699
um

3172
02:02:03,899 --> 02:02:09,299
I think there's no other way to do it

3173
02:02:05,698 --> 02:02:10,919
actually but um it's been a pain and and

3174
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:13,020
this is why kind of now I'm kind of

3175
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:16,260
doing what I'm doing because I'm able to

3176
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:17,940
kind of grow on a small scale and it is

3177
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:21,420
all about quality it's not about

3178
02:02:17,939 --> 02:02:22,738
quantity and it's you know I kind of

3179
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:25,739
feel like I'm doing a service for the

3180
02:02:22,738 --> 02:02:30,059
community it sounds weird but it's true

3181
02:02:25,738 --> 02:02:32,399
no I I don't have I don't know

3182
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:34,260
I'm already happy I'm already where I

3183
02:02:32,399 --> 02:02:36,899
want to live I'm already you know doing

3184
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:38,579
what I want to do so like I said my life

3185
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:40,319
hasn't changed much in the time I've

3186
02:02:38,579 --> 02:02:43,019
started the seed company

3187
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:45,179
you know in many cases I'm using the

3188
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:48,300
same table same equipment I was using

3189
02:02:45,179 --> 02:02:50,279
before I had the seed company so you

3190
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:51,960
know I'll just continue this I mean I

3191
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:53,759
could see in the future trying to sell

3192
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:56,939
authentic genetics to a bigger company

3193
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:59,460
so that I could you know get like my own

3194
02:02:56,939 --> 02:03:01,678
Winery and and have my own crew and have

3195
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:04,139
greenhouses and be able to on a much

3196
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:06,719
larger scale be able to breed that would

3197
02:03:04,139 --> 02:03:09,659
be my dream and be able to then sell the

3198
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:11,579
you know the plants the seeds that I

3199
02:03:09,658 --> 02:03:14,158
make through my you know sold company

3200
02:03:11,579 --> 02:03:16,198
because you know there's a part of me

3201
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:18,179
that doesn't want to be a secretary it

3202
02:03:16,198 --> 02:03:20,039
doesn't enjoy the business side of it as

3203
02:03:18,179 --> 02:03:21,658
much as I just enjoy growing that's

3204
02:03:20,039 --> 02:03:24,238
where my heart is that's where my

3205
02:03:21,658 --> 02:03:26,879
passion is I like writing I like

3206
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:28,738
creating content educating you know

3207
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:30,719
sitting there you know sending invoices

3208
02:03:28,738 --> 02:03:33,899
and packing seeds is

3209
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:35,520
rather a burden but I'm grateful for it

3210
02:03:33,899 --> 02:03:37,979
but it's

3211
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:40,380
not exactly what I wanted to be when I

3212
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:42,598
grew up you know but

3213
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:43,940
it's cool I'm dealing with it for the

3214
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:47,219
time being

3215
02:03:43,939 --> 02:03:50,399
my eyes hurt from doing emails but it's

3216
02:03:47,219 --> 02:03:52,020
cool now I can understand yeah you're a

3217
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:53,819
man who wants to be among the clients

3218
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:56,280
not the computer screens I feel for you

3219
02:03:53,819 --> 02:03:58,319
so with that we're on to our final five

3220
02:03:56,279 --> 02:03:59,759
quick questions before we wrap this one

3221
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:02,219
up we'd love to ask everyone these

3222
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:05,099
questions so the first one is what's the

3223
02:04:02,219 --> 02:04:07,139
single most memorable experience with

3224
02:04:05,099 --> 02:04:09,179
cannabis you've ever had

3225
02:04:07,139 --> 02:04:11,819
I'm probably getting my mom that first

3226
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:14,520
time in the car because it was so what

3227
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:17,099
the [ __ ] you know this is like I just

3228
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:19,619
they never I never I never felt that way

3229
02:04:17,099 --> 02:04:21,480
before Giddy and hungry and like

3230
02:04:19,618 --> 02:04:24,118
everything was funny and I didn't have

3231
02:04:21,479 --> 02:04:25,799
any pain I wasn't nauseous and you know

3232
02:04:24,118 --> 02:04:28,079
when you're going through cancer

3233
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:30,179
you're feeling pretty low you know like

3234
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:32,579
you're depressed you're you physically

3235
02:04:30,179 --> 02:04:35,158
ache you're you're mentally strained

3236
02:04:32,579 --> 02:04:36,658
you're worried you're anxious and to be

3237
02:04:35,158 --> 02:04:39,359
able to get high

3238
02:04:36,658 --> 02:04:41,939
you Cannon I can't underestimate that I

3239
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:44,098
was just was a huge difference you know

3240
02:04:41,939 --> 02:04:45,960
and uh that's probably why I became such

3241
02:04:44,099 --> 02:04:47,460
a passionate Advocate and activist

3242
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:51,599
because

3243
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:53,760
it made a really deep impact on my life

3244
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:56,400
and my health and my well-being and I

3245
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,560
feel grateful to it because of it

3246
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:01,019
yeah powerful

3247
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:03,360
so on the other end of the spectrum was

3248
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:05,639
there ever a time when maybe all your

3249
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:07,139
peers or your friends are really hyping

3250
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:09,000
something up and you're getting really

3251
02:05:07,139 --> 02:05:12,618
excited for it and then you finally try

3252
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:16,279
and you're like this is it

3253
02:05:12,618 --> 02:05:16,279
what is runs

3254
02:05:17,658 --> 02:05:23,399
no that's cute but you know Skittles was

3255
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:25,800
one of those two you know I'm old so

3256
02:05:23,399 --> 02:05:27,899
when I first got handed a skittles but I

3257
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:31,500
was like guys I smell skunk one and

3258
02:05:27,899 --> 02:05:33,299
they're like Skittles I'm like one it's

3259
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:35,099
you know because I don't know some of

3260
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,420
the because I've had the ability to work

3261
02:05:35,099 --> 02:05:38,219
with some of these old genetics and

3262
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,079
their piriform I kind of can smell them

3263
02:05:38,219 --> 02:05:41,340
I could see the primary colors if that

3264
02:05:40,079 --> 02:05:44,039
makes sense I could smell the primary

3265
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:46,920
colors coming through so yeah you can't

3266
02:05:44,039 --> 02:05:48,840
really hide it and um

3267
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:50,219
it's happened more than once you know a

3268
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:53,219
lot of the stuff that's come out in the

3269
02:05:50,219 --> 02:05:55,079
last you know cookies please you know

3270
02:05:53,219 --> 02:05:56,658
like a lot of the stuff that's come out

3271
02:05:55,079 --> 02:05:59,698
has been like

3272
02:05:56,658 --> 02:06:01,379
it's okay you know I mean I like cookies

3273
02:05:59,698 --> 02:06:04,979
I'll smoke cookies sometimes it's really

3274
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:06,840
good uh sometimes not so great uh Jack

3275
02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:08,519
Harris same thing you know I used to

3276
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:10,739
love Jack Herer when we first got it

3277
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:12,840
from Scentsy sense of seeds when it was

3278
02:06:10,738 --> 02:06:15,479
really hazy but then they changed it in

3279
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:18,360
1996 it crossed it with the skunk kind

3280
02:06:15,479 --> 02:06:19,500
of imitated the SSH

3281
02:06:18,359 --> 02:06:21,658
um

3282
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:23,698
it was their version of SSH it was

3283
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:25,799
called Jack Flash and it was a heavier

3284
02:06:23,698 --> 02:06:28,198
version that came out around 1996 from

3285
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:30,840
Scentsy seeds and they kind of replaced

3286
02:06:28,198 --> 02:06:34,379
Jack hero with Jack Flash and a lot of

3287
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:36,779
the Jack Hera that we now refer to 1997

3288
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:39,060
on what is really Jack Flash and it's

3289
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:42,359
really like a super silver hage-ish

3290
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:44,699
because it's really a haze a cross with

3291
02:06:42,359 --> 02:06:46,319
skunk which is what super silver haze

3292
02:06:44,698 --> 02:06:49,439
was it was Neville's head across the

3293
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:52,259
skull so it was a similar recipe done a

3294
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:52,879
little differently with similar plants

3295
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:54,539
um

3296
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:56,039
but

3297
02:06:54,539 --> 02:06:57,300
and it's funny because I like the

3298
02:06:56,039 --> 02:06:58,560
original Jack Curry and I like the

3299
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:00,239
original Neville say it's more than I

3300
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:03,599
like the super silver A's or the Jack

3301
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:05,698
Flash but Jack Frost xj39 a lot of these

3302
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:07,319
Jack crosses that we see now are not

3303
02:07:05,698 --> 02:07:11,098
very hazy

3304
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:13,198
um but I don't you know Jack his kids

3305
02:07:11,099 --> 02:07:17,159
are using the name and they're trying to

3306
02:07:13,198 --> 02:07:20,698
create a brand and I'm not trying to

3307
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:23,579
exploit an old friend and I you know I I

3308
02:07:20,698 --> 02:07:24,960
I have Haze so I can make really hazy

3309
02:07:23,579 --> 02:07:26,880
stuff and one thing people talk about

3310
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,618
Jack Cara really they're smelling a

3311
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:30,840
little bit of haze but I have the whole

3312
02:07:28,618 --> 02:07:33,658
pie so I can make stuff that's way

3313
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:36,319
hazier than the Jack Herer hazy hybrids

3314
02:07:33,658 --> 02:07:39,059
that are floating around right now so

3315
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:40,319
uh it's like different if that makes

3316
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:42,539
sense so

3317
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:45,059
I'm definitely going to be bringing way

3318
02:07:42,539 --> 02:07:47,460
more Haze hybrids back in the years to

3319
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:49,080
come because it's my fancy and my

3320
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:51,658
fascination

3321
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:53,939
and because I have the genetics yeah

3322
02:07:51,658 --> 02:07:55,920
exciting to see that happen

3323
02:07:53,939 --> 02:07:57,479
so if you could only pick one for the

3324
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:00,179
rest of your life what would you pick

3325
02:07:57,479 --> 02:08:02,279
indoor or outdoor

3326
02:08:00,179 --> 02:08:04,199
I'm indoor all day I don't like birds

3327
02:08:02,279 --> 02:08:06,300
[ __ ] on my flowers I don't think

3328
02:08:04,198 --> 02:08:07,799
that's very sanitary and the problem

3329
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:09,139
with growing Outdoors is that you're

3330
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:11,760
you're

3331
02:08:09,139 --> 02:08:13,739
susceptible to Mother Nature she you

3332
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:16,860
know she gives you can work so hard and

3333
02:08:13,738 --> 02:08:19,019
so true and so valiantly and she just

3334
02:08:16,859 --> 02:08:22,319
comes along and has it really damp you

3335
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:25,020
know August or a really dry one or you

3336
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:27,719
know [ __ ] fires and that you get fall

3337
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:29,880
out and you know or some Kid Next Door

3338
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:31,980
is freaking playing with some seeds and

3339
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:34,800
he pops some nails and next thing you

3340
02:08:31,979 --> 02:08:36,839
knew you've got fertilized flowers that

3341
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:39,179
you didn't expect to have because pollen

3342
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:41,760
travels really easily so I think there's

3343
02:08:39,179 --> 02:08:45,000
a lot of drawbacks to outdoor I think

3344
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:47,099
outdoor will mostly be used for extracts

3345
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,139
um because it can be cleaned up I think

3346
02:08:47,099 --> 02:08:50,819
that small batch outdoor can be freaking

3347
02:08:49,139 --> 02:08:53,039
awesome because there's nothing like the

3348
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:55,500
Sun but my favorite is mixed light

3349
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:58,618
indoor greenhouse because my Greenhouse

3350
02:08:55,500 --> 02:09:02,340
also has led supplementation and I have

3351
02:08:58,618 --> 02:09:05,339
you know VPD control and Heat and the

3352
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:07,679
ability to cool it off and it's you know

3353
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:09,539
I'm Mother Nature at that point if the

3354
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:12,000
environment [ __ ] up it's my fault not

3355
02:09:09,539 --> 02:09:15,420
hers I'm just you know surfing the wave

3356
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:18,599
as she gives it to me on hot days or dry

3357
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:20,520
days or rainy days I just readjust the

3358
02:09:18,599 --> 02:09:22,860
equalizer that's my greenhouse and try

3359
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:26,340
to stay in my perimeters and keep my

3360
02:09:22,859 --> 02:09:29,279
plants happy and I like that I prefer to

3361
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:31,440
have a roof over my plant's head and I I

3362
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:33,300
like avoiding the winds and everything

3363
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:34,979
but I still grow indoors for practical

3364
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:37,139
reasons because

3365
02:09:34,979 --> 02:09:38,339
I got to keep Mother plants and I got to

3366
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:42,239
keep clones and you're not going to do

3367
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:44,520
that in the sunshine and I also

3368
02:09:42,238 --> 02:09:46,439
um I like indoor flowers I think they're

3369
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:48,599
great and it gives me an ability to kind

3370
02:09:46,439 --> 02:09:52,138
of see the expressions of the phenotypes

3371
02:09:48,599 --> 02:09:54,719
in a controlled environment uh where

3372
02:09:52,139 --> 02:09:56,400
everything's equal you know where when

3373
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,840
you're outside you know one can get a

3374
02:09:56,399 --> 02:09:59,879
little more sun or what could be in a

3375
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:01,739
little sweet spot but when it's indoors

3376
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:03,118
it's it's they're all sweet spots or

3377
02:10:01,738 --> 02:10:06,118
you're not setting up your environment

3378
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:09,238
correctly so for testing reasons I'll

3379
02:10:06,118 --> 02:10:11,579
always be an indoor grower you know for

3380
02:10:09,238 --> 02:10:13,618
you know Greenhouse I'll always have a

3381
02:10:11,579 --> 02:10:15,899
greenhouse too but I'll always yeah but

3382
02:10:13,618 --> 02:10:18,359
outdoor I don't I like putting plants

3383
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:20,460
Outdoors I've done it many times but I

3384
02:10:18,359 --> 02:10:22,319
don't know I feel like it's like rolling

3385
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:23,520
dice with mother nature maybe you'll get

3386
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:26,880
a good harvest

3387
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:28,980
but she's mad maybe about

3388
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:31,920
no I completely agree with you I

3389
02:10:28,979 --> 02:10:33,539
completely agree so I'm interested to

3390
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,639
know if I'm going to drop you off on a

3391
02:10:33,539 --> 02:10:37,439
desert island and you can only take

3392
02:10:35,639 --> 02:10:40,800
three strains with you for the rest of

3393
02:10:37,439 --> 02:10:43,738
your life what three are you gonna take

3394
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:45,960
I would be his for sure it would be now

3395
02:10:43,738 --> 02:10:49,439
Northern Lights probably

3396
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:51,719
oh I don't know nl2 or purest Indica

3397
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:53,698
would have to be one of those two that's

3398
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:55,618
really tough that would be tough maybe

3399
02:10:53,698 --> 02:10:58,678
the pure St Indica but then I wouldn't

3400
02:10:55,618 --> 02:11:00,319
have an Afghan to make the nl2

3401
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:03,960
um and then third

3402
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:05,399
Ah that's tough you know for the

3403
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:09,060
diversity of it it would be something

3404
02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:11,098
similar to to skunk one because I like

3405
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:12,599
the tropicalness of it and when I say

3406
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:16,560
skunk one

3407
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:19,920
I I like the sweet version of of skunk

3408
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:23,760
one as well as the acrid version I found

3409
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:27,359
in the Mel Franks old seeds uh so I kind

3410
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:31,260
of I like the fruity tropical varieties

3411
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:35,279
um and and if I had Haze skunk one even

3412
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:37,739
the the sweet skunk one and

3413
02:11:35,279 --> 02:11:39,779
uh either the purest indicator or the

3414
02:11:37,738 --> 02:11:41,638
nl2 I'd be pretty happy because at that

3415
02:11:39,779 --> 02:11:44,219
point I would have the gassy I would

3416
02:11:41,639 --> 02:11:46,920
have the fruity and I have the spicy and

3417
02:11:44,219 --> 02:11:48,239
I would be thrilled I guess and then I

3418
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:49,319
could make all sorts of great [ __ ]

3419
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:51,419
because

3420
02:11:49,319 --> 02:11:53,399
and I need a few more lifetimes on the

3421
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:54,739
island just because of all the Hybrids

3422
02:11:53,399 --> 02:11:57,839
I'd want to make

3423
02:11:54,738 --> 02:11:59,698
you know and then time to test them of

3424
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:02,639
course and then time to make cash with

3425
02:11:59,698 --> 02:12:05,339
them covering all the bases I like it I

3426
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:07,859
like it on to our final question one I'd

3427
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:10,199
love to ask everyone if you could get in

3428
02:12:07,859 --> 02:12:13,198
a time machine and go back in time

3429
02:12:10,198 --> 02:12:15,299
anywhere you wanted any time presumably

3430
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,460
to collect either seeds or a cutting

3431
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:19,139
where would you go and what would you be

3432
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:21,060
collecting

3433
02:12:19,139 --> 02:12:22,319
that's heavy man

3434
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:24,840
um

3435
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:27,299
That's Heavy I came home from Amsterdam

3436
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:29,159
with over 50 000 seats and

3437
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:31,679
they were stolen from me when I got

3438
02:12:29,158 --> 02:12:33,839
raided and

3439
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:35,639
I don't know that's tough because I had

3440
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:37,380
such a diversity in genetics at that

3441
02:12:35,639 --> 02:12:40,319
point I wish I could have my old seeds

3442
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:43,679
because I it sounds really weird to say

3443
02:12:40,319 --> 02:12:46,500
but I admit I it hurt to lose them it

3444
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:48,239
took me up to that point a lifetime of

3445
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:49,738
collecting so and then they took them

3446
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:52,678
all and I just

3447
02:12:49,738 --> 02:12:54,479
uh that hurt and uh I don't know like

3448
02:12:52,679 --> 02:12:56,578
that I could still see him in front of

3449
02:12:54,479 --> 02:12:58,859
me I just I don't know

3450
02:12:56,578 --> 02:13:01,019
that's partly why people listening you

3451
02:12:58,859 --> 02:13:03,118
know partly how I got the the deal from

3452
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:06,239
Peter is uh

3453
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:08,819
he offered me 10 grand and he offered me

3454
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:10,500
uh that skunk Nancy I'm calling me right

3455
02:13:08,819 --> 02:13:12,479
now actually

3456
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:15,118
um they he

3457
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:17,939
he offered me 10 grand and eight percent

3458
02:13:15,118 --> 02:13:21,539
of my book and I turned him down and

3459
02:13:17,939 --> 02:13:26,178
then I had mailed back some seeds and

3460
02:13:21,539 --> 02:13:29,039
when I mailed them back uh

3461
02:13:26,179 --> 02:13:31,260
he was there with me when I opened the

3462
02:13:29,039 --> 02:13:32,819
packages the boxes he had boxes too I

3463
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:34,980
sent him goodies as well

3464
02:13:32,819 --> 02:13:38,399
so I'm sure the statue of limitations as

3465
02:13:34,979 --> 02:13:40,799
long as long up but uh but I started

3466
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:43,078
pulling seeds out instead of hash and

3467
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:45,960
grass which is what he wanted I started

3468
02:13:43,078 --> 02:13:50,460
pulling seeds out packages of 1 000 all

3469
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:53,158
neatly marked with the varieties and he

3470
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:56,880
was shocked you know and when he grabbed

3471
02:13:53,158 --> 02:13:58,500
a bag of seeds he was like how much is a

3472
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:00,060
seed worth and I was like I don't know

3473
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:01,859
five bucks 10 bucks

3474
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:06,480
and he's like this little bag he's worth

3475
02:14:01,859 --> 02:14:08,819
10 grand and I was like yeah and there

3476
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:11,339
was like a pile and a half of there was

3477
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:13,799
a huge amount of in front of me and he

3478
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:18,239
was like how many seats are there I sent

3479
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:21,539
an excess of 50 000 and he said

3480
02:14:18,238 --> 02:14:22,439
no wonder you said no to my money and he

3481
02:14:21,539 --> 02:14:24,300
was like what are you gonna do with

3482
02:14:22,439 --> 02:14:26,098
those and I was like hopefully keep them

3483
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:28,139
you know but I want to start you know I

3484
02:14:26,099 --> 02:14:30,179
want to start a seed company and he said

3485
02:14:28,139 --> 02:14:31,739
no you have to keep them he's like you

3486
02:14:30,179 --> 02:14:35,039
have to grow them every one of them

3487
02:14:31,738 --> 02:14:37,618
they're important and I was just like oh

3488
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:39,479
my God and he was just like

3489
02:14:37,618 --> 02:14:41,399
would you take a quarter million would

3490
02:14:39,479 --> 02:14:42,899
that would that would like we I'll give

3491
02:14:41,399 --> 02:14:46,519
you a credit card too but like let's get

3492
02:14:42,899 --> 02:14:46,519
you started and I was just like

3493
02:14:46,979 --> 02:14:51,718
yeah and he literally turned to my

3494
02:14:49,859 --> 02:14:53,039
girlfriend and and he was like you still

3495
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:55,078
have the keys to my car because we had

3496
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:57,479
used this car and now I said and he said

3497
02:14:55,078 --> 02:14:58,679
yeah I said yeah she said yes and he

3498
02:14:57,479 --> 02:15:01,078
said let's bring them to the bank before

3499
02:14:58,679 --> 02:15:04,500
he changes his mind and he got up in a

3500
02:15:01,078 --> 02:15:06,238
robe with [ __ ] shower shoes little

3501
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:08,578
[ __ ] fuzzies because he was gay he

3502
02:15:06,238 --> 02:15:10,738
was hilarious and a bird running around

3503
02:15:08,578 --> 02:15:13,319
on his shoulders [ __ ] on his white

3504
02:15:10,738 --> 02:15:16,319
robe and he had us drive him down to the

3505
02:15:13,319 --> 02:15:18,779
Wells Fargo Bank in L.A and we walked in

3506
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:21,299
this dude's wearing a robe and got Bed

3507
02:15:18,779 --> 02:15:22,800
Head for days and we go in there and the

3508
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:25,380
manager runs up to him he's like Mr

3509
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:27,360
McWilliams how are you doing would you

3510
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:29,159
like some organic milk we have it in the

3511
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:31,618
fridge for you and he's like yeah sure

3512
02:15:29,158 --> 02:15:34,379
and if he whisks us out of the manager's

3513
02:15:31,618 --> 02:15:35,639
office and just it was that easy Peter's

3514
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:37,739
like I want to put a quarter million

3515
02:15:35,639 --> 02:15:39,480
dollars uh into his bank account he's

3516
02:15:37,738 --> 02:15:41,879
going to need a company card what else

3517
02:15:39,479 --> 02:15:44,339
do you need and I was like I can't think

3518
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:46,139
of much more now and he's like we'll get

3519
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:48,619
back to you if we need more stuff it was

3520
02:15:46,139 --> 02:15:52,139
like my life changed in a minute and I

3521
02:15:48,618 --> 02:15:54,359
and that's kind of how it happened I

3522
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:56,460
mean I immediately started looking for a

3523
02:15:54,359 --> 02:15:58,679
place to live I found the castle

3524
02:15:56,460 --> 02:16:01,139
which was utterly ridiculous but had a

3525
02:15:58,679 --> 02:16:04,578
lot of space I moved into it and I had a

3526
02:16:01,139 --> 02:16:08,099
[ __ ] I literally had a a

3527
02:16:04,578 --> 02:16:10,920
card with no limit I Peter was like

3528
02:16:08,099 --> 02:16:12,840
very encouraging he was very wealthy at

3529
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:14,699
the time and he was like he thought he

3530
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:16,260
he was dying I mean unfortunately he

3531
02:16:14,698 --> 02:16:20,279
died two and a half years after we met

3532
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:23,639
and um he just he was living like his

3533
02:16:20,279 --> 02:16:26,099
life was ending and uh and I had no

3534
02:16:23,639 --> 02:16:28,380
limit so I bought [ __ ] Diamond lights

3535
02:16:26,099 --> 02:16:31,380
and [ __ ] built the tables brought

3536
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:33,540
electricians in I [ __ ] everything was

3537
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:35,880
amazing man I put my ballast in my

3538
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:38,099
Elevator Shaft because I had this like

3539
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:39,959
70 foot Elevator Shaft that went from

3540
02:16:38,099 --> 02:16:42,120
the ground floor all the way up and I

3541
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:44,339
put massive fans in my attic and I

3542
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:47,219
pulled the air all the way through fresh

3543
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:50,639
air from my garage which was like a six

3544
02:16:47,218 --> 02:16:52,619
car garage I had 38 lights in one room

3545
02:16:50,638 --> 02:16:55,079
and I used to pull all the air through

3546
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:56,939
up into my Elevator Shaft up the

3547
02:16:55,079 --> 02:16:59,159
Elevator Shaft and threw out of the

3548
02:16:56,939 --> 02:17:00,659
house the place was incredible it was

3549
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:02,519
located directly across from something

3550
02:17:00,659 --> 02:17:04,619
called The Stone Canyon reservoir and it

3551
02:17:02,519 --> 02:17:06,960
created this little humid Zone in the

3552
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:09,359
canyon I lived in and I didn't even have

3553
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:13,138
to use domes when I made clones it was

3554
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:15,960
like perfect VPD all the time and I was

3555
02:17:13,138 --> 02:17:18,598
crazy like you could put any plant you

3556
02:17:15,959 --> 02:17:21,058
wanted outside and it loved it I had

3557
02:17:18,599 --> 02:17:23,760
plants going up my staircases all over

3558
02:17:21,058 --> 02:17:26,039
my patios in the courtyard I had them

3559
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:29,159
everywhere I took this Haze plant that

3560
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:31,559
was like I'd say almost 16 feet tall and

3561
02:17:29,159 --> 02:17:34,019
dragged it into my elevator with a

3562
02:17:31,558 --> 02:17:36,718
twisty fluorescent light bulb and the

3563
02:17:34,019 --> 02:17:38,880
plant was like half bent over so when

3564
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:42,358
you got in the elevator this Haze plant

3565
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:45,539
was like really big leaves but super

3566
02:17:42,359 --> 02:17:48,000
thin and like it was weird it was like a

3567
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:49,500
big bear hugging you that would be just

3568
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,840
stopped in the corner and the stem was

3569
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:53,459
like bent all the way all the way over

3570
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,139
at an angle and then I put a little

3571
02:17:53,459 --> 02:17:57,239
table in it where you could do suit like

3572
02:17:55,138 --> 02:17:59,938
single bong hits as you took elevator

3573
02:17:57,239 --> 02:18:02,280
rides it was a kid's fantasy it was

3574
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:04,979
really what it was I mean for a stoner

3575
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:08,579
psychedelic pot grower it was [ __ ]

3576
02:18:04,978 --> 02:18:10,379
great while it lasted you know and I

3577
02:18:08,579 --> 02:18:12,120
don't know I don't regret it it was it

3578
02:18:10,379 --> 02:18:14,638
was a lot of fun I

3579
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:16,859
I never planned for it to happen I I

3580
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:18,718
hope nobody listening thinks that I had

3581
02:18:16,859 --> 02:18:20,639
some stupid dream of moving to Bel Air

3582
02:18:18,718 --> 02:18:23,039
and growing [ __ ] thousands of plants

3583
02:18:20,638 --> 02:18:26,398
in a [ __ ] Mansion but it just it's

3584
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:28,320
good it's what happened you know it's

3585
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:30,840
just sometimes when you're letting life

3586
02:18:28,319 --> 02:18:31,978
take you takes you some strange places

3587
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:34,500
you know

3588
02:18:31,978 --> 02:18:36,420
that's it I think that's the the theme

3589
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:38,340
of this interview it's taking us to some

3590
02:18:36,420 --> 02:18:42,120
strange places but nevertheless
