so

28
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,798
first question i want to ask is what are

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,280
you guys currently smoking on

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,439
a homesteader we actually have a big jar

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
of homesteader here which is um one of

32
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,079
our really long time

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
strains well it's actually a cross of

34
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,359
one of our really long time strains so

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
it's our zeli's gift times our 840.

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,438
um

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,439
and it has a temple spice as a female so

38
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,399
we've been working with the zelly's gift

39
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,719
for a while

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,000
it has a jack herrera mom and uh a gooey

41
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,759
mother

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
clone that came from oregon which is

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,599
really really awesome that we love

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
forever and uh yeah we've been breeding

45
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,118
up here for a long time so we we do have

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,640
a lot of other people's strengths

47
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:57,840
there's a lot of wonderful amazing

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,159
people that give us strains but we

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,478
really like ours um because they're

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
really um you know intelligent for our

51
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,039
area so the homesteader is kind of a

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,000
uplifting kind of lemony

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,239
um high in beta-caryophyllene and has

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,439
some really a beautiful full-spectrum

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,400
cannabinoid profile it's like it's spicy

56
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,000
oh nice and so is that got any like um

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,039
cbd or anything like that or is it more

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,878
thc dominant one it's mostly thc

59
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,318
dominant but it's probably like a four

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,239
to one so

61
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,479
we're guessing you know we wrote we go

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,800
from seeds so it would probably be like

63
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,119
a maybe a 17 to 19 thc and we're hoping

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,080
for like an eight percent cbd we're

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,840
starting to bring more cbd into our thc

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,879
varieties and they still have a lot of

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,120
flavor

68
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,280
and then they have this dynamic

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
um cannabinoid profile which we really

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,640
like a lot and we're also breeding for

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,640
the cbdv and the cbdn

72
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,238
and yes we're breeding for the

73
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,079
cannabinoids we don't know about yet

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,439
yeah that's such an interesting point to

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
make because something i've always

76
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,800
thought about kind of in my subconscious

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,879
is what if breeders began to embed just

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
a small amount of cbd in the background

79
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,878
of profiles such that maybe people

80
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,318
aren't aware that it's even their per se

81
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,318
but just everyone's kind of enjoying

82
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,598
that added medicinal effect

83
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,119
do you think that that's maybe something

84
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,039
that will like come out more so in the

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,439
future

86
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,519
absolutely i mean um you know trying to

87
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,199
have as much cbds in there and still

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,840
getting that nice high that people are

89
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,878
looking for you know is is totally

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,598
beneficial so we've been breeding in cbd

91
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,798
from an ac dc clone that we got a long

92
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,039
time ago

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,799
and we have like a one to one and sort

94
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,959
of a two to one and a three to one and a

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,959
four to one and we're just continually

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
trying to make sure that that cbd makes

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,598
an appearance in all of our new strains

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
we know that the uh there's kind of like

99
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,280
the hemp cbd

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,120
and then there's the

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,878
thc variety throwback cbds

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
and that's where some of the original

103
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,318
cbds came from cbd plants and stuff like

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,040
the harlequin and everything came from a

105
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,119
thc variety um that was you know

106
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,759
thinking it white might have had

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,840
the high um cbd and then you know the

108
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,478
tsunamis and the sour tsunamis and

109
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,879
everything um got created after that but

110
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,319
um if you're not breeding it

111
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,519
you have to be careful with breeding

112
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,599
into the hemp

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,240
to try and get your cbd varieties when

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,439
you find like a really flavorful high

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
cbd

116
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,918
that is easily breedable with the thc

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
varieties and our opinion i think it's

118
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,799
what along the lines what you're saying

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
that's a real winner

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,560
yeah and then we just sort of keep our

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,160
hemp uh breeding with each other we

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
don't really see the difference between

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
medical and recreational and in fact we

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
would love to just sneak in whatever

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
people consider medical into

126
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,319
recreational because

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,720
why not be medical while you recreate

128
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,000
yeah exactly so you touched on a few

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
interesting points there the first one

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,478
which jumps to mind though is one thing

131
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
i've heard commonly is that some strains

132
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,038
particularly the cbd dominant ones have

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
this kind of general slash bland terpene

134
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,959
profile i think some people even refer

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,839
to it as like a cherry kind of profile

136
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,198
do you

137
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,560
agree with that view like do you

138
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
subscribe to that or do you think maybe

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,280
that's just a bit too nitpicky

140
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,918
um we definitely see that more in the

141
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,439
hemp varieties but now we have lots of

142
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,000
friends that are in the industry that

143
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,560
are starting to like pop like 1 million

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,038
seeds and then they're testing 10 000 of

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,720
those seeds and one of their number one

146
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,599
things that they're searching for is a

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,600
wide variety of a terpene profile

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,320
so there's some new seeds out there in

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
the hemp world called a spectrum there's

150
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,800
also one that's the cherry wine

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,680
one that's called a number five that

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,918
really has beautiful terpenes sort of

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,319
you know all over the map so

154
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,478
yes i do agree with you that sort of the

155
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,839
cherry was the first flavor to come up

156
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,000
in the high cbd hemp varieties but now

157
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,918
that there's just more searching out

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,959
there and more testing more terpene

159
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,120
profiles are becoming apparent

160
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,198
and so another question i wanted to ask

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,519
you is i've found a strain by i believe

162
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
it's cbd crew and if not cbd seeds it's

163
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,959
one of the two it's shanty barber's

164
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,279
company but basically he says he's got a

165
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,038
cbd strain where instead of having any

166
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,599
hemp being brought into it at any point

167
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,959
he found a regular kind of you know thc

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,439
dominant strain which happened to have

169
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,839
some cbd in it and then over multiple

170
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,079
generations selectively bred it out like

171
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,839
selectively bred the thc out of it

172
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,719
he says the the advantage of this is

173
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,839
that you don't get that hemp terp or and

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,319
you get a little bit better bud

175
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,560
structure but the thought that i had was

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,759
is that really an issue with you know

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
like for example when we look at the

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,038
work you're doing is the bud structure

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,879
from the hemp genetics which maybe

180
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,240
brought the cbd many generations ago is

181
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,319
that still evident or is it just not

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
even there anymore really

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
still looks a lot like the hemp when you

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,360
get the hempy ones yeah definitely it

185
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,719
still has sort of that you know smaller

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,080
flower nodes um maybe even less of them

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
on a plant

188
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,038
um taller thinner leaves you know i mean

189
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,639
really you know i feel beautiful

190
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,719
terpenes and there's i know people that

191
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,759
are making oils out of it and even

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,000
making rosin and stuff so there's still

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
you know there's still profiles there to

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,959
go with but

195
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,038
yeah i mean there's really there really

196
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,239
is kind of the hemp varieties and then

197
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,159
the the

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
the more broad leaf varieties there's

199
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
broadleaf cbd's is basically what you're

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,918
looking for

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,919
and so in regards to kind of what i just

202
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,079
mentioned with that uh selectively bred

203
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,198
out thc phenotype would you be

204
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,120
interested in looking at something like

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,478
that or does the advantages on paper not

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,598
really kind of seem like it's a

207
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:40,560
worthwhile in exploration so to speak

208
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,360
definitely we feel like um breeding out

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,199
the thc you know more in what is called

210
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,560
the drug cultivar

211
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
cannabis

212
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,959
um

213
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,879
so yeah being able to breed out the thc

214
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,198
and up that cbd is going to give you

215
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
those beautiful you know dripping

216
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,000
resinous flower

217
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,439
flowers i mean essentially if you if

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
you're a farmer or if you're if you're

219
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,120
going to start a business an apartment

220
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,240
you're looking at it kind of like

221
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,720
are you targeting no thc or cbd um or

222
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,199
high cbd with no thc which allows you to

223
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,280
sell more you know globally and more

224
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
internationally and that's a real you

225
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,598
know that's a

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
an attractive incentive so in that way

227
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,639
you know breeding out the thc and just

228
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
having the cbd is you know when when if

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,240
someone's putting in that much effort to

230
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
create those seeds though those are

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
really valuable

232
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
and we also know that the hemp variety

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,759
you know sort of across the globe it's

234
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,759
that 0.3

235
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,399
that they're looking for so that it's

236
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,519
you know

237
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,600
non-structured and it's not going to be

238
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,839
necessarily put into the cannabis

239
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,639
industry with restrictions so if you're

240
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,800
looking for that 0.3 thc that's going to

241
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,480
really be found in the hemp varieties

242
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,399
we're finding those super super low thc

243
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,839
and then you just want to you know up

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,720
all of the rest of the cannabinoid

245
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,519
profile in your terpene profile so it's

246
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,519
a big hunt in the hemp world as well as

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,278
in the cb drug cultivar world right now

248
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
so i'm not sure if you guys would be

249
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,958
familiar with this next part but

250
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,599
basically what i had noticed was

251
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,359
whenever i had tried a cbd extract like

252
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
most notably the really highly refined

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,399
ones you know like they're looking

254
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
really white crystalline type of stuff

255
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,639
i just found like yeah it just really

256
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,839
wasn't medicinal in the way that like uh

257
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,759
say a cbd flower was is this like a you

258
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,519
know a kind of a pertinent point in your

259
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,278
mind like are you kind of on that same

260
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,959
wavelength of like it loses that

261
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,559
medicinal value as it gets more

262
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,479
processed

263
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,278
absolutely that means that you're just

264
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,200
extracting just the cbd and then you've

265
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,519
got that 99

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,440
cbd crystallite and that means that it

267
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,440
doesn't really have any other you know

268
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
terpenes in it for sure there's no

269
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,160
terpenes and as well as there's no

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
cannabinoids so you've lost sort of this

271
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,159
dynamic profile where they all work

272
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,159
together you know

273
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,000
one what you're saying there is really

274
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,159
interesting because you could have

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
something that you know is maybe a five

276
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,000
milligram

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,480
cbd and if it has cbdv in it and cbdn in

278
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,399
it and it's sort of like a full profile

279
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,200
you're gonna feel that so much more than

280
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,759
say a hundred milligram straight cbd

281
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
isolate at least that's been what i've

282
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,120
really experienced and other people have

283
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
experienced across the board and that

284
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,799
has a lot to do with the terpenes um you

285
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
know and

286
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,359
and and the dynamic effect of of the

287
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,879
entourage where everything's working

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,919
together i mean

289
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,039
and it's it's just it's almost

290
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,120
pharmaceuticalizing it in the sense to

291
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,879
to try and you know isolate or

292
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,039
distillate you know you know certain

293
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,480
parts of it and there's reasons for that

294
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,078
and there's a lot of medicines you can

295
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
do that so i'm not i'm not saying at all

296
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,159
that's not a that's not a good thing but

297
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,278
i feel like

298
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,879
i do think you it's more dynamic in the

299
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,958
um in the

300
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,559
corrective medicine aspect of it when

301
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,000
you get the other terpenes in there

302
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,078
because they work together and they

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
really create the your immune they

304
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,039
really boost your immune system and in

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,480
the end

306
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,480
you know you're trying to boost your

307
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
immune system and those are that

308
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,920
endocannabinoid system will be charged

309
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,319
up with the with as many different

310
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,759
cannabinoids as possible and most of the

311
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
doctors have

312
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,240
have proven that through

313
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,360
research is that you know one by one

314
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,278
is a good one is it good

315
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,480
yeah i definitely have found personally

316
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,399
at least that the one to one seems to

317
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,839
work really nicely for me if we take a

318
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,679
little step back though from what we

319
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,839
were just talking about with the the uh

320
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,359
the ultra most extracted slash process

321
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
end of things and we just go kind of

322
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,039
more to the midway how do you guys feel

323
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
about say extracts which have added

324
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,799
terpenes put back in them do you feel

325
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,559
like it's like a two-step forward

326
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,319
three-step back type situation or what's

327
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,000
your view

328
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
well i think that that you know there's

329
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,480
there's people using terpenes that are

330
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,120
made from foods and they're just getting

331
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,240
like mercy from wherever mercy comes

332
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,480
from and for sure that's not really a a

333
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,560
thing that we that we you know promote

334
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
or condone at all i mean if you're going

335
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,199
to use terpenes in there they should be

336
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
from cannabis and really i mean the

337
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
whole goal is to

338
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,920
is to preserve your terpenes with your

339
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,278
growing practices and with your um and

340
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,360
with your uh

341
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,360
your curing practices and when you go to

342
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,519
extract it i mean hopefully you don't

343
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
need to add any terpenes but you know

344
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,519
when you're making different oils you

345
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,759
can get terpenes from it and it is

346
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,879
really fun to work with terpenes and do

347
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,559
different things with it the

348
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,078
aromatherapy and

349
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,439
different things you can do but i think

350
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,879
you have to be

351
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,200
kind of um

352
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,159
gentle with with using them

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
for sure

354
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,799
yeah

355
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,519
so last little thing i wanted to touch

356
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,278
on on this kind of cbd topic was i

357
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,720
watched a little segment of you guys

358
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,200
talking on youtube and you were talking

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
about how you think uh some cbd slash

360
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,440
just funky you know cannabinoid profiles

361
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,879
may be related to the soil itself

362
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,880
and that was a really interesting point

363
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,240
and the first thing i thought of is

364
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,000
do you think it's more related to the

365
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,839
microbes or to the amendments you're

366
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,839
using

367
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,800
um definitely to the microbiology

368
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,639
because if you've got a living soil um

369
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,879
then you're really not feeding your

370
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,879
plant the focus then becomes that you're

371
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,799
feeding the soil and then that soil

372
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,240
becomes a vast organism that then you're

373
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,799
trying to feed

374
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
and and when you feed them say

375
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,199
terpene-rich nutrients then it's really

376
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,240
the breakdown of the fungi and the

377
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,519
bacteria and all of the different

378
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,959
microbiology in there that then feeds it

379
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,159
up to the plant

380
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,719
so i think to feed really you know

381
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,360
biodynamic accumulators that are terpene

382
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
rich is probably a really good idea but

383
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,278
it's going to go through the

384
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,760
microbiology before it hits the plant so

385
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,240
there's always a through way um you know

386
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,360
with a beautiful living soil and yeah

387
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,919
we've definitely found um with testing

388
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,079
with our medicine before that you know

389
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,319
we a lot of the facilities we've worked

390
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,198
with have seen you know a really um

391
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
broad array of cannabinoids and even

392
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,198
some really unique ones that they

393
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,800
haven't seen before and for sure you

394
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:12,319
know science backs this is as as

395
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,078
the the microbiology is what really

396
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,560
allows the plant to produce the

397
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,799
secondary metabolites that it has i mean

398
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,000
we definitely know if you grow one

399
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,559
the same clone and you know 10 different

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
environments indoor outdoor and whatever

401
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,239
it is with different even with different

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,759
nutrients you will get different

403
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,919
cannabinoid and terpene profiles so so

404
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,919
for sure there's like that that's what's

405
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,078
fun about growing this plan is that you

406
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,958
know when you give it something really

407
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,679
um unique it allows it to

408
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:47,599
um express itself to its full full

409
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,638
extent so so yes adding um a really

410
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,680
really

411
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,440
live and rich microbiology to your soil

412
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,958
is going to really really help

413
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
you know the

414
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,198
the diversity of your cannabinoids and

415
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,439
terpenes and we're going to be we we

416
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,198
have been working with a lab here in bc

417
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,959
for about a year and actually they're

418
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,198
going to be coming out to our farm and

419
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,159
we're going to be doing soil tests along

420
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,719
with

421
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,120
plant tissue tests and really trying to

422
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,278
get to the bottom of it because this lab

423
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,039
is seen like josh had said some really

424
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,198
rare cannabinoids and they don't even

425
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,278
have the ability to test them all

426
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,838
so we really feel like we can give a

427
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,720
seed that's you know our own

428
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,839
uh

429
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
you know that we've been breeding up

430
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,680
here for maybe 12 years and we feel like

431
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,040
it's it's a pretty stable strain after

432
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,799
12 years and then we'll give it to

433
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,519
somebody else and those rare

434
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,919
cannabinoids are maybe not being found

435
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,839
and we feel like maybe more and more

436
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,479
rare cannabinoids are going to be found

437
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,160
with you know building of soil so we've

438
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,079
been on our land for now 11 years um and

439
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,639
you know what is it going to be like 15

440
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,638
years from now when our soils are built

441
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,039
up to even more maximum are we going to

442
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,278
be able to get cannabinoid profiles

443
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,519
that are really rare we believe that we

444
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,198
will and we and we have um you know a

445
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,759
long time strain that we've been using

446
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,078
and last year all of a sudden we had 10

447
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,120
cbd in it out of nowhere so

448
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,359
we did have cbd show up and

449
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,278
for sure there's a relationship within

450
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
the soil and within the roots growing

451
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,039
together

452
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,799
so we really envision that when we're

453
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,399
growing and in the teas and everything

454
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,039
that we're making we're thinking oh how

455
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,559
is this going to affect our rhizosphere

456
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,399
and that community and that that neuro

457
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,159
communication that happens within the

458
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,919
soil and it's super

459
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,838
i mean we really love

460
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,679
thinking about the roots and and when we

461
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,480
see the hyphae and how it all goes

462
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,879
together

463
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,720
and you it really dirty and and and

464
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,278
people have even proven that there's

465
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,560
electromagnetic you know pulses going

466
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,278
through there so

467
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,958
plants communicating with themselves in

468
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,600
the soil allow them to be healthier and

469
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,239
ex once again express themselves

470
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,480
to more diversity and we believe that

471
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
you know cannabis is a social plant and

472
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,560
the reason why we believe that is

473
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,959
because it drops its seeds on the ground

474
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,279
right around the plant and then all of

475
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,600
that mother plant then drops all of the

476
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,078
mulching leaves and actually feeds it to

477
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,318
her next generation so all of those

478
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,798
seeds will sort of grow close together

479
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,399
in a natural setting and that makes it a

480
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,240
very social plant

481
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,038
and that's something that we recognize

482
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,038
if

483
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,759
plants are in pots and then we put them

484
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,000
out into the ground we immediately see

485
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,759
that there's some kind of a completion

486
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,759
of the circuits the completion of the

487
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,599
electricity a completion of the

488
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,558
communication between the plants so that

489
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,359
they can help each other out

490
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,759
um

491
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,639
so you know that's definitely a part of

492
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,480
the cannabinoid profile as well is how

493
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
happy is your plant

494
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
if your plant is incredibly happy then

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,519
it's going to be able to show its full

496
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,679
capabilities for the medicine and the

497
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,918
terpenes that it puts out and it's also

498
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,798
why we we really you know

499
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,280
um

500
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,519
we really condone having your plants in

501
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,879
the earth and not in pots above the

502
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,639
ground and that's part of our pure

503
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
certification part of the farms that we

504
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,559
work with and stuff everyone

505
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,799
is building you know

506
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,960
beds connected to the earth and it's

507
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,960
better for water water retention you in

508
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,038
australia you know you guys have a you

509
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,279
know big huge water problem you know a

510
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,960
lot of times in the year and

511
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,399
you know you know learning about those

512
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,400
techniques is going to be extremely

513
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
important for you all too

514
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,960
yeah so i've got a whole bunch of

515
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,240
questions related to that but i just

516
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,160
want to jump back to something you

517
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,480
referenced a moment ago where you said

518
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,240
you wonder what the soil slash your farm

519
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
will be like in 15 years from now

520
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,519
something i wanted to ask you

521
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,400
specifically was do you know if the

522
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,599
concept of probiotic runoff exists so to

523
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
speak like let's just say you know your

524
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,959
beds are just pumping it out for the

525
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
next 15 years do you think at some point

526
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
you reach saturation and the microbes

527
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,240
then start to leach off to elsewhere and

528
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
you're kind of by remediating elsewhere

529
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
or do you think it's going to be quite

530
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,119
localized

531
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,520
well i i'm going to i'll we'll reference

532
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,798
paul's statements on this and i mean in

533
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:03,440
in his um studies is his

534
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,359
is that there was cow farms above

535
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,160
the um

536
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,159
oyster fields out in in olympia and the

537
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
oyster fields and oyster farmers in the

538
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,640
water were you know losing or their

539
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,840
their their crop and not being able the

540
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
oysters weren't growing and they were

541
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,279
losing their crop there oh my god what's

542
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,839
happening we're getting poisoned by

543
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,839
cows and so what they did is they

544
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:29,279
inoculated bales of hay with um

545
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,678
oyster mushrooms and they built channels

546
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,759
for the runoff so the water when the

547
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,080
rain came in when and when and extra

548
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,119
ground waters came

549
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,839
the

550
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,959
groundwater could filter through

551
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:46,000
the bales of hay which in and in the end

552
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,319
did save the oyster fields and that just

553
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
goes to prove and we talk about this a

554
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,240
lot

555
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,798
with um

556
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,359
land um formation when people are doing

557
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:59,119
earthworks on their property is to build

558
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,038
um burlap balls and and inoculate it

559
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,319
with um

560
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,798
with um biology because we we know that

561
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,399
you do affect the area around you

562
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,119
through biology so

563
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,679
having really dedicated beds or swales

564
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:17,038
around your property that have really

565
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,280
live mycology or biology in your soils

566
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,400
it it does affect your your neighbors

567
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,319
and and it does

568
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,519
affect your water and and you have to be

569
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,038
really careful

570
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,599
about um

571
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,839
you know uh you know building your

572
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,000
property properly so it does affect your

573
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,240
neighbors in a positive way

574
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,480
did i answer that and if there is going

575
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,720
to be runoff you know with your

576
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,720
beneficials or your microbiology in your

577
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,279
beds then if it's on your land that's

578
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,480
nothing but you know awesome as far as

579
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,119
like reaching like ultimate peak of

580
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,159
microbiology microbiology is just

581
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,479
constantly eating and colonizing and

582
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799
dying and eating and colonizing and

583
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,599
dying it's just part of what it does it

584
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,158
changes seasonally it'll change on a hot

585
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,599
day you know if we're having blazing hot

586
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,760
days then all of that beautiful

587
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,599
microbiology that might be in the first

588
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,158
inch of the soil is going to go down

589
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,319
quite deep so not only does it ebb and

590
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,480
flow in numbers but it also ebbs and

591
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,439
flows in in depth

592
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,599
and also how wide it is so we really

593
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,720
encourage people that you may start with

594
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:26,240
one garden bed but the view is to see

595
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,600
a beautiful intelligent microbiology

596
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,839
biome

597
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,599
that you know expands out from your

598
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,599
garden and then it goes out to your

599
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,599
property and then if it attaches onto

600
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,240
your neighbor's property then all you're

601
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,319
doing is creating a beautiful

602
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
safe haven for

603
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,158
a lot of microbiology that's dying in

604
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,120
the world today with all of the

605
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,200
different toxins so if microbiology can

606
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,239
have beautiful islands of health and

607
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,279
well-being you know in people's farms or

608
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,279
even in a garden bed or or in a large

609
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,798
farm then it is a positive impact for

610
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,558
the whole world

611
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,319
and and the beds are never done so we're

612
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,879
always adding to them like kelly said i

613
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,678
mean in 15 years we'll have to add to

614
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,720
our beds 15 times at least

615
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,038
yeah

616
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,200
so i know that you guys are big

617
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,519
advocates of the use of imo and as we

618
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
just heard microbes in general however i

619
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,319
was wondering

620
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
you know obviously you've never said it

621
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,879
but are you against kind of bringing in

622
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,320
external microbes you know or are you

623
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,960
okay with that but you just prefer to

624
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,639
use indigenous ones and i guess the most

625
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
notable example of this would be mammoth

626
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,840
p for example where do you sit on that

627
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,959
um well i mean we do we have our own

628
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,079
products

629
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,880
that have a different array of bacteria

630
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,599
as well as endomycorrhizae fungi

631
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,760
as well as different glomus species

632
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,319
we feel like if you can introduce

633
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,000
something that's really beneficial and

634
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,240
it's going to take then that's

635
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,359
absolutely fantastic it's really no

636
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,759
different than adding probiotics to your

637
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,519
to your body you know if you add um

638
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,079
different types of probiotics you know

639
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,079
the lactobacillus or the bacillus is

640
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,480
then that's just gonna inoculate your

641
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,158
body it may only inoculate your body for

642
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,519
72 hours and then you have to

643
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
re-inoculate it because it's going to

644
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,798
stay in the upper respiratory tract but

645
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,879
some of these soil microbiology that we

646
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,038
introduced to our body which we know as

647
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,600
human beings were completely deficient

648
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,319
in which is hence so many

649
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,959
health issues on the planet today ibs

650
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,879
and colitis and i could go on and on

651
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
leaky gut syndrome and all of these

652
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,440
things even even clear thinking brain

653
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,558
capabilities you know all really are

654
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
based in microbiology so in the same way

655
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,119
that maybe we're going to be deficient

656
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,360
in some type of a really important

657
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,439
microbe you know you can introduce it to

658
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,558
your body in the same way that maybe

659
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,640
your farm is deficient in microbiology

660
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,038
you can also you know introduce it to

661
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,200
your farm but the most important thing

662
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,278
is when you introduce it

663
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,440
you can't be introducing it in a way

664
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,519
that it's not going to be colonizing

665
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,320
so to really look at what kind of

666
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,480
microbiology that you're bringing in to

667
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,720
create a beautiful environment so that

668
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,798
it will colonize right away is the real

669
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,038
goal so that you're not continually

670
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,679
buying this microbiology to inoculate

671
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:19,038
inoculate inoculate your soil it's great

672
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,278
to re-inoculate your your t's and maybe

673
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,079
josh will talk a little bit about that

674
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:23,839
well

675
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,798
another thing that we think about when

676
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,720
when it comes to biology is that our

677
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,119
number one question is

678
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,839
what biology and where did it come from

679
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,558
and there's a lot of biology companies

680
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,240
out there that are rooted in gmo

681
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,798
companies and

682
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,960
um ones that do are are involved in a

683
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,639
lot of practices worldwide that we don't

684
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,120
agree with

685
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,559
so uh when it comes to even predators

686
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,519
you know if you're getting predators for

687
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,960
your garden you have to be really

688
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,319
careful of you know where you get your

689
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,919
predators from because some of those

690
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,079
companies are involved in really you

691
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,320
know large-scale you know gmo products

692
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,639
and and and farms that we don't agree

693
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,879
with so that's a number one question

694
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,520
and some of it's produced on substrate

695
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,760
that's gmo and you have to know what the

696
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,000
biology substrate is that it's being

697
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,798
colonized on so those are some of the

698
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,720
questions i mean mammoth p you know for

699
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,038
example if you you know we don't like to

700
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,360
you know to talk about any in particular

701
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,599
companies a lot of people use that you

702
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,079
know in in products but you know if

703
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,918
you're shipping liquid around the world

704
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,359
and stuff you know you think about the

705
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,360
container that it's involved in and

706
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,359
stuff and if you can try and even with

707
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,439
our products you know we try and you

708
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,199
know tell people how to

709
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
make it locally because it's better for

710
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,159
the gardening and better for your

711
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
environment so

712
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,760
biology is

713
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,919
best being tried to be made in soils

714
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,839
you know um and then i'm bringing it

715
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,600
into teas um you know that's um where

716
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,319
where we have our products and stuff

717
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,678
like that our products um represent

718
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,319
herbs and an herbal medicine which is is

719
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,759
certified organic herbs with a certified

720
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,240
organic

721
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,798
bacteria count and when we make a

722
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,079
bacteria colony and when we make teas

723
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,960
out of it

724
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,038
the herbs just go through the tea and

725
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,840
when they you water the beds the herbs

726
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,679
go on to the top of the soil so you can

727
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,639
colonize them in the tea and then you

728
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,559
can

729
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
they continue to colonize when they're

730
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,359
in the soil and and we're talking a lot

731
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,520
about our products but more importantly

732
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,399
we teach people to not use products at

733
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,319
all

734
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,038
so you know all of our products have

735
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,960
every single recipe on it we really we

736
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,359
really encourage people to grow this

737
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,519
herbal biomass themselves then it

738
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,000
becomes closed loop you also can

739
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,319
inoculate and grow out all of your own

740
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
species of different types of inoculants

741
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:50,480
whether that's a fungi or a bacteria

742
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,119
you know we utilize a tremendous amount

743
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,079
of lactic acid bacteria cultures here as

744
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,719
well as different types of soil bacteria

745
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,879
to help break down the raw

746
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,319
plant mass so we grow a tremendous

747
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,440
amount of

748
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:08,158
herbal biomass on our property here that

749
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,798
then gets chopped up and broken down

750
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,278
into a tea container and then you add

751
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:16,000
all of that microbiology so that it eats

752
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,599
it up at a very rapid rate

753
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,519
and then you aerate it so that's a

754
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,519
really an

755
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,000
anaerobic um beginning stages of that

756
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,480
because those anaerobes are incredibly

757
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,960
you know verocious and they eat through

758
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,720
things that are very rapid

759
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,720
and they're digesters so when you have

760
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,120
that in an anaerobic and then you switch

761
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,480
your anaerobic fermented teas into an

762
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,719
aerobic compound by adding you know air

763
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,720
to it then that gets all of your

764
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,640
anaerobes away and then it's ready to

765
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
drench and then it will be

766
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,278
fully

767
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,120
full of all of the the great

768
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,119
microbiology that you're looking for

769
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,479
that's going to continue to break down

770
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,239
that material in your soils

771
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,558
so a question kind of relating to the

772
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,599
teas that i wanted to ask you is do you

773
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,440
see any downside to artificially

774
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,719
extending the life of your tea so for

775
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,919
example maybe you know you've had a

776
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,440
brewing for a few days and you haven't

777
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,120
used it all so you just throw a bit of

778
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
extra carbohydrate sauce in there or

779
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,798
something along those lines do you think

780
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
that that's like you know detrimental

781
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,440
would you

782
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,278
sorry avoid doing that or how do you

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,600
feel about that

784
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,000
i mean it's not going to be the best way

785
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,319
to build the colony of your tea i mean

786
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,679
you know if the the purpose of of having

787
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,439
a tea to begin with is to is to

788
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,600
build mycology

789
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,159
essentially and not mycology but

790
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,558
microbiology you know i mean you start

791
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,120
with one thing and you add a little bit

792
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,359
of molasses or something to it organic

793
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,439
or not and we can get into that whether

794
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,519
to use organic uh to use organic

795
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,919
molasses or not but

796
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,720
you use the aeration to charge up the

797
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,399
tea and when you charge up the tea um

798
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,079
you know you're building the

799
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,000
colony and that's the point of it so if

800
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,038
you if you just extend that you're just

801
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,319
losing

802
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,919
the colony that you built because

803
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,759
they're not they don't wait around

804
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,840
they're they're just live and die you

805
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,519
know fast organisms so they've if

806
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,959
they've eaten up a lot of the nutrients

807
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,440
that you've already put in there and

808
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,038
then you add more inoculants in there

809
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,200
then it's not going to be the same

810
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,319
colonies that have eaten up the the

811
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,159
initial

812
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,759
foods or nutrients that you've put in

813
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,840
there it's going to be sort of a

814
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,440
different colony that takes over

815
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,319
and it's really interesting because

816
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,558
colonies can change in a tea brew from

817
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,798
hour to hour you know they can change

818
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,359
depending on how warm the weather is how

819
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,599
much humidity is in there or you know

820
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,959
depending on what you put in there so

821
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,519
it's a really

822
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,840
we we really don't look at our t's any

823
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,319
different than you would like a stomach

824
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,639
or a digestive tract we want to make

825
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,038
sure to put everything in there and then

826
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,799
give it the ability to be able to digest

827
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,319
it fully with all beneficial

828
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,158
microbiology

829
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,439
and we really don't separate it between

830
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,520
the human digestive tract and and a tea

831
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,120
brew as far as yeah the teas we just do

832
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,119
it a little differently i mean we do it

833
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,879
kind of like the art of fermentation on

834
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,639
one side and then we activate it on the

835
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,159
other and and that's different than a

836
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,919
lot of people

837
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,600
so i think a lot of our listeners will

838
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,038
probably kill me if i don't ask how long

839
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,439
do you brew your teas for generally and

840
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,440
do you use uh like a kind of a rule of

841
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,558
thumb to see when they're ready like you

842
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,080
know a lot of people will say when

843
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:18,960
there's a nice healthy froth on top but

844
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,720
then you know you'll have other people

845
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,640
who'll say that's not always indicative

846
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,720
that it's done things like that like

847
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,200
where do you sit on that

848
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,038
well most importantly you know the very

849
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,519
end i could go through the beginning of

850
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,119
it but the very end is taste it

851
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,519
you know really

852
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,199
if you're utilizing things in your tea

853
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,119
that you know are good for the soil and

854
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,720
good for the microbiology

855
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,000
you know of course you can get a ph

856
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,240
meter of course you can look at the

857
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,200
bubbles you can smell it but when you

858
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,079
taste your tea it's totally inert it has

859
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,880
zero flavor at all it's crazy you could

860
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,439
put a tremendous amount of

861
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,320
biomass in there chop up all of your

862
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,720
plants and in the anaerobic part of it

863
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,720
which usually is between five and seven

864
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,519
days it can go up to ten days during

865
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
really cold cycles if it's more warm

866
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,240
then it's going to be faster to five

867
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,399
days

868
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,000
that's your anaerobic brew and then when

869
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,959
you take that anaerobic brew and then

870
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,599
you put it into another container you

871
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,120
know by straining out all of the biomass

872
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,759
and the herbs and everything you put it

873
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,879
into another container and you aerate it

874
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,480
it should have

875
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,480
zero smell

876
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,679
and the taste of it should be totally

877
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,278
inert and for us that's saying it's done

878
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,000
and then that gives a really beautiful

879
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,558
color to the tea and everything and our

880
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,679
aeration usually is between

881
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,798
24 and 72 hours depending well 12

882
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,440
actually 12 and 72 hours depending on

883
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,839
you know what cycle our plants are in i

884
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,798
mean the general rule of thumb you know

885
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,119
is

886
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,759
12 to 24 hours

887
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,518
tops i mean that's but you know you then

888
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,759
you're going on just

889
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,399
you know compost tea knowledge just you

890
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,119
know basic compost tea knowledge you

891
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:06,558
know which is a certain you know a third

892
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,038
of a tablespoon or a of a pound you know

893
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,000
per gallon or and then you and you

894
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,519
bubble it overnight you know or 12 to 24

895
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,759
hours if you do it longer than that you

896
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,159
lose your colony but there's a lot of

897
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,319
reasons why you know even just steeping

898
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,519
it overnight makes a lot of sense so you

899
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,158
can take like

900
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,319
herbs like dried herbs and some compost

901
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
tea and you can just steep it overnight

902
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,439
and then just

903
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
drench it onto your soil

904
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,038
and then that's really good for your

905
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,479
soil microbes so there's really a lot of

906
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,079
different ways to make teas um and i

907
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,919
think that you have to really think

908
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,879
about you know what your goal is and are

909
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,038
you indoor are you soilless do you have

910
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,960
um you know outdoors so i mean there

911
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,240
really is a lot of questions on how

912
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,159
you're growing on how you're going to

913
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,159
attack you there's not just one way to

914
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,720
do a t from our perspective and we

915
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
really like to you know us personally

916
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,399
just like josh said there's a lot of

917
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
different ways to make teas

918
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,398
but we really like to have control over

919
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,840
you know what's in our tea brewers which

920
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,079
is the reason why we work with herbal

921
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,839
biomass and our inoculants we're not

922
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,398
really working with

923
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,599
compost because you know

924
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,759
the variety of

925
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:18,719
differentiation of microbiology in there

926
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:21,278
is so huge it's so vast so we really

927
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,360
like to have control over what's in our

928
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,960
tea brews so that we know

929
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,158
what's going to be the end product that

930
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,679
we're not going to have anything

931
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
anaerobic in there we're not going to

932
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,880
have anything i mean unless it's a

933
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,959
facultative anaerobe and then that's

934
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,679
really awesome but you know nothing that

935
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,480
would be detrimental to the root system

936
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,399
so

937
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,240
we really like to have control over what

938
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,158
is in our tea brews and we pick and

939
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,079
choose particular inoculants that we

940
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,080
make here on our own property

941
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,000
to to make that happen

942
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,918
yeah wow you just read my mind because i

943
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,679
was gonna ask you about facultative

944
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,000
anaerobes i was gonna say i was talking

945
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,759
to mr bob hemphill and he's saying he's

946
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,640
a big fan of adding bokash or you know

947
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,240
em4 imo 4 whatever you're making it with

948
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
do you do you feel the same way like do

949
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,679
you like adding bokashi like where you

950
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,440
kind of incorporate that you know the

951
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,519
anaerobic with the aerobic or do you

952
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,200
prefer as you referenced a moment ago to

953
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,239
have you know like your ferment stage

954
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:15,358
and then your activation stage

955
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,878
well i think with um with bokashi and

956
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,918
and different things like that you have

957
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:23,918
to be careful because it's it's acidic

958
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:27,118
in nature so um really using less of it

959
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,358
is using more and we do like bokashi

960
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,519
because we like lactic acid bacteria

961
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,199
because it's you know the main

962
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,440
you know fermenting microbe and

963
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,000
sauerkraut and most of the foods

964
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,639
that we eat so we do like propagating

965
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,559
lactic acid bacteria on our property and

966
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,599
we usually do that through making teas

967
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,799
as far as you know our soils go in our

968
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
beds

969
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,760
we we treat them like a compost pile so

970
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,679
we're kind of always adding stuff and

971
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,879
and it creates like a healthy gut for

972
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,800
the plants

973
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,639
and we you know we're slowly adding to

974
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,200
it all the time so

975
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,000
our imo's are basically

976
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,799
attracted to our beds and we don't feel

977
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,280
we need to go collect imo's

978
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,640
even though we'll bring handfuls of dirt

979
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,720
from different environments that we

980
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,039
think are really healthy and maybe we'll

981
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,118
propagate those through teas and drench

982
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,000
them onto our beds

983
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,440
to to spread the microbes but

984
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,079
we we generally use mulch and biomass

985
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,559
and and covering our beds to attract the

986
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,640
indigenous microbes to our beds and we

987
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,320
have less and less compost piles and

988
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,639
more and more just our beds or our

989
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,240
compost and yeah to answer your question

990
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,639
the facultative microbes are just

991
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,719
totally imperative for the beginning

992
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,400
stages of the fermentation those

993
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,358
facultative microbes are the ones that

994
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,119
are just so hardcore and quick digesters

995
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,358
and they can make you know the

996
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,440
difference between a pretty pathogenic

997
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,319
tea and a totally beneficial t and the

998
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,960
and facultative means that they can can

999
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,440
propagate in an anaerobic condition or

1000
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,280
an aerobic condition so

1001
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,519
you know we're attracted

1002
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,599
in our life we're attracted to microbes

1003
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,000
that we that to us that's adaptogenic

1004
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,880
there they adapt they're able to

1005
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,119
to live and propagate in in an anaerobic

1006
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,920
situation and then when you go to what

1007
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,720
we say activate the the t

1008
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,639
then they change with that and we we

1009
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,480
like having those kind of microbes that

1010
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,239
can that can adapt and we want to

1011
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,079
propagate that and put those that into

1012
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,319
our soils because you know the

1013
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,839
environment is ever changing our bodies

1014
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,640
are ever changing and we just want a

1015
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,838
really healthy um you know biome around

1016
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,920
us

1017
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,199
of course so i noticed on a few

1018
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,800
different instagram posts sometimes

1019
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,399
people will ask you maybe like what

1020
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,920
you're using in a specific picture in

1021
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,599
relation to say a top dress or like

1022
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,200
something along those lines and the

1023
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,240
general answer you kind of give is like

1024
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,598
oh you know like we're just using stuff

1025
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,959
that's around the place

1026
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,960
would you try to maintain that

1027
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,400
philosophy everywhere you go or is that

1028
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,838
more so applicable just because you're

1029
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,280
like obviously on your farm you've got

1030
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,480
access to a lot of this stuff so you are

1031
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,160
able to just kind of use what's around

1032
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,679
but maybe somewhere else like i guess

1033
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,039
what the question is is do you think

1034
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,399
that there's stuff people can use no

1035
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,679
matter where they are or do you think

1036
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,440
you guys are a little bit lucky and that

1037
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,719
you do have stuff laying around so to

1038
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,119
speak

1039
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,039
absolutely it's totally important that

1040
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,720
people utilize what they have around

1041
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,719
their own environment because that own

1042
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,039
and whatever they have in their own

1043
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,159
environment is is intelligent to that

1044
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,000
area

1045
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,838
you know to utilize plants that are

1046
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,639
growing really well and that are super

1047
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,119
healthy um we also you know with our

1048
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,879
pure certification we have to have you

1049
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,119
know people are looking for this at

1050
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,519
least six closed loops and creating your

1051
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,000
own nutrients and growing your own

1052
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,759
is a really big part of that loop and

1053
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,920
that's ever-changing depending on where

1054
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,040
you are you know if you're in arizona

1055
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,960
you're going to be utilizing a

1056
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,759
tremendous amount of prickly pear and

1057
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,159
cactus and different types of sage brush

1058
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,320
and it's incredible the nutrients that

1059
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,960
are available in those in those plants

1060
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,200
and and also the cyanobacteria

1061
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,199
that's on the outside of those leaves

1062
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,039
are are there for a reason they're there

1063
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,118
to keep the plant healthy during its

1064
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,759
life but they're also there to help

1065
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,000
digest it in in the time of its death or

1066
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,839
when the leaves drop to the ground so

1067
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,400
when you're collecting biomass in your

1068
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,480
area you're also collecting microbiology

1069
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,240
on the leaf structure as well

1070
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,000
so you know your teeth should be

1071
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,559
absolutely as intelligent as they

1072
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,920
possibly can be and that's going to come

1073
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:26,480
from your own property so we've we

1074
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,960
definitely have chosen the area that we

1075
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,119
live in for a reason because it is rich

1076
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,838
in biomass and we do really resonate

1077
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,160
with this area so that part is true we

1078
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,880
are really lucky where we live

1079
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,639
but um like kelly said and we we have

1080
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,559
traveled the world to a lot of different

1081
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,799
places we've worked in a lot of um you

1082
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,759
know international projects and in a

1083
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,079
disaster projects and we went to jamaica

1084
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,920
for a month this year and and worked

1085
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,640
with the the rasta village there and we

1086
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,519
worked with with um you know making

1087
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:00,000
biomass gardens um everywhere that we've

1088
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,920
gone in each country that we've gone to

1089
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,358
so we we don't think that it's it's

1090
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,358
something that just we do on our

1091
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,039
property we we say it's absolutely

1092
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:09,519
imperative for people to do it

1093
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:13,358
everywhere they are and every time we go

1094
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:15,280
somewhere we really um you know really

1095
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,039
look to the area as soon as we get there

1096
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,200
and say oh what can we use and what can

1097
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,599
we use there so yeah i i think that you

1098
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,358
can um get really creative and that's

1099
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
the thing about our pure certification

1100
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,639
as well

1101
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,640
and all of the farmers that that we that

1102
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,199
are are part of that movement and that

1103
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,440
regenerative movement of cannabis is

1104
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,598
that you know it's part it's part of

1105
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
connecting with your environment and

1106
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,079
that's the way that you can really

1107
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,880
really

1108
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,519
um ensure that you're you're getting

1109
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,280
clean inputs into your farm and we

1110
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,119
haven't talked about that yet but having

1111
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,079
clean inputs onto your farm is

1112
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,440
absolutely imperative and moving forward

1113
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,400
in the new legalization paradigm of

1114
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,159
cannabis um we have to be real extremely

1115
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,760
careful about the products that we bring

1116
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,440
into our property and i think that's

1117
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,720
been a big part of this

1118
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,039
regenerative cannabis uh movement is

1119
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,358
people that's why

1120
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,838
people have have started to grow more

1121
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,440
diversity on their property i mean part

1122
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,358
of being pure certified is you can't

1123
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,639
just have a cannabis farm you have to

1124
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,039
grow other

1125
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,279
other biomass like like kelly was saying

1126
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,719
and and and that's part of connecting

1127
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,160
with your land so trees and bushes and

1128
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:30,879
food grass and and even you know local

1129
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,960
livestock and stuff are a crucial part

1130
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,720
of building life on your farm even if

1131
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,519
you have an indoor operation you can

1132
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:40,318
still use you know the edges of you know

1133
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:42,559
the land around it to to make

1134
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,480
um you know mass for your gardens and

1135
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,318
and part of being regenerative is

1136
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,960
understanding the botany that grows

1137
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,719
around your region and your area and and

1138
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,119
a lot of people that call something

1139
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,039
maybe a noxious weed that's come in from

1140
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,640
an outside source

1141
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,960
those noxious weeds are there for a

1142
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,519
reason it's because they have found a

1143
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,639
home that is going to be able to

1144
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,519
help them express you know their true

1145
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,559
health

1146
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,719
and well-being and those can be utilized

1147
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,039
so much and then that helps

1148
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,879
down the noxious weeds in your area but

1149
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,800
then you're also utilizing them in your

1150
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,559
teas and we suggest to make sure to

1151
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,119
utilize those noxious weeds you know

1152
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,279
before they seed so that you're not

1153
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,720
continuing you know the propagation of

1154
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,359
them but if it's something that you have

1155
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,279
on your property of course use it you

1156
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,519
know in oregon and in northern

1157
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,920
california they have a tremendous amount

1158
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,719
of of a himalayan blackberry and an

1159
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,000
alpine blackberry it grows there like

1160
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,919
crazy

1161
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,880
but when you start looking at all of the

1162
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,519
nutritive capabilities that this plant

1163
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,760
has when you chop it up or you put it in

1164
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,599
a tea the amount of growth hormones that

1165
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,160
are in it then you have an understanding

1166
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,640
of why it's so noxious because it has

1167
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,679
such incredible capability to grow so

1168
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,159
fast

1169
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,919
in a really small space

1170
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,159
so we really encourage people to look

1171
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,318
around and understand the plant life

1172
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,759
that's around your area and then start

1173
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,519
picking and choosing what you want to

1174
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,720
propagate and also what you want to put

1175
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:13,679
into your teas or into your compost or

1176
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:16,959
chip up or put on the top as a mulch you

1177
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,078
know you could go on and on so i got a

1178
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,400
question where it's kind of like the

1179
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,920
devil's in the details but i guess what

1180
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
i'm wondering is

1181
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,760
would you want to say

1182
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,159
not use something which is kind of

1183
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,160
external but it would have been a waste

1184
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,759
anyway so what i'm getting at is i love

1185
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,039
to go down to my local coffee store and

1186
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,560
grab the coffee grinds you know it's

1187
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,480
just my plants love it when i talk dress

1188
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,480
it with them but i understand it brings

1189
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,480
with a myriad of questions you know like

1190
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,599
where's the beans is it gmo like you

1191
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,599
know all that type of stuff that comes

1192
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,800
along with it for those reasons is it

1193
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,160
just something you would look to avoid

1194
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,000
or are you okay with something like that

1195
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,358
where broadly speaking you are kind of

1196
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,280
using what would have otherwise been

1197
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,000
wasted

1198
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,119
well i mean we're living in a in a world

1199
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,440
of of international

1200
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,400
products and in an international world

1201
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,159
of food and if there's something that

1202
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
you feel like wow you know this would be

1203
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,159
really good for my farm definitely find

1204
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,440
out what the source is go all the way

1205
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,159
down with it but if you have an

1206
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,599
intuition that those coffee grounds are

1207
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,960
going to be great for your farm and you

1208
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,359
feel like it would be really helpful

1209
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,280
then it's good to take in a small amount

1210
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,679
of whatever said thing that you're

1211
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,319
bringing into your property and utilize

1212
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,919
it in a small area give like a trial of

1213
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,239
two to three weeks or something like

1214
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,639
that have a look at it and then say yeah

1215
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,279
my intuition is right because i believe

1216
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,679
with science and and and all of these

1217
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,319
tests and trials that we do involving

1218
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,799
science it's starting to take away

1219
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:43,199
you know our basic innate

1220
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,000
understanding of intuition

1221
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,159
and gardening is such an intuitive thing

1222
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,760
you know humans are of the earth plants

1223
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,000
are of the earth of course we

1224
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,560
communicate with each other of course

1225
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,800
we're having conversations on another

1226
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,799
level and we really encourage people to

1227
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,519
have those conversations with your land

1228
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,200
and your soil and the plants around you

1229
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,800
and and also the inputs that you're

1230
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,679
going to be able to bring in it's it's a

1231
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,440
really

1232
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,919
an individual

1233
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
matter but also whatever inputs that

1234
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,960
you're bringing in make sure that you

1235
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,598
feel really good about it and that your

1236
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,000
intuition is right and it is sound to

1237
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,680
create an a good ultimate immune

1238
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,559
response and wherever you're putting it

1239
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,078
and for me it brings up you know another

1240
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,000
question is

1241
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,079
number one where are you in the world

1242
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,599
and of course we always

1243
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,680
you know

1244
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,440
we always talk about being crafty and

1245
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,358
and you know you we have to be

1246
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,960
resourceful and use you know what's in

1247
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:37,920
our area

1248
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,838
and

1249
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,639
depending on where you live in the world

1250
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:45,599
and with cannabis especially it is a

1251
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:48,078
dynamic accumulator accumulates stuff

1252
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,079
out of the soil so depending on what

1253
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,039
level of scrutiny you have i mean

1254
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,359
there's

1255
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,639
some farms that can't

1256
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:58,159
use

1257
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:00,239
you know municipality um compost like

1258
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,719
from different cities because of

1259
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:06,000
different sprays that might be used you

1260
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:08,559
know on the roadside if they used that

1261
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,559
compost thinking oh geez you know

1262
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,799
our city produces compost and i just

1263
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,960
want to use compost from my city it just

1264
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,519
only makes all the sense in the world

1265
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,440
like on a human level yeah it does make

1266
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,559
sense but if on on an actual reality of

1267
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,440
testing

1268
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,318
you could potentially fail tests with

1269
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,480
cannabis by using bad

1270
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,440
inputs so yeah i mean you have to be

1271
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,838
really

1272
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,838
pretty mindful in certain places in

1273
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:38,239
other places you know it only makes

1274
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,318
sense to use what's around you and also

1275
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,919
to add to what you know josh was just

1276
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,000
saying is that there's a tremendous

1277
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,159
amount you know in north america right

1278
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,079
now and also in other parts of the world

1279
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,838
of the use of glyphosate

1280
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,680
and glyphosate is not something that's

1281
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,440
even being tested because department of

1282
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:56,000
ags all over the world and these really

1283
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,159
large multinational multi-international

1284
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,400
corporations feel like glyphosate is

1285
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,879
totally healthy and that you know we

1286
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,200
should be able to drink it so why is it

1287
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,119
a problem but we're finding it more and

1288
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,759
more along the roadsides we're finding

1289
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,838
it everywhere and then prolonged use in

1290
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,760
your soil beds is going to kill your

1291
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:19,039
microbiology it is an herbicide and an

1292
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,839
herbicide you know kills all different

1293
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,159
types of microbiology and it has a huge

1294
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,679
long life you know the half-life they're

1295
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,000
saying now you know they've already

1296
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,318
negated at least 10 times over so the

1297
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
truth is that we don't really know how

1298
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,480
long those half-lifes are of these

1299
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,159
horrible chemicals and over prolonged

1300
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,079
use in your gardens you're going to be

1301
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,318
killing all of your microbiology which

1302
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,560
is going against everything that you

1303
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,000
began by being able to bring in those

1304
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,239
inputs so

1305
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,318
it's a really it's a difficult question

1306
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,959
yeah if you have an indoor garden you

1307
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,559
may not have as a

1308
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,519
soil that's as

1309
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,279
vigorous as an outdoor garden an outdoor

1310
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,838
garden you have the ability to create a

1311
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,599
ton of biomass and a ton of microbiology

1312
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,639
and if you're if you're

1313
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,039
positive microbiology outweighs

1314
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,358
the little bit of toxins that you might

1315
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:10,960
be getting from an inorganic coffee

1316
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,799
thing that it would probably might it

1317
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,880
might remediate it

1318
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,720
but if you get anything out of balance

1319
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,039
you could throw that off and kill the

1320
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,118
microbiology like what kelly's saying

1321
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,558
and we're not really believing that you

1322
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,559
know

1323
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,119
nature and microbiology

1324
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,920
um you know are not very good at

1325
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,160
remediating horrible toxins on the

1326
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,720
planet any better than we're able to

1327
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,960
remediate those toxins when we ingest it

1328
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,279
and we always go back to human health

1329
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,240
soil health plant health it's just all

1330
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,760
the same

1331
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,199
so whenever there's information out

1332
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,359
there in the science world and you're

1333
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,838
looking up a particular

1334
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,318
product or something or or

1335
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,880
some kind of an input look at all of the

1336
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,119
human health that it has attached to it

1337
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,119
as well you know take the time to google

1338
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,039
all of that information and go deeper

1339
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,880
affects pollinators and it affects

1340
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,039
pollinators or how it affects our own

1341
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,280
immune response

1342
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,800
yeah okay that's very interesting so

1343
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,640
i want to know then

1344
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,480
if i so for example here in australia

1345
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,239
glyphosate is incredibly widely used

1346
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,920
there's almost no concern about it at

1347
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,919
least in the sense their ways in the

1348
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,760
states which is a little alarming but

1349
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,280
essentially if i was to buy a new

1350
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,800
property and move on there i would you

1351
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,760
know bet my left leg that it's been

1352
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,240
sprayed down with glyphosate a lot so

1353
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,599
you know obviously you know the details

1354
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,039
would give the specifics of this

1355
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,640
situation but if you had to give a rule

1356
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,358
of thumb how long would you think it

1357
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:35,679
would take for me to kind of buy or

1358
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,880
that uh kind of land i bought and more

1359
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,480
importantly would you be okay with say

1360
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,920
consuming the first crop produced on

1361
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,440
that land or would you want to do some

1362
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,680
work first before you were feeling

1363
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,920
comfortable about that

1364
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:48,960
i would i would start um to sort of

1365
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,720
begin

1366
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,280
the the question that where you started

1367
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:55,759
at the end there was i would definitely

1368
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,680
start bio remediation with plant matter

1369
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,119
that wasn't vegetables that i would be

1370
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,279
eating

1371
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,358
as far as a time period of how long that

1372
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,519
would take to remediate it i mean

1373
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,279
possibly your whole lives and and your

1374
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,599
grandchildren's lives that's something

1375
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,599
that we just don't know because the

1376
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,838
information that we're getting is so

1377
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,079
one-sided because it's all being put out

1378
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,279
by the makers of this particular product

1379
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,318
so they've got

1380
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,680
you know

1381
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:20,639
a real

1382
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,318
uh

1383
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,639
investment to make sure that the

1384
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,639
scientific research goes along the way

1385
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,879
that they would like it to go along but

1386
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,199
we know for sure that heavily laden

1387
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,200
glyphosate areas you just simply put a

1388
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:34,558
pea in there or a bean

1389
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,558
it won't grow

1390
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,640
they don't you know those are kind of

1391
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,519
plants that don't do very well with

1392
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,239
herbicide before you buy the property

1393
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,039
go

1394
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,959
try and plant peas on it

1395
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,239
because peas are one of those they're

1396
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,639
they're they're one of the most

1397
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,078
susceptible things to herbicides so you

1398
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,239
just be like you know what i just can i

1399
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,920
plant a row of peas here right now and

1400
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,358
come back a week later and if they've

1401
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,200
sprouted then you've got something you

1402
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,598
can work with but if they do don't

1403
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,919
sprout and there's no reason for it

1404
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,160
you might seriously consider it and we

1405
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,838
and we totally tell people to test the

1406
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,159
soil for sure if you're going to buy a

1407
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,078
piece of land you can test it in and

1408
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,759
with glyphosate like i know i i'm not

1409
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,119
sure exactly about soil tests in

1410
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,160
australia but

1411
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,000
um

1412
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,639
there'll be soil tests that have you

1413
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,880
know 30 different you know pesticides

1414
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,759
and herbicides that they test for but

1415
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,519
glyphosate will not be one of them for

1416
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,599
the same reason that you just said

1417
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:32,400
because you know they think oh you know

1418
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,160
you can dump you know glyphosate in your

1419
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,079
cheetos in the morning and it's totally

1420
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,879
fine um but

1421
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,839
um

1422
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,480
so

1423
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:43,519
you you really have to be you know very

1424
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,400
mindful of what you're using

1425
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,759
and and get a soil test

1426
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,599
so the

1427
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,200
kind of in related to all of this stuff

1428
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,039
the first thing i'll add is that i think

1429
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,519
unfortunately in australia soil tests

1430
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,079
are quite cost prohibitive like i think

1431
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,559
um to get a fairly basic one you're

1432
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,559
probably looking at around 150 to 200

1433
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,839
which i think that's some tests in the

1434
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,440
states are like that expensive but it

1435
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:06,639
certainly seems very expensive here

1436
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,480
especially considering you know we're in

1437
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:09,440
like an illegal market

1438
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,960
but um

1439
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,960
something i did wanted to ask you guys

1440
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,599
about was just the interesting range of

1441
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,838
soil additives you have in that

1442
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,760
excuse me the cocoa that's the one which

1443
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,039
the cocoa sorry um that's the one which

1444
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,119
grabs my interest the most you know

1445
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,639
because it's like you see alfalfa you

1446
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,680
see you see a lot of stuff being used by

1447
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,118
a lot of people and i think that you

1448
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,118
guys use all of that stuff in a really

1449
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,720
interesting way but the coco the kokoa

1450
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,920
was the one which really grabbed my

1451
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,838
interest because you just you don't see

1452
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,039
it outside of your products so how did

1453
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,358
you come up with that and what was kind

1454
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,440
of the rationale behind it

1455
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,598
well the rationale is when you look at a

1456
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,000
plant and you see a plant through its

1457
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,240
whole cycle it starts out as a sprout

1458
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,679
first of all it starts as a seed and the

1459
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:52,479
seed has all the vast nutrients that are

1460
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,558
available it almost becomes like a micro

1461
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,679
superfood a seed does because it

1462
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,599
contains

1463
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,358
everything that that plant should

1464
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,440
contain in

1465
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:03,279
and then once it grows out then it

1466
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,400
starts to have other different kinds of

1467
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,400
nutrients like say nitrogen and calcium

1468
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,599
and then as the plant starts growing out

1469
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,079
even more

1470
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,559
it's up taking different minerals and

1471
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,039
different nutrients from the soil

1472
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,880
throughout its entire life cycle and we

1473
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,480
know that for cannabis you know we add a

1474
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,640
lot of nitrogen at the beginning and

1475
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,318
then we move to their phosphorus and

1476
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,118
potassium and phosphorus and that sort

1477
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,880
of thing well plants are no different in

1478
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,119
in the wild so

1479
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,039
they're uptaking you know basic

1480
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,760
nutrients at the beginning and then when

1481
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:39,199
they turn into a seed form like the

1482
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,119
cacao then it starts to become a very

1483
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,879
nutrient dense

1484
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,280
uh

1485
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,119
product or or you know in this case it

1486
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,960
was a product but you know nutrient

1487
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,318
dense part of the plant

1488
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,199
a cacao

1489
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,159
uh

1490
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:57,759
mines a tremendous amount of magnesium

1491
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:59,920
and manganese and copper out of the soil

1492
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,880
and had a million other you know and a

1493
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,960
million other things so we utilize the

1494
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,960
raw cacao because when you test raw

1495
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,760
cacao it has a tremendous amount of

1496
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,599
nutrients that helps a plant finish

1497
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,960
because it's the finishing part of the

1498
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,039
cacao tree

1499
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,280
it's no different than say you know

1500
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:20,079
you're utilizing maybe sesame seeds are

1501
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,200
going to contain a lot more finishing

1502
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,680
compounds and minerals and nutrients in

1503
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,759
it than the first sprout of that

1504
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,000
particular sesame and that's why we use

1505
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,599
spirulina in our radiant green in the in

1506
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,679
the vegetative one

1507
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,200
because you know nothing's

1508
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,799
more nutritive than one celled organisms

1509
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,639
and algaes so

1510
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,800
you know the raw cacao has a wide

1511
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,279
variety of trace minerals and and

1512
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,920
nutrients and vitamins at the very end

1513
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,200
and this and also the wild yam is one

1514
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,039
that you did

1515
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,318
did you want us to talk about more of

1516
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,480
the

1517
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,000
ingredients yeah yeah i'd love to hear

1518
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,639
more about it especially what i wanted

1519
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,079
to hear was um what organic ingredients

1520
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,279
you look to for phosphorus because

1521
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,800
phosphorus is one of those ones where

1522
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,800
it's a little less common to come by

1523
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,119
phosphorus can definitely be mined up in

1524
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,880
a plant there's lots of different plants

1525
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,960
that are going to contain phosphorus and

1526
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,519
like i was saying before it's going to

1527
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,079
be the ending part of the plant that's

1528
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,199
going to have the most phosphorus so

1529
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,640
tubers

1530
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,480
wild yam has you know phosphorus as well

1531
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,358
as like yams that you eat out of the

1532
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,159
ground potatoes have a lot of phosphorus

1533
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:32,078
in our products we utilize burdock root

1534
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:34,719
and the reason why we utilize burdock

1535
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:38,480
root is just 5 000 years of ancient

1536
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:40,399
chinese history you know of of of

1537
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,000
healing of the body

1538
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,519
and like i had said before we always

1539
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,760
look at the healing of the body the same

1540
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,318
as healing of the plant and burdock has

1541
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,799
so many healing modalities because of

1542
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,798
the tremendous amount of nutrients in it

1543
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,880
and one of the nutrients in there that's

1544
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,759
so rich is phosphorus

1545
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,680
so rather than getting mined phosphorus

1546
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,480
or phosphorus that really leeches out

1547
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:05,118
into the soil you know you can add rock

1548
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,679
phosphate and you're going to lose about

1549
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,358
80 percent of that rock phosphate

1550
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:13,598
whereas if you

1551
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:16,078
feed phosphorus rich plants tubers seeds

1552
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,760
finishing parts of the plant and you

1553
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,680
feed it to the microbiology then it

1554
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,480
becomes immediately available to the

1555
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,639
plant

1556
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,318
and phosphorus is one of those ones that

1557
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,558
you know can be found like i said in the

1558
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:29,440
finishing party and also a big a big

1559
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:32,480
part of our um you know practices that

1560
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,400
we that we promote is is having a you

1561
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,159
know a type of

1562
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,798
soil that has a lot of compost in it

1563
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:41,279
that's composting and living

1564
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:43,838
and the the breakdown of of

1565
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,920
of leaf mold leaf matter and and

1566
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,920
different stuff like that produces

1567
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,039
phosphorus in the soil so we really

1568
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,880
believe that you know having an active

1569
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,838
soil that's being that's breaking down

1570
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,960
is producing enough phosphorus we don't

1571
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:01,039
actually we never use more phosphorus

1572
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,000
ever on our property than what's

1573
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:06,558
produced just by our soils and these

1574
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,039
plants and and the seeds and the the

1575
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,040
roots that we use so and turkey rhubarb

1576
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:13,119
is another one in there for the last 20

1577
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:16,239
years we've been growing you know in a

1578
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,480
way that we don't utilize any of those

1579
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,279
bat guano phosphoruses and it's like

1580
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,599
this

1581
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,400
thing which is rock phosphate anyway

1582
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,240
yeah actually it's not in the baguano so

1583
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,880
just having a really active soil and

1584
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:31,118
then using roots and seeds which is the

1585
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,358
ending product of the plant um provides

1586
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,160
the phosphorus potassium

1587
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:36,078
um

1588
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,000
you know manganese and and all that

1589
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,680
stuff that we need and josh just create

1590
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,599
the flower josh has touched on something

1591
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,399
that we feel is like incredibly

1592
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,559
important is the use of trees

1593
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,119
the use of tree leaves

1594
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,119
trees the ultimate miners

1595
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,680
they send down their roots as tall as

1596
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,440
they are you know they're mining all

1597
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,279
kinds of things in the soil and then

1598
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,880
they bring them up into their leaves and

1599
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,880
then they drop their leaves and i'm

1600
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,880
talking about deciduous trees in this

1601
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,119
particular instance not eucalyptus of

1602
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,400
course they don't use any eucalyptus

1603
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,400
anything

1604
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,039
and so they they take all of the

1605
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,039
nutrients up into the tree and then they

1606
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,558
drop all of those and then the cycle

1607
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,838
continues again

1608
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:20,559
so utilizing tree leaves um you know

1609
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:22,159
contain an incredible amount of fuel

1610
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,839
term minerals and phosphorus is

1611
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:25,440
definitely one

1612
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:26,880
and is that something when you say the

1613
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,639
tree leaves you're referring to like a

1614
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,280
leaf mold type of thing or just a direct

1615
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,440
top dressing type of a situation

1616
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,200
yeah you can direct top dress um because

1617
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,358
it's gonna turn into leaf mold

1618
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:40,000
immediately anyway

1619
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,078
we we now look at our beds like these

1620
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
living beings like i we had opened up

1621
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,640
the conversation to begin with you know

1622
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
so we're always layering things on top

1623
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,598
of our beds

1624
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,920
making sure that we're not layering

1625
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,920
anything that would turn it hot

1626
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,838
you know we don't want necessarily hot

1627
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,400
composting to be happening in the beds

1628
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,239
but we certainly want cold composting to

1629
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,960
be happening in the beds

1630
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,558
and the beautiful thing about nature

1631
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,880
is that especially when you're in an

1632
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,119
area that has seasons

1633
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,160
everything is available all at the right

1634
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,119
time

1635
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:15,679
and then when the seasons come it it it

1636
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,240
provides the nutrients that your gardens

1637
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:20,639
need at that time you know all of the

1638
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,558
flowers start coming out and the seeds

1639
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,078
and the tubers start coming out right at

1640
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,480
the same time that your plants are

1641
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,400
needing phosphorus that your tomatoes

1642
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,760
are needing phosphorus to produce juicy

1643
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,079
tomatoes

1644
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,079
there's some kind of a beauty in the

1645
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,200
cycles of nature and if we just pay

1646
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:39,760
attention then it's all there for us i

1647
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:42,318
mean you know permaculture did come out

1648
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,160
of tasmania in so many ways and

1649
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,719
in australia and there's there's plenty

1650
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:47,679
of examples you know across the

1651
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,519
you know

1652
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,838
across the country there in the in the

1653
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:53,838
continent that that show is really

1654
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,599
similar to what we're talking about

1655
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,199
yeah definitely definitely there's a a

1656
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,760
lot of really good gardeners shout out

1657
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,598
to steve solomon in tasmania

1658
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,760
um so

1659
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,039
yeah he's a big guru so

1660
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,480
something i wanted to ask you is i'd

1661
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,318
noticed that over say the past three or

1662
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,880
four years there had been this kind of

1663
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:12,880
unspoken trend within the no-till scene

1664
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,559
so to speak that there'd been there'd

1665
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,358
been a move away from animal products

1666
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,798
and

1667
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:18,318
especially you know in terms of like

1668
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:19,759
amendments and so the question which i

1669
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:21,440
was wondering is

1670
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,040
do you think that it's the case that

1671
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,480
we've just found better replacements or

1672
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,079
it's more a case that there's also an

1673
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,880
underlying objection to you know like

1674
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,760
the raising and the slaughtering

1675
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,640
um

1676
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,200
well

1677
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:35,598
all of it so to answer that question i i

1678
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:38,239
always say to people okay so what does

1679
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:41,039
it look like on a hot summer day when

1680
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:43,279
you throw a steak out on the lawn that's

1681
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,920
raw and then you leave it there for a

1682
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,680
week or if you throw an apple out on the

1683
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,720
lawn and then you leave it there for a

1684
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,039
week

1685
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:54,239
what kind of different bacteria and

1686
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:56,480
fungi are going to overtake that to be

1687
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,159
able to digest it down and basically

1688
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,199
turn it into soil

1689
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,879
the meat is going to have incredibly

1690
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:07,118
aggressive

1691
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,358
anaerobic fungi and bacteria bugs and

1692
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,240
worms and maggots

1693
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,318
yeah i mean it could be fun watch it

1694
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:16,719
it's going to draw a tremendous amount

1695
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,079
of pathogens in order for it to become

1696
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,078
beneficial

1697
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,000
whereas the apple that's like you know

1698
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,839
being digested on the lawn there in the

1699
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,960
hot summer day is going to just start

1700
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,519
drawing

1701
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,599
all of these beautiful

1702
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,519
things that turn white and you could you

1703
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,240
know things meaning microbiology it's

1704
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,759
great fungi and and different bacteria

1705
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,598
and you could almost take that rotting

1706
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,799
apple and you know put it right into

1707
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,400
your soil

1708
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,719
you know i don't necessarily suggest

1709
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,400
this but then that would be come you

1710
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,639
know a beneficial colony you really

1711
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,440
couldn't take the steak and put it into

1712
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,798
there

1713
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,000
at all so

1714
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,880
we haven't used animal products

1715
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,719
ever

1716
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,720
it's just not we've been growing for

1717
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,118
almost three decades

1718
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,959
and and we haven't utilized any animal

1719
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,720
products other than manure that's you

1720
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,039
know from our own farm here you know

1721
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:05,919
that's all grass-fed no grain

1722
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,719
um

1723
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,358
because we feel like the pathogens that

1724
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,879
break down that animal matter is just

1725
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:15,279
not something that we want to bring into

1726
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,280
our gardens and nor do we like

1727
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,359
to support something

1728
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,839
that is unkind or harmful to the planet

1729
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,679
yeah and through soil testing i mean you

1730
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:28,239
when you're doing no-till you're doing

1731
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:29,440
something that's that's continuous

1732
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,759
you know where you're using the same

1733
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,358
stuff for a long time you know you do

1734
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,599
have to be mindful of what you put in

1735
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,598
there and just like kelly said you know

1736
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,680
certain animal products

1737
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,079
just don't have the same kind of

1738
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,598
longevity that you're going for

1739
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,440
and that's why the forest is so

1740
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,960
beautiful because you know it really

1741
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,880
shows the power of of plant medicine and

1742
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,039
and how well it can do

1743
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,838
and also you know organic farmers here

1744
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,640
in

1745
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,239
in

1746
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,759
north america

1747
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,719
to be certified organic on a vegetable

1748
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,640
farm

1749
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,598
they use a tremendous amount of blood

1750
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:09,838
and bone meal like a tremendous amount

1751
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,920
and when you test that blood and bone

1752
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,318
meal the glyphosate levels are really

1753
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,200
high because the cows are eating the

1754
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,480
grain that's glyphosate laden and also

1755
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,679
they're eating the grass that's

1756
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,000
glyphosate laden and that's bringing all

1757
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,798
of that into so you're not only bringing

1758
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,318
possible pathogenic nutrients into your

1759
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,079
property but you're also bringing a

1760
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:31,838
tremendous amount of glyphosate and who

1761
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,798
knows what else

1762
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:34,480
so

1763
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:36,480
you know

1764
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,559
really supporting the slaughterhouses is

1765
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,318
not something that we feel like we want

1766
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,920
to touch at all we don't want to support

1767
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:43,599
those slaughterhouses and we really

1768
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,798
don't want to support the microbiology

1769
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,798
that it takes to break down those

1770
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,759
slaughterhouses we're also really

1771
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:52,079
careful with plants like neem and

1772
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,119
karanja and different you know seed

1773
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,880
meals that haven't also lasted very well

1774
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,960
in soil

1775
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,000
that's interesting so you guys are not

1776
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,599
big fans of neem

1777
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,119
well i mean

1778
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,559
you know there's

1779
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:10,400
neat the neem tree is phenomenal

1780
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,798
and so of course you know we love the

1781
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,400
neem tree and you know to take neem you

1782
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,400
know there's neem tease and knee

1783
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,838
medicine is is a good thing

1784
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,920
it's just also you know it's it's

1785
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:25,199
it's not something that promotes

1786
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,720
you know by microbiology in the soil

1787
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,838
and um

1788
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,959
it's a volatile oil so you know anything

1789
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:34,078
that has

1790
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,679
any plants that have large aromatics you

1791
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,839
have to be really careful about what

1792
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,798
those aromatics are you know if you're

1793
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,199
going to

1794
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,559
break down a ton of geranium you know

1795
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,719
you might really want to think of

1796
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:47,519
putting a ton of geranium into your

1797
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:50,239
soils because it contains high geranol

1798
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:52,400
and geranol is great to get rid of pests

1799
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,719
and you know pathogens possibly on the

1800
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,720
leaf source or maybe in the soil but if

1801
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,798
you're utilizing it over a long period

1802
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:00,639
of time then your beneficials aren't

1803
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,318
going to be like yay this is an awesome

1804
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:04,960
soil to be in because there's just such

1805
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,759
a vast amount of volatile oils

1806
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:11,199
so we really stay away from you know

1807
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:14,079
eucalyptus or black walnut or even neem

1808
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:16,879
in large amounts or karanja or any of

1809
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,079
these like super volatile oil plants

1810
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,160
it's not a way that we want to deal with

1811
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,480
the pathogens that those are trying to

1812
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,639
kill so that we're we'll use predators

1813
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,559
for that instead so we we don't need to

1814
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:29,759
top dress with neem and those kind of

1815
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,519
things because

1816
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,079
we know that the neem is going to kill

1817
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,838
other microbiology because we work with

1818
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,798
you know a lot of people that you know

1819
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,880
do soil testing all the time and and and

1820
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:43,038
we've that we they've shown that you

1821
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,960
know and so

1822
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,720
that's not a thing that we use and we've

1823
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,838
always felt like that kind of weary

1824
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,279
about it

1825
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:53,519
okay and so in general do you veer more

1826
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,680
towards wanting to have say a bacterial

1827
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,599
dominant soil a fungal dominant soil or

1828
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,118
just a kind of a one-to-one type of

1829
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,039
ratio

1830
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,720
always a blend

1831
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,480
always a blend you definitely want to

1832
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,078
have your bacteria is just going to last

1833
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,000
in there for a short time so it's

1834
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,798
awesome that your bacteria that your

1835
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,039
teas are super bacteria rich

1836
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,038
and that your soils are really fun fungi

1837
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:17,039
rich so that the bacteria is going to

1838
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,359
stay in there long enough just to break

1839
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,240
down that green material the leaf

1840
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:24,159
material light material and then be able

1841
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,639
to give it to the plant but you know the

1842
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:29,118
prolonged breakdown of the soil is

1843
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,920
definitely you know our fungi friends

1844
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,480
it's almost easy to get the bacteria so

1845
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,720
it's not you know it's it's you we

1846
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,960
with hugo culture and with you know

1847
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:41,118
carbon sequestration and

1848
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,079
carbon farming is is really to attract

1849
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,358
fungi so we're we're really kind of

1850
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:49,359
doing all we can to get more fungi into

1851
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,480
our soils because through a lot of soil

1852
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,078
testing

1853
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,400
um you know you'd find that there's

1854
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,119
lower fungal mass and there is

1855
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,119
bacterial you know mass so we you know

1856
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,720
that's why we're adding biomass so much

1857
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,119
to our soils is

1858
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:06,719
the the fungi really interact with the

1859
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:09,119
roots and to directly feed the plant and

1860
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,439
you're feeding a lot of soil fungi by

1861
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:14,079
feeding it bacteria so there's a whole

1862
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,400
lot of really awesome fungi that eats

1863
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,640
bacteria directly that have you know

1864
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,880
this beautiful relationship with the top

1865
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:23,118
layer is totally bacteria rich and then

1866
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,480
as you go down lower you've got more

1867
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:29,599
fungi so that's why adding more you know

1868
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,358
bacteria-rich compounds throughout the

1869
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,039
time to make sort of a calm cold

1870
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:35,038
composting in your

1871
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,960
in your soil beds is a great idea

1872
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,119
because then in time that bacteria top

1873
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,358
layer is going to turn into a fungi rich

1874
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,798
lower layer yeah i mean you can add

1875
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:44,960
anything hard and you're going to get

1876
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,038
more carbon more sticks

1877
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,039
you know a little stick maybe stocks

1878
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,280
from your previous harvest you could

1879
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,079
work into the top part of your soil

1880
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,400
um or even adding for a you know

1881
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,240
pre-made soil of people that have indoor

1882
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,798
adding sawdust

1883
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,318
to your to your soil is great as well

1884
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:06,239
you know when you're having a pre-mixed

1885
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:07,519
soil or some wood chips yeah deciduous

1886
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,519
because then you're not dealing with the

1887
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,519
acidity but it but if it's really old

1888
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:15,199
then the acidity you know goes away as

1889
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:16,639
well that's a whole other conversation

1890
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,879
there's so much

1891
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,199
yeah yeah i mean something which kind of

1892
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,440
i think is an overall topic of this

1893
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,558
whole kind of thread is and i've seen

1894
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,240
you reference it on a few different

1895
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,559
youtube videos there's kind of this

1896
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,719
conundrum of organic certification

1897
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,160
organic labels you know just that the

1898
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,399
whole the holiday thing it's like it's

1899
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,239
like a minefield these days so with that

1900
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,079
being said are you happy to use

1901
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:39,598
something which is not strictly organic

1902
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,640
so long as you're confident it's kind of

1903
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,640
beneficial in some way or another

1904
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:46,078
yeah absolutely there's a lot of people

1905
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:47,519
and a lot of farmers out there in the

1906
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,440
world that don't want to have anything

1907
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,358
to do with a certification

1908
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,639
even if they're an alfalfa farmer

1909
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:54,719
because they don't feel like their

1910
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:57,118
regenerative practices are

1911
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:59,118
representative that certification and

1912
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,720
unfortunately it's like there's not many

1913
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,318
certifications

1914
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:03,919
and that's the reason why we came up

1915
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:07,199
with the peer certification is because

1916
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:10,480
we just felt really sort of angry

1917
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:12,558
really upset with what the commonality

1918
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,480
of what people saw as organic and if it

1919
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,719
had that label on it then oh that's good

1920
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,198
enough for me but when you start reading

1921
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,960
into it you know 30 of your inputs can

1922
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,198
be non-organic and then there's a whole

1923
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,198
list of pesticides you can add and a

1924
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:27,119
whole list of herbicides and

1925
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,198
all different kinds of things that are

1926
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:32,479
underneath that and like you said yeah

1927
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:34,318
it started out like in in the u.s with

1928
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,119
the oregon tilth and they did a really

1929
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,920
good job but now they can't utilize that

1930
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:42,719
term organic unless it's along with the

1931
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,440
usda organic or the canadian organic

1932
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,520
standards and certifications so yeah i i

1933
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,399
say it depends because it's kind of a

1934
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,960
know your farmer situation i mean if you

1935
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,198
find yourself in the countryside

1936
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,520
and you've got in your area someone

1937
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,960
who's been farming you know a certain

1938
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,880
way their whole time and they just

1939
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,319
didn't want to go bother

1940
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,880
going through and buying the

1941
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:08,239
certification and getting that kind of

1942
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,239
um you know validation then i mean we

1943
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,158
would say use that because that farmer

1944
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:14,639
is probably just more

1945
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,479
radical to keep it natural than someone

1946
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,400
who's part of the system it's almost

1947
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,798
like when you're part of the system you

1948
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,439
have to question it more so it's kind of

1949
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:25,519
really knowing your source you know of

1950
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:27,838
where it's coming from and now there's

1951
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,080
been this incredible

1952
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:32,000
movement of power in the peer

1953
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:34,399
certification because pure farmers are

1954
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,798
now joining together and going out onto

1955
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:39,920
farmer's plots and saying hey

1956
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:41,920
we'll buy all of your hay or your straw

1957
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,158
every single bit of it if you don't

1958
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,798
spray it and you add these things to it

1959
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:48,559
and you let all of the weeds grow so now

1960
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,039
the farmer is getting a higher price

1961
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,239
from pure farmers and that's just like

1962
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:55,840
sacred commerce that creates

1963
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,319
knowing your source you're actually

1964
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,640
creating knowing yourself powers your

1965
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,799
alfalfa farmer and empowers your field

1966
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,760
farmer who may not have had a reason to

1967
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,360
care

1968
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,000
that person might have just been like oh

1969
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:09,679
you know what the farmers these bigger

1970
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,359
companies are just they just pay me and

1971
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,119
then i just do it and they give me seed

1972
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:15,198
i don't have to think about it but you

1973
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,359
might have farmers that you know

1974
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,759
if they were if they had a community of

1975
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:22,399
people that were like listen we value

1976
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,640
you not using any chemicals on your

1977
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:28,000
products or on your field you know we'll

1978
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,560
pay this specific price and then farmers

1979
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,079
now have an incentive to to

1980
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,480
to grow you know their their their their

1981
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,800
alfalfa in a good way and that's why the

1982
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:41,119
pure farmers are making an impact not

1983
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,119
just on their farm but but even way

1984
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:45,238
farther and we encourage the listeners

1985
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,800
to look up dem

1986
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:48,639
purefarms.com

1987
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,960
which is a website that we've created

1988
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,440
which highlights um close the closed

1989
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,399
loop practices that we talk about and

1990
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,719
the farms that that do those practices

1991
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,879
and shows those farms and in the

1992
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:03,439
different states so when you say is it

1993
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,600
just us on our farm no you can see you

1994
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,839
know close to 80 different examples of

1995
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,079
other people doing it in in different

1996
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,920
places in the world

1997
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,640
there's mostly in the us and canada at

1998
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,560
this moment and and this certification

1999
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,360
you know that we're talking about is a

2000
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,039
movement it's an activist movement it's

2001
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,759
not something you can even buy it

2002
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,719
doesn't cost anything it's free

2003
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,719
and it's in its community run in that we

2004
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,719
don't decide the final

2005
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,600
you know if somebody is looking to be

2006
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,279
pure certified we set the standards and

2007
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,679
we and we sort of set it out but it

2008
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:40,000
becomes a community brain and a mind so

2009
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:42,158
that say somebody in humboldt is wanting

2010
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,158
to be certified well all of the pure

2011
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,000
farmers in humboldt are the ones that go

2012
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:47,439
to that farm and make a decision on

2013
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,119
whether it is

2014
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:51,039
matching their farm and whether they

2015
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:53,599
feel like it's the same standard as

2016
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,079
their farm and in that it creates

2017
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,920
community and more of a conversation so

2018
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,920
that we can all get better

2019
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,880
and that goes into your conversation

2020
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,880
about sourcing just right back at it if

2021
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,719
there's more people trying to source the

2022
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,920
same thing then we know exactly where

2023
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,760
we're getting it from and we know

2024
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,440
exactly what it contains and you know

2025
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,560
i'll just i'll just make the point that

2026
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:15,119
you know we

2027
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,400
we love ganja and when we smoke it we we

2028
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:18,719
feel like

2029
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:21,279
in harmony with nature and we have that

2030
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:24,800
connection of naturalness and and and to

2031
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:27,359
be a naturalist and so we we really

2032
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,840
it is an activist movement just to just

2033
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,519
make the impact as widespread as

2034
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,400
possible and that that that's really

2035
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,080
what this is and it is really exciting

2036
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,759
and it's nice to have something exciting

2037
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,198
in a time when you know there's a lot of

2038
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,520
doom and gloom

2039
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:43,198
yeah of course and so i think the thing

2040
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,320
which you touched on and which appeals

2041
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:45,759
to me the most about the pure

2042
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,639
certification is that yeah there's

2043
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,360
there's the kind of uh community

2044
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,679
responsibility aspect to it all do you

2045
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:55,519
think that that same kind of philosophy

2046
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,880
needs to be extended to more parts of

2047
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,960
the movement and i guess the thing which

2048
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,119
jumps to mind to me the most is kind of

2049
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,158
the activism within say the legal sector

2050
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,039
you know do you think there needs to be

2051
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:07,119
that same kind of onus on ourselves to

2052
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,920
kind of take responsibility for the

2053
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:12,800
things we want to see happen in a way

2054
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,640
absolutely cannabis is not just a plant

2055
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,360
it's a culture and it doesn't matter

2056
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,600
where you are on the planet it's so cool

2057
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,359
i mean so many listeners out there and

2058
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,520
i'm sure you would feel the same way you

2059
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,960
know you could go anywhere in the world

2060
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,640
and you're seeing somebody that's

2061
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,800
totally different from a totally

2062
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,119
different place from a totally different

2063
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,679
you know whatever different age group or

2064
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:36,000
different socioeconomic group or or

2065
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:39,600
possibly a different race or whatever

2066
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,840
but if you have cannabis in in common

2067
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,840
all of a sudden that they're a dude

2068
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,840
that's like great you know you're just

2069
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,000
like all of a sudden friends with that

2070
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:51,039
person and i believe that

2071
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,039
that camaraderie and that family energy

2072
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,920
and culture of cannabis

2073
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:58,158
absolutely needs to be in the forefront

2074
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,399
having a rightful voice for this plant

2075
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:03,359
that has given us so much

2076
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:06,000
you know when we ingest it it gives us

2077
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:08,559
uh you know a higher understanding of

2078
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,119
nature and and more of a community

2079
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,440
mindset and i think that that community

2080
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,039
mindset is everything that we need to be

2081
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,759
able to move forward both in the

2082
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:20,158
political sector and also all the way

2083
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,400
down to the cultivation sector

2084
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,960
yeah and then and and i will and i will

2085
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:27,198
say that this this movement has gone you

2086
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,679
know political and and we do have

2087
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:32,079
friends and family that are working in

2088
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,440
in politics and

2089
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:37,039
i don't want to say the word politics

2090
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:38,319
but influencing laws and and

2091
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,158
and

2092
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,799
you know give thanks give thanks to them

2093
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:45,679
and regulations and stuff and so and and

2094
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,239
it's also just in in cafes and even

2095
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:50,079
beyond like and midwifery is something

2096
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,479
that's really important to us you know

2097
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,960
and there's just a lot of things that

2098
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:57,839
see this kind of movement this pure kind

2099
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,760
of movement as more of a lifestyle and

2100
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,520
that's why regenerative is a word that

2101
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,760
that's being used a lot by us in the

2102
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,560
community is because it makes sense to

2103
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,640
to use a regenerative lifestyle because

2104
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,600
we really do need to regenerate you know

2105
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,239
we can't sustain you know where we are

2106
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,239
in this world or in this in this path we

2107
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,959
have to go beyond sustaining and

2108
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:21,359
regenerate and so the pure certification

2109
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,920
is it's it is cannabis and food based

2110
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:26,319
but it goes way beyond it really does

2111
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,399
and we're in an international you know

2112
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,679
community now i mean as a perfect

2113
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,920
example we're talking to you in

2114
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,719
australia as if you're here in our front

2115
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:37,119
room and what a wonderful opportunity to

2116
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:39,198
be able to reach out to the whole world

2117
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:42,880
and i think that cannabis needs to be

2118
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:44,879
seen as is international now you know we

2119
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,039
all need to join together we all need to

2120
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,920
be on the same page and that's the way

2121
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:51,519
that we're going to be able to

2122
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,520
have the rightful voice like i was

2123
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,560
saying before for the plant and i

2124
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,199
believe that you know so many investors

2125
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,760
we call them outvesters but just for fun

2126
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:04,000
um so many investors and so many

2127
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,640
different you know corporations out

2128
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,039
there trying to own it but nobody

2129
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,800
brought a seat up for the plant

2130
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,359
in that conversation or in that

2131
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,840
conference call nobody is having a

2132
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:18,719
conversation you know if they're in that

2133
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,440
corporate mindset and i believe that as

2134
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:24,319
we move forward into the rules and the

2135
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:25,759
regulations and into our own use

2136
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,479
and you know into the health and

2137
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,039
well-being of of introducing our

2138
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:33,678
cannabis culture to the whole world we

2139
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:35,840
have an incredible responsibility to

2140
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:37,359
have a rightful voice for the plant and

2141
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,719
that she's always part of our

2142
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:42,639
conversations and how we move forward

2143
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,600
yeah okay i can definitely agree with

2144
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,760
all of that

2145
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,679
so i had one question which i was

2146
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,039
actually struggling to think of how i

2147
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,560
was going to slide it in but you guys

2148
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:52,719
just gave me the perfect segue when you

2149
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,920
mentioned that midwifery i know that you

2150
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:58,079
guys have been toying slash you know 100

2151
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,600
doing like a kind of pregnancy brew for

2152
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:01,760
a while i was interested in that like

2153
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,719
how did that start and like can you just

2154
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,920
give us a bit more information about it

2155
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,920
um

2156
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,840
well i'm a midwife and i've been in the

2157
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:13,119
natural health field

2158
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:15,360
naturopathic medicine herbology

2159
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,920
chinese medicine

2160
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:20,719
uh since my early 20s

2161
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,119
and um

2162
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,719
you know mid to early 90s yeah so it's

2163
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,039
really early

2164
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,119
for a really long time yeah

2165
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,279
and um

2166
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,599
yeah and we're so so youthful we're

2167
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,359
still saying don't worry

2168
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,360
well the veterans are really around us

2169
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:40,079
we like to give like a lot of respect to

2170
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,679
the the veterans yeah the truth the

2171
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:42,640
elders yeah

2172
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,679
um

2173
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,920
but i

2174
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,239
i've always utilized you know a

2175
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,920
beautiful tea blend and i've

2176
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:52,238
thought that herbs and steeping and

2177
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,560
brewing herbs were just a really good

2178
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:57,759
way to get immediate

2179
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:00,080
results in a human condition so any

2180
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,560
maladies that anybody had you know

2181
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,640
whether it was a body wash which is like

2182
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,239
a fuller ear spray or whether it's like

2183
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,000
in you know drinking it and you're

2184
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,559
drinking it for your kidneys or whatever

2185
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,198
different things that you know utilizing

2186
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,280
herbs for that and pregnancy tea

2187
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,960
uh is is really close to my heart

2188
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:18,559
because i feel like

2189
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,319
you know you can take pregnancy

2190
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,320
supplements and

2191
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:23,359
because it's like mined minerals and

2192
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:25,198
it's very

2193
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:26,399
difficult for your digestive tract to

2194
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:28,719
understand

2195
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,599
herbs in the same way you know like

2196
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,039
pills

2197
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,560
in the form of capsules or something

2198
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,560
like that you know like a supplement

2199
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,239
whole food capsule wouldn't be the same

2200
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,400
as a whole food

2201
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:40,639
you know coming out of your garden

2202
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,960
so and then we know if you steep those

2203
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,119
teas then it starts to extract the

2204
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,239
minerals like overnight

2205
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:51,119
and you can grow a beautiful healthy you

2206
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:53,198
know mama and baby with with great

2207
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,559
breast milk after the baby is born just

2208
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:56,639
off of herbs

2209
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:59,120
and that's where we took that whole

2210
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,079
ideology and started putting it into

2211
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:03,920
soil

2212
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:05,198
and i had a an old tea brew blend you

2213
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,960
know i could

2214
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,319
grow all of my own herbs and then give

2215
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,158
them out to all of the ladies that i

2216
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:12,158
work with i

2217
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:13,599
had one that was a year old and the new

2218
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:15,920
crop was coming up and i just thought

2219
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,840
hey you know what i'm i'm just gonna

2220
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,079
steep this we've always just steeped

2221
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,039
nettles and horsetail before i'm gonna

2222
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:25,198
steep this entire pregnancy brew

2223
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,198
and see what happens and it was like as

2224
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:30,399
if the plants were just screaming out

2225
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:33,279
the next day like this is it you got it

2226
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,439
you know it's it's herbology for plants

2227
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:37,039
you can help us and treat us and help us

2228
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:38,158
grow and help stimulate our immune

2229
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,920
response

2230
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:41,679
through other plants because it's

2231
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,840
something that they understand and we've

2232
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,760
always had a really spiritual connection

2233
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,159
with our gardens and with our gardening

2234
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,560
and with our wild crafting and foraging

2235
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:53,039
and we've always had a you know a

2236
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,880
spiritual connection so you know we we

2237
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,359
definitely recognized of course that

2238
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,760
we're growing a female plant in the

2239
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:03,039
female cannabis plant so it was a

2240
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,840
natural connection to using herbology

2241
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:08,158
for women to using herbology for female

2242
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,039
plants and so that's why there's like

2243
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,559
wild yam which is a feminine you know

2244
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,198
hormone

2245
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,080
herb which is in in our fat flowers

2246
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:18,319
blend

2247
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:21,039
and that's why people we feel get such a

2248
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:23,599
great response in their flowers and in

2249
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,198
their terpene um response by using you

2250
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,679
know the products and our blends that we

2251
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,919
put together or also utilizing even

2252
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,840
flowers you know when you see things

2253
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,840
that are flowering it's a great thing to

2254
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,840
utilize in your flowers

2255
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,920
so that's a you know a feminine quality

2256
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,079
to a feminine quality so that's why we

2257
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,000
utilize a lot of flowers on our property

2258
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:45,920
and we suggest for people to do that

2259
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,719
it's just been an intertwined you know

2260
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,880
let's say um work of life that we've

2261
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,480
intertwined you know the gardening with

2262
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,480
the human health

2263
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,919
and it's been extremely beneficial and

2264
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,759
we feel like it's timeless it's

2265
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,440
something that doesn't go away and it's

2266
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,440
it's almost like it awakens something

2267
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,039
primal inside people and when they learn

2268
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,919
about it you know they just want to do

2269
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:08,639
it it just makes so much sense

2270
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:11,679
yeah of course i can relate to that

2271
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:13,679
so when you say you use um say things

2272
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,800
like even flowers from other plants in

2273
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,840
the teas

2274
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,920
is that

2275
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,600
kind of like the more terpene rich the

2276
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,920
better and the reason why i asked this

2277
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,600
is because uh i've got this frangipani

2278
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,158
tree in my backyard and it smells so

2279
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,600
much and it drops so many flowers on me

2280
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:29,119
and i've been looking at it for so long

2281
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,360
gone i need to make a ferment out of

2282
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:33,840
this what do you guys think

2283
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,359
oh i think it's fantastic it's a great

2284
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,119
idea you're just taking all of those

2285
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,279
terpenes and then making them totally

2286
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:41,039
usable for your microbiology and then

2287
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:44,238
uptake into your plants

2288
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,920
it's great and franjapani oh amazing i

2289
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:48,718
just had a big whiff of it go through my

2290
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:52,000
body when you said that that's beautiful

2291
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:54,079
um another thing is um as far as you

2292
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
know fermenting it and extracting that

2293
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:58,079
there's really kind of two ways to

2294
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,679
ferment biomass and i think it's good to

2295
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,119
touch on it which is

2296
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,840
you know using sugar to extract it and

2297
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:08,079
make

2298
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:10,719
a concentrate with the biomass or using

2299
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:12,238
let's say water and doing more of an

2300
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,600
herbal juice

2301
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,119
and so we've

2302
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,280
we've touched on this in this in this

2303
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,760
disc in this discussion already but we

2304
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:22,719
really we really prefer the juice the

2305
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,719
water version as opposed to the soil one

2306
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,480
it does depend i mean you may live in

2307
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,800
like in your area with you know near

2308
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:30,000
sugar cane or some kind of like sweet

2309
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,159
crop or

2310
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,158
something that you can use sugar really

2311
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:37,119
easily and it might be fruit it might

2312
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:39,119
make a lot of sense in your area so

2313
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:41,198
once again you know farming is a

2314
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:44,479
bio-regional thing and it really you

2315
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:46,799
can't say one thing for all areas but

2316
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:49,039
in a lot of our areas um in the northern

2317
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,760
hemisphere um you know

2318
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:54,079
sugar doesn't do well you know up here

2319
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,880
it doesn't grow and and in our bodies

2320
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:58,479
it's it's like a hot it's a hot thing

2321
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,039
that goes through our body and it burns

2322
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,599
out quick so we don't really want to use

2323
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:06,960
that it's not good for our health so

2324
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,480
when i'm extracting with sugar and when

2325
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,800
it doesn't come from our area it doesn't

2326
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:13,519
make sense we really want to try and

2327
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,679
make a tea that's from our area which

2328
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,800
empowers us to not have to bring

2329
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:21,199
something from far away and using water

2330
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,119
and just chopping up your herbs and and

2331
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:24,879
putting herbs and water and letting them

2332
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:27,198
ferment and juice

2333
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,920
you know with the lactic acid bacteria

2334
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:32,158
mother culture and fermenting it and

2335
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:35,440
juice and then straining it out and

2336
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:38,000
activating it is um our favorite way to

2337
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:40,879
extract biomass yeah and what josh means

2338
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,840
by juice is the natural plant sugars

2339
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,800
that are already present in the plant

2340
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,279
and you know also the the reference to

2341
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,039
hot you know sugar

2342
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:54,319
sugar is something that when you eat it

2343
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:57,600
in your body it creates immediate energy

2344
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:59,679
the energy is quick it's fast

2345
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,120
and then as we all know that's why

2346
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,679
people call it a sugar high because

2347
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:07,439
there's a downside to the sugar high

2348
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:09,440
and microbiology has that same thing so

2349
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:12,079
if you add a whole bunch of sugar to

2350
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:14,719
your tea brews it's going to spark an

2351
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:16,479
immediate microbiological

2352
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,960
like effect

2353
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:21,599
that then burns out very quickly and

2354
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:24,158
maybe sugars are okay to add a tiny

2355
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,320
teeny tiny bit to maybe start spark that

2356
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:29,198
microbiology but you want your

2357
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:31,279
microbiology to be subsist

2358
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,879
off of the plant material and the plant

2359
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,399
sugars in the plant extracts that are

2360
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,119
already within there

2361
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,879
so you know we we don't utilize sugars

2362
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:41,439
in our tea brews because we really don't

2363
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,159
eat sugar in our home either

2364
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:46,719
um you know people utilize some of these

2365
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:49,119
as an extract i think that maybe it is

2366
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:51,679
it is a good idea if you

2367
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:53,679
have an opportunity to buy a product at

2368
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:56,239
a store or you have an opportunity to

2369
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,880
make your own extract and concentrate

2370
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:01,678
from plants that are say seasonal and

2371
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,920
then you bring it to your indoor um you

2372
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,760
know operation then that makes a lot of

2373
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,039
sense because the more homemade things

2374
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,840
the better

2375
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:10,399
but

2376
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,360
fresh is always going to be best

2377
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:15,039
and we feel like utilizing the plant

2378
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:17,759
sugars over

2379
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,760
any type of processed sugar

2380
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,679
is going to be the best and and also to

2381
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,400
interject here really quickly sugars are

2382
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,800
very different you know evaporated cane

2383
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:29,119
juice is very different than beet sugar

2384
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,960
and you know you have to be very careful

2385
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:32,479
um what you're eating and also what

2386
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,920
you're putting in your tea brews the

2387
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:38,479
beet sugar is a monosaccharide you know

2388
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,560
your your microbiology doesn't recognize

2389
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:42,638
it it just starts killing things it's

2390
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,639
the same within your body so when you

2391
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,960
look at a label that just says sugar

2392
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:49,279
it's mostly going to be beet sugar

2393
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,000
because that's a gmo crop that they're

2394
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:54,399
producing on a mass level and it just

2395
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,560
produces a lot of candida and yeast

2396
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:59,158
things within our body and also within

2397
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,039
our soil so looking up what a

2398
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:03,920
polysaccharide is and the more

2399
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,439
saccharides that are in within a sugar

2400
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,920
is definitely what you're looking for

2401
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,919
because that's going to be a prebiotic

2402
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,840
to certain types of organisms that are

2403
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,440
beneficial and yeah cone is one thing

2404
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,119
that's came and that's coming to our

2405
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:16,960
life which is from south america and

2406
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:17,840
it's a watery tuber and it's really

2407
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,158
really

2408
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,000
um sweet and it's a really really good

2409
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:24,079
companion plant planets aerates your

2410
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,719
soils and it's a really good thing to

2411
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,800
use for and a great prebiotic and also

2412
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,800
polysaccharides it's high in inulin as

2413
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,840
as opposed to insulin and it's just a

2414
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,840
prebiotic um

2415
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:39,279
it's a prebiotic for good microbiology

2416
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,119
yes that's all really interesting stuff

2417
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,158
especially with that inulin comment i've

2418
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:43,760
been looking into that a little more

2419
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,359
myself recently

2420
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,440
something that i wanted to ask about the

2421
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:48,960
evaporated cane sugar this may feel like

2422
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,399
a little bit of a redundant question but

2423
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,239
i notice it's in some of your products

2424
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:53,920
and so i guess the question is do you

2425
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:55,678
find like that's the one you would pick

2426
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,679
if you had to use one or is there

2427
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,880
something maybe a little better but you

2428
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,480
know for whatever reason you don't put

2429
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,239
that in the products like where do you

2430
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:04,799
sit on the sugars like which is your

2431
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:06,799
personal favorite well we put that in

2432
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,279
our product because we know the source

2433
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,440
of that and so the source is always

2434
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:13,039
really important we know that that farm

2435
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:15,839
that makes that sugar

2436
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:17,920
is of ups you know standing value it's a

2437
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,239
smaller you know farm it's a good

2438
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,760
product it contains a lot of

2439
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:24,479
polysaccharides it is from cane sugar

2440
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:27,039
and we put a tiny bit in there

2441
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:29,198
just to spark the microbiology to wake

2442
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:31,760
them up to then have them start eating

2443
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:33,519
the herbs and that's exactly what we do

2444
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,440
within our tea brews as well but when

2445
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,520
you've got fresh

2446
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:39,599
plants then you're going to be having a

2447
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,679
lot more sugars that there's no need to

2448
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,679
add any other extra sugar because we

2449
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,920
notice the microbiology is sparked up

2450
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:48,399
right away but in our product there's

2451
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,079
dried you know um

2452
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:52,479
herbs in there so to spark the

2453
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:54,319
microbiology immediately is a good idea

2454
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,079
but you don't want them to sustain off

2455
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:58,840
of the sugars because then that's just

2456
01:27:56,079 --> 01:28:00,960
creating you want yeah fungi that's

2457
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,679
pathogenic the herbology that you put in

2458
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,960
there

2459
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,359
the herbs

2460
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,279
yeah perfect makes sense so if we just

2461
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:09,599
loop back to one or two questions ago

2462
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:12,479
when i was talking about the kind of the

2463
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,760
onus on the community to be you know

2464
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:17,279
more solidified in a legal sense i guess

2465
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,119
i just wanted to ask a few quick legal

2466
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:20,880
questions like i guess the most kind of

2467
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,559
relevant one to me is if you could kind

2468
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,560
of just change one

2469
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,400
law or maybe a few which ultimately just

2470
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,920
kind of change one thing ultimately

2471
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,319
what's the one thing that you feel is

2472
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,920
most pertinent to get fixed or changed

2473
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:33,198
or whatever you know set right so to

2474
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,960
speak

2475
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:37,359
i mean right off the bat i would love to

2476
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,639
see cannabis decriminalized and not

2477
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:40,079
legalized

2478
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,920
because legalized means that you're

2479
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:43,920
immediately going to have rules and

2480
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,000
regulations and all different kinds of

2481
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,158
conference calls and people and money

2482
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,319
and investors and corporations and big

2483
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:52,158
bucks and everything is coming in and it

2484
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:54,399
really has a negative connotation but

2485
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:56,000
when you decriminalize something that

2486
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:58,638
allows people to go on about their

2487
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,560
business and lots of herbs are you know

2488
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:02,639
decriminalized

2489
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,639
you can't really like go and make a

2490
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,480
whole bunch of them or whatever you know

2491
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,079
say like poppy or something you can grow

2492
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,879
them in your garden and it's up to you

2493
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:12,399
as to what you want to do with that and

2494
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,560
just right off the bat

2495
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:17,279
that's really uh you know radical did

2496
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:19,679
you mean agriculture laws

2497
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:22,000
yeah like anything really i mean maybe

2498
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,679
maybe a a better example would be maybe

2499
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,439
something a little smaller than like a

2500
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,719
you know broad scale decriminalization

2501
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:29,039
like because i hear a lot of people

2502
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,399
complain about lots of the the smaller

2503
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:32,319
like kind of sub legalities of the

2504
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,238
legalization like whether it be

2505
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:36,559
limits on how much small producers can

2506
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:38,238
grow or just you know like financial

2507
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,679
hurdles for certain people to get into

2508
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:40,799
the game you know all those types of

2509
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,000
things

2510
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:47,199
yeah well i mean capping capping you

2511
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,079
know the the your farm canopy your

2512
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:51,119
canopy is i think is a great way a great

2513
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:52,880
law

2514
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:55,039
because um

2515
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,880
when you don't cap

2516
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:59,039
when you have a legalization structure

2517
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,279
and you don't cap what farms can do then

2518
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:03,519
you just get crazy farms

2519
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,439
like in canada and different places in

2520
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,639
california you get these farms that are

2521
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:10,399
like 20 acres and they're a million

2522
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,159
square feet and all of a sudden it's

2523
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:13,839
like how many million square feet

2524
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,638
companies do you need

2525
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,239
in a country or in a legalized

2526
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:21,359
area so i think

2527
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:22,559
capping it and having more farms is

2528
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:25,839
going to give

2529
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:28,000
more you know ability for more farms to

2530
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,639
grow and really what we need is and i

2531
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,679
think this is a problem and and a lot of

2532
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:36,560
agriculture is is the corporatization of

2533
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,920
it and the mass scale of it all i think

2534
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,360
we need a lot of

2535
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,560
smaller farms producing more intentional

2536
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:43,599
um

2537
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,840
products

2538
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,239
and so i think that capping it would be

2539
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,119
one thing another thing with with as far

2540
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:53,678
as agriculture laws and organics goes i

2541
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:56,960
mean i would like to see organic mean

2542
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,079
absolutely no chemicals used and another

2543
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,079
one

2544
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,639
plastic mulch

2545
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:06,238
not allowed

2546
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:07,279
plastic mulch not allowed with organic

2547
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:08,238
farming

2548
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,198
sorry

2549
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:14,319
it's not organic sorry organic farm

2550
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:16,000
not okay yeah i mean every single year

2551
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:18,319
you're gonna throw away your plastic

2552
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,238
mulch because you can get your

2553
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:23,519
zucchini out two weeks earlier your

2554
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:24,638
strawberries out a month earlier yeah

2555
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,719
and so when you say that are you

2556
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:28,480
referring to kind of like that shredded

2557
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:31,039
polypipe stuff or more of like just a

2558
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:32,799
general plastic cover type of thing

2559
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:35,439
it's poly pots we don't agree with

2560
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:38,159
either it's a sheet of plastic that goes

2561
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:41,198
over the ground that people utilize for

2562
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:44,000
weed control it burns out any kind of

2563
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:45,119
weeds and seeds that is there and also

2564
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,439
of course it's going to burn out a

2565
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:50,079
tremendous amount of your microbiology

2566
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:52,158
and also it makes the soil warmer in a

2567
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:55,519
lot of regions so that you can push a

2568
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:57,519
crop earlier earlier earlier harvest out

2569
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,360
of it and it keeps the moisture in there

2570
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,440
there's tractors that have

2571
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:03,759
you know giant rolls of plastic i know i

2572
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:06,399
know people have to acres they're

2573
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,440
they're organic farmers have acres of of

2574
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:12,638
of of earth covered in black plastic

2575
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:14,879
that's covering their mounds and every

2576
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:17,279
year they throw it away

2577
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,920
and this is like charity

2578
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:21,759
this is the majority of the us's you

2579
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,480
know 88

2580
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:27,280
of the organic market in the us comes

2581
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:29,279
from california alone and then like over

2582
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,759
90 percent of that comes from like the

2583
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:34,158
salinas county and you know all of that

2584
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,639
area and region and all of that is

2585
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:39,198
covered in black plastic and they can

2586
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,760
still put an organic standard on it and

2587
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:44,000
they can use glyphosate as well

2588
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,920
very well goes on and on

2589
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,079
another another thing i remember you

2590
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,920
specifically referencing kelly was in uh

2591
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,079
one of the talks i saw on youtube you

2592
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,760
mentioned that there's an increasing

2593
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:55,439
amount in terms of say your percentage

2594
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,520
or composition of your products which

2595
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:59,359
can like be kind of ambiguously labeled

2596
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,679
or just blatantly not organic but still

2597
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:03,599
gets that label do you think that that

2598
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,960
for example is kind of like the ultimate

2599
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,600
nail in the coffin for organic

2600
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,319
certifications and labeling

2601
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,199
it is it definitely is yeah because

2602
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:15,279
you'll get farms that use things while

2603
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:16,079
omri is something in america that people

2604
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:19,759
use

2605
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:21,439
and north america yeah and and

2606
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,520
they will use a product that's

2607
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:25,599
registered and then they'll find out

2608
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,600
that it wasn't even what was on the

2609
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,719
label it was something that was a

2610
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,960
carrier in the product in the liquid

2611
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:35,520
that maybe makes their their their

2612
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,760
product fail in a test

2613
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,719
so that's that's kind of your big

2614
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,760
problem

2615
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:44,158
and also the you know the fine print you

2616
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,679
know will say that this product is

2617
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:50,000
registered

2618
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:53,760
for use in organic agriculture

2619
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,479
it is not saying that it is organic

2620
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:59,760
the language that is utilized is

2621
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:02,158
utilized and geared towards big ag no

2622
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:05,440
matter what country that you're on

2623
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:08,399
department of ag the epa whatever your

2624
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:11,519
standardization you know names are

2625
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:14,399
they're all under the same umbrella and

2626
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:16,480
that's big agriculture big agriculture

2627
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:18,238
makes up those rules and regulations and

2628
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:21,039
they're the ones that have all the way

2629
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:23,119
down to the labeling i mean you would

2630
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:25,279
not believe we need to change our labels

2631
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,599
for every single state like practically

2632
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:30,559
every other month because because they

2633
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:33,039
can do toxicity levels well and they

2634
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:36,000
continue changing the language we can no

2635
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:38,319
longer utilize the term healthy

2636
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,639
on any of our labels because the term

2637
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:44,238
healthy implies that you have used a

2638
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:47,279
pesticide on the pesticide list so if

2639
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:50,399
you have a pesticide then you can say

2640
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:52,639
this pesticide will bring health to your

2641
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:54,719
garden so they've taken away that

2642
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:56,560
ability for us to be able to use

2643
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:59,359
language in a way

2644
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,840
that is actually educational labels are

2645
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:03,679
not education we need to look further

2646
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,279
than labels to be able to get our

2647
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,199
education because they're out there

2648
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:10,158
trying to trick us and part of looking

2649
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:13,279
further is you know when you get organic

2650
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:16,000
liquid fertilizers of any kind liquid

2651
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:18,479
itself is a problem

2652
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,560
you have to have some type of stabilizer

2653
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:22,399
within that and a preservative and that

2654
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,960
preserves it in order for it to not

2655
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:26,719
explode on the shelves and if it's not

2656
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,960
exploding on the shelves then how much

2657
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,760
is it really doing for your microbiology

2658
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:34,960
to begin with because microbiology

2659
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,639
has to live or it dies so different

2660
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,800
things that preserve liquid are a

2661
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,480
problem phosphoric acids and different

2662
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,639
things that can be in there

2663
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:44,399
um so you have to be

2664
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:46,480
you have to be a little bit um you have

2665
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:48,319
to be aware of of the companies there's

2666
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:51,118
there's even different things in sprays

2667
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:53,118
and foliar sprays that that are um in

2668
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,960
the in there that are not on the label

2669
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:57,039
that can be a toxic

2670
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,800
residue on your plants later and that's

2671
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:00,719
why we use only

2672
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:03,039
powders in our products because then we

2673
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,719
put the power in the farmer's hand to

2674
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,158
make liquid out of it

2675
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:07,920
and then you're not and then we have

2676
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:10,319
everything in glass and not in plastic

2677
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,319
so there's no plastic garbage and we

2678
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:15,359
encourage people you know to grow your

2679
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:17,359
own biomass and not buy our products

2680
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,118
so that's the ultimate goal is that

2681
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,679
everybody is closed loop and that you're

2682
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:23,679
creating your own nutrients and wow that

2683
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:26,079
is just like the best middle finger in

2684
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:29,199
the world to big ag there's no more

2685
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:31,519
power than we have than to grow our own

2686
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:33,198
seeds and propagate our own vegetables

2687
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,000
and our own medicine on our farm with

2688
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:38,399
the nutrients that we grow there

2689
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,840
so if we just kind of reference the

2690
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:41,599
comments you made about encouraging

2691
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,760
people to close the loop

2692
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,199
where do you ultimately see dragonfly

2693
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,039
earth medicine if that were to happen

2694
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:49,439
for example let's just say you know

2695
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:51,118
there was a substantial number of pure

2696
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,519
farms and you know we had reached that

2697
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:55,519
goal would you would you kind of launch

2698
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,880
dragonfly as you know like a slightly

2699
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,960
different direction at that point or do

2700
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,960
you think there would still be a need

2701
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,719
for in the way it currently operates so

2702
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,520
to speak

2703
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,000
um

2704
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,239
i mean you know dragonfly i guess a lot

2705
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,639
like the species we're just all over the

2706
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:11,599
place we feel like education is number

2707
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,079
one

2708
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,000
and you know we're farmers first and we

2709
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:19,439
came up with our products after we were

2710
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,679
farmers for 20 years you know and then

2711
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:23,279
then the education started sparking out

2712
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,118
because we came out of the closet and we

2713
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,359
realized wow we're doing things really

2714
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:30,399
different than everybody else because we

2715
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:33,118
had to hike you know seven hours out

2716
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:34,960
into the bush or a two-hour hike

2717
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:37,118
straight up the mountain

2718
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:39,198
you know from our property we weren't

2719
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:40,960
able to bring anything and because we

2720
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:43,359
didn't share with other community

2721
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,359
cannabis members or anything we didn't

2722
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:46,960
know that we were that different so when

2723
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,719
we came out of the closet we started

2724
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,880
thinking wow this is actually really

2725
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,760
unique and we maybe have something to

2726
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,279
share

2727
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,719
with the rest of the community and it

2728
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,800
turns out that people

2729
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,880
all over the world are hungry for this

2730
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,199
knowledge and it's not even really that

2731
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:04,400
we're teaching people we're just

2732
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:06,799
reminding our basic human instinct of

2733
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:09,118
our relationship to the earth

2734
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,119
and as far as dragonfly and dragonfly

2735
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:13,198
earth medicine in the world and as

2736
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:15,039
we're really proud of our products and

2737
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:17,198
and they do we feel like they'll always

2738
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:19,840
have a place because there's always

2739
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:22,238
going to be someone on earth or in a

2740
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,880
place that you know doesn't live near

2741
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:27,118
biomass or or even farms that we work

2742
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:29,600
with you will use you know the products

2743
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:31,599
because it makes a really quick and nice

2744
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,840
and easy tea so it's knocking out it's

2745
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:36,320
safe and it's easy and you can and the

2746
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,800
plants respond to it right away so

2747
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:40,639
we we see our our products as timeless

2748
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,679
we have human health products as well

2749
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:46,079
you know our raw cacao and so our that

2750
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,399
part of our we and we've never taken

2751
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,479
you know we've never um done marketing

2752
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:52,719
without with with any of our business

2753
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:53,839
either so we've taken this unique stance

2754
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:57,359
of

2755
01:38:53,840 --> 01:39:00,159
showing a lifestyle and having you know

2756
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:00,880
products as well so we we we will always

2757
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:03,359
be

2758
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,239
connecting with farmers in the world and

2759
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:08,960
that's that's i think our true love our

2760
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:11,439
true love is is homesteading and working

2761
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:14,639
with raw materials and and building and

2762
01:39:11,439 --> 01:39:17,118
doing timber framing or or he or his or

2763
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:19,359
midwifery it's a home birth or our

2764
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:22,399
gardening and on that level we always

2765
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:24,639
want to expand with that kind of direct

2766
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:26,879
contact with farmers and at the end of

2767
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:29,039
the day you know if the business fails

2768
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,960
and you know it all goes to hell in a

2769
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:33,279
handbasket we're just gonna be humble

2770
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,359
farmers because that's what we do so

2771
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:36,960
i'll be helping catch babies and we'll

2772
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:38,238
be humble farmers

2773
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,880
because that's our true love and

2774
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:42,399
everything else is sparked off of that

2775
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,719
well it's a good thing i don't think

2776
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:46,719
that'll happen but one thing i did want

2777
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,719
to specifically inquire into is will

2778
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:50,719
there ever be a point where you know

2779
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:53,359
dragonflies seeds will be commercially

2780
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:55,600
available for people to buy

2781
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:56,880
an interesting question about seeds is

2782
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,800
that um

2783
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,319
the answer is we don't know because

2784
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,880
we've been

2785
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,960
giving away our seeds and we give them

2786
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,520
away to people that we see and we never

2787
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,600
felt like you could put a monetary

2788
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,840
number on a seed

2789
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,960
so it's really interesting that it

2790
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:16,719
involves ethics it involves you know

2791
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,840
getting it out there to the public it

2792
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:20,719
involves

2793
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:23,119
exchange between two people there's so

2794
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:25,679
much you know with seeds it's it's it's

2795
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:26,319
sort of the essence of of all of this

2796
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,560
and

2797
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:29,599
we've always just given them away

2798
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,280
so

2799
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,280
we don't really know what's going to

2800
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,960
happen we've we've just been breeders

2801
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:36,639
because that's part of our closed loop

2802
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,079
and we're breeders because we didn't

2803
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:41,039
have tests

2804
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:44,000
you know and and facilities to be able

2805
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:46,399
to tell us so we went off of smell we

2806
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,039
went off of how it made you feel

2807
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:53,039
and now we've been breeding for almost

2808
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:56,479
25 years now off of what it made us feel

2809
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:58,079
and now those genetics are being tested

2810
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:01,039
and they're awesome

2811
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:02,840
so here's a really beautiful

2812
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:05,600
you know focus on

2813
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:07,840
intuition than matching science and

2814
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,679
maybe the intuition was always right i

2815
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,840
know i'm going off the subject here with

2816
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:13,840
the scene definitely you know

2817
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,520
we like we've

2818
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,119
seen our seeds grow in a lot of

2819
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,480
different environments and we've gotten

2820
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:20,799
a lot of feedback from people that have

2821
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:24,158
gotten our seeds and there really is

2822
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,920
a really strong vigor that goes through

2823
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:28,158
the seeds they're like the first ones to

2824
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:30,480
pop and they'll be you know big leaves

2825
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:33,279
and everything so i mean

2826
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:36,319
what we can say is we will always breed

2827
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:38,079
we always will be making seeds if if if

2828
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:39,599
it does become available to the world

2829
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:42,800
it's because of all the sudden there's

2830
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:45,280
this crazy world demand but but for now

2831
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,840
it's just it's just a labor of love and

2832
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:51,118
anyone who comes in contact with us

2833
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:53,600
we are pretty damn generous about it so

2834
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:54,960
just feels good to exchange

2835
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,920
yeah of course

2836
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,239
and so

2837
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,158
if we kind of look at your specific

2838
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,839
situation i know that you guys do all

2839
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:04,000
your breeding outdoors and you don't use

2840
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,440
clones or anything one of our viewers

2841
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,118
had submitted the question of wanting to

2842
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:09,919
know do you feel like that makes your

2843
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:11,439
breeding a little harder in the you know

2844
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,880
you know sorry i keep saying you know

2845
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:14,638
it's such a pet peeve of mine i'll cut

2846
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,039
that out

2847
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:18,960
but basically they were wondering do you

2848
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,719
feel like it limits you in the because

2849
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,760
you've got a male outside there's say

2850
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,118
you wanted to do a few different

2851
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,400
projects you may not be able to do as

2852
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:26,158
many as you wanted because you have to

2853
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,238
be mindful of you know the pollen may

2854
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:29,679
carry and we only want to do so many and

2855
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:30,718
not risk having too many males around is

2856
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,239
that something whichever goes through

2857
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,079
your mind or is it just not actually

2858
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:35,839
like that in reality

2859
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:38,000
no we feel like the best breeding is

2860
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,159
done in nature and that's just been

2861
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,399
proven you know to do fast cycle

2862
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,879
breeding is not something that we want

2863
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:46,960
to do because we want to see the full

2864
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,679
expression of the plant we want to see

2865
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:52,079
it from seed all the way through and we

2866
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,960
do take cuttings sometimes we do take a

2867
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:56,399
cutting off of like if we have a bunch

2868
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,079
of plants and we're growing them out

2869
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:01,118
long season and we've got one that's

2870
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:03,279
like oh my goodness this one is so

2871
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:05,118
beautiful we're gonna have to keep it we

2872
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:07,679
won't even think about keeping it until

2873
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:09,519
the very end maybe when we're harvesting

2874
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:11,679
it you know so that will be like an

2875
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:13,920
extenuating circumstance but some of our

2876
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:16,560
breeding has come off of that

2877
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:20,239
but long season you know when we call it

2878
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:22,239
an f1 it's a true f1 that's a full year

2879
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:23,519
well i mean for sure

2880
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,399
you know if you're going to start a

2881
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:28,480
genetics company you know i wouldn't

2882
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:31,039
i wouldn't necessarily do it the way we

2883
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:32,559
did it i mean we're doing it because

2884
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:35,679
yeah you could get

2885
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:38,560
you know you could stabilize a strain

2886
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:41,199
you know technically you know by you

2887
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:44,000
know doing it five or seven you know

2888
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:46,158
generations which no one does but but

2889
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
you know so yeah well we've gotten to 12

2890
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:49,679
if you're gonna start a genetics company

2891
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,399
you know you can get a lot more out of

2892
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:54,639
it but i i will say this i mean

2893
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:56,879
our breeding is a labor of love and it's

2894
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,600
an expression of ourselves

2895
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,359
and

2896
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:01,840
we think that there's an incredible

2897
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:04,000
amount of strength that comes from

2898
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:06,560
breeding underneath the sun

2899
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,920
and and we we've we've grown seeds from

2900
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,360
other people that grow underneath the

2901
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,279
sun and we've seen that within other

2902
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:12,960
people's genetics as well

2903
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:14,800
and um so

2904
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,639
you know we feel like there's an

2905
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,199
incredible vigor that comes from growth

2906
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:22,239
from creating seeds outdoors and we we

2907
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:25,039
put a lot of intention into you know

2908
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:27,839
choosing the right mail and we grow that

2909
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:29,519
male outside you know

2910
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,199
all the way out until the very end and

2911
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,360
then we bring it inside like the room of

2912
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:34,879
our house in order to keep the the

2913
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:37,359
pollen um

2914
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,279
from going all over the property but yes

2915
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:40,960
we we we think that it's a good way to

2916
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:43,039
breed because we've seen a lot of good

2917
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:45,198
results from it and then when you get

2918
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:49,118
our seeds and our genetics it's a full

2919
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:51,279
expression of our microbiome here on our

2920
01:44:49,118 --> 01:44:54,399
farm it's a full expression of the

2921
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:55,759
flowers and the plants that we grow here

2922
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:57,279
yeah well i think that's probably why

2923
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,280
the seeds are so healthy because there's

2924
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:02,238
certainly an increasing demand i should

2925
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:04,319
say for seeds produced by growers slash

2926
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:05,678
breeders who are breeding in you know as

2927
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:07,599
much of an organic environment as

2928
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,960
possible because you can kind of see you

2929
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,920
know the seeds come out really healthy

2930
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,000
but

2931
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,600
i wanted to ask one other quick question

2932
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,198
about um

2933
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,560
in regards to you said if it's if it's a

2934
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:18,238
keeper you know you want to hang on to

2935
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,239
it does that i mean i guess the

2936
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:21,678
implication is you re-veg it do you find

2937
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:23,759
that that re-veging process is

2938
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:25,039
detrimental at all or not not after

2939
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,159
you've got it back to where it needs to

2940
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:28,238
be

2941
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:29,759
no we haven't seen that you know really

2942
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:31,919
really beautiful healthy plant can

2943
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,320
definitely produce a healthy clone

2944
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,000
zelly's gift is a plant that we cloned

2945
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:38,559
in 2014

2946
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,238
and it's still going really strong for a

2947
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,119
lot of people so

2948
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:45,678
the initial stages of cloning you know a

2949
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:48,880
flowering i mean the zelly's gift we

2950
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,560
cloned it the day we harvested it so

2951
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,880
then these were big plants these were

2952
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,800
like you know 10 10 12 foot plants that

2953
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:56,639
we're that we're talking about and on

2954
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,760
the inside part of the plants there's a

2955
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:00,079
lot of

2956
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,679
you know inner branches that will leave

2957
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:03,840
some of those inner branches on the

2958
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,920
inside part of the plant during the

2959
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,319
flowering phase and not we won't clear

2960
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,960
out everything in there just in case we

2961
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:13,359
do find a plant that's just like amazing

2962
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:15,118
and then we can clone it

2963
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:17,519
so it's not like you're cloning like a

2964
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:20,079
bud you know you're cloning like an

2965
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,679
inner branch that has less of a bud head

2966
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:23,679
on it and has a little bit more leaf

2967
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:26,000
matter on it and that's going to be

2968
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,760
you know way more likely to re-vegetate

2969
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,279
so you have to have a little bit more

2970
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,119
patience with it you know it's not going

2971
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:33,519
to be like a typical clone that you're

2972
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:35,920
getting off the end of the meristem you

2973
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,840
know of the plant but and also you know

2974
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,760
you can get a clone we've noticed we've

2975
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,920
gotten clones before and then if we put

2976
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:44,320
them in a full outdoor cycle then it

2977
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,520
really rejuvenates the clone

2978
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:48,319
you know

2979
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,960
so many of our our genetics are getting

2980
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:53,599
either watered out or we're losing the

2981
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:56,719
vitality of the genetics both with inner

2982
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,560
breeding and also just over breeding and

2983
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:00,800
if you have an amazing clone that you

2984
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,560
just love to bring it outside and let it

2985
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,400
go full season and then reclone it

2986
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,159
you're really going to reinvigorate that

2987
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:08,479
strain and we've done it over and over

2988
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:10,799
again we've even taken like a clone that

2989
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:12,238
test out something and then put it into

2990
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,079
the ground and had a full season and

2991
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:15,118
then it tests out something totally

2992
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:16,158
different

2993
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:17,839
so

2994
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:19,679
you know that's where we were talking at

2995
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,679
the very beginning that microbiology

2996
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:24,079
does have a tremendous amount to do with

2997
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:27,440
the health and vitality cannabinoid

2998
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:29,519
ratio cannabinoid profile terpene

2999
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:31,919
profile and and another thing is you

3000
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,840
know we would never grow

3001
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,760
a feminized seed

3002
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,880
we just don't believe in feminizing

3003
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:40,079
seeds

3004
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:42,159
and we don't smoke tobacco around our

3005
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:44,800
plants i don't have a problem with

3006
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:47,439
tobacco and and people smoking and it's

3007
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,920
spiritual it's not healthy to have

3008
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:52,079
tobacco smoke around you know cannabis

3009
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,480
plants in there and and um you know you

3010
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:56,158
have to be careful with you know just

3011
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:57,198
breeding and breeders and knowing your

3012
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:58,559
breeders

3013
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,879
and knowing you know what kind of

3014
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:03,360
environment you know

3015
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:06,639
being grown in because the plant is up

3016
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:08,238
taking like information as it's growing

3017
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:10,560
and when it's growing in a totally

3018
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:12,559
healthy environment the information that

3019
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,600
it's up taking is just

3020
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:18,600
full happiness full expression no

3021
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,600
barriers

3022
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:22,079
so a question that we kind of normally

3023
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:23,279
start the interview off but i mean we

3024
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,639
were having so much fun talking about

3025
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:26,880
other stuff we didn't get to it so let's

3026
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:30,000
go back what was your guys first

3027
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,000
introduction to cannabis

3028
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:36,399
um well

3029
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:38,880
mine was in um in the formation of my my

3030
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:42,960
seed and creation

3031
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:45,679
so my my very creation on earth

3032
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:47,039
um has been me being surrounded by

3033
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:50,639
cannabis

3034
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:51,359
so um my connection was being born into

3035
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:52,719
it

3036
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:56,000
and um

3037
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:58,158
i really have always felt really um

3038
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,560
a beautiful connection to it it's always

3039
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:02,319
been you know good quality

3040
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,480
around and

3041
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:06,639
um it's it's

3042
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:08,638
always something i felt really called to

3043
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:11,118
and connected with in my life and josh

3044
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:15,118
is from southern oregon so you know one

3045
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:17,519
of the weed capitals of the world and uh

3046
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,559
it's just yeah yeah you need to add that

3047
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:20,560
yeah

3048
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,560
yeah no it's it's it's it's been you

3049
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:25,360
know a huge part of my life and i feel

3050
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,639
really blessed to be able to have such a

3051
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:28,559
you know just still have such a

3052
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,400
connection with it and stuff and

3053
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,039
everything so it's multi-generational

3054
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:36,319
and even for uh you know our kid too and

3055
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:38,158
uh and his partner the snog grass family

3056
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:39,599
and my

3057
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,399
my um

3058
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:45,440
connection to it was i was definitely

3059
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:47,198
not born into it quite the opposite

3060
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:50,399
you know family that believed in the

3061
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:53,279
just say no campaign you know was real

3062
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:55,519
and um you know anything outside of you

3063
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:57,359
know copious amounts of alcohol

3064
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,480
you know shouldn't be done

3065
01:49:57,359 --> 01:49:59,759
um

3066
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:01,678
and so i was raised in a very

3067
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,800
conservative

3068
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,319
family

3069
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,119
catholic

3070
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:09,118
uh you know just all of sort of the

3071
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:10,960
pointing fingers that what to do and

3072
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,479
what not to do

3073
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,760
and

3074
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:16,479
i

3075
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:19,280
tried my very first joint that worked i

3076
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:21,678
think i had to try it a couple of times

3077
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:24,399
but the first joint that worked was

3078
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:26,639
actually up on top of a mountain top

3079
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:29,198
skiing back country

3080
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:32,079
with eight of my really good friends and

3081
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:34,079
i got high for the very first time

3082
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:36,399
when i was 16

3083
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:38,639
and it was a white out and i had to get

3084
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:40,638
down the mountain with all of these

3085
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,239
amazing hot shots

3086
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,880
and i just thought

3087
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:46,158
had i not been totally baked

3088
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,159
i would have never gotten down the

3089
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:50,960
mountain so

3090
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:52,638
immediately i had a relationship with it

3091
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,079
and then from there

3092
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,279
um

3093
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:56,279
i worked

3094
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:58,000
in

3095
01:50:56,279 --> 01:51:01,118
1988

3096
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,920
up in alaska and i was blessed to work

3097
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:04,839
with

3098
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:07,920
a man called johnny appleseed who

3099
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:10,079
literally during festivals in mid-summer

3100
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,560
would drop cannabis seeds out of his

3101
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:12,559
airplane

3102
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:16,319
yeah the matanuska thunder [ __ ] which

3103
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:17,439
was the original

3104
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:20,000
alaskan

3105
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:23,039
bushed weed that was awesome and super

3106
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:26,158
flavorful and yeah and he did a lot of

3107
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:28,880
his um you know cultivation practices

3108
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:30,079
were then what i took on later on in my

3109
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:33,118
life

3110
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:35,519
but that was my initial introduction and

3111
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:37,198
i just started working there

3112
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,679
almost full time

3113
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:42,000
around the clock in a big cannabis field

3114
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:43,840
when i had just turned 18. and luckily

3115
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,960
and then it's never ended yeah luckily

3116
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:47,520
kelly and i

3117
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:49,279
we've been together for 25 years now we

3118
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:52,560
got together when we were really young

3119
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:55,599
27 now and uh you know we have a 21 year

3120
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:57,440
old son now and we've you know it's just

3121
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:59,599
been a part of our whole entire life

3122
01:51:57,439 --> 01:52:01,439
it's given us that's why we have so much

3123
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:02,400
respect for it we feel like it's given

3124
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:03,759
us

3125
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,799
you know everything that we have

3126
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,800
essentially and i feel like you know

3127
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,719
just first being introduced to cannabis

3128
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,440
then it opened up my eyes to the whole

3129
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:17,439
cannabis culture and for the first time

3130
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:19,919
i felt a belonging i felt like you know

3131
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:22,799
i went to my first grateful dead show

3132
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,039
when i was 17 years old

3133
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,639
in 1986

3134
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:29,279
alpine valley

3135
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:31,599
and i was immediately around all of that

3136
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:32,719
culture and for the first time i felt

3137
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,360
family

3138
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:37,679
so not only has cannabis given me a

3139
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:41,198
tremendous amount of education

3140
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:43,760
and health but it's also given me family

3141
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:46,079
wow that's an amazing answer just as a

3142
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:48,239
quick little side point that may

3143
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:51,198
upset some of my close friends do you

3144
01:52:48,238 --> 01:52:53,519
agree that the dead fell off in like 90

3145
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:56,638
90 onwards so to speak

3146
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:58,320
um the dead fell off when jerry died

3147
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,840
yeah that's just and that's when we

3148
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:02,399
moved up to canada

3149
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:05,119
but when you say the dead the dead off

3150
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:06,079
at 90 that means that you love brent

3151
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:07,839
and really

3152
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:09,599
billy you should love brett because

3153
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,440
there was like a fire that happened

3154
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:13,279
within the band when brent was around

3155
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:15,759
and that's just a real thing

3156
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:17,840
and and it had a lot to do

3157
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:20,239
it had a lot to do with crosstalks and

3158
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,880
and really strong lsd as well so you

3159
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:24,638
know as as the drugs changed things

3160
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:27,359
changed as well but as far as the

3161
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:29,279
culture of traveling and being like what

3162
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:31,439
the dead represented which was more than

3163
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:33,679
music i mean for sure that did nothing

3164
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:35,598
happen to that it only got you know more

3165
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:37,118
more strong and all the way we would

3166
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,279
have never moved to british columbia if

3167
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:42,079
it wasn't for jerry and

3168
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:44,960
honestly i was able i made my way

3169
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:47,039
through university by swinging kind buds

3170
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:49,599
at dead shows that's that's how it all

3171
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:52,238
happened for me so i have a double major

3172
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:54,239
in university and almost a masters

3173
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:56,479
because you know cannabis gave me that

3174
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:59,279
at a very young age

3175
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,439
fantastic and did you have any of the

3176
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:03,840
kind of how should i say like deeply

3177
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:05,519
meaningful experiences which so many

3178
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,360
people say they have had at the dead

3179
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,199
shows or was it as you said more of just

3180
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:10,719
like a welcoming community and things

3181
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:13,359
like that

3182
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,800
i mean there's no other church having

3183
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:18,158
jerry

3184
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:20,560
just going off and the whole crowd

3185
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:23,359
elevating a foot off of where they're

3186
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:26,239
standing and every single person having

3187
01:54:23,359 --> 01:54:27,519
an unbelievable group experience of

3188
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:28,959
total

3189
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:32,239
oneness

3190
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:34,639
you know i have yet to experience that

3191
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:36,799
at any other place and you know that

3192
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:38,960
goes into all of our psychedelic use

3193
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,520
that we you know have taken on

3194
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,439
throughout our adult life as well

3195
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:45,920
you know all of them very important but

3196
01:54:43,439 --> 01:54:48,719
there was something about sharing

3197
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:51,118
that experience and that high with the

3198
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,960
same like-minded people yeah i mean

3199
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:56,519
there's nothing more

3200
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:59,279
we've had the most mind-blowing you know

3201
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:01,840
transforming experiences at grateful

3202
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:03,679
dead shows and then it just goes into

3203
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,599
the parking lot afterwards and there was

3204
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:07,359
camping afterwards so

3205
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:09,360
and there was no internet at the time

3206
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:10,880
and people weren't just like buried into

3207
01:55:09,359 --> 01:55:12,559
their their phones and stuff instead

3208
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,599
they were buried into like their each

3209
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,840
other and

3210
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:18,319
hacky sacks and guitars and drums and

3211
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,119
drum circles and disco busses

3212
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,880
and you know you would get to like know

3213
01:55:21,118 --> 01:55:25,198
people and and you would hear about

3214
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,118
people communes and people living a

3215
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:29,198
certain way and you would you know it

3216
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:31,359
was the most amazing thing in the world

3217
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,960
and a lot of the grateful dead family

3218
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:35,039
are still really really close with us

3219
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,719
and we're really blessed to have a close

3220
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:39,039
relationship with a lot of them they

3221
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,480
live in eugene and and in oakland and

3222
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:43,279

01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,280
mountain girl and every everything that

3226
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:50,319
the whole family has done and still do

3227
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:52,880
they still

3228
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:54,880
rock our community with love and those

3229
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,079
are our builders those are our elders

3230
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,679
that's when we were saying at the

3231
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:59,599
beginning you know we really don't feel

3232
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:01,039
like we're elders in this community

3233
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:03,279
those are the real elders those are the

3234
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:05,439
ones in their mid 70s

3235
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:07,519
that you know helped bring this plant

3236
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:09,519
forward you know mountain girl she wrote

3237
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:11,360
one of the first cannabis

3238
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,400
books out there that are totally

3239
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:17,118
relevant you know the primo plant today

3240
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:19,839
and those are our real you know teachers

3241
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:21,839
and guides that have helped us catapult

3242
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,440
forward to then catapult into the next

3243
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,039
generation yeah

3244
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:26,319
yeah i was about to say wow it's been a

3245
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:27,439
minute since i've heard of the merry

3246
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:29,759
pranksters

3247
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:31,759
uh so i guess with that all being said

3248
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:34,079
at what point did you kind of have the

3249
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:37,760
initial thoughts to start dragonfly and

3250
01:56:34,079 --> 01:56:37,760
what was the ultimate catalyst

3251
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:41,198
well we

3252
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:43,759
we moved

3253
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:45,598
to another country in 98

3254
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:47,760
and

3255
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:49,840
lived the way that we lived for a really

3256
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,520
long time and

3257
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,639
we

3258
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:57,599
got we became citizens of this country

3259
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:58,480
through doing um imports

3260
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,560
from

3261
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:02,879
indonesia and then

3262
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,760
that we started transforming out of that

3263
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:05,679
after

3264
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,760
you know a while and started feeling

3265
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:10,480
like we really wanted to do

3266
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:12,320
um a service you know to the earth and a

3267
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:13,678
service that really represented our

3268
01:57:12,319 --> 01:57:18,238
lifestyle

3269
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:20,800
and um it became you know and by 2007 we

3270
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:22,879
we formed dragonfly earth medicine

3271
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,480
as a representation of our lifestyle

3272
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,400
yeah and i think that also as a

3273
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:27,678
representation of our direct you know of

3274
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:29,279
our recipes

3275
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:31,118
so it was the first time that we were

3276
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:32,719
able to share our recipes and it didn't

3277
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:34,158
start out that we just had dragonfly

3278
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:36,399
earth medicine it started out that we

3279
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:38,799
were just making a ton of stuff for all

3280
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:40,879
of our friends and then they were

3281
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,440
getting it from us and oh my god you

3282
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,960
guys this stuff is so amazing and you

3283
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:47,039
know teaching them how to grow it and

3284
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:49,359
then them drying it out and then you

3285
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,279
know taking all of the different herbal

3286
01:57:49,359 --> 01:57:53,439
concoctions and then it really became

3287
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:55,599
about sharing our recipes and

3288
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:57,118
we're working on a book now it's been

3289
01:57:55,599 --> 01:58:00,000
several years working on it it's just

3290
01:57:57,118 --> 01:58:02,319
getting bigger and bigger and bigger

3291
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,960
because there's so much information but

3292
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:07,759
it is it's really that same thing it's

3293
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:11,039
it's sharing the recipes of our life and

3294
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:14,000
of our cultivation practices

3295
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,279
that's a really good answer and so

3296
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,039
something which a lot of people have

3297
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:19,039
asked us questions about is your recent

3298
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:20,399
trip to jamaica and you you referenced

3299
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:21,679
it earlier but i wanted to do a whole

3300
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:23,198
bunch of questions on this i figured

3301
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:26,000
we'd kind of dedicate a little block to

3302
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:27,598
it first of all what was the uh the i

3303
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,319
guess you know the inspiration to do the

3304
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:33,360
jamaica trip

3305
01:58:30,319 --> 01:58:35,759
the inspiration was um we had been

3306
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:39,359
reached out to by certain parts of the

3307
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:41,280
community and um you know they had to to

3308
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:44,000
come out and

3309
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:44,719
to collaborate with them and and work

3310
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,439
with

3311
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:49,359
them on their the project and so and

3312
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:52,158
they were needing you know some help and

3313
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:54,158
some some ideas and and some changes

3314
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:56,479
they wanted to make changes to become

3315
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:58,559
you know more closed loop and they had

3316
01:58:56,479 --> 01:59:00,799
been asking us for you know maybe a

3317
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:03,520
whole year to come out and we finally

3318
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:05,599
said yeah okay we'll do it now

3319
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,760
and um that's just sort of how it all

3320
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,679
began and it was an opportunity for us

3321
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,760
to bring together our community and

3322
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:14,319
theirs and for us to learn

3323
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,960
from their community and and from us to

3324
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:19,519
and for us to teach them you know from

3325
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,760
um our community you know things that we

3326
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,119
had learned and stuff so it was we felt

3327
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,840
like it was a really beautiful

3328
01:59:23,118 --> 01:59:28,559
information exchange

3329
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:30,480
yeah and so when you got there what were

3330
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:32,159
kind of the first or i shouldn't say

3331
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:33,598
with the first like what were some of

3332
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:36,158
the initial

3333
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:37,679
styles of gardening slash principles

3334
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:39,759
slash methodologies however you want to

3335
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,440
classify it what were the main tools you

3336
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,760
used when you were kind of revitalizing

3337
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:45,039
the land it's from from a third from

3338
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,239
like an outsider point of view it looked

3339
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:48,479
like you were using kind of you know the

3340
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:49,919
use of imo some kind of k and f style

3341
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:51,919
principles is that how you would

3342
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:53,920
describe it or how would you describe

3343
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,920
what you did essentially

3344
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:58,960
yeah well it's the same you know you

3345
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:01,039
just go into an area and you just try to

3346
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,039
figure out doing a lot of really good

3347
02:00:01,039 --> 02:00:05,118
practices on the property and and

3348
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:06,319
building soils and stuff and when we got

3349
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:07,839
there we were

3350
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:10,158
able to

3351
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,480
you know continue the work and and

3352
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:14,238
connect more with the surroundings and

3353
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:15,919
you know using a chipper was a big part

3354
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:18,559
of it you know

3355
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:20,319
yeah and just seeing what was available

3356
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:22,800
in and around the property and what it

3357
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:24,479
is that they had available so

3358
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,480
you know we had talked to them at the

3359
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:27,678
beginning and they had gotten a chipper

3360
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:30,158
you know

3361
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:32,719
and we just started

3362
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:34,799
you know talking about you know what

3363
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:37,198
type of ratios of chipping that you can

3364
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,920
utilize and you know within two to three

3365
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:42,638
days we had massive piles of soil that

3366
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:45,599
we just planted directly into

3367
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:48,319
and it's amazing how when you just

3368
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:50,079
utilize what is there around you it's

3369
02:00:48,319 --> 02:00:51,840
great to go to the tropics too because

3370
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:52,880
it's a whole different

3371
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,520
like

3372
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:57,520
reality of what we deal with up here but

3373
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:59,440
really it's the same in that you just

3374
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:01,760
look at the biomass that's available but

3375
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:03,598
there's not like a lot of earthworms

3376
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,719
there you know when you go to tropical

3377
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:07,360
climates

3378
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:09,760
you're you're dealing with massive

3379
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:12,399
amounts of microbiology

3380
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:14,560
you know tropical regions

3381
02:01:12,399 --> 02:01:16,799
you know rejuvenate themselves so

3382
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,800
quickly you know jungles are just eating

3383
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,639
themselves and regrowing themselves you

3384
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,119
know so quickly

3385
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:26,719
and in jamaica really has like that

3386
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:28,000
jungle feeling so the microbiology is so

3387
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:30,239
much you know

3388
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
finding indigenous microorganisms is

3389
02:01:30,238 --> 02:01:33,439
like it they're everywhere

3390
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,880
you put something down on the ground you

3391
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:37,118
add a little bit of water to it and it's

3392
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:39,440
going to disintegrate within a day

3393
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:42,000
so what kind of things could you lay on

3394
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:44,638
top of the ground that could become soil

3395
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,118
really quickly and we just sort of got

3396
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:49,118
into the brain of the microbiology there

3397
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:52,079
and went through well yeah i mean for

3398
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:56,559
example i think uh a regular bale of

3399
02:01:52,079 --> 02:01:58,880
peat moss like a four cubic yard um bail

3400
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,960
pmos is like 70

3401
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:03,039
or something it's like some crazy amount

3402
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,840
of money you know what i mean so you

3403
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:09,279
really can't take the mentality of oh

3404
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:11,119
i'm gonna make soil for you know a ganja

3405
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:13,279
garden or something or be you know buy

3406
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:15,439
from the store type thing so

3407
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:16,800
you know you could get a bail or have a

3408
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:19,039
couple bales and then you would maybe

3409
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,880
want to like you know extend that as

3410
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:22,719
much as possible so

3411
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,880
one thing is we started digging around

3412
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:26,719
on the property and saw other you know

3413
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:29,679
areas on the property that were dug out

3414
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:31,920
from greenhouses and stuff

3415
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:34,239
and we started realizing you know on the

3416
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:36,639
on the property what parts of it had

3417
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:38,718
really good deposits of earth

3418
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:40,239
so there was i mean i mean like soil

3419
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:42,880
usable soil

3420
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:45,678
some of it was kind of like clayish and

3421
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:48,079
and had like a tendency to want to bind

3422
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:50,239
together but so what we did is we just

3423
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:52,479
would take wheelbarrows to that and just

3424
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:54,158
start mixing it you know with the

3425
02:02:52,479 --> 02:02:56,000
biomass that we were collecting from

3426
02:02:54,158 --> 02:02:57,359
different places and we were basically

3427
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,679
aerating it

3428
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:00,399
aerating it with biomass and stuff so it

3429
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:02,639
was

3430
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:04,238
it was a hands-on collection and we

3431
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:06,239
walked around with the you know with the

3432
02:03:04,238 --> 02:03:07,439
the the people from the friends from the

3433
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:08,879
village and

3434
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:12,000
and we really connected with what

3435
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,039
vegetation you know was good to use and

3436
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,439
we

3437
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:17,599
would reach our hands into the ground

3438
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:19,279
and see what kind of you know dirt there

3439
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:21,760
was in earth and we would see how we

3440
02:03:19,279 --> 02:03:23,679
could bring that up and propagate it and

3441
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:25,440
stuff so that that was our you know that

3442
02:03:23,679 --> 02:03:28,079
was how it started when we first got

3443
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:30,238
there this is an example of really a lot

3444
02:03:28,079 --> 02:03:33,279
of the island being full of a lot of

3445
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:35,598
clay very hard stuff to be able to work

3446
02:03:33,279 --> 02:03:37,840
with and just getting out of the mindset

3447
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:39,760
that you have to go in the ground you

3448
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,760
know that you can come up and out of the

3449
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,920
ground and that soil is available

3450
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:46,719
everywhere you look because it things

3451
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:48,960
grow so voraciously everywhere you know

3452
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:51,359
the same as in australia there's so many

3453
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,599
northern regions and areas that things

3454
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:55,679
are just growing so much that is your

3455
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:58,319
soil and if we start looking at what is

3456
02:03:55,679 --> 02:04:00,800
the above is below

3457
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:03,439
then it it just makes it really easy to

3458
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,279
adapt to garden very quickly even if you

3459
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:07,759
don't understand the surroundings or you

3460
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:09,759
don't even know the vegetation

3461
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,400
yeah yeah some really pertinent points

3462
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:12,480
there

3463
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:14,078
one thing i personally noticed from the

3464
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:15,759
the images that i saw on your instagram

3465
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:18,158
for example was that

3466
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,760
the soil itself didn't look all that

3467
02:04:18,158 --> 02:04:21,198
aesthetically pleasing especially if you

3468
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:22,480
come from like an indoor setting where

3469
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:24,559
you know it looks all nice and

3470
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:25,598
homogenous however you couldn't deny

3471
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,960
like what you said you know they're

3472
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:28,639
planning straight into it there's no

3473
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,158
issues all that type of thing

3474
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:31,599
what i ultimately am interested in

3475
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:33,039
though is how do you think that soil

3476
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:34,078
would have ultimately compared like do

3477
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:35,920
you think that

3478
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:37,679
it was kind of like you were making the

3479
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,840
situation work but at the same time

3480
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:41,118
there's kind of you know a bit of a

3481
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:42,639
honest truth that you know maybe it's

3482
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:44,479
not going to perform as well as the pete

3483
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,840
but you know given the situation the

3484
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:47,759
cost all the rest is clearly the

3485
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,000
superior option

3486
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:52,880
well it's definitely clearly the

3487
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,279
superior option no matter what even if i

3488
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:58,239
had available soil to be buying from the

3489
02:04:55,279 --> 02:05:01,359
store what we were making if it comes in

3490
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:02,879
on that land was absolutely superior and

3491
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:05,039
i mean if you look at the whole island

3492
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,639
of jamaica i mean you know there's a lot

3493
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:09,519
of different kinds of soil on the island

3494
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:10,480
there's red soil there's black soil

3495
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,679
there's

3496
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:16,158
hard soil and stuff so it is extremely

3497
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:18,000
dependent on on where you are

3498
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:20,000
and it is amazing you know when you go

3499
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,158
to even hawaii and different places you

3500
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,719
know there's the red dirt is an

3501
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:26,719
incredible dirt that grows you know

3502
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:28,800
plants amazingly so really

3503
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:30,800
you can't really go on visual

3504
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,440
what you really need to have in there

3505
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:34,800
once we what we say all the time is just

3506
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:36,879
biomass

3507
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,560
so i mean that's how we're aerating the

3508
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,118
soils and that's how we're attracting

3509
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:42,960
more worms there wasn't there was worms

3510
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,639
around but there wasn't a ton so we were

3511
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:45,920
trying to like just gather them from

3512
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:48,480
wherever we

3513
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:50,639
we found it but you find that it it's

3514
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:52,479
they're not the big digesters you know

3515
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:54,400
of soil the big digesters is the

3516
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:56,000
microbiology

3517
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:58,638
in the soil so the soil that we were

3518
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,760
digging up in the soil that we made

3519
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:02,159
we

3520
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,719
made a whole batch of soil you know

3521
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:07,519
within the first week that we were there

3522
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:09,439
and planted seeds that we brought

3523
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:11,440
in that soil and

3524
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:13,198
you know we had gone on some other farm

3525
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:15,759
tours and went around and but we got to

3526
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:17,839
see those seeds germinate out of the

3527
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:20,079
soil that we made and got to see the the

3528
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:22,639
health of the seeds and stuff so

3529
02:06:20,078 --> 02:06:25,198
i i do believe that you know the soil

3530
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:26,800
was really really powerful and good

3531
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:29,039
yeah that's awesome to hear so you i

3532
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:31,760
mean you just tapped on the genetics

3533
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:33,118
point the question i have is because

3534
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:36,000
i've seen other other people go to

3535
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:37,598
jamaica most notably uh sonic seeds uk

3536
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,560
based breeder he's been there and done a

3537
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:40,078
bit of a

3538
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:41,520
land race hunt type of thing and

3539
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:43,118
obviously you would have been exposed to

3540
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,639
different genetics on the island what

3541
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:46,319
did you see when you were there because

3542
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:48,319
a lot of what people say is like it's a

3543
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:50,880
lot of really acclimatized dutch stuff

3544
02:06:48,319 --> 02:06:52,399
from years gone by and that the general

3545
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,560
consensus is there's not really any pure

3546
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:55,920
land race anymore would you agree with

3547
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:59,520
that

3548
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:02,399
yes definitely as far as like

3549
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,639
climatized i don't know i don't we

3550
02:07:02,399 --> 02:07:05,839
didn't really see too many climatized

3551
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:08,639
patches

3552
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:11,360
you know they're all really short and

3553
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:13,760
there's even an eight week can be

3554
02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:15,759
flowering out in five weeks it forms a

3555
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,159
tiniest little bud on it

3556
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:20,800
you know it's not something

3557
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:23,920
yeah it's all hybrids that you know have

3558
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:27,679
a lot of maybe the high himalayan

3559
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:29,520
cold climate northern cali or european

3560
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:31,760
strain all dutch i mean there's a lot of

3561
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:34,159
california influence in there and for

3562
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:36,239
sure i mean there's you know i i'm not i

3563
02:07:34,158 --> 02:07:37,598
have no idea about percentage-wise and

3564
02:07:36,238 --> 02:07:38,959
stuff but

3565
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:41,360
i would say that we found with the

3566
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:44,319
jamaican farmers that you know they were

3567
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:46,719
no very similar to any one of us who

3568
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:47,840
really want the best flavor and the

3569
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:49,840
newest

3570
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,719
genetic and the newest you know best

3571
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:55,119
crystals and and hash making things so

3572
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:56,800
over the years they've met people and

3573
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:59,359
people have come to the island and and

3574
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:01,360
they've you know would would be get

3575
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:03,519
gifted or something and so what you find

3576
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:05,679
when you go to the farms is a

3577
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,840
is a lot of small plants which are

3578
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:10,158
mostly hybrid from a lot of years of

3579
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:11,760
people you know yeah breeding from other

3580
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:13,920
places in the world

3581
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:17,199
and it's really you know there there

3582
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,880
is that that farm or that place that has

3583
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:21,519
land race and

3584
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:24,000
if they're off the beaten track and you

3585
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:26,719
know it's it's really not a sought after

3586
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,319
thing on the island really because it of

3587
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:30,880
you know what they they feel like they

3588
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:33,039
can grow now let's say and we we felt

3589
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:34,960
like it was really important you know

3590
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:37,198
that that the genetics that we brought

3591
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:40,000
there were very thought out

3592
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:42,960
and we brought genetics um you know from

3593
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,960
bodhi and from coastal seeds and bob

3594
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,880
henpel

3595
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:49,279
you know that were climatized that were

3596
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:51,279
more like thai varieties

3597
02:08:49,279 --> 02:08:53,359
that we know that maybe they could start

3598
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:56,479
interbreeding and trying to find you

3599
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:59,679
know a biologically intelligent

3600
02:08:56,479 --> 02:09:01,759
tall long flowering because anywhere

3601
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:02,880
around the tropics you know it's a 12

3602
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,440
12.

3603
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:08,719
and that's the genetics that we you know

3604
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:09,439
search for in in our realms is that you

3605
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:12,319
know

3606
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:13,919
two month eight week plant

3607
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:15,439
but when you're there

3608
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,199
you know you put out a really small

3609
02:09:15,439 --> 02:09:19,759
plant and immediately just starts

3610
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:21,839
flowering you're not going to be able to

3611
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:23,360
number one it's not going to reach the

3612
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:25,520
full potential

3613
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:28,319
i mean waste if you're lucky we saw you

3614
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:29,280
know whole fields of just like knee-high

3615
02:09:28,319 --> 02:09:31,439
and

3616
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:34,000
it's because these these plants don't

3617
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:35,759
have the intelligence of a 12-12 cycle

3618
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,520
they don't have the intelligence of an

3619
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:40,480
equatorial

3620
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:43,040
you know region either so you can get a

3621
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:44,879
really sweet producing sativa that does

3622
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:46,560
take longer it makes their plants you

3623
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,679
know bigger and

3624
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:49,760
nice and

3625
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:51,440
and really expressive i mean

3626
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,960
you know that so that was a big thing

3627
02:09:51,439 --> 02:09:54,638
yeah we went and talked a lot about

3628
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:56,639
breeding and went and talked to a lot of

3629
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,480
breeders there's a lot of open breeding

3630
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:00,800
happening by a lot of farmers where you

3631
02:09:58,479 --> 02:10:02,799
know they just let you know a few males

3632
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:04,480
you know pollinate gardens in certain

3633
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,599
areas and stuff so

3634
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:07,598
you know

3635
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:09,199
that is a really good way of breeding

3636
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,039
from from their point of view and it

3637
02:10:09,198 --> 02:10:12,799
gets a lot of different flavors and

3638
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:14,639
their flavors are all

3639
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,960
you know they they get through them they

3640
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:19,679
sell them and and do it you know it's so

3641
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,480
it works in in that climate but

3642
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:23,440
um

3643
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:25,359
yeah so like when on the island itself

3644
02:10:23,439 --> 02:10:27,198
if you have to take a guess does kind of

3645
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:29,359
marijuana make up a large part of the

3646
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:31,118
the economy or it's a relatively a

3647
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:33,279
smaller part nowadays like is it is a

3648
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:36,158
big thing for them

3649
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:38,639
well back in the 80s it was huge and you

3650
02:10:36,158 --> 02:10:41,198
know they were cutting out swaths of of

3651
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,679
jungle and landing you know big

3652
02:10:41,198 --> 02:10:46,000
airplanes and then all of that you know

3653
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:49,199
ganjo was brought out all over europe

3654
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:52,000
especially uk and holland and and all of

3655
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:54,799
that and then turned into hash and so

3656
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,679
there was a really huge economy

3657
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:59,599
for you know weed growers on that island

3658
02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:01,599
because not only did they have the

3659
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:04,078
culture of weed but they also had the

3660
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:05,279
know-how how to grow it and it was

3661
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:07,359
really good and they were already

3662
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:10,000
growing you know pretty large amounts of

3663
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:12,158
it so for them to be able to expand

3664
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,679
was really easy but now they're seeing

3665
02:11:12,158 --> 02:11:15,920
the same thing

3666
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:18,399
as the whole cannabis industry you know

3667
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:21,359
anywhere that it's been legalized you

3668
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:24,078
know with legalization comes regulations

3669
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:26,319
that then make it really difficult to be

3670
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:27,920
able to have an economy

3671
02:11:26,319 --> 02:11:30,719
off of that so

3672
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:32,639
now all of a sudden through legalization

3673
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:35,359
you know they're keeping all of their

3674
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:37,279
weed into your island and there's not

3675
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:39,118
enough people you know and they're

3676
02:11:37,279 --> 02:11:41,118
looking to be able to get it out for

3677
02:11:39,118 --> 02:11:42,399
sure but that's a whole other

3678
02:11:41,118 --> 02:11:44,799
conversation with pharmaceutical

3679
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:47,198
companies i mean you know every

3680
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,599
for sure most people grow i mean uh

3681
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:51,759
smoke cannabis on the island and you

3682
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:53,760
know it's it's everyone's smoking ganja

3683
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:55,440
and it's it's not a thing at all to

3684
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:58,000
worry about and it's it's definitely a

3685
02:11:55,439 --> 02:12:00,479
huge part of the thing it's not valuable

3686
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,599
on the island i mean it's it's valuable

3687
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:03,039
i'm not saying you know there's there's

3688
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:05,440
farmers and they and they sell and they

3689
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:07,599
make monetary value you know it's it's

3690
02:12:05,439 --> 02:12:09,759
it's inexpensive you know on the island

3691
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:13,119
type thing so it's you know to make a

3692
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:15,679
lot of so i'd say it seems like cannabis

3693
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:18,880
is is definitely in a really big

3694
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:21,840
transformation in on jamaica because of

3695
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:24,078
of legalization like kelly said but

3696
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:25,679
with legalization is becoming

3697
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:28,238
international

3698
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:30,319
um you know farming is what you're

3699
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:32,158
starting to see on jamaica and other

3700
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:35,679
countries and

3701
02:12:32,158 --> 02:12:38,000
i think jamaica's big you know

3702
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:40,158
goal or thing in life is i mean they've

3703
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,078
helped bring cannabis culture to the

3704
02:12:40,158 --> 02:12:43,839
world through their practices and

3705
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:45,279
through their love of rastafari and

3706
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:47,360
reggae music

3707
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:49,840
and so they they want to still save

3708
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:52,479
their culture and save their farms and

3709
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:54,560
their way of life and growing and they

3710
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:57,439
they they do want to see legalization

3711
02:12:54,560 --> 02:13:00,159
but they to see legalization meaning a

3712
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:01,919
bunch of international companies coming

3713
02:13:00,158 --> 02:13:04,078
in and using their island to grow a

3714
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,800
bunch of weed like say for example

3715
02:13:04,078 --> 02:13:09,039
canadian companies could potentially are

3716
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:12,480
are you know working in jamaica right

3717
02:13:09,039 --> 02:13:14,719
now and a lot of weed on jamaica really

3718
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:17,519
to be valuable has been exported over

3719
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:20,599
the years even in the 80s so now that

3720
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:23,679
export market is now transforming to a

3721
02:13:20,599 --> 02:13:25,760
legalization market and you know i think

3722
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:27,279
that there's a there's a cultural thing

3723
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:29,119
at stake there and i think they really

3724
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:32,238
want to save their culture and there's

3725
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:33,519
also a health stake there you know so

3726
02:13:32,238 --> 02:13:35,359
these large

3727
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:37,440
corporate cannabis are coming to the

3728
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:39,279
island you know not to spread doom and

3729
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:40,719
gloom but to give people an education

3730
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:43,039
out there we think that it's totally

3731
02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:45,439
imperative once it becomes federally

3732
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:47,439
legal then there's a play in the

3733
02:13:45,439 --> 02:13:49,678
international market with all other

3734
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:51,759
federally legal countries

3735
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:53,920
and then all of a sudden now it becomes

3736
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:56,079
pharmaceutical so it's going to be

3737
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:57,520
really easy for large pharmaceutical

3738
02:13:56,078 --> 02:14:00,559
companies to

3739
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:02,960
to partner with large cannabis companies

3740
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:05,520
and those large cannabis companies not

3741
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:08,960
even grow the cannabis because they'll

3742
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:11,840
get cheaper cannabis with the labor um

3743
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:14,800
and also you know the dollar exchange in

3744
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:18,560
jamaica or say in colombia you know the

3745
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:20,719
cut flower market is a huge industry

3746
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:22,639
and now the cannabis big corporate

3747
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:25,439
cannabis is starting to have massive

3748
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:27,440
takeovers in colombia and in brazil i

3749
02:14:25,439 --> 02:14:29,598
mean most of the farms we visited in

3750
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:31,439
jamaica even you know ones that were

3751
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:33,760
like roots farms that have been growing

3752
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:35,519
for a long time had been visited by

3753
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:37,840
these international companies that were

3754
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,920
talking yeah this is happening now we go

3755
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:42,000
there this winter and as of us going

3756
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:43,440
there this winter all of the farmers

3757
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,679
have been visited by international

3758
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:47,039
companies i mean that's that's a that's

3759
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:48,800
kind of a generalized statement but

3760
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:50,960
that's that's what we found is that

3761
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,480
they've been and they want to make deals

3762
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:55,118
with it and they and they say that you

3763
02:14:52,479 --> 02:14:56,879
know they don't care how it's grown and

3764
02:14:55,118 --> 02:14:59,279
other countries don't have the same

3765
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:01,440
restrictions with pesticides and with

3766
02:14:59,279 --> 02:15:04,078
fertilizers and with herbicides and

3767
02:15:01,439 --> 02:15:05,759
fungicides and on and on so that it

3768
02:15:04,078 --> 02:15:07,759
opens up

3769
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:09,280
and it opens that they either irradiate

3770
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,280
it or they say they're going to wash it

3771
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:13,519
with petrochemical solvents and then

3772
02:15:11,279 --> 02:15:15,519
they think that they're washing out

3773
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:17,840
all of you know

3774
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:18,880
any pathogens or purities that are on

3775
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:21,199
there

3776
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:23,599
it's a really big conversation you know

3777
02:15:21,198 --> 02:15:24,879
this could be a whole other podcast that

3778
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:27,039
we do

3779
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:28,960
yeah well i mean the exact same thing is

3780
02:15:27,039 --> 02:15:30,880
happening in australia in regards to the

3781
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,719
uh international you know kind of

3782
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,639
companies moving in and doing their bit

3783
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:36,239
but something i would love to ask first

3784
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:38,400
though is do you think part of this

3785
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:41,118
problem arises from the increasing

3786
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:43,198
demand from the consumer market

3787
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:45,439
for concentrates or products which

3788
02:15:43,198 --> 02:15:46,638
derive from concentrates and thus you

3789
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:48,319
know there's

3790
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:50,639
maybe not demand but for example the

3791
02:15:48,319 --> 02:15:52,399
stat i heard was that something like 50

3792
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:54,639
of all cannabis sales in the states are

3793
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:56,960
related to like vape pens or cartridges

3794
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:58,560
or like something along that line and if

3795
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:00,800
it's true it just goes to show yeah like

3796
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:02,960
there's just an exponential growth in

3797
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:04,639
the the demand for these cartridges and

3798
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:06,480
so do you think that's a problem because

3799
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:07,440
it facilitates you know like just these

3800
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:09,598
kind of

3801
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:11,118
you know shady concentrate deals going

3802
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:12,960
on

3803
02:16:11,118 --> 02:16:15,279
well there's there's that's a whole

3804
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:16,880
other conversation too as far as like

3805
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:18,639
concentrates and the cleanliness of

3806
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:20,400
concentrates and the importance of the

3807
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:22,880
cleanliness of concentrates because it's

3808
02:16:20,399 --> 02:16:25,039
not just a concentrate it actually has

3809
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:28,078
the name of what it is you're literally

3810
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:31,039
concentrating everything that's in that

3811
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:33,039
flower you know so utmost respect for

3812
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:34,000
cultivation practices all the way

3813
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:36,880
through

3814
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,959
is imperative for concentrates and then

3815
02:16:36,879 --> 02:16:41,518
to look at your other question about it

3816
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:44,079
taking over the large market

3817
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:45,679
is that you know now that pharmaceutical

3818
02:16:44,079 --> 02:16:47,760
companies are going to be entering into

3819
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:50,079
the cannabis market of course they're

3820
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:52,239
going to be concentrating it they're

3821
02:16:50,079 --> 02:16:55,280
going to be getting a product that has

3822
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:58,159
the same exact cannabinoid ratio no

3823
02:16:55,280 --> 02:17:00,479
matter how or where they put it out and

3824
02:16:58,159 --> 02:17:03,119
it is a way of dosaging and it's

3825
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:05,438
something that they understand that's

3826
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:07,280
not you know it's taking it out of sort

3827
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:09,679
of the organic

3828
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:12,079
um you know world that we know of

3829
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:14,318
looking at flowers now it's going to be

3830
02:17:12,079 --> 02:17:16,959
you know going into different types of

3831
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:20,558
supplements and in all different types

3832
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:22,478
of you know pills and caps worldwide so

3833
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:25,840
that's definitely going to take up the

3834
02:17:22,478 --> 02:17:28,799
majority of the market i think that

3835
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:31,760
you're right to say that you know the

3836
02:17:28,799 --> 02:17:34,638
the demand of the people to buy oils is

3837
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:37,519
is part of it and it's it's driven you

3838
02:17:34,638 --> 02:17:40,638
know farms to make concentrates

3839
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:42,880
and um it's a convenience thing you know

3840
02:17:40,638 --> 02:17:44,879
it's not as smoky and everything so what

3841
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:47,039
you find when you talk to dispensaries

3842
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:48,478
and you talk to you know who's the you

3843
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,559
know the the people that are buying in

3844
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:52,638
the dispensaries they want something

3845
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:54,558
super easy that they can drive around in

3846
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:57,518
their car with and stuff so

3847
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:58,879
there is an ease that comes to you know

3848
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:01,760
having a pen

3849
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:02,959
um pre-rolls is another thing that sells

3850
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:05,120
you know really really well in

3851
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:07,759
dispensaries which i think is another

3852
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:10,000
thing of ease you know it's just easy to

3853
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:11,120
get pre-rolls and stuff and you know

3854
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,200
it's always

3855
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:15,920
a better high i think in a lot of ways

3856
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:18,319
to have like the full flower and

3857
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:20,879
i think that um from a farmer's point of

3858
02:18:18,318 --> 02:18:23,679
view i think it's almost good with the

3859
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:25,679
um concentrates in a way because you

3860
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:28,478
don't have to grow all clones you can

3861
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:30,159
grow you know a bunch of seeds seed

3862
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:31,840
plants and have different varieties and

3863
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:35,200
then do batches

3864
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:37,040
of your flower and make a good oil batch

3865
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:38,880
and it's going to be all that you know

3866
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:40,719
number and everything so

3867
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:43,199
um number of cannabinoids and everything

3868
02:18:40,718 --> 02:18:46,398
so i mean it's it's kind of an amazing

3869
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:48,880
question you know that you know on which

3870
02:18:46,398 --> 02:18:50,478
one came first essentially

3871
02:18:48,879 --> 02:18:52,558
yeah

3872
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:54,638
and well so what do you think then is

3873
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:56,959
the necessary steps for us as either a

3874
02:18:54,638 --> 02:18:58,718
community or just as a scene so to speak

3875
02:18:56,959 --> 02:19:00,638
to get things back on track and do you

3876
02:18:58,718 --> 02:19:02,239
think that it's a knee-jerk reaction to

3877
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:04,478
say just try to push people to go back

3878
02:19:02,239 --> 02:19:06,239
to flower

3879
02:19:04,478 --> 02:19:07,840
um i think the most important thing that

3880
02:19:06,239 --> 02:19:10,879
we can push people to is know your

3881
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:12,239
farmer the most important thing and then

3882
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:15,598
understand

3883
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:18,398
where your flowers are coming from

3884
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:20,639
understand where you know

3885
02:19:18,398 --> 02:19:22,318
what dispensary that you want to go to

3886
02:19:20,638 --> 02:19:24,239
what breeder that you're working with

3887
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:25,279
you know really finding out and

3888
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:27,840
understanding their products and

3889
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:30,960
extraction company you're using yeah and

3890
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:33,280
what what so i no we're not saying

3891
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:36,159
everyone should only smoke flour

3892
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:38,399
you know we only smoke flour and

3893
02:19:36,159 --> 02:19:40,478
we have some you know really amazing you

3894
02:19:38,398 --> 02:19:43,279
know extract companies that we work with

3895
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:45,039
ice water hash too yeah well i mean

3896
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:47,359
there's some really really good good

3897
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:49,600
companies out there um that do

3898
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:50,800
extracting and stuff but so what we want

3899
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,520
to say is

3900
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:57,679
you know yeah it's totally it's totally

3901
02:19:53,520 --> 02:20:00,399
fine to to use but we don't we as a as a

3902
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:03,600
certification and as as a as a community

3903
02:20:00,398 --> 02:20:04,639
we don't use any petrochemicals

3904
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:06,079
when we

3905
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:07,358
extract our

3906
02:20:06,079 --> 02:20:09,359
our

3907
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:11,520
materials so that's what's really really

3908
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:13,359
important to us and i think that

3909
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:16,000
customers and people that are out there

3910
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:17,680
that are consumers should ask you know

3911
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:22,318
what did it come from was it made from

3912
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:24,318
propane or butane and then or hexane

3913
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:27,039
even that white powder cbd that you're

3914
02:20:24,318 --> 02:20:29,279
talking about is a hexane product and

3915
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:31,680
those are just coming from petrochemical

3916
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:33,359
companies and they're just coming from

3917
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:35,680
from sources that we just don't want to

3918
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:37,280
be involved in which goes back to what

3919
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:39,600
you were talking about with animal

3920
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:41,920
products it's the same reason it's the

3921
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,600
source of what happens within the animal

3922
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:45,600
product industry the source of what

3923
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:48,960
happens within the petrochemical

3924
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,840
industry as well as the final product

3925
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:52,079
so

3926
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:54,239
you know all things need to be looked at

3927
02:20:52,079 --> 02:20:56,239
and unfortunately you know

3928
02:20:54,239 --> 02:20:58,559
education

3929
02:20:56,239 --> 02:21:00,239
is paramount how are we going to share

3930
02:20:58,559 --> 02:21:02,719
education with each other in the

3931
02:21:00,239 --> 02:21:04,959
importance of being really open

3932
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:07,199
and that hopefully dispensaries are

3933
02:21:04,959 --> 02:21:08,799
getting more on their game and that you

3934
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:10,399
know more growers are getting more on

3935
02:21:08,799 --> 02:21:12,879
their game because

3936
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:13,840
it's really important because so many of

3937
02:21:12,879 --> 02:21:16,159
the people that are going to be

3938
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,840
listening to this podcast and us having

3939
02:21:16,159 --> 02:21:20,559
this conversation

3940
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:23,359
you know were a different group of

3941
02:21:20,559 --> 02:21:26,000
cannabis enthusiasts of cannabis

3942
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:27,439
cultivators of cannabis you know

3943
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,359
business people

3944
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:31,120
than the other

3945
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:33,520
side that i'm talking about with this

3946
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:36,800
massive cannabis

3947
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:39,359
corporate model that is the other side

3948
02:21:36,799 --> 02:21:41,599
of cannabis so it's so important to have

3949
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:43,920
education on this side

3950
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:45,600
so that we can share and really get the

3951
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:47,280
message out

3952
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,920
yeah 100

3953
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:51,760
and so this is a bit of a doom and gloom

3954
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:54,079
question but what's your prediction for

3955
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:55,680
what would happen to the high-end market

3956
02:21:54,079 --> 02:21:57,920
so to speak if all of the small

3957
02:21:55,680 --> 02:22:00,720
producers were kind of pushed out phased

3958
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:02,318
out whatever you want to call it

3959
02:22:00,719 --> 02:22:04,799
well what you're going to get is a bunch

3960
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:06,079
of irradiated weed

3961
02:22:04,799 --> 02:22:08,639
what you're going to get is you're going

3962
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:09,520
to get you're going to get basically

3963
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:13,279
um

3964
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:16,079
the same thing is going and buying um

3965
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:19,520
packaged processed food

3966
02:22:16,079 --> 02:22:21,200
so by by pushing out the small farmer

3967
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:23,600
you're pushing out

3968
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:25,600
the intention

3969
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,800
and that'll never happen

3970
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:31,280
anyway there will be a reassurgence no

3971
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:33,599
matter what right now is a hard time

3972
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,520
but a lot of the true soul growers you

3973
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:38,239
know already had their properties and

3974
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,120
are trying to navigate their way through

3975
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:40,799
and

3976
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:43,840
i think that you're gonna just like

3977
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:46,318
craft beer and craft wine and craft food

3978
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:48,960
you know you're gonna find you know

3979
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:51,760
regions where it still works to have

3980
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:53,759
small farms and the small farms are just

3981
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:56,960
going to have such unique flavors and

3982
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:59,359
such unique strains that you know

3983
02:22:56,959 --> 02:23:01,438
those those mass-produced farms will

3984
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:03,600
they'll never be able to produce that i

3985
02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:05,760
mean the large automated farms that are

3986
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:06,800
happening up in canada are talking about

3987
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:09,280
being

3988
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:11,519
no peep there no people grow the weed

3989
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:12,560
it's all automated the whole entire

3990
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:15,280
thing

3991
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:17,279
the all the watering all the spraying

3992
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:19,200
all even the harvesting is it's done

3993
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:21,280
like robotically

3994
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:22,640
and i'd like to think i'd like to think

3995
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:24,319
that you know

3996
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:27,279
the cannabis plant

3997
02:23:24,318 --> 02:23:29,760
um you know has her own intelligence and

3998
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:32,000
the reason why i say she is it's just a

3999
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,079
feminine energy plant it doesn't mean

4000
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:37,840
that there aren't males and females

4001
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:39,600
um but you know she will probably i hope

4002
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:41,920
have the last laugh

4003
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:43,280
because we're learning that the happier

4004
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:44,559
she is

4005
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:47,760
and the more

4006
02:23:44,559 --> 02:23:50,318
grown with better intention and in

4007
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:52,639
you know beautiful soils she's going to

4008
02:23:50,318 --> 02:23:54,398
produce the well-rounded cannabinoid

4009
02:23:52,639 --> 02:23:56,559
profile that really puts out the

4010
02:23:54,398 --> 02:23:58,879
medicine that science is going to soon

4011
02:23:56,559 --> 02:24:01,680
come to it's what we as old-school

4012
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:04,000
growers already understand we know what

4013
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:06,720
strains made you feel good we knew what

4014
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:09,280
was going on already before

4015
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:11,519
so if we can just keep that intention

4016
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:13,680
moving forward then the voice of the

4017
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:16,239
plant will continue to be moving forward

4018
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:18,079
and and i just hope that the same thing

4019
02:24:16,239 --> 02:24:20,478
won't happen to this

4020
02:24:18,079 --> 02:24:23,439
sentient being that has happened to

4021
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:25,519
tobacco you know tobacco is a plant and

4022
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:28,398
it's been taken over by corporate

4023
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:30,479
tobacco but and everybody wants to maybe

4024
02:24:28,398 --> 02:24:32,079
deem it and say that it's bad but it has

4025
02:24:30,478 --> 02:24:33,519
such a sacred

4026
02:24:32,079 --> 02:24:36,719
amazing

4027
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:38,239
special plant medicine for the rest of

4028
02:24:36,719 --> 02:24:41,039
you know the world

4029
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:43,039
and i just am hoping that through

4030
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:45,200
science and through our intuitive

4031
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:47,680
processes bringing it forward

4032
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:50,560
that the plant will have the last laugh

4033
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:53,680
and she will demand to be grown in a way

4034
02:24:50,559 --> 02:24:56,079
that is respectful yeah and and is in a

4035
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:58,000
soulful living soil you're going to find

4036
02:24:56,079 --> 02:24:59,920
more diverse cannabinoids so they'll

4037
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,159
never be able to produce that

4038
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:04,559
yeah of course so with all that being

4039
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:06,879
said though do you ever foresee maybe a

4040
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:08,879
bigger facility or operation adopting

4041
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:12,239
approach similar or maybe even the

4042
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:15,279
complete pure certification

4043
02:25:12,239 --> 02:25:17,280
oh yeah we have this large dispen i mean

4044
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,040
large facilities um

4045
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:22,479
you know green life productions in

4046
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:25,920
nevada's uh an indoor operation that

4047
02:25:22,478 --> 02:25:28,559
that does fully no-till um soils and has

4048
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:30,239
been expanded in a hard market

4049
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:32,478
in a market that's you know they're one

4050
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:33,920
of the only organic cultivators in all

4051
02:25:32,478 --> 02:25:36,398
of nevada

4052
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:38,079
um so that that's one example and you

4053
02:25:36,398 --> 02:25:41,199
know there's there's a lot of examples

4054
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:42,959
in colorado and oregon yeah california

4055
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:45,120
that we work with that have adopted it

4056
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:47,599
so we we work with really large

4057
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:50,640
facilities and turning over that you

4058
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:53,680
know the idea of of just all bottled

4059
02:25:50,639 --> 02:25:55,920
nutrients and npk ratios and sort of

4060
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:58,079
dead soil and growing plants that really

4061
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:00,239
don't have the liveliness that the

4062
02:25:58,079 --> 02:26:01,920
market is going to be looking for and

4063
02:26:00,239 --> 02:26:04,159
also we're going to be coming becoming

4064
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,840
smarter as consumers

4065
02:26:04,159 --> 02:26:08,079
you know we're going to start having an

4066
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:10,559
idea you know as a larger group a

4067
02:26:08,079 --> 02:26:12,799
conserva of consumers of what makes us

4068
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:14,879
feel good oh yeah that made me feel

4069
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:17,199
really good i had a great day on that

4070
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:18,639
and oh what was that and that's going to

4071
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,800
start you know more and more

4072
02:26:18,639 --> 02:26:22,799
conversations for people we're working

4073
02:26:20,799 --> 02:26:25,039
behind the scenes with you know

4074
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:27,438
facilities all over the place i mean

4075
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:29,439
really over the last 10 years i mean

4076
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:31,359
we've talked to you know

4077
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:34,000
seems like you know

4078
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:36,399
a whole hell of a lot of people and

4079
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,478
there and there's more you know coming

4080
02:26:36,398 --> 02:26:40,239
and and different states are are still

4081
02:26:38,478 --> 02:26:41,760
opening up and different places in the

4082
02:26:40,239 --> 02:26:44,398
world are still opening up so we've

4083
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:47,200
always offered ourselves you know for

4084
02:26:44,398 --> 02:26:49,680
him for um you know information and how

4085
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,520
to so you know whether they're a pure

4086
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,439
farm or not you know they they may have

4087
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:55,120
taken on some of the practices that were

4088
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:56,880
that we're working on

4089
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:59,120
yeah of course and i think that's maybe

4090
02:26:56,879 --> 02:27:01,679
more of a realistic end goal anyway

4091
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:04,479
right if everyone could adopt most of it

4092
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:06,479
rather than expecting it yeah i mean

4093
02:27:04,478 --> 02:27:08,639
yeah i mean once again you know we we

4094
02:27:06,478 --> 02:27:10,639
we've never claimed you know there's a

4095
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:12,478
lot of the people make it what it is you

4096
02:27:10,639 --> 02:27:14,079
know all the farms are so unique and

4097
02:27:12,478 --> 02:27:16,239
stuff and everyone brings something

4098
02:27:14,079 --> 02:27:18,639
unique to the table and you know there's

4099
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:20,559
the regenerative farm award and

4100
02:27:18,639 --> 02:27:22,239
permaculture institute you know high

4101
02:27:20,559 --> 02:27:24,719
tide permaculture different people that

4102
02:27:22,239 --> 02:27:27,680
are doing amazing work on farms and and

4103
02:27:24,719 --> 02:27:30,879
helping people adapt their farm to uh

4104
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:33,680
natural cycles and um you know it's it's

4105
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:35,759
it's really an amazing expansion of

4106
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,760
consciousness right now that's it's

4107
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:40,318
really amazing to be a part of and and

4108
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:43,359
to watch and we get people you know

4109
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:46,079
emailing us all the time that talk about

4110
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:48,318
you know us and this changing their life

4111
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:50,719
and and just us talking about the things

4112
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:52,398
that we talk about them you know

4113
02:27:50,719 --> 02:27:54,159
opening their eyes to like making

4114
02:27:52,398 --> 02:27:56,239
changes on so many different levels so

4115
02:27:54,159 --> 02:27:58,239
there's been amazing you know positive

4116
02:27:56,239 --> 02:28:00,799
feedback from it and just the each one

4117
02:27:58,239 --> 02:28:02,478
teach one you know when you go out and

4118
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:03,840
educate a group of people then those

4119
02:28:02,478 --> 02:28:05,840
whole group of people are then going to

4120
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:08,159
educate other groups of people that can

4121
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:10,000
then educate other groups of people and

4122
02:28:08,159 --> 02:28:12,000
we just feel like free it up free up the

4123
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,439
knowledge and we're never going to be

4124
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,280
those people that are like this is the

4125
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:17,280
way to do it and this is the only way to

4126
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:19,120
do it there's so many different ways to

4127
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:20,720
do it to where you're practicing

4128
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:22,800
conscious cannabis

4129
02:28:20,719 --> 02:28:25,119
and i think that you know

4130
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:27,119
any any way that works for you and your

4131
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:29,120
environment whether it be indoor whether

4132
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:30,960
it be outdoor how you know whether

4133
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:33,040
you're up in antarctica or whether

4134
02:28:30,959 --> 02:28:35,438
you're in the tropics or wherever you

4135
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:37,200
are cultivating your cannabis just do it

4136
02:28:35,439 --> 02:28:39,040
in a conscious way

4137
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:41,040
that is going to get out better

4138
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:43,359
education to the people that then

4139
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:45,760
utilize your product because we're the

4140
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,760
shamans of of this medicine we're

4141
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:49,520
effecting somebody's day you affect

4142
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:50,639
their life you could be affecting their

4143
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:52,960
health

4144
02:28:50,639 --> 02:28:55,599
you're affecting their family

4145
02:28:52,959 --> 02:28:57,759
it's so important to have that feeling

4146
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,840
of every single flower that you touch in

4147
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:01,200
every single plant that you grow that

4148
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:02,960
that is going to have an effect on

4149
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:04,319
somebody else's life

4150
02:29:02,959 --> 02:29:06,839
and that's what real conscious

4151
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:09,920
cultivation is about so

4152
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:11,760
important yeah of course and so if we

4153
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:13,439
just look back for just two seconds to

4154
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:15,439
how we were talking about the automation

4155
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:16,880
that's going on in canada

4156
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:18,880
kind of you know on that same train of

4157
02:29:16,879 --> 02:29:20,478
thought how do you feel about certain

4158
02:29:18,879 --> 02:29:22,799
types of automation i mean the one i'm

4159
02:29:20,478 --> 02:29:24,799
most notice most interested in is like

4160
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:26,639
the automated watering systems like you

4161
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:27,759
know the blue mat or the floraflex i'm

4162
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:28,879
not sure if those are the brands in

4163
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:30,800
america those are the major ones in

4164
02:29:28,879 --> 02:29:33,039
australia but essentially is this the

4165
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:34,799
type of technology you advocate for or

4166
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:36,319
do you feel like it's kind of removing a

4167
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:39,119
certain level of connection with the

4168
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:41,840
plant when you say hand water

4169
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:44,160
we advocate for more mulch and hand

4170
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:46,079
watering you know i mean i'm not going

4171
02:29:44,159 --> 02:29:47,760
to say that

4172
02:29:46,079 --> 02:29:50,000
you know having one of those systems

4173
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:50,880
doesn't doesn't work because it does it

4174
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,799
works

4175
02:29:50,879 --> 02:29:55,279
and if you can't be there and you really

4176
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:56,799
want to have a garden i mean use one you

4177
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:58,640
know what i mean um

4178
02:29:56,799 --> 02:30:00,719
it's just involving more plastic into

4179
02:29:58,639 --> 02:30:02,478
your gardens as well and how your teas

4180
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:04,639
and what they're running through and all

4181
02:30:02,478 --> 02:30:07,279
of that stuff breaks down

4182
02:30:04,639 --> 02:30:09,039
over time and then really you think that

4183
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:10,640
you might be helping yourself but how

4184
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:12,720
many times do you have to fix that

4185
02:30:10,639 --> 02:30:15,358
system and then order out parts for that

4186
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:17,519
system he's like oh god there's a lot of

4187
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:20,479
pathogens that build up in the hoses too

4188
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:22,800
that you have to be careful of so and

4189
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:24,559
it's taking away that human interaction

4190
02:30:22,799 --> 02:30:26,559
with the plant and

4191
02:30:24,559 --> 02:30:28,959
anyone who is out there and is a

4192
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,359
cultivator totally understands what that

4193
02:30:28,959 --> 02:30:33,199
is you know you can have an ailing plant

4194
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:34,800
or a garden and all you do is just give

4195
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:36,800
it some attention by giving it good

4196
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:38,799
energy and it turns everything around i

4197
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:41,039
mean you know sometimes that's not

4198
02:30:38,799 --> 02:30:43,039
enough of course you have to go you know

4199
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:44,720
into the deep dredges of education and

4200
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:47,359
try to figure it out but

4201
02:30:44,719 --> 02:30:49,840
oftentimes just giving good good energy

4202
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:51,680
is enough so if we're going to become

4203
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:53,920
you know automated the more and more

4204
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:55,680
automated that we we become the less and

4205
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:57,760
less that we're having an interaction

4206
02:30:55,680 --> 02:31:00,479
with the soil and this is why we choose

4207
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:02,559
to build you know soil the way we do you

4208
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:04,239
know like whether it's an indoor bed and

4209
02:31:02,559 --> 02:31:06,478
you keep you know wood chips in the

4210
02:31:04,239 --> 02:31:09,359
bottom of it to keep soil down there or

4211
02:31:06,478 --> 02:31:11,438
you you know cover the sides to keep so

4212
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:13,760
you know the humidity in there you

4213
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:16,239
whether you're outside and you use rocks

4214
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:18,318
like thin rocks across the top

4215
02:31:16,239 --> 02:31:20,959
where you'd use like a rock mulch you

4216
02:31:18,318 --> 02:31:23,119
know there's there's a lot of ways to to

4217
02:31:20,959 --> 02:31:24,478
keep the water in there and

4218
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:26,319
just using

4219
02:31:24,478 --> 02:31:29,599
we've never used one of those systems

4220
02:31:26,318 --> 02:31:32,879
and one of the reasons is um it's kind

4221
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:35,359
of a shallow watering yeah you know

4222
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:36,799
water it's and it does keep biology nice

4223
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:38,800
when it's always wet and there's you

4224
02:31:36,799 --> 02:31:40,478
know there's a lot of reasons why it can

4225
02:31:38,799 --> 02:31:42,239
make sense but

4226
02:31:40,478 --> 02:31:45,119
from our point of view you know deep

4227
02:31:42,239 --> 02:31:47,840
watering you know gets it you know to

4228
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:50,720
the lower parts of the roots and that

4229
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:52,719
really gives a true watering to the root

4230
02:31:50,719 --> 02:31:54,799
system and when you start getting down

4231
02:31:52,719 --> 02:31:57,599
into the sub layers of your soil that's

4232
02:31:54,799 --> 02:32:00,000
a lot where the clay is and the minerals

4233
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:02,318
are and then your plant has the ability

4234
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,398
to sort of break down those you know

4235
02:32:02,318 --> 02:32:05,119
when you have really long tap roots and

4236
02:32:04,398 --> 02:32:07,358
you're

4237
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:08,880
you know planting them into the earth

4238
02:32:07,359 --> 02:32:10,880
you're going to want a deep water

4239
02:32:08,879 --> 02:32:13,119
because you don't want your plants just

4240
02:32:10,879 --> 02:32:14,719
to have shallow roots and then a big

4241
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,600
wind comes along and then you're done

4242
02:32:14,719 --> 02:32:18,239
with

4243
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:21,040
so you know deep watering has a lot of

4244
02:32:18,239 --> 02:32:23,039
values more than just you know a system

4245
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,920
or whether it's easier and we don't use

4246
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:27,760
a lot of trellis you know um systems on

4247
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:29,920
our plants we don't we we let them blow

4248
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:32,639
around in the wind and having you know a

4249
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:34,318
more saturated root system that has you

4250
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:36,879
know more ability to

4251
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:39,519
to give its you know stock strength and

4252
02:32:36,879 --> 02:32:42,000
to give you know the lateral um

4253
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:43,840
capillaries and and the branches you

4254
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,600
know more strength and stuff without we

4255
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:47,600
believe that's why we

4256
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:49,359
to grow you know you have to think of

4257
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:51,359
everything so what we

4258
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:54,559
we look at our soils and we build our

4259
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:57,680
soils in a way that that we it's going

4260
02:32:54,559 --> 02:32:59,600
to enhance our watering for the season

4261
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:02,318
you know it's it's kind of

4262
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:04,239
it's not just putting a

4263
02:33:02,318 --> 02:33:06,639
soil mixture together and hoping it's

4264
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:08,639
going to like hold water for the season

4265
02:33:06,639 --> 02:33:10,639
we got way off track on your question

4266
02:33:08,639 --> 02:33:12,559
but no that's good because i got another

4267
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:14,879
one related to exactly that so what i

4268
02:33:12,559 --> 02:33:16,398
wanted to know was is you know if if you

4269
02:33:14,879 --> 02:33:18,239
could kind of choose so to speak do you

4270
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:20,159
prefer your soil to be like more of a

4271
02:33:18,239 --> 02:33:21,840
water retaining soil or would you prefer

4272
02:33:20,159 --> 02:33:25,600
to water more frequently because it kind

4273
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:25,600
of you know it dries out a bit quicker

4274
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:30,239
well less frequently is better because

4275
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:33,200
your microbiology is giving a chance to

4276
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:35,760
be able to colonize and when you have a

4277
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:37,680
soil that doesn't hold any water

4278
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:39,359
then when you water it it's you're

4279
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:40,960
actually losing your microbiology

4280
02:33:39,359 --> 02:33:42,720
they're out of the bottom of your pot or

4281
02:33:40,959 --> 02:33:43,519
into your subsoils

4282
02:33:42,719 --> 02:33:45,358
so

4283
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:48,239
you know it's really good to have good

4284
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:50,000
water retention but we believe in layers

4285
02:33:48,239 --> 02:33:51,840
so there's different layers some of them

4286
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,840
are water retention layers and some of

4287
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:55,520
them aren't and another one may be rocky

4288
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:57,439
and another one may be this so then the

4289
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:59,439
roots can make a decision

4290
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:00,960
you know on where they are and maybe if

4291
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:02,880
they want some dryness that they're

4292
02:34:00,959 --> 02:34:04,959
going to be able to find it in a layer

4293
02:34:02,879 --> 02:34:06,239
that has more aeration and if they want

4294
02:34:04,959 --> 02:34:07,759
more water then they're going to be able

4295
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:09,840
to find it in an area that has more

4296
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:12,159
moisture yeah i mean your soil has to

4297
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:14,639
drain there has to be a good you know

4298
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:15,760
cation exchange and there has to be good

4299
02:34:14,639 --> 02:34:18,559
you know

4300
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:21,120
aeration in there and aerobic you know

4301
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:24,000
qualities and breath you know in the

4302
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:26,880
soil and hydrogen and carbon so you know

4303
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,478
we we do build our soils though to

4304
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:31,920
retain water

4305
02:34:28,478 --> 02:34:34,318
and we think that's important because

4306
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:36,559
water is a huge commodity on earth and

4307
02:34:34,318 --> 02:34:39,439
there's a ton of areas that are in

4308
02:34:36,559 --> 02:34:42,639
drought and that's just to react

4309
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:44,960
so i think anything that we can do to

4310
02:34:42,639 --> 02:34:46,719
build you know soils to save water even

4311
02:34:44,959 --> 02:34:48,239
if it's indoors

4312
02:34:46,719 --> 02:34:50,519
i think it makes all the sense in the

4313
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:53,920
world and i do think it saves your

4314
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:56,159
microbiology to to stay wet

4315
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:58,000
but dry out all the time your biology

4316
02:34:56,159 --> 02:34:59,520
has to like wake up and go to sleep all

4317
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:02,318
the time and that doesn't

4318
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:04,479
truly serve the rhizosphere

4319
02:35:02,318 --> 02:35:06,239
okay and so what's your thoughts on rock

4320
02:35:04,478 --> 02:35:08,398
dust and i'm wondering and do you

4321
02:35:06,239 --> 02:35:11,520
believe they're as vital to the soil as

4322
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:13,760
some people make them out to be

4323
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:15,680
well i i know that steve solomon has

4324
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:17,840
talked about rock dust over the years a

4325
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:19,840
lot and he said that he's you know not

4326
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:22,478
seen a good balance out of a true

4327
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:23,439
glacial rock dust that's a true balance

4328
02:35:22,478 --> 02:35:24,879
um

4329
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:26,720
and stuff so

4330
02:35:24,879 --> 02:35:28,879
you know we've always

4331
02:35:26,719 --> 02:35:31,438
used different

4332
02:35:28,879 --> 02:35:34,879
rock dust that were available you know

4333
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:37,120
maybe the paramagnetic rock dust basalt

4334
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:39,039
or or you know glacial rock dust and you

4335
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:40,560
can use a little bit of you know those

4336
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:43,600
powders but really

4337
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:45,760
you know our our main mission in life is

4338
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:48,559
to try and get the minerals from our

4339
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:50,478
plant life in our in our area and that's

4340
02:35:48,559 --> 02:35:53,119
so our our big thing is once again it

4341
02:35:50,478 --> 02:35:55,279
goes back to building soil so our big

4342
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:56,560
thing is to trying is to to think about

4343
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:58,399
the trees

4344
02:35:56,559 --> 02:36:00,478
and the different stuff the ways that we

4345
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:02,239
can build the soil to get minerals in

4346
02:36:00,478 --> 02:36:04,639
and in each different you know different

4347
02:36:02,239 --> 02:36:06,079
plant species uptake different types of

4348
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:07,920
minerals and you know that certain

4349
02:36:06,079 --> 02:36:10,318
plants are rich in certain types of

4350
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:13,520
minerals and if you're looking for that

4351
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:15,600
in your garden why not feed your biomass

4352
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:17,680
all of those minerals and then cut your

4353
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:19,520
biomass down and then feed that to your

4354
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:21,600
garden because then your biomass has a

4355
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:24,000
long time to be able to uptake it and

4356
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:25,840
the bio microbiology in the soil has

4357
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,680
more time to uptake it

4358
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:29,520
so we really believe in if you're going

4359
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:32,720
to bring in rock dust or if you're going

4360
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:34,079
to bring in you know ocean salts or or

4361
02:36:32,719 --> 02:36:36,398
or different things that might make

4362
02:36:34,079 --> 02:36:38,478
sense and have a lot of mineral content

4363
02:36:36,398 --> 02:36:40,079
feed it to your biomass rather than

4364
02:36:38,478 --> 02:36:42,318
feeding it directly to your plants in

4365
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:44,879
your soil because then it just makes an

4366
02:36:42,318 --> 02:36:46,398
easier exchange into your soils that

4367
02:36:44,879 --> 02:36:49,519
what you want to grow if you can get

4368
02:36:46,398 --> 02:36:52,159
dehydrated ocean water i mean it has you

4369
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:55,200
know 84 trace minerals in it and stuff

4370
02:36:52,159 --> 02:36:56,879
but you know the oceans are really toxic

4371
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:57,760
in the world right now so you'd have to

4372
02:36:56,879 --> 02:37:00,159
have

4373
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:02,719
a toxicity report you know if you're

4374
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:05,600
going to use any of that and mines are

4375
02:37:02,719 --> 02:37:07,438
are so sketchy you know we really again

4376
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,439
you need to look at from where all of

4377
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:11,760
the inputs are coming from we know that

4378
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:13,760
we're reaching a phosphorous ceiling

4379
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:15,840
right now because of rock phosphate on

4380
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:18,318
the planet and all of those mines that

4381
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:20,960
they've totally depleted and now all of

4382
02:37:18,318 --> 02:37:21,680
the big ag that's totally dependent on

4383
02:37:20,959 --> 02:37:23,599
it

4384
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:25,680
you know and people are feeling like oh

4385
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:27,439
without it what the heck are we gonna do

4386
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:29,920
this is the only way that we know how to

4387
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:32,000
get phosphorus well it's a really shitty

4388
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:34,398
way to get phosphorus truthfully because

4389
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,159
it's being mined and all of the people

4390
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:38,239
that work down in the mines what kind of

4391
02:37:36,159 --> 02:37:40,239
health problems are they having

4392
02:37:38,239 --> 02:37:41,760
i you know if you just start looking at

4393
02:37:40,239 --> 02:37:44,079
all of it

4394
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:47,200
it's like we've over thought ourselves

4395
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:49,120
humans do that consistently we just have

4396
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:51,840
like this big

4397
02:37:49,120 --> 02:37:54,319
you know ability to mess up stuff and

4398
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:56,960
this is just a perfect example of that

4399
02:37:54,318 --> 02:37:58,719
we have to go and get mined material

4400
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:00,879
from somewhere else to be able to get

4401
02:37:58,719 --> 02:38:03,920
our mineral content i mean if you're

4402
02:38:00,879 --> 02:38:05,920
building an indoor soil from you know

4403
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:08,079
coco choir and stuff i mean you have to

4404
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:09,840
have something for sure so you might as

4405
02:38:08,079 --> 02:38:13,120
well get you know

4406
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:15,120
as many different kinds of dusts as you

4407
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:17,680
possibly can you know what i mean and

4408
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:21,120
and that are consciously you know what i

4409
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:23,280
mean like glacial rock dust in our area

4410
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:26,240
there's there's tons of it and then

4411
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:29,359
there's there's tons of volcanic ash

4412
02:38:26,239 --> 02:38:30,159
and there's tons of you know basalt you

4413
02:38:29,359 --> 02:38:32,559
know

4414
02:38:30,159 --> 02:38:33,359
quarry and you know basalt that doesn't

4415
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:35,680
take

4416
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:36,559
you know very much to create powder out

4417
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:38,880
of so

4418
02:38:36,559 --> 02:38:41,279
there there are areas where it can make

4419
02:38:38,879 --> 02:38:42,799
sense and we and we really encourage

4420
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:44,239
people when they're making these soils

4421
02:38:42,799 --> 02:38:46,318
and we do work with people that have to

4422
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:48,959
make soils from scratch

4423
02:38:46,318 --> 02:38:51,279
is to what kind of native soil in their

4424
02:38:48,959 --> 02:38:53,438
area can you mix into that that's going

4425
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,600
to have all of those you know minerals

4426
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:57,760
already there and it doesn't mean you

4427
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:59,280
know you can make a soil that's

4428
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:01,920
intelligent enough that it will be able

4429
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:04,159
to unlock that um you know all of those

4430
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:06,079
minerals pretty easily

4431
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:08,000
so again just being conscious about

4432
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:09,439
where all your dusts and things are

4433
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
coming from

4434
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:13,680
yeah so this is going to be a bit of a

4435
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:15,359
weird question but it's just kind of us

4436
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:17,359
when we were mentioning steve solomon it

4437
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:19,439
jumped to mind but steve's got this idea

4438
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:21,680
that he he thinks that you can use

4439
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:24,159
nutrient density as kind of like

4440
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:26,559
an overall parameter to quantifiably

4441
02:39:24,159 --> 02:39:28,239
test things on their quality so you know

4442
02:39:26,559 --> 02:39:29,439
i i think i'm right when i say this but

4443
02:39:28,239 --> 02:39:31,039
i think if you asked him he would say

4444
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:32,639
something like if you got two different

4445
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:35,040
bits of cannabis and you tested the

4446
02:39:32,639 --> 02:39:37,358
nutrient density between them he regards

4447
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:39,439
nutrient density as that quantifiable

4448
02:39:37,359 --> 02:39:40,880
kind of parameter and so he says you

4449
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:41,920
know if you just tested a whole bunch of

4450
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:43,679
cannabis the one with the highest

4451
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:45,840
nutrient density is going to be like the

4452
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:47,760
most enjoyable so to speak put aside

4453
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:49,920
maybe personal preferences do you have

4454
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:51,680
any thoughts along those lines or would

4455
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:53,359
you maybe disagree with that and i guess

4456
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:54,479
maybe overall do you think there is like

4457
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:56,640
a one

4458
02:39:54,478 --> 02:39:58,639
quantifiable parameter we can use for

4459
02:39:56,639 --> 02:39:59,680
testing

4460
02:39:58,639 --> 02:40:01,439
um

4461
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:03,840
i don't think i think you could utilize

4462
02:40:01,439 --> 02:40:06,318
a lot of things you know as much little

4463
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:08,159
things that you have in your basket to

4464
02:40:06,318 --> 02:40:10,318
help you out along the way little

4465
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:11,760
tidbits of information or little testing

4466
02:40:10,318 --> 02:40:14,239
things that you have along the way is

4467
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:16,559
great but absolutely believe in that

4468
02:40:14,239 --> 02:40:18,559
idea you know the healthier your plant

4469
02:40:16,559 --> 02:40:20,559
is the better it's going to taste as far

4470
02:40:18,559 --> 02:40:22,559
as food is concerned your medicine is

4471
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:24,879
definitely going to be better more

4472
02:40:22,559 --> 02:40:27,359
terpene-rich the plant was able to fully

4473
02:40:24,879 --> 02:40:29,438
express itself in health you know the

4474
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:31,920
brix reading is something that i know

4475
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:34,159
that he utilizes we utilize bricks

4476
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:36,398
testing here free fractal a

4477
02:40:34,159 --> 02:40:38,239
refractometer to test the sugars and

4478
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:40,478
stuff in the plant and we analyze our

4479
02:40:38,239 --> 02:40:42,799
plants in as many ways as possible under

4480
02:40:40,478 --> 02:40:44,478
microscopes and leaves and we analyze it

4481
02:40:42,799 --> 02:40:46,398
through pests

4482
02:40:44,478 --> 02:40:49,039
you know knowing whether your your

4483
02:40:46,398 --> 02:40:51,278
plants getting eaten by a pest

4484
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:53,600
is one way of seeing whether it's

4485
02:40:51,279 --> 02:40:55,359
healthy or not so in some pests we're

4486
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:56,960
finding like aphids and stuff have been

4487
02:40:55,359 --> 02:40:58,640
attracted to healthy plants so there's

4488
02:40:56,959 --> 02:41:00,559
always an exception

4489
02:40:58,639 --> 02:41:03,599
but you know a lot of times

4490
02:41:00,559 --> 02:41:05,920
um you know a healthy plant repels pests

4491
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:06,880
and that's the goal of it and stuff so

4492
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,920
um

4493
02:41:06,879 --> 02:41:09,519
yeah

4494
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:11,120
yeah definitely health health and

4495
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:13,760
well-being of the plant is going to be

4496
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:15,600
the looking at the plant and seeing it

4497
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:18,159
vibrate and seeing it's

4498
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:20,640
it's leaves extended out and not

4499
02:41:18,159 --> 02:41:23,119
constricted i mean you know there's

4500
02:41:20,639 --> 02:41:25,599
that's the the the like the emotional

4501
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:28,000
touch that goes into looking at it

4502
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:29,200
right there so kind of on the same topic

4503
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,719
we referenced it earlier and i was going

4504
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,720
to bring it up but i forgot to but i was

4505
02:41:30,719 --> 02:41:34,159
talking to jeremy and from builder soil

4506
02:41:32,719 --> 02:41:36,000
and he said that

4507
02:41:34,159 --> 02:41:38,000
one thing he was interested in is that

4508
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,079
there's the development of new organic

4509
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:41,920
ipm based products a lot of them have

4510
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:43,680
microbes in them you could look at one

4511
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:46,000
say

4512
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:48,398
em5 perfect example you know microbial

4513
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,680
based uh ipm product the interesting

4514
02:41:48,398 --> 02:41:52,000
thing about it was he was mentioning

4515
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:54,239
that when people undergo testing these

4516
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:56,079
same probiotics like the the cfu's the

4517
02:41:54,239 --> 02:41:58,239
colony forming units get counted all the

4518
02:41:56,079 --> 02:42:00,318
same and you can fail tests because of

4519
02:41:58,239 --> 02:42:02,639
it is that something which kind of is a

4520
02:42:00,318 --> 02:42:04,318
bit concerning to you like the fact that

4521
02:42:02,639 --> 02:42:07,680
i i guess maybe we're not able to use

4522
02:42:04,318 --> 02:42:09,359
microbial products in an ipm remedy you

4523
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:11,520
know in that way or do you think that

4524
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:12,960
there's a way around it

4525
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:15,439
what's concerning about it is the

4526
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:16,239
testing um the testing is what's failing

4527
02:42:15,439 --> 02:42:18,000
us

4528
02:42:16,239 --> 02:42:19,600
it's not it's not the problem of what

4529
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:22,079
we're spraying on it and if we're

4530
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:23,680
utilizing a nice ipfm we always add the

4531
02:42:22,079 --> 02:42:27,120
f in there because it's integrated pest

4532
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:28,479
and fungal management program um

4533
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:30,640
uh it just

4534
02:42:28,478 --> 02:42:33,199
it's like it adds

4535
02:42:30,639 --> 02:42:34,879
i forgot what i was doing with that

4536
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:35,760
oh you're just talking about the testing

4537
02:42:34,879 --> 02:42:37,599
oh right

4538
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:40,880
the testing sorry thank you it was like

4539
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:41,920
off on another tangent thing um is is

4540
02:42:40,879 --> 02:42:44,959
that they're not testing the

4541
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:46,879
differentiation between the dna so they

4542
02:42:44,959 --> 02:42:49,679
they can they can but it's a very

4543
02:42:46,879 --> 02:42:51,679
expensive test to be able to find out

4544
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:53,439
you know if it's a bacterius or is it a

4545
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:55,279
bacteria spore that's healthy for you or

4546
02:42:53,439 --> 02:42:57,439
is it a bacterial spore that's unhealthy

4547
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:59,680
for you and they're just doing a full

4548
02:42:57,439 --> 02:43:01,279
round spectrum of just like putting it

4549
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:03,439
all together in one basket and they're

4550
02:43:01,279 --> 02:43:04,960
just saying it's all fruit even if it

4551
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:06,479
could have like you know 50 different

4552
02:43:04,959 --> 02:43:08,000
species of fruit and some of them could

4553
02:43:06,478 --> 02:43:09,760
even be poisonous to you they're just

4554
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:11,600
saying it's all fruit and if there's any

4555
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:13,279
fruit in the basket then you know it's

4556
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:16,000
no good if there's any type of

4557
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:17,840
microbiology even dust spores that are

4558
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,398
perfectly fine and healthy we breed them

4559
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:23,359
in all the time you know that it's going

4560
02:43:20,398 --> 02:43:24,879
to fail a test so the problem is really

4561
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:27,359
the testing

4562
02:43:24,879 --> 02:43:29,599
the problem is not so we we're trying to

4563
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:31,600
get smarter to the test but this is a

4564
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:34,840
huge conversation in the industry right

4565
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:38,079
now several states have let go of the

4566
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:39,760
microbiology um the microbes counts this

4567
02:43:38,079 --> 02:43:41,920
is what it's called microbe count you

4568
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:44,159
have to i would talk about testing a lot

4569
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:46,000
because you know that's what like the

4570
02:43:44,159 --> 02:43:48,239
recreational scene brings and that's

4571
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,680
what farmers have to deal with so

4572
02:43:48,239 --> 02:43:53,279
the answer is

4573
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:54,800
if you have um a microbial test that you

4574
02:43:53,279 --> 02:43:57,359
have to pass

4575
02:43:54,799 --> 02:43:58,959
then you can fail that microbial test

4576
02:43:57,359 --> 02:44:02,800
from using

4577
02:43:58,959 --> 02:44:04,478
healthy beneficial probiotic organisms

4578
02:44:02,799 --> 02:44:06,639
so does that make sense

4579
02:44:04,478 --> 02:44:08,239
no it doesn't make sense

4580
02:44:06,639 --> 02:44:10,398
but the answer is

4581
02:44:08,239 --> 02:44:12,799
you can fail your test with those things

4582
02:44:10,398 --> 02:44:16,398
so you if you you live

4583
02:44:12,799 --> 02:44:19,119
in an area where you have to basically

4584
02:44:16,398 --> 02:44:21,519
pass the test i mean you have to do what

4585
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:24,960
you have to do mm-hmm so a lot of people

4586
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:27,120
is it healthy for you to use bacillus

4587
02:44:24,959 --> 02:44:28,959
you know strains and

4588
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:31,600
and even

4589
02:44:28,959 --> 02:44:33,438
and other you know things on your on

4590
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:35,760
your plant absolutely

4591
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:39,040
of course it is em5 is it is it

4592
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:41,439
beneficial for you yes

4593
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:43,920
does it make a better flower absolutely

4594
02:44:41,439 --> 02:44:45,439
yeah and and i think that we've touched

4595
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:47,760
on this already but i'll say it again i

4596
02:44:45,439 --> 02:44:49,359
mean our body needs to be able to

4597
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:53,200
process

4598
02:44:49,359 --> 02:44:54,960
dust and and probiotics and and without

4599
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:57,200
like to having a sterilized product for

4600
02:44:54,959 --> 02:44:58,799
our body it does our immune system no

4601
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:01,920
good it does our health

4602
02:44:58,799 --> 02:45:02,799
no good so those laws are prohibitive

4603
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:04,478
laws

4604
02:45:02,799 --> 02:45:07,599
put in place to make it damn near

4605
02:45:04,478 --> 02:45:09,760
impossible for an organic farmer to to

4606
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:12,159
to do what they have to do and it puts

4607
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:15,040
out different the differentiation of

4608
02:45:12,159 --> 02:45:17,920
what is the word clean to you

4609
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:20,640
you know is clean hospital clean is it a

4610
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:23,680
sterile clean because some of the worst

4611
02:45:20,639 --> 02:45:26,079
most horrific diseases come out of that

4612
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:27,279
height you know parentheses you know

4613
02:45:26,079 --> 02:45:30,239
clean

4614
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:32,399
so it's just a really interesting topic

4615
02:45:30,239 --> 02:45:35,199
clean the way that we see it is

4616
02:45:32,398 --> 02:45:37,840
beneficial microbiology everywhere that

4617
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:40,000
you're dealing with you know beneficial

4618
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:42,478
microbiology that if a pathogen is

4619
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:44,398
digesting yeah it's even coming in the

4620
02:45:42,478 --> 02:45:46,478
door at all it can't come in because you

4621
02:45:44,398 --> 02:45:48,000
know there's totally so many beneficials

4622
02:45:46,478 --> 02:45:50,318
that are holding it back

4623
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,719
to us that could even taunt the pathogen

4624
02:45:50,318 --> 02:45:55,920
because you're so strong with good

4625
02:45:52,719 --> 02:45:58,719
microbiology you could taunt it yeah and

4626
02:45:55,920 --> 02:46:01,120
it would never you know be a part or or

4627
02:45:58,719 --> 02:46:02,719
or come in as a pathogen

4628
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:04,000
yeah i think that's a great way to kind

4629
02:46:02,719 --> 02:46:06,000
of uh

4630
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,920
i don't know visualize the situation or

4631
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:10,318
approach a situation i noticed on the

4632
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:12,398
site it says you have had you know

4633
02:46:10,318 --> 02:46:14,278
really extensive range of trialling

4634
02:46:12,398 --> 02:46:16,639
various different mycorrhizae and

4635
02:46:14,279 --> 02:46:18,000
micromicrobial products is there any

4636
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:19,680
kind of little tips or tricks you've

4637
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,200
learned throughout that process you'd be

4638
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:22,639
willing to share with us you know like

4639
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:24,720
certain things which maybe indicate

4640
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:25,840
you've got a good micro product beyond

4641
02:46:24,719 --> 02:46:28,639
the obvious you know like are there

4642
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:30,880
certain things you can kind of um you

4643
02:46:28,639 --> 02:46:32,719
know share from your both trial and

4644
02:46:30,879 --> 02:46:34,000
error with all the different microbial

4645
02:46:32,719 --> 02:46:36,159
products

4646
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,760
well it's really fun to get a microscope

4647
02:46:36,159 --> 02:46:40,159
we really encourage people to get a

4648
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:42,318
microscope i mean you just learn so much

4649
02:46:40,159 --> 02:46:43,359
when you start to enter that world of

4650
02:46:42,318 --> 02:46:44,639
you know

4651
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:46,479
little things

4652
02:46:44,639 --> 02:46:47,920
you don't have to get a professor or

4653
02:46:46,478 --> 02:46:49,599
anything like that in order to get a

4654
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:51,600
microscope you can just

4655
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:53,359
learn after you get the microscope and

4656
02:46:51,600 --> 02:46:55,279
just start seeing yeah and you don't

4657
02:46:53,359 --> 02:46:57,680
have to buy an expensive microscope you

4658
02:46:55,279 --> 02:47:00,159
can buy you know one that is used for

4659
02:46:57,680 --> 02:47:02,159
like high school or finishing school

4660
02:47:00,159 --> 02:47:03,760
science class or something like that

4661
02:47:02,159 --> 02:47:05,520
there's so much out there and you can

4662
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:07,200
actually look at the teas that you make

4663
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:10,239
you can look at the soil that you're

4664
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:11,680
making and also looking at the plant and

4665
02:47:10,239 --> 02:47:13,600
what kind of reaction you know of course

4666
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:16,079
that you said you know under except the

4667
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:18,159
obvious that's that's the most obvious

4668
02:47:16,079 --> 02:47:20,719
is how does your plant react

4669
02:47:18,159 --> 02:47:22,959
because unfortunately you know these

4670
02:47:20,719 --> 02:47:25,119
department of agriculture regulations

4671
02:47:22,959 --> 02:47:25,919
and big ag are going to be giving so

4672
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:28,240
much

4673
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:30,159
different information you know if you go

4674
02:47:28,239 --> 02:47:32,840
on threads out there in the cannabis

4675
02:47:30,159 --> 02:47:36,159
world whoa the crazy stuff that's flying

4676
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:37,840
around is just difficult for people to

4677
02:47:36,159 --> 02:47:38,719
determine so

4678
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:42,000
you know

4679
02:47:38,719 --> 02:47:43,599
do your own science learn your own ways

4680
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,159
you know

4681
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:48,239
well define your intuition in your own

4682
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:50,000
gardens that's going to be the best way

4683
02:47:48,239 --> 02:47:52,079
to find out if products are working for

4684
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,760
you and you can trust good companies

4685
02:47:52,079 --> 02:47:56,159
like ours and others that have been

4686
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:57,040
tried and tested through the community i

4687
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:59,119
mean

4688
02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:01,680
the community does not stick with

4689
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:02,800
companies that don't have integrity so a

4690
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:04,239
lot of the companies that have been

4691
02:48:02,799 --> 02:48:05,438
around for a long time are around

4692
02:48:04,239 --> 02:48:07,039
because they have

4693
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:08,960
you know they've our our products have

4694
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:10,800
been tested by you know a million

4695
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:12,398
different people and there's so many

4696
02:48:10,799 --> 02:48:16,239
other companies out there with with

4697
02:48:12,398 --> 02:48:17,840
beautiful integrity you know we really

4698
02:48:16,239 --> 02:48:19,279
you know want to highlight you know

4699
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:21,040
those farms that are making good

4700
02:48:19,279 --> 02:48:22,720
products and also those companies that

4701
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:24,080
are making good products for the farms

4702
02:48:22,719 --> 02:48:27,199
you know we're out there and there's

4703
02:48:24,079 --> 02:48:29,279
lots of us and we're all over the world

4704
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:31,359
yeah most certainly and i so strongly

4705
02:48:29,279 --> 02:48:32,560
agree with that that final point about

4706
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:34,800
you know like the community doesn't

4707
02:48:32,559 --> 02:48:36,159
trust brands without integrity and

4708
02:48:34,799 --> 02:48:37,438
i think you can look at that especially

4709
02:48:36,159 --> 02:48:39,680
if you look at you know the people who

4710
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:40,559
are using your products it's some of the

4711
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:42,000
most

4712
02:48:40,559 --> 02:48:43,519
um you know like the leaders of the

4713
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,639
industry but also that not just the

4714
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:46,319
leaders you know but the ones who are

4715
02:48:44,639 --> 02:48:48,398
viewed with integrity themselves so you

4716
02:48:46,318 --> 02:48:49,519
know it's almost like a two-fold

4717
02:48:48,398 --> 02:48:50,799
mm-hmm

4718
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:52,399
yeah and that's just

4719
02:48:50,799 --> 02:48:54,159
and that was a big part of this culture

4720
02:48:52,398 --> 02:48:55,840
to begin with it's just word of mouth

4721
02:48:54,159 --> 02:48:56,879
and everything and trusting in each

4722
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:57,680
other

4723
02:48:56,879 --> 02:48:59,759
yeah

4724
02:48:57,680 --> 02:49:01,680
so something i wanted to run by you is

4725
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:05,760
what's your thoughts on throwing

4726
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:07,520
mycorrhiza into a tea specifically

4727
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:08,559
before you brew it because

4728
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:10,479
you know in

4729
02:49:08,559 --> 02:49:11,840
the i i refer to it as the bible of

4730
02:49:10,478 --> 02:49:14,478
organic gardening you know teeming with

4731
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:15,840
microbes by jeff he says very very

4732
02:49:14,478 --> 02:49:17,438
clearly in the book you know if if

4733
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:19,920
mycorrhizae doesn't come in contact with

4734
02:49:17,439 --> 02:49:21,439
a root within 24 hours it dies and so i

4735
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:22,559
always see people throwing mycorrhizae

4736
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:24,639
into their ts and then they're going to

4737
02:49:22,559 --> 02:49:25,920
bubble it for presumably at least 24

4738
02:49:24,639 --> 02:49:28,079
hours and i'm like does that not all

4739
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:30,000
just die

4740
02:49:28,079 --> 02:49:31,840
makes no sense it will a lot of them

4741
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,840
will become dormant and they'll just sit

4742
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:36,079
in there until they reach a root if they

4743
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:37,520
do so it really doesn't make any sense

4744
02:49:36,079 --> 02:49:39,680
at all

4745
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:41,520
you definitely want direct contact onto

4746
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:43,840
that route and one of the best ways to

4747
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:46,000
get direct contact is because so many of

4748
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:48,318
our gardens we're growing fast plants

4749
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:51,279
and we're having fast turnover with

4750
02:49:48,318 --> 02:49:53,840
cannabis plants is that your cover crop

4751
02:49:51,279 --> 02:49:56,319
can grow the endomycorrhiza on it

4752
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:58,960
propagating and it can propagate it so

4753
02:49:56,318 --> 02:50:01,359
when you're feeding your soils different

4754
02:49:58,959 --> 02:50:03,358
types of mycorrhiza make sure that you

4755
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:05,840
put you know great cover crops like

4756
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:07,680
clover is an awesome one for so many

4757
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:09,920
cover crops i could go on and on and

4758
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:12,559
they're going to help propagate it for

4759
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:15,439
your your cannabis plants so that's one

4760
02:50:12,559 --> 02:50:17,119
of the beauties of really utilizing a

4761
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:20,318
lot of different species in your garden

4762
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:23,600
so you can put mycorrhizal spores in

4763
02:50:20,318 --> 02:50:26,478
water and drench it into your soil that

4764
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:28,239
is an application that does work it's oh

4765
02:50:26,478 --> 02:50:31,039
it's not going to be as good as direct

4766
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:33,520
contact it's direct contact that really

4767
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:34,960
you know propagates the the spore to

4768
02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:37,040
come to life

4769
02:50:34,959 --> 02:50:38,719
but um we always suggest to people that

4770
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:40,399
if they're going to do a tea brew do the

4771
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:42,159
tea brew and then just put the

4772
02:50:40,398 --> 02:50:44,000
mycorrhizae in like right at the last

4773
02:50:42,159 --> 02:50:46,079
second right before you're about ready

4774
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:49,120
to drench your gardens

4775
02:50:46,079 --> 02:50:50,559
and that's that's a good application

4776
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:51,840
yeah that's that's definitely what i

4777
02:50:50,559 --> 02:50:53,119
always thought was like kind of the

4778
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:56,159
optimal

4779
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:57,359
yeah it does not grow in in an aeration

4780
02:50:56,159 --> 02:50:59,119
setting

4781
02:50:57,359 --> 02:51:01,279
so another little point i wanted to

4782
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:03,840
swing by that jeff made in one of his uh

4783
02:51:01,279 --> 02:51:05,760
verde natural talks was that he said

4784
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:07,680
that there'd been some kind of you know

4785
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:10,318
newer discovery around how it was just

4786
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:11,760
kind of one of the subspecies of micro

4787
02:51:10,318 --> 02:51:13,519
that was responsible for the bulk of the

4788
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:14,960
work and i think he said it was the the

4789
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:17,359
glomerus type

4790
02:51:14,959 --> 02:51:19,278
do you know anything about that and

4791
02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:20,159
i mean like if so would we not expect

4792
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:21,760
all

4793
02:51:20,159 --> 02:51:23,279
mico to switch to that one subtype

4794
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:25,840
essentially

4795
02:51:23,279 --> 02:51:28,479
well the glomus intradices is the one

4796
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:30,000
that's been known to be the supposedly

4797
02:51:28,478 --> 02:51:31,438
the one that

4798
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:34,318
um you know

4799
02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:35,680
communicates and and bonds with cannabis

4800
02:51:34,318 --> 02:51:36,879
roots

4801
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:39,439
do

4802
02:51:36,879 --> 02:51:41,839
from our point of view i mean fungi is

4803
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:43,439
made like to break the rules i mean

4804
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:46,478
there are there are no rules there's the

4805
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:50,079
most adaptogenic when it comes to

4806
02:51:46,478 --> 02:51:52,959
you know petri dishes and science and

4807
02:51:50,079 --> 02:51:54,239
and maybe like soilless mediums and

4808
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:56,318
different things like that you know if

4809
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:57,840
you're in a soilless indoor medium and

4810
02:51:56,318 --> 02:51:59,119
you're just getting like two months

4811
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:00,559
cycle or

4812
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,479
something you're not going to get a lot

4813
02:52:00,559 --> 02:52:04,000
out of a two-month cycle with

4814
02:52:02,478 --> 02:52:06,639
mycorrhizae it kind of has to live

4815
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:08,398
longer than that to be truly beneficial

4816
02:52:06,639 --> 02:52:09,119
to the root zone

4817
02:52:08,398 --> 02:52:11,278
but

4818
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:14,079
you know

4819
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:16,479
diverse microorganisms communicate with

4820
02:52:14,079 --> 02:52:18,559
each other in garden settings so you

4821
02:52:16,478 --> 02:52:20,639
know we we have

4822
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:22,799
four different ones that we work with

4823
02:52:20,639 --> 02:52:25,439
right now and we just

4824
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:27,920
always enhance that type of mycorrhizal

4825
02:52:25,439 --> 02:52:29,920
growth in our gardens just because we

4826
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:32,159
know that all the answers are not there

4827
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:34,478
and biodiversity is so incredibly

4828
02:52:32,159 --> 02:52:36,398
important in your garden so you know

4829
02:52:34,478 --> 02:52:38,478
being able to have you know the classic

4830
02:52:36,398 --> 02:52:40,559
endomycorrhiza

4831
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:42,559
um you know that that's out there in the

4832
02:52:40,559 --> 02:52:44,959
market that's grown organically and

4833
02:52:42,559 --> 02:52:47,199
consciously which is really important

4834
02:52:44,959 --> 02:52:48,959
can also speak to the other root zones

4835
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:51,760
that's going on in your gardens which is

4836
02:52:48,959 --> 02:52:54,398
just like your cover crop and and and

4837
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:56,000
and and i don't know you know the whole

4838
02:52:54,398 --> 02:52:57,519
thing have just did that it's singular

4839
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:59,840
species

4840
02:52:57,520 --> 02:53:01,600
i'm not really sure of that yet i can't

4841
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:03,520
say one way or the other it just doesn't

4842
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:05,439
make sense of nature at all it goes

4843
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:08,560
against all of nature's rules where

4844
02:53:05,439 --> 02:53:11,439
she's just like so full of diversity

4845
02:53:08,559 --> 02:53:14,000
um why is it that we're separating out

4846
02:53:11,439 --> 02:53:16,159
and concentrating and isolating and the

4847
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:18,719
more that we do that we bring it away

4848
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:21,439
from its nature which really doesn't

4849
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:23,278
involve the entourage effect of of

4850
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:25,200
everything that's going on in the rise

4851
02:53:23,279 --> 02:53:26,560
of sphere and i mean it's been proven

4852
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:28,880
that you know

4853
02:53:26,559 --> 02:53:31,519
inner that species

4854
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:33,839
of different different types communicate

4855
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:36,319
with each other and share food like a

4856
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:39,920
pine tree can share food with a birch

4857
02:53:36,318 --> 02:53:42,079
tree and there's no like

4858
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:43,840
law in there that says that they can do

4859
02:53:42,079 --> 02:53:45,680
that but they do it

4860
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:48,239
so enhancing

4861
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:50,159
you know biodiversity in your gardens is

4862
02:53:48,239 --> 02:53:52,959
a big part of cannabis growing and you

4863
02:53:50,159 --> 02:53:55,039
would want to enhance as much different

4864
02:53:52,959 --> 02:53:56,879
species as possible so

4865
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:58,640
they can communicate with each other so

4866
02:53:56,879 --> 02:54:01,438
did that make sense i mean yeah you can

4867
02:53:58,639 --> 02:54:02,959
just get in glomus intradices and put it

4868
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:05,760
in there and yeah you could just be off

4869
02:54:02,959 --> 02:54:08,478
to the races with that one but i think

4870
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:11,760
in life we should try and get you know

4871
02:54:08,478 --> 02:54:14,639
more dynamics happening than that

4872
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:16,398
okay and so i mean i guess the thing i'm

4873
02:54:14,639 --> 02:54:18,398
interested in is overall you would kind

4874
02:54:16,398 --> 02:54:19,599
of say that you don't think that you

4875
02:54:18,398 --> 02:54:22,559
would get better results from just

4876
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:25,040
exclusively using the one

4877
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:27,519
yeah we think that diversity is key in

4878
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:30,399
all aspects diversity and microbiology

4879
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:33,040
and diversity in in nutrients

4880
02:54:30,398 --> 02:54:36,239
is key

4881
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:37,680
can you guys hear my cat meowing

4882
02:54:36,239 --> 02:54:38,879
okay great sorry i had to make sure

4883
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:40,318
otherwise i was like you've got to go

4884
02:54:38,879 --> 02:54:41,599
tell it to go away

4885
02:54:40,318 --> 02:54:43,199
um

4886
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:45,359
so

4887
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:46,840
yeah she's she's got a mouth on her i'll

4888
02:54:45,359 --> 02:54:49,520
tell you that

4889
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:52,000
um so something i saw on your site which

4890
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:54,640
i was super interested in because i am a

4891
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:56,398
self-professed coffee addict you guys

4892
02:54:54,639 --> 02:54:57,920
say that you know it's a bit taxing on

4893
02:54:56,398 --> 02:55:00,318
the adrenal system you're not so into it

4894
02:54:57,920 --> 02:55:01,680
for that reason do you guys think you

4895
02:55:00,318 --> 02:55:04,318
know like that there are actually some

4896
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:05,920
long-term negatives if you know kind of

4897
02:55:04,318 --> 02:55:08,000
bludgeon your body with coffee over a

4898
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:10,719
long period of time

4899
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:12,959
absolutely yeah i mean it stimulates the

4900
02:55:10,719 --> 02:55:14,478
parasympathetic nervous system

4901
02:55:12,959 --> 02:55:16,478
and if your parasympathetic nervous

4902
02:55:14,478 --> 02:55:18,559
system is stimulated all the time which

4903
02:55:16,478 --> 02:55:19,679
unfortunately you know everything that

4904
02:55:18,559 --> 02:55:22,079
we do

4905
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:23,120
is stimulating that you know nervous

4906
02:55:22,079 --> 02:55:25,920
system

4907
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:28,560
and then it starts to drain the adrenals

4908
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:32,079
and when you give your body a full sense

4909
02:55:28,559 --> 02:55:33,039
of stimulant then it starts to kick into

4910
02:55:32,079 --> 02:55:34,478
action

4911
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:36,720
you know that

4912
02:55:34,478 --> 02:55:39,199
the all of those different systems which

4913
02:55:36,719 --> 02:55:40,719
makes a depression in the immune system

4914
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:42,640
and then you have things over a long

4915
02:55:40,719 --> 02:55:44,719
period of time that you know just start

4916
02:55:42,639 --> 02:55:47,920
breaking down the other thing about

4917
02:55:44,719 --> 02:55:50,318
coffee is that it's incredibly acidic

4918
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:52,478
and um you know if you're drinking it

4919
02:55:50,318 --> 02:55:54,239
often then it's really changing the

4920
02:55:52,478 --> 02:55:57,039
acidity of your body

4921
02:55:54,239 --> 02:55:59,520
and you know more alkalinity uh you know

4922
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:01,920
contains more beneficial microbiology

4923
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:04,079
than acidity so if you're constantly

4924
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:06,239
acidifying your body then you're not

4925
02:56:04,079 --> 02:56:08,959
only killing beneficial microbiology but

4926
02:56:06,239 --> 02:56:10,318
you're also breeding pathogens

4927
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:13,278
yeah wow

4928
02:56:10,318 --> 02:56:14,959
and so the the solution to this or maybe

4929
02:56:13,279 --> 02:56:17,359
not the direct solution but you know in

4930
02:56:14,959 --> 02:56:19,358
instead you guys have the cacao and

4931
02:56:17,359 --> 02:56:22,399
mushroom kind of tea you make how did

4932
02:56:19,359 --> 02:56:26,960
you stumble across that one

4933
02:56:22,398 --> 02:56:26,959
uh we just you know we were really like

4934
02:56:27,279 --> 02:56:31,279
has been a really important thing in our

4935
02:56:28,799 --> 02:56:32,879
lives we've been mushroom collecting

4936
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:35,600
for a long time and health and

4937
02:56:32,879 --> 02:56:38,239
well-being has been you know a big part

4938
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:42,159
of what we do and also incredibly long

4939
02:56:38,239 --> 02:56:44,478
hours of work we put a lot into

4940
02:56:42,159 --> 02:56:46,478
you know our property here on our farm

4941
02:56:44,478 --> 02:56:48,239
we put a lot into the education that we

4942
02:56:46,478 --> 02:56:49,920
put out to other people we put a lot

4943
02:56:48,239 --> 02:56:52,159
into our business

4944
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:54,239
and we need something that is going to

4945
02:56:52,159 --> 02:56:56,079
work for us long time josh and i have

4946
02:56:54,239 --> 02:56:58,398
always been joking that we're just in

4947
02:56:56,079 --> 02:56:59,680
training to be 90 year olds

4948
02:56:58,398 --> 02:57:00,719
um

4949
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:02,239
so

4950
02:57:00,719 --> 02:57:03,519
we just want to make sure that you know

4951
02:57:02,239 --> 02:57:05,359
everything that we're putting into our

4952
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:08,479
body is going to have incredible

4953
02:57:05,359 --> 02:57:12,000
longevity it's going to be adaptogenic

4954
02:57:08,478 --> 02:57:14,639
and it's going to decide what our body

4955
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,719
needs rather than depressing it and we

4956
02:57:14,639 --> 02:57:18,639
we we recognize you know with the first

4957
02:57:16,719 --> 02:57:20,799
thing that you drink in the day you know

4958
02:57:18,639 --> 02:57:23,680
really kind of sets the tone for your

4959
02:57:20,799 --> 02:57:25,679
body for the rest of the day so we

4960
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:27,279
you know have been really

4961
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:29,120
wanting to drink something really

4962
02:57:27,279 --> 02:57:31,520
powerful and potent for our bodies so

4963
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:33,520
every morning you know we're drinking

4964
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:35,439
the raw cacao

4965
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:37,359
with you know the medicinal mushrooms in

4966
02:57:35,439 --> 02:57:39,600
there we're just slowly building up our

4967
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:43,279
immune system with the mushrooms every

4968
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:45,200
day and it doesn't drop us you know in

4969
02:57:43,279 --> 02:57:47,279
in energy levels later in the day so

4970
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:49,600

whole uh a long time and and she beat it

5003
02:58:58,159 --> 02:59:03,359
though yeah and uh but we so we've been

5004
02:59:00,799 --> 02:59:04,719
you know propelled on health

5005
02:59:03,359 --> 02:59:06,800
um

5006
02:59:04,719 --> 02:59:09,438
through that and you know also our way

5007
02:59:06,799 --> 02:59:11,920
of life so you know it's again that's a

5008
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:13,760
representation of our lifestyle

5009
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:15,920
yeah that's that's so awesome to hear

5010
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:18,318
and do you guys kind of advocate for

5011
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:20,719
people to look into say maybe taking

5012
02:59:18,318 --> 02:59:22,239
medicinal mushrooms or like a regular

5013
02:59:20,719 --> 02:59:24,000
kind of schedule thing or do you think

5014
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:26,159
maybe not that broadly applicable to

5015
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,079
everyone

5016
02:59:26,159 --> 02:59:29,279
yeah i think that it's important

5017
02:59:28,079 --> 02:59:31,359
everyone

5018
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:32,960
um if they're adaptogens which means

5019
02:59:31,359 --> 02:59:35,760
that they go into your body and they

5020
02:59:32,959 --> 02:59:37,039
decide what it is that you need you know

5021
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:39,760
they're sort of like a higher

5022
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:42,399
intelligent being mycology breaks all

5023
02:59:39,760 --> 02:59:45,040
the rules fungi breaks all the rules

5024
02:59:42,398 --> 02:59:47,119
you know um fruiting bodies you know are

5025
02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:48,399
here to help us you know they they

5026
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:51,279
exudate

5027
02:59:48,398 --> 02:59:53,199
uh co2 and intake oxygen just like we

5028
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:54,600
are we do so

5029
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:56,720
they're just sort of an interesting

5030
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:58,880
anomaly and

5031
02:59:56,719 --> 03:00:01,119
we we know that prolonged use of

5032
02:59:58,879 --> 03:00:02,478
mushrooms is what's the best

5033
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:04,000
so you're not going to really notice a

5034
03:00:02,478 --> 03:00:05,679
difference if you start doing mushrooms

5035
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,040
for a week you'll definitely notice an

5036
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:10,318
energy

5037
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:11,920
increase absolutely you'll notice a more

5038
03:00:10,318 --> 03:00:13,600
mental

5039
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:15,520
increase you know your words will come

5040
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:17,600
to you quicker you you'll have sort of

5041
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:19,920
like you know a better memory base

5042
03:00:17,600 --> 03:00:22,559
immediately but the long-term effects

5043
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:25,439
are you know over a long period of time

5044
03:00:22,559 --> 03:00:27,278
and we feel like years of mushroom use

5045
03:00:25,439 --> 03:00:29,680
is what people need to be doing and

5046
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:31,279
let's let's let's get more specific i

5047
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:34,079
mean chaga

5048
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:37,040
is you know one of the most powerful if

5049
03:00:34,079 --> 03:00:39,600
not the most powerful antioxidant of any

5050
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:42,240
herb on earth as we know it

5051
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:44,559
it has more sods in it which is

5052
03:00:42,239 --> 03:00:47,199
superoxide dismutase which is a

5053
03:00:44,559 --> 03:00:48,799
longevity enzyme it's got one of the

5054
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:52,240
most you know highest amounts of

5055
03:00:48,799 --> 03:00:54,318
longevity enzymes in it um the siberian

5056
03:00:52,239 --> 03:00:55,760
shamans you know done a tremendous

5057
03:00:54,318 --> 03:00:58,318
amount of work and

5058
03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:01,279
in teaching the world about it and

5059
03:00:58,318 --> 03:01:04,239
russian and and korean

5060
03:01:01,279 --> 03:01:05,600
um chinese you know have done a ton of

5061
03:01:04,239 --> 03:01:08,879
work on

5062
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:10,079
medicinal mushrooms um cordyceps builds

5063
03:01:08,879 --> 03:01:12,879
um

5064
03:01:10,079 --> 03:01:14,959
your blood and and builds uh oxygen in

5065
03:01:12,879 --> 03:01:17,920
your blood and you know there's they've

5066
03:01:14,959 --> 03:01:20,398
been used by olympic athletes for years

5067
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:22,639
um to enhance their performance

5068
03:01:20,398 --> 03:01:24,719
you know and their daily routines of

5069
03:01:22,639 --> 03:01:26,398
working out and everything so

5070
03:01:24,719 --> 03:01:28,879
um there's a lot of you know the

5071
03:01:26,398 --> 03:01:32,239
agaricon works the lungs and and and

5072
03:01:28,879 --> 03:01:34,559
also nootropic medicine is is is part of

5073
03:01:32,239 --> 03:01:35,279
what mushrooms are in nootropic means

5074
03:01:34,559 --> 03:01:38,799
that

5075
03:01:35,279 --> 03:01:41,040
it regenerates um cell life

5076
03:01:38,799 --> 03:01:43,599
so it helps you it's a smart drug

5077
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:46,960
particularly in the brain so it helps

5078
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:49,040
generate brain cells um and also yeah

5079
03:01:46,959 --> 03:01:50,879
helps generate them

5080
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:51,920
for the cell to be able to propagate

5081
03:01:50,879 --> 03:01:53,920
itself

5082
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:56,799
in a memory of a healthy cell rather

5083
03:01:53,920 --> 03:01:58,879
than in a memory of a non-healthy cell

5084
03:01:56,799 --> 03:02:01,599
because that's that's the goal is that

5085
03:01:58,879 --> 03:02:04,000
you know in cancer any kind of malaise

5086
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:06,640
or people that have ailments

5087
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:08,000
it's that the cell is reproducing and it

5088
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:10,478
will reproduce

5089
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:12,799
an ailing cell or it will reproduce a

5090
03:02:10,478 --> 03:02:14,478
healthy cell so what is it that you're

5091
03:02:12,799 --> 03:02:17,599
going to be able to give your body the

5092
03:02:14,478 --> 03:02:20,000
memory of reproducing a healthy cell and

5093
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:22,159
we feel like mushrooms really help give

5094
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:24,079
that much higher intelligent

5095
03:02:22,159 --> 03:02:26,398
intelligence of the body to be able to

5096
03:02:24,079 --> 03:02:28,799
produce the healthier cell because we

5097
03:02:26,398 --> 03:02:30,478
know that nothing fights cancer other

5098
03:02:28,799 --> 03:02:32,478
than the immune system

5099
03:02:30,478 --> 03:02:33,679
of course cancer can be diminished along

5100
03:02:32,478 --> 03:02:36,000
with everything else through

5101
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:38,239
chemotherapy and radiation but the

5102
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:40,559
immune system is the only thing that

5103
03:02:38,239 --> 03:02:43,039
transforms cancer cells into healthy

5104
03:02:40,559 --> 03:02:45,519
cells again and that's something across

5105
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:46,800
the board and we also went into

5106
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:49,040
you know we were talking about the

5107
03:02:46,799 --> 03:02:49,840
intelligence of trees

5108
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:52,160
and

5109
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:54,239
a lot of these medicinal mushrooms come

5110
03:02:52,159 --> 03:02:56,079
from trees and they're taking all of the

5111
03:02:54,239 --> 03:02:58,000
minerals and all of the intelligence and

5112
03:02:56,079 --> 03:03:00,239
they're growing directly off the tree

5113
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:02,000
and we can't eat the entire tree but we

5114
03:03:00,239 --> 03:03:03,920
can eat the mushroom that's coming off

5115
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:06,398
of that tree and it has all of the

5116
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:08,559
nutrients that that tree has

5117
03:03:06,398 --> 03:03:10,559
so like chaga comes off of a tree and

5118
03:03:08,559 --> 03:03:13,278
agaricon comes off of the tree in the

5119
03:03:10,559 --> 03:03:16,478
lion's mane and the turkey

5120
03:03:13,279 --> 03:03:18,640
so many are wood loving um

5121
03:03:16,478 --> 03:03:20,239
mushrooms and and we live in a toxic

5122
03:03:18,639 --> 03:03:22,000
environment in general you know we're

5123
03:03:20,239 --> 03:03:23,920
just it's just the way it is and it's

5124
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:26,318
fine you know we do we have toxins

5125
03:03:23,920 --> 03:03:28,879
around us so we should be ingesting

5126
03:03:26,318 --> 03:03:30,719
things that rid ourself of those paths

5127
03:03:28,879 --> 03:03:32,959
you know of the free radicals and and

5128
03:03:30,719 --> 03:03:34,559
that's what mushrooms do we raised our

5129
03:03:32,959 --> 03:03:38,559
son like this he's a professional

5130
03:03:34,559 --> 03:03:40,159
athlete you know so you know it works

5131
03:03:38,559 --> 03:03:42,079
that's awesome to hear yeah i definitely

5132
03:03:40,159 --> 03:03:43,119
believe that something i wanted to touch

5133
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:45,279
on though

5134
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:47,200
bodhi made a comment about how he he

5135
03:03:45,279 --> 03:03:49,200
loves to do both gardening as well as

5136
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:51,279
breeding while under the influence of

5137
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:52,720
psychedelic mushrooms is this something

5138
03:03:51,279 --> 03:03:54,399
you guys have experimented with at all

5139
03:03:52,719 --> 03:03:57,119
and did you find it was productive or

5140
03:03:54,398 --> 03:03:59,439
maybe counterproductive

5141
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:01,600
extremely productive some of the most

5142
03:03:59,439 --> 03:04:03,439
important information that we've gotten

5143
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:05,120
from the plants some

5144
03:04:03,439 --> 03:04:07,120
one of the most life-changing

5145
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:08,800
experiences that have ever happened to

5146
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:09,840
me have been in my greenhouse with my

5147
03:04:08,799 --> 03:04:11,438
plants

5148
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:14,559
on psychedelics

5149
03:04:11,439 --> 03:04:17,760
you know it cuts through stuff

5150
03:04:14,559 --> 03:04:20,000
it it it leads you it it breaks the

5151
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:22,559
veils and it gets you to the point of

5152
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:25,120
importance it puts aside the ego

5153
03:04:22,559 --> 03:04:26,959
and and what you think is happening and

5154
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:29,040
it really allows you to see what is

5155
03:04:26,959 --> 03:04:31,919
happening i feel like

5156
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:34,240
responsible use of psychedelics

5157
03:04:31,920 --> 03:04:35,680
is absolutely imperative and you know a

5158
03:04:34,239 --> 03:04:37,279
lot of people say that you know that

5159
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:38,880
kind of use could be checking out we

5160
03:04:37,279 --> 03:04:40,239
call it checking in

5161
03:04:38,879 --> 03:04:42,398
and checking in

5162
03:04:40,239 --> 03:04:43,680
is so important especially when it comes

5163
03:04:42,398 --> 03:04:45,760
to nature

5164
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:47,520
you know these mushrooms have a higher

5165
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:49,359
intelligence that they're they're there

5166
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:51,439
to teach us they've helped transform our

5167
03:04:49,359 --> 03:04:52,880
whole entire evolution as we know it to

5168
03:04:51,439 --> 03:04:55,200
begin with so

5169
03:04:52,879 --> 03:04:57,438
you know and and psychedelics for some

5170
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:59,439
is like oh a big scary thing

5171
03:04:57,439 --> 03:05:01,760
and psychedelics really shouldn't be

5172
03:04:59,439 --> 03:05:03,359
they should be thought of as as

5173
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:06,000
um

5174
03:05:03,359 --> 03:05:08,318
into spirituality i mean nothing

5175
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:10,639
in this world is easy to to

5176
03:05:08,318 --> 03:05:13,039
explain so having insight you know makes

5177
03:05:10,639 --> 03:05:15,039
a lot of sense and micro dosing is

5178
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:16,880
something that you know a lot of people

5179
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:18,240
are doing nowadays and so it's a lot

5180
03:05:16,879 --> 03:05:20,719
it's not something that people are

5181
03:05:18,239 --> 03:05:22,799
really checking in on and

5182
03:05:20,719 --> 03:05:24,639
you know you can create medicine where

5183
03:05:22,799 --> 03:05:26,719
you're just micro dosing and having a

5184
03:05:24,639 --> 03:05:27,920
little bit of a check in and it can be

5185
03:05:26,719 --> 03:05:30,239
extremely

5186
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:32,879
not only positive for gardening it can

5187
03:05:30,239 --> 03:05:34,719
be extremely positive on your well-being

5188
03:05:32,879 --> 03:05:35,839
and you're you know some people have

5189
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:39,039
problems with

5190
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:41,520
depression or anxiety or detention

5191
03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:44,640
deficit disorder and sometimes it's just

5192
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:47,359
a neurological connection that they ptsd

5193
03:05:44,639 --> 03:05:49,358
yeah so many so we we

5194
03:05:47,359 --> 03:05:50,479
highly suggest that once again know your

5195
03:05:49,359 --> 03:05:51,439
source

5196
03:05:50,478 --> 03:05:54,000
um

5197
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:56,239
mushrooms in particular um take up a lot

5198
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:58,879
of toxins from the environment

5199
03:05:56,239 --> 03:06:01,439
um so know your source in that area but

5200
03:05:58,879 --> 03:06:03,759
yeah it's a good check-in

5201
03:06:01,439 --> 03:06:05,279
yeah nice i dig it and so you kind of

5202
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:07,520
answered it but just to get a final

5203
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:09,600
clarification i had someone talking to

5204
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:12,000
me saying that like they were mixing in

5205
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:13,040
like i i'm just gonna say cube essences

5206
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,398
or whatever like just because you know

5207
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:16,560
it just jumps to mind

5208
03:06:14,398 --> 03:06:18,719
like a micro dose of that with say like

5209
03:06:16,559 --> 03:06:20,639
their regular dose of lines main things

5210
03:06:18,719 --> 03:06:22,398
like that and what they said was that it

5211
03:06:20,639 --> 03:06:24,318
was they felt like it was acting as like

5212
03:06:22,398 --> 03:06:25,760
a potentiator do you think that's the

5213
03:06:24,318 --> 03:06:27,359
case or maybe it was like they were just

5214
03:06:25,760 --> 03:06:28,960
maybe feeling some of the effects of the

5215
03:06:27,359 --> 03:06:30,159
cubes or whatever it was they mixed in

5216
03:06:28,959 --> 03:06:33,358
there

5217
03:06:30,159 --> 03:06:35,200
i mean you know mushrooms are a catalyst

5218
03:06:33,359 --> 03:06:37,600
they're a catalyst for all different

5219
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:39,760
types of well-being they're a catalyst

5220
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:43,439
for mineral uptake in our body they're a

5221
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:46,159
catalyst for so many things and cubensis

5222
03:06:43,439 --> 03:06:48,960
is is one that you know is sort of a

5223
03:06:46,159 --> 03:06:51,200
master of the mushrooms in

5224
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:53,438
in the way that when we take it and how

5225
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:55,760
we perceive the world so that wouldn't

5226
03:06:53,439 --> 03:06:58,079
surprise me at all that it's a catalyst

5227
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:58,800
for the uptake of the nutrients as well

5228
03:06:58,079 --> 03:07:01,120
as

5229
03:06:58,799 --> 03:07:04,000
a cognitive understanding

5230
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:06,160
of it biologically

5231
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:07,920
you know and when you sit with chinese

5232
03:07:06,159 --> 03:07:09,760
herbs and you mix it with other

5233
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:12,398
different adaptogenic herbs then you're

5234
03:07:09,760 --> 03:07:13,920
going to get full spectrum uptake and we

5235
03:07:12,398 --> 03:07:16,478
don't you know

5236
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:18,559
we we do do lipid extraction

5237
03:07:16,478 --> 03:07:20,719
concentrates with our cbd

5238
03:07:18,559 --> 03:07:22,959
and we would never do that without a

5239
03:07:20,719 --> 03:07:25,318
huge array of mushrooms and different

5240
03:07:22,959 --> 03:07:27,278
adaptogenic roots and and herbs

5241
03:07:25,318 --> 03:07:29,920
non-psychedelic

5242
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:33,120
non-psychedelic for that yeah but uh as

5243
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:35,439
far as the psychedelic um ones going it

5244
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:37,439
makes sense to use them with other herbs

5245
03:07:35,439 --> 03:07:40,479
for sure that support your

5246
03:07:37,439 --> 03:07:41,840
your system while you're in that state

5247
03:07:40,478 --> 03:07:43,438
and we do know that that's hard on your

5248
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:44,880
liver so you have to have things that

5249
03:07:43,439 --> 03:07:48,479
are supportive

5250
03:07:44,879 --> 03:07:50,000
of you know um the uptake of the toxins

5251
03:07:48,478 --> 03:07:51,039
as well

5252
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,959
yeah

5253
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:54,479
so question that's a little off topic

5254
03:07:52,959 --> 03:07:55,839
but i

5255
03:07:54,478 --> 03:07:57,119
remember i think you've even said it a

5256
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:59,359
few times in a few different little

5257
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:01,120
talks that you kind of wanted to remain

5258
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:02,239
like kind of like a mom-and-pop type of

5259
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:03,680
company where you were still really

5260
03:08:02,239 --> 03:08:05,039
hands-on with things

5261
03:08:03,680 --> 03:08:06,880
is that still the case and do you

5262
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:08,479
foresee that you know like a point where

5263
03:08:06,879 --> 03:08:10,000
you ever might expand your network

5264
03:08:08,478 --> 03:08:12,478
beyond say what you could physically

5265
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:15,840
deal with or is it very core to you to

5266
03:08:12,478 --> 03:08:18,239
remain kind of that hands-on approach

5267
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:20,159
it's awesome because we are expanding

5268
03:08:18,239 --> 03:08:21,680
and we're expanding

5269
03:08:20,159 --> 03:08:23,600
through other farms and they're

5270
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:25,520
expanding through us and the knowledge

5271
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:27,760
is being passed on

5272
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:29,040
from one farm to the next and it's just

5273
03:08:27,760 --> 03:08:30,079
becoming

5274
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:32,240
like

5275
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:34,559
we're able to almost be everywhere and

5276
03:08:32,239 --> 03:08:36,559
the information is able to be everywhere

5277
03:08:34,559 --> 03:08:37,439
and that's the real power

5278
03:08:36,559 --> 03:08:39,760
and

5279
03:08:37,439 --> 03:08:41,840
i mean hands-on experience yes

5280
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:44,800
absolutely it's just totally important

5281
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:47,359
to us to have relationships with people

5282
03:08:44,799 --> 03:08:49,519
and community and we feel like this is a

5283
03:08:47,359 --> 03:08:52,800
way that we can have relationship with a

5284
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:53,680
greater wider international community is

5285
03:08:52,799 --> 03:08:56,959
through

5286
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:59,760
like-minded and like practicing

5287
03:08:56,959 --> 03:09:01,519
cultivators and extractors and business

5288
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:03,760
people and

5289
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:06,560
yeah and everywhere we've not taken on

5290
03:09:03,760 --> 03:09:08,559
major distributors or major investors in

5291
03:09:06,559 --> 03:09:11,039
any way with our company

5292
03:09:08,559 --> 03:09:13,680
and so no it's not a goal for us it's

5293
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:16,000
not a goal for us to sell our company to

5294
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:18,318
you know say a global distributor type

5295
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:21,200
thing and you know get it into every

5296
03:09:18,318 --> 03:09:22,879
grow store worldwide you know do we you

5297
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:25,120
know would do we want a successful

5298
03:09:22,879 --> 03:09:27,438
company yeah do you know if it happened

5299
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:29,120
to where it all went into all the growth

5300
03:09:27,439 --> 03:09:31,120
stores and it was somehow imagined an

5301
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:33,920
all-in-one

5302
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:36,319
organic uh you know expansion yes we

5303
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:38,159
want that which is what it is now um you

5304
03:09:36,318 --> 03:09:40,238
know like josh had mentioned really you

5305
03:09:38,159 --> 03:09:42,398
know briefly we don't do any we don't do

5306
03:09:40,238 --> 03:09:44,478
any marketing marketing like at all we

5307
03:09:42,398 --> 03:09:46,959
haven't spent any money ever on

5308
03:09:44,478 --> 03:09:49,039
marketing because we just feel like

5309
03:09:46,959 --> 03:09:51,519
pass the information on and then the

5310
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:52,479
good information will rise to the top

5311
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:54,159
and

5312
03:09:52,478 --> 03:09:56,799
and you know

5313
03:09:54,159 --> 03:09:58,478
it's more important for us to be walking

5314
03:09:56,799 --> 03:10:00,398
forward with integrity than walking

5315
03:09:58,478 --> 03:10:02,639
forward with anything else and and

5316
03:10:00,398 --> 03:10:04,799
having the voice of the plant

5317
03:10:02,639 --> 03:10:06,559
you know always in our mind and and

5318
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:08,478
being able to share that voice so that

5319
03:10:06,559 --> 03:10:10,318
other people can also have it within

5320
03:10:08,478 --> 03:10:11,039
their integrity and their intention as

5321
03:10:10,318 --> 03:10:13,039
they

5322
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:15,439
you know grow their flowers in their

5323
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:15,439
gardens

5324
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,559
so

5325
03:10:16,799 --> 03:10:19,599
this is kind of an interesting one

5326
03:10:18,559 --> 03:10:21,039
because we've been talking a lot about

5327
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:22,960
the immune system about the plant's

5328
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:24,720
immune system the human immune system

5329
03:10:22,959 --> 03:10:25,679
i'm really interested in

5330
03:10:24,719 --> 03:10:27,278
you know i call them the

5331
03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:28,800
immunomodulators that's kind of i guess

5332
03:10:27,279 --> 03:10:30,238
more of like a human term for these

5333
03:10:28,799 --> 03:10:32,478
types of molecules but things which

5334
03:10:30,238 --> 03:10:35,279
activate the sar response systemic

5335
03:10:32,478 --> 03:10:36,959
acquired resistance like yeah chitin

5336
03:10:35,279 --> 03:10:39,200
salicylic acid

5337
03:10:36,959 --> 03:10:40,719
jasminic acid these types of things

5338
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:42,399
what are your thoughts on these ones do

5339
03:10:40,719 --> 03:10:44,478
you kind of play around with insect

5340
03:10:42,398 --> 03:10:46,959
frass or chitin or any of these kind of

5341
03:10:44,478 --> 03:10:48,799
immunoboosters for the plant and do you

5342
03:10:46,959 --> 03:10:50,639
advocate for them

5343
03:10:48,799 --> 03:10:53,278
well interestingly enough one of the

5344
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:54,719
highest forms of natural chitin that

5345
03:10:53,279 --> 03:10:55,920
comes through the plant form is in a

5346
03:10:54,719 --> 03:10:58,719
mushroom

5347
03:10:55,920 --> 03:11:01,840
so we utilize lots of mushrooms we

5348
03:10:58,719 --> 03:11:03,519
utilize mushrooms as biomass you know we

5349
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:04,960
chop up some of the tree mushrooms that

5350
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:07,279
we have here that we would use in a

5351
03:11:04,959 --> 03:11:08,478
medicinal lipid compound you know that

5352
03:11:07,279 --> 03:11:10,880
we make here

5353
03:11:08,478 --> 03:11:13,278
and also put it into our tees

5354
03:11:10,879 --> 03:11:16,318
so chitin is definitely something that

5355
03:11:13,279 --> 03:11:18,560
we utilize we utilize white willow bark

5356
03:11:16,318 --> 03:11:20,559
um we make it here on the property we

5357
03:11:18,559 --> 03:11:24,000
put that in our teas for the acid

5358
03:11:20,559 --> 03:11:26,000
acidicity acid um you know we always

5359
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:29,439
look for the plants

5360
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:30,879
yet again for growing on the property

5361
03:11:29,439 --> 03:11:33,359
yeah and we're always looking towards

5362
03:11:30,879 --> 03:11:35,358
the plants to give that information to

5363
03:11:33,359 --> 03:11:36,640
us because if we're feeding plants we

5364
03:11:35,359 --> 03:11:38,880
feel like

5365
03:11:36,639 --> 03:11:41,039
plants understand plants the best they

5366
03:11:38,879 --> 03:11:43,679
communicate the best with each other so

5367
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:46,560
we're looking for the plant version of

5368
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:48,559
it you know we don't get the the other

5369
03:11:46,559 --> 03:11:49,760
part of it like the powderized version

5370
03:11:48,559 --> 03:11:51,680
and what's interesting is all the

5371
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:53,840
pharmaceutical companies that have had

5372
03:11:51,680 --> 03:11:55,520
like hexane extraction on a lot of these

5373
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:58,079
you know say aspirin i mean it

5374
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:59,840
originally came from a plant or all of

5375
03:11:58,079 --> 03:12:02,318
these different compounds that we see in

5376
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:04,079
pharmacies and and also you know vitamin

5377
03:12:02,318 --> 03:12:06,879
supplements they originally came from

5378
03:12:04,079 --> 03:12:08,559
plants and we've also we've we've made

5379
03:12:06,879 --> 03:12:11,199
them like synthetic to where our body

5380
03:12:08,559 --> 03:12:13,760
can't necessarily break it down

5381
03:12:11,200 --> 03:12:15,920
so that's why you know plants and teas

5382
03:12:13,760 --> 03:12:17,040
and these things are just so incredibly

5383
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:18,799
powerful

5384
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:20,399
for boosting the immune in the immune

5385
03:12:18,799 --> 03:12:22,000
response

5386
03:12:20,398 --> 03:12:24,238
yeah i can definitely agree with that

5387
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:26,719
have you actually done any like toying

5388
03:12:24,238 --> 03:12:28,799
around yourself so to speak with uh like

5389
03:12:26,719 --> 03:12:30,799
chitin and its effects on the immune

5390
03:12:28,799 --> 03:12:32,879
system because i know it was used in

5391
03:12:30,799 --> 03:12:34,719
traditional chinese medicine for a long

5392
03:12:32,879 --> 03:12:36,398
time but i couldn't really find any

5393
03:12:34,719 --> 03:12:37,278
clear evidence of whether it was like

5394
03:12:36,398 --> 03:12:38,639
you know because it's not it's not

5395
03:12:37,279 --> 03:12:39,680
offered as like a supplement so i kind

5396
03:12:38,639 --> 03:12:41,278
of was thinking i don't know how

5397
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:43,279
effective it is

5398
03:12:41,279 --> 03:12:45,520
well right now it is being offered as a

5399
03:12:43,279 --> 03:12:48,159
supplement there's a lot more things

5400
03:12:45,520 --> 03:12:51,279
coming out now with cricket powder

5401
03:12:48,159 --> 03:12:52,478
so you can you can buy cricut powder

5402
03:12:51,279 --> 03:12:55,040
and

5403
03:12:52,478 --> 03:12:57,039
they're taking crickets and that are

5404
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:58,880
problems and areas and they're turning

5405
03:12:57,040 --> 03:13:00,960
it into a supplement

5406
03:12:58,879 --> 03:13:03,039
and i think that that's great

5407
03:13:00,959 --> 03:13:05,358
one thing that we know for certain is

5408
03:13:03,040 --> 03:13:07,040
that you know there's been test studies

5409
03:13:05,359 --> 03:13:08,880
done in india

5410
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:11,279
and um

5411
03:13:08,879 --> 03:13:14,079
they couldn't really figure out why is

5412
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:16,720
it that certain jain regions you know

5413
03:13:14,079 --> 03:13:18,559
that only eat certain vegetables and and

5414
03:13:16,719 --> 03:13:21,920
certain types of beans and this sort of

5415
03:13:18,559 --> 03:13:23,519
thing why is it that their b12

5416
03:13:21,920 --> 03:13:25,439
rates were still pretty high in their

5417
03:13:23,520 --> 03:13:27,520
blood counts you know where is it that

5418
03:13:25,439 --> 03:13:28,800
they were getting that b12 to be able to

5419
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:31,359
uptake it

5420
03:13:28,799 --> 03:13:34,079
and after you know several years of

5421
03:13:31,359 --> 03:13:36,399
research and study it was all of the

5422
03:13:34,079 --> 03:13:38,719
small bugs that are in the grains and in

5423
03:13:36,398 --> 03:13:39,840
the lentils that they're eating every

5424
03:13:38,719 --> 03:13:40,719
day

5425
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:43,680
so

5426
03:13:40,719 --> 03:13:45,278
that's a a perfect example of

5427
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:48,479
you know

5428
03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:51,840
that sort of like bug and insect we call

5429
03:13:48,478 --> 03:13:54,840
those macrobes you know can be a part of

5430
03:13:51,840 --> 03:13:57,680
our diet as well as our as our plants

5431
03:13:54,840 --> 03:14:00,559
diet yeah makes sense right just the

5432
03:13:57,680 --> 03:14:00,559
holistic approach

5433
03:14:00,719 --> 03:14:04,079
so

5434
03:14:02,079 --> 03:14:05,200
you know you feel free to you know we

5435
03:14:04,079 --> 03:14:06,478
can cut this one out if you don't want

5436
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:08,319
to answer it because it's i don't know

5437
03:14:06,478 --> 03:14:09,599
it's maybe not in your style but i've

5438
03:14:08,318 --> 03:14:11,920
noticed that there's kind of like this

5439
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:13,359
cyclical wave of like fad products on

5440
03:14:11,920 --> 03:14:15,200
the market and like the one that jumps

5441
03:14:13,359 --> 03:14:16,720
to mind to me is like fulvic acid you

5442
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:19,040
know fuvic acid has always been around

5443
03:14:16,719 --> 03:14:20,478
but recently we had like the shilajit

5444
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:22,960
surge you know it kind of came back with

5445
03:14:20,478 --> 03:14:24,318
a force and then it's died off again and

5446
03:14:22,959 --> 03:14:25,599
what's your experience with the fad

5447
03:14:24,318 --> 03:14:27,439
products like are there any ones where

5448
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:28,640
you see it just like so my example was

5449
03:14:27,439 --> 03:14:29,760
the fulvic acid where it's like you know

5450
03:14:28,639 --> 03:14:32,238
it's just a basic product but it just

5451
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:34,159
keeps getting recycled and rebranded and

5452
03:14:32,238 --> 03:14:35,600
you know kind of i guess maybe tricking

5453
03:14:34,159 --> 03:14:37,600
some people who aren't familiar that

5454
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:39,760
most of the time it's just fulvic acid

5455
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:41,359
in that in that example do you have any

5456
03:14:39,760 --> 03:14:43,040
kind of products which jump to mind

5457
03:14:41,359 --> 03:14:44,479
which are like this for you where you

5458
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,840
know like they get this surge of

5459
03:14:44,478 --> 03:14:48,879
popularity and it's like it's just the

5460
03:14:45,840 --> 03:14:50,880
same thing that's always been there

5461
03:14:48,879 --> 03:14:52,159
well we i think they will probably pass

5462
03:14:50,879 --> 03:14:54,799
on that question because we wouldn't

5463
03:14:52,159 --> 03:14:56,639
want to you know point out

5464
03:14:54,799 --> 03:14:59,438
you know a name of a product and then

5465
03:14:56,639 --> 03:15:00,719
maybe put that down or make a fad of it

5466
03:14:59,439 --> 03:15:02,398
you know what i mean i think that it's

5467
03:15:00,719 --> 03:15:05,119
important that

5468
03:15:02,398 --> 03:15:07,519
you know in it's all about them

5469
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:09,439
yeah it's about the evolution and again

5470
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:10,560
the the community gets to decide so

5471
03:15:09,439 --> 03:15:12,159
they're going to be lots of things

5472
03:15:10,559 --> 03:15:13,760
thrown at the community and how is it

5473
03:15:12,159 --> 03:15:14,719
that the community is going to sift

5474
03:15:13,760 --> 03:15:17,040
through it

5475
03:15:14,719 --> 03:15:19,119
is more important than focusing on the

5476
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:21,760
company that put out some kind of a fad

5477
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:23,279
product it will be up to the community

5478
03:15:21,760 --> 03:15:24,639
to decide on what's going to have the

5479
03:15:23,279 --> 03:15:25,920
longevity

5480
03:15:24,639 --> 03:15:27,920
yeah of course

5481
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:29,920
and so are you familiar with uh

5482
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:31,840
tricantenol or tricontinol however you

5483
03:15:29,920 --> 03:15:33,359
want to pronounce it um like the natural

5484
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:35,439
growth hormone

5485
03:15:33,359 --> 03:15:38,318
you mean alfalfa you mean alfalfa yeah

5486
03:15:35,439 --> 03:15:40,720
yeah so definitely in that um so my

5487
03:15:38,318 --> 03:15:42,478
question is basically there's now like

5488
03:15:40,719 --> 03:15:44,159
more refined versions of it coming out

5489
03:15:42,478 --> 03:15:45,920
and it's kind of slowly getting some

5490
03:15:44,159 --> 03:15:48,159
traction in the market as far as i can

5491
03:15:45,920 --> 03:15:49,520
see have you looked into those more

5492
03:15:48,159 --> 03:15:51,520
purified versions because obviously a

5493
03:15:49,520 --> 03:15:53,279
lot of people maybe knowingly or not

5494
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:55,040
engage in it through alfalfa top

5495
03:15:53,279 --> 03:15:57,120
dressers things like that but what about

5496
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:58,720
a really kind of purified version would

5497
03:15:57,120 --> 03:16:00,720
you be in favor of that if it worked

5498
03:15:58,719 --> 03:16:02,000
similarly or is it kind of you know down

5499
03:16:00,719 --> 03:16:04,000
that same school of thought we don't

5500
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:05,680
engage in

5501
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:07,600
well the the

5502
03:16:05,680 --> 03:16:10,479
the idea of it really would be is how is

5503
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:13,840
it purified how is it concentrated and

5504
03:16:10,478 --> 03:16:15,358
really you you get such high levels in

5505
03:16:13,840 --> 03:16:17,279
super healthy

5506
03:16:15,359 --> 03:16:19,600
really awesome alfalfa

5507
03:16:17,279 --> 03:16:20,560
and if you're only going to use it once

5508
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:22,318
you know

5509
03:16:20,559 --> 03:16:24,639
you know one time a cycle are going to

5510
03:16:22,318 --> 03:16:26,639
use it two times for a whole cycle well

5511
03:16:24,639 --> 03:16:28,959
you can use alfalfa in every one of your

5512
03:16:26,639 --> 03:16:31,439
feedings and that's just going to be

5513
03:16:28,959 --> 03:16:32,318
prolonged over time it really goes back

5514
03:16:31,439 --> 03:16:34,000
to

5515
03:16:32,318 --> 03:16:36,799
you know sometimes we overthink

5516
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:38,799
ourselves sometimes the basic raw whole

5517
03:16:36,799 --> 03:16:40,879
food is really what's best for us more

5518
03:16:38,799 --> 03:16:43,519
often rather than

5519
03:16:40,879 --> 03:16:45,679
less often and a bunch of you know

5520
03:16:43,520 --> 03:16:48,399
pre-packaged stuff in between and then

5521
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:50,479
people are gonna want gibberellic acid

5522
03:16:48,398 --> 03:16:53,358
because it makes their plants grow you

5523
03:16:50,478 --> 03:16:55,039
know super tall and yeah you know you

5524
03:16:53,359 --> 03:16:58,559
might just find out that you can just

5525
03:16:55,040 --> 03:17:01,120
use your urine

5526
03:16:58,559 --> 03:17:03,278
with water and and you'd be like oh my

5527
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:05,120
god this works a hundred times better

5528
03:17:03,279 --> 03:17:07,760
than anything i've gotten from the store

5529
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:10,079
i mean seriously it feels like we could

5530
03:17:07,760 --> 03:17:12,800
go right back to the basics on almost

5531
03:17:10,079 --> 03:17:14,318
everything and it really works

5532
03:17:12,799 --> 03:17:16,799
better

5533
03:17:14,318 --> 03:17:19,359
it just does so no we're not really down

5534
03:17:16,799 --> 03:17:21,438
with all the the new

5535
03:17:19,359 --> 03:17:23,359
and improved

5536
03:17:21,439 --> 03:17:25,279
not saying that there's not a place for

5537
03:17:23,359 --> 03:17:27,760
evolution and not saying that there's

5538
03:17:25,279 --> 03:17:30,238
not a place for all

5539
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:31,520
things and all good times you know what

5540
03:17:30,238 --> 03:17:32,799
i mean it's just

5541
03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:35,680
um

5542
03:17:32,799 --> 03:17:36,959
we constantly look towards nature to be

5543
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:39,120
our mentor

5544
03:17:36,959 --> 03:17:41,759
so maybe what we'll find is a new

5545
03:17:39,120 --> 03:17:43,520
biomass bush to grow you know maybe

5546
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:46,000
we'll find a new

5547
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:48,640
you know tree that that blooms all

5548
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:50,879
summer for the bees now now i'm talking

5549
03:17:48,639 --> 03:17:53,840
now we're talking about a product you

5550
03:17:50,879 --> 03:17:56,238
know what i mean yeah totally uh

5551
03:17:53,840 --> 03:17:58,799
a grass that propagates mycorrhizae you

5552
03:17:56,238 --> 03:18:00,159
know what i mean like now now let's talk

5553
03:17:58,799 --> 03:18:01,920
you know

5554
03:18:00,159 --> 03:18:03,520
yeah so

5555
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:05,439
this is a bit of a weird one but a lot

5556
03:18:03,520 --> 03:18:08,399
of people commonly will say that you

5557
03:18:05,439 --> 03:18:10,159
can't do kind of like a no-till type of

5558
03:18:08,398 --> 03:18:12,238
philosophy unless you're in a certain

5559
03:18:10,159 --> 03:18:13,840
size pot i think the commonly uh

5560
03:18:12,238 --> 03:18:14,639
reference number is about 30 liters or

5561
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:16,238
so

5562
03:18:14,639 --> 03:18:17,920
do you do you drive with that like do

5563
03:18:16,238 --> 03:18:19,760
you think people using small pots can

5564
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:21,680
successfully under do kind of nutrient

5565
03:18:19,760 --> 03:18:23,439
cycling and the the concepts of what

5566
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:25,040
no-till is advocating or do you think

5567
03:18:23,439 --> 03:18:26,800
there is that requirement for a certain

5568
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:29,840
size pot

5569
03:18:26,799 --> 03:18:31,679
i don't like to limit people yeah but uh

5570
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:33,840
you know it's going to work better in a

5571
03:18:31,680 --> 03:18:35,359
bigger pot and and but the plant's going

5572
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:37,040
to grow better

5573
03:18:35,359 --> 03:18:38,720
plants gonna grow better in a bigger pot

5574
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:40,399
and plants gonna grow better in a bigger

5575
03:18:38,719 --> 03:18:43,119
bed you know and it's easier to keep

5576
03:18:40,398 --> 03:18:45,680
your biology happy there's options you

5577
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:47,840
know but but some people only have small

5578
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:49,120
pots and if that's and if this is the

5579
03:18:47,840 --> 03:18:50,960
introduction that they're getting for

5580
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:53,200
them to be able to grow really awesome

5581
03:18:50,959 --> 03:18:54,799
medicine to share with your friends or

5582
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:57,200
you know if they're needing it then

5583
03:18:54,799 --> 03:18:58,639
that's awesome and like josh said we

5584
03:18:57,200 --> 03:19:01,120
just really don't want to

5585
03:18:58,639 --> 03:19:03,278
limit you just do your very best there's

5586
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:05,439
so much conversation out there right now

5587
03:19:03,279 --> 03:19:08,720
on what the word regenerative is you

5588
03:19:05,439 --> 03:19:11,760
know for us it's like if you're creating

5589
03:19:08,719 --> 03:19:15,119
more balances than checks you're doing

5590
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:17,680
good and we all can't just automatically

5591
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:19,200
have some closed-loop regenerative farm

5592
03:19:17,680 --> 03:19:21,279
where everything is just running

5593
03:19:19,200 --> 03:19:23,840
perfectly you know some of us have to

5594
03:19:21,279 --> 03:19:27,120
start in a closet with a couple of you

5595
03:19:23,840 --> 03:19:29,439
know one gallon pots do your best yeah

5596
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:31,279
do your best there really small plants

5597
03:19:29,439 --> 03:19:32,559
for that you know if you're gonna do you

5598
03:19:31,279 --> 03:19:34,800
know a small pot you'd have to have

5599
03:19:32,559 --> 03:19:36,959
really small plants otherwise the roots

5600
03:19:34,799 --> 03:19:39,358
would colonize the root zone too much

5601
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:40,799
and it would just it would choke out the

5602
03:19:39,359 --> 03:19:43,279
life that you're trying to do in a

5603
03:19:40,799 --> 03:19:45,759
prolonged environment so you know the

5604
03:19:43,279 --> 03:19:46,960
smaller pot you have the more you know

5605
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:48,960
thought out and tension you're gonna

5606
03:19:46,959 --> 03:19:50,559
have to put into it

5607
03:19:48,959 --> 03:19:52,799
yeah you have a little bit of room you

5608
03:19:50,559 --> 03:19:54,639
know of in a bed you know

5609
03:19:52,799 --> 03:19:55,759
yeah it's like a safety net in a way

5610
03:19:54,639 --> 03:19:58,079
isn't it

5611
03:19:55,760 --> 03:20:00,159
it is oh it's a huge safety net we

5612
03:19:58,079 --> 03:20:03,200
always say that you know a soilless

5613
03:20:00,159 --> 03:20:04,879
medium is like the plant uptaking

5614
03:20:03,200 --> 03:20:07,439
through an iv

5615
03:20:04,879 --> 03:20:09,519
and then a a plant a

5616
03:20:07,439 --> 03:20:10,720
soil that just has a little teeny tiny

5617
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:12,880
bit in it

5618
03:20:10,719 --> 03:20:15,039
is somebody who you know a person that

5619
03:20:12,879 --> 03:20:18,079
may have you know not a very good

5620
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:19,520
digestive tract but when you have big

5621
03:20:18,079 --> 03:20:21,600
heaping

5622
03:20:19,520 --> 03:20:23,520
soil piles and you've been working on it

5623
03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:25,359
for a really long time it's the same as

5624
03:20:23,520 --> 03:20:27,120
that person that you would call that has

5625
03:20:25,359 --> 03:20:29,120
an iron gut

5626
03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:30,720
that they can take anything and you can

5627
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:32,160
throw anything at that person and

5628
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:33,438
they're not allergic to it they've got

5629
03:20:32,159 --> 03:20:36,159
nothing because they have such a

5630
03:20:33,439 --> 03:20:37,600
tremendous amount of microbiology

5631
03:20:36,159 --> 03:20:39,520
and that's it you know the more you

5632
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:41,200
build your microbiology the more you're

5633
03:20:39,520 --> 03:20:43,279
going to be able to throw at it the

5634
03:20:41,200 --> 03:20:44,640
least amount of microbiology to be very

5635
03:20:43,279 --> 03:20:48,000
careful what you throw at it because

5636
03:20:44,639 --> 03:20:51,119
your plant can't understand it balance

5637
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:52,959
yeah yeah i can definitely see that so

5638
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:55,200
on a lot of your products they're used

5639
03:20:52,959 --> 03:20:57,039
for fatigue and for top dressings

5640
03:20:55,200 --> 03:20:58,800
however i have seen the odd person just

5641
03:20:57,040 --> 03:21:00,479
using it as a straight soil amendment

5642
03:20:58,799 --> 03:21:02,799
just mixing it in or like kind of like a

5643
03:21:00,478 --> 03:21:04,318
revitalization thing after a cycle do

5644
03:21:02,799 --> 03:21:06,000
you find you get pretty much the same

5645
03:21:04,318 --> 03:21:07,600
results doing that or do you kind of you

5646
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:09,600
know if possible advocate for them to be

5647
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:11,040
used as teas or like the way maybe you

5648
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:13,760
marketed it

5649
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:15,200
it's just valuable you know anyway yeah

5650
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:19,920
it's fine

5651
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:22,399
it's an absolutely amazing soil additive

5652
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:24,879
it's just phenomenal what what the roots

5653
03:21:22,398 --> 03:21:27,039
do with it and even and it's really just

5654
03:21:24,879 --> 03:21:29,199
a transplant and it's really not just

5655
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:32,160
you know our products it's the idea of

5656
03:21:29,200 --> 03:21:34,159
just bringing in green material into

5657
03:21:32,159 --> 03:21:36,079
your soils you know making sure that

5658
03:21:34,159 --> 03:21:38,000
you've got some herbal compounds and

5659
03:21:36,079 --> 03:21:40,079
some plant material in there more than

5660
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:41,920
just kelp like take all your sun leaves

5661
03:21:40,079 --> 03:21:43,439
from your previous harvest and put them

5662
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:45,600
in your soil

5663
03:21:43,439 --> 03:21:48,800
and that just really helps increase the

5664
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:51,120
bacteria you know breakdown and then the

5665
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:52,799
bacteria then starts to feed the fungi

5666
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:54,000
it's just you know when you up it all

5667
03:21:52,799 --> 03:21:56,238
its best

5668
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:58,238
and in nature you know when you go to

5669
03:21:56,238 --> 03:21:59,039
the most beautiful pristine forest it

5670
03:21:58,238 --> 03:22:01,520
has

5671
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:03,040
varying amounts of decomposition from

5672
03:22:01,520 --> 03:22:04,800
the leaves

5673
03:22:03,040 --> 03:22:06,560
all around it and that's something

5674
03:22:04,799 --> 03:22:08,639
that's really easy to mimic in your

5675
03:22:06,559 --> 03:22:10,639
garden and it's easy to mimic even in

5676
03:22:08,639 --> 03:22:12,799
your first soil mixes

5677
03:22:10,639 --> 03:22:15,199
you could mimic you can mimic that by

5678
03:22:12,799 --> 03:22:16,719
adding more leaf material

5679
03:22:15,200 --> 03:22:18,800
yeah okay i think that's actually

5680
03:22:16,719 --> 03:22:20,719
something people are a little scared of

5681
03:22:18,799 --> 03:22:22,959
at least mixing it into the soil i mean

5682
03:22:20,719 --> 03:22:23,760
i'm a bit i don't mind top dressing but

5683
03:22:22,959 --> 03:22:25,679
yeah

5684
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:27,040
i think there is a little bit of

5685
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:28,318
yeah i don't know what the word is

5686
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:29,600
better than

5687
03:22:28,318 --> 03:22:31,600
yeah like really mixing it in you know

5688
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:33,760
what i mean yeah

5689
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:35,680
we utilize all of that our hash

5690
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:37,680
leftovers you know all of the green

5691
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:40,720
material from our hash we make sure to

5692
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:41,680
make it at a time that we're mixing our

5693
03:22:40,719 --> 03:22:43,519
soil

5694
03:22:41,680 --> 03:22:44,479
for our nurseries

5695
03:22:43,520 --> 03:22:45,920
so

5696
03:22:44,478 --> 03:22:48,079
you know we make sure that that's all

5697
03:22:45,920 --> 03:22:49,920
like cyclical and all that green fresh

5698
03:22:48,079 --> 03:22:52,559
material just goes right in and it's

5699
03:22:49,920 --> 03:22:54,879
amazing even carrot pulp will be making

5700
03:22:52,559 --> 03:22:57,519
carrot juice and we'll put carrot pulp

5701
03:22:54,879 --> 03:23:00,000
in there too and it can be really good

5702
03:22:57,520 --> 03:23:02,640
just the idea that you can utilize so

5703
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:04,398
much different vegetation to help spark

5704
03:23:02,639 --> 03:23:05,920
your soil

5705
03:23:04,398 --> 03:23:08,000
yeah definitely

5706
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:09,840
so we kind of indirectly touched on this

5707
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:12,318
question but i just wanted to get the

5708
03:23:09,840 --> 03:23:15,200
final ruling on it what type of ipm or

5709
03:23:12,318 --> 03:23:17,519
sorry ipfm methods do you guys use

5710
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:19,840
throughout kind of the more flowering

5711
03:23:17,520 --> 03:23:21,200
phases if you had an infestation let's

5712
03:23:19,840 --> 03:23:22,719
just say a mite you know a lot of people

5713
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:24,720
kind of deal with that what are the

5714
03:23:22,719 --> 03:23:26,639
types of things you'd be looking to use

5715
03:23:24,719 --> 03:23:28,318
or to like you know kind of philosophies

5716
03:23:26,639 --> 03:23:31,039
to utilize

5717
03:23:28,318 --> 03:23:33,199
if you're if you're in flowering cycle

5718
03:23:31,040 --> 03:23:36,000
which is always the most difficult

5719
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:39,520
definitely bringing your rooms up to 120

5720
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:41,680
degrees fahrenheit 50 degrees celsius

5721
03:23:39,520 --> 03:23:43,120
um kills all

5722
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:44,800
thin

5723
03:23:43,120 --> 03:23:47,200
exoskeleton

5724
03:23:44,799 --> 03:23:48,959
mites as well as aphids they'll

5725
03:23:47,200 --> 03:23:52,000
literally explode

5726
03:23:48,959 --> 03:23:55,519
so utilizing heat treatment is fantastic

5727
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:58,559
but making sure that your root zone is

5728
03:23:55,520 --> 03:24:00,880
damp and well fed because your roots

5729
03:23:58,559 --> 03:24:02,318
need to stay very moist and they need to

5730
03:24:00,879 --> 03:24:04,478
stay cool

5731
03:24:02,318 --> 03:24:06,559
and it's not it's not heating up your

5732
03:24:04,478 --> 03:24:08,799
indoor rooms through lights you can't

5733
03:24:06,559 --> 03:24:10,398
have your lights on high and heat it up

5734
03:24:08,799 --> 03:24:12,398
that much because the pores of the

5735
03:24:10,398 --> 03:24:13,920
leaves are going to open and when the

5736
03:24:12,398 --> 03:24:17,039
pores of the leaves are open they're

5737
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:20,559
very susceptible to like uv light in

5738
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:22,960
greenhouses you can get it up to 120 no

5739
03:24:20,559 --> 03:24:25,278
problem it's really easy

5740
03:24:22,959 --> 03:24:27,278
you can watch the buds actually swell

5741
03:24:25,279 --> 03:24:28,800
you'll get more yield where we're really

5742
03:24:27,279 --> 03:24:30,800
noticing that

5743
03:24:28,799 --> 03:24:33,199
with the resin is really coming out and

5744
03:24:30,799 --> 03:24:35,519
you're being able to kill off really the

5745
03:24:33,200 --> 03:24:37,120
thin exoskeleton you'll be killing off

5746
03:24:35,520 --> 03:24:38,319
your predators

5747
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:41,359
as well

5748
03:24:38,318 --> 03:24:43,359
but you put your predators on afterwards

5749
03:24:41,359 --> 03:24:46,479
it certainly doesn't kill things like

5750
03:24:43,359 --> 03:24:48,559
wasps you know and and plants love 50

5751
03:24:46,478 --> 03:24:50,159
degrees you know people say oh is that

5752
03:24:48,559 --> 03:24:52,238
so hot well you look at where they the

5753
03:24:50,159 --> 03:24:54,398
plants actually come from and the season

5754
03:24:52,238 --> 03:24:56,159
that they grow in they just love heat

5755
03:24:54,398 --> 03:24:56,959
so it's not something that is going to

5756
03:24:56,159 --> 03:24:59,039
be

5757
03:24:56,959 --> 03:25:01,438
definitely stay in your room

5758
03:24:59,040 --> 03:25:03,600
have a glass of water for you and you're

5759
03:25:01,439 --> 03:25:05,600
sort of like taking a sauna either in

5760
03:25:03,600 --> 03:25:07,840
your greenhouse or in your room or

5761
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:10,479
wherever you are to try to reach that 50

5762
03:25:07,840 --> 03:25:13,920
degrees and we use celsius swirsky and

5763
03:25:10,478 --> 03:25:16,159
cucumarus um and together for broad

5764
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:19,639
mites and russet mites

5765
03:25:16,159 --> 03:25:23,920
um and um you know a person millis or

5766
03:25:19,639 --> 03:25:26,079
californicus or anders andersoni for uh

5767
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:28,799
the spider mites and

5768
03:25:26,079 --> 03:25:31,600
to have a good predator um

5769
03:25:28,799 --> 03:25:33,599
colony on your plants allows you to not

5770
03:25:31,600 --> 03:25:36,159
have to use the sprays

5771
03:25:33,600 --> 03:25:38,238
so and and and usually use like two to

5772
03:25:36,159 --> 03:25:39,920
three times the amount that they

5773
03:25:38,238 --> 03:25:40,879
that they suggest

5774
03:25:39,920 --> 03:25:44,079
to you

5775
03:25:40,879 --> 03:25:46,719
and um and not two to three times as

5776
03:25:44,079 --> 03:25:48,478
often just two to three times the amount

5777
03:25:46,719 --> 03:25:50,799
so you do the heat treatment if you're

5778
03:25:48,478 --> 03:25:53,438
infested in later flower you do the heat

5779
03:25:50,799 --> 03:25:56,559
treatment and then you just bombard your

5780
03:25:53,439 --> 03:25:59,439
room with predators and hopefully you

5781
03:25:56,559 --> 03:26:01,600
know you've got enough enough time

5782
03:25:59,439 --> 03:26:03,200
that um the predators will eat all the

5783
03:26:01,600 --> 03:26:05,760
rest that's there and then they just

5784
03:26:03,200 --> 03:26:07,760
leave they're not interested in staying

5785
03:26:05,760 --> 03:26:10,000
on your plants they don't colonize on

5786
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:12,079
the plants they don't breed on cannabis

5787
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:14,079
plants they're just going in and they're

5788
03:26:12,079 --> 03:26:16,799
eating so a lot of people worry about oh

5789
03:26:14,079 --> 03:26:19,200
geez my smoking predator is no they're

5790
03:26:16,799 --> 03:26:21,679
eating and then they're leaving

5791
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:24,239
yeah so that's just really helpful and

5792
03:26:21,680 --> 03:26:27,040
we love the use of predators and in

5793
03:26:24,238 --> 03:26:29,279
vegetative times if there's an outbreak

5794
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:32,080
we love botanical washes

5795
03:26:29,279 --> 03:26:35,279
and not utilizing you know essential

5796
03:26:32,079 --> 03:26:37,439
oils or volatile oils and heavy amounts

5797
03:26:35,279 --> 03:26:40,000
you know i don't really like my skin

5798
03:26:37,439 --> 03:26:40,960
covered in heavy oil neither do the

5799
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:43,200
leaves

5800
03:26:40,959 --> 03:26:45,519
but if you want to you know wash them

5801
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:49,680
you can take fresh neem leaf

5802
03:26:45,520 --> 03:26:53,040
and a fresh rosemary or fresh you know

5803
03:26:49,680 --> 03:26:55,279
eucalyptus or fresh lavender and make a

5804
03:26:53,040 --> 03:26:57,279
nice tea brew and steep it with

5805
03:26:55,279 --> 03:27:00,319
horsetail or with another herb that you

5806
03:26:57,279 --> 03:27:03,120
want and make it a botanical wash that

5807
03:27:00,318 --> 03:27:05,680
isn't good for pathogens it's healthy

5808
03:27:03,120 --> 03:27:07,120
for beneficials and it's also healthy

5809
03:27:05,680 --> 03:27:09,359
for the flowers

5810
03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:12,079
and literally like washing the plants

5811
03:27:09,359 --> 03:27:14,800
down it's they just love it and that's a

5812
03:27:12,079 --> 03:27:16,879
really good preventative as well and

5813
03:27:14,799 --> 03:27:18,559
also to help get rid of an infestation

5814
03:27:16,879 --> 03:27:20,159
you want to follow that up then with

5815
03:27:18,559 --> 03:27:22,478
predators

5816
03:27:20,159 --> 03:27:25,039
yeah sounds like a pretty good little uh

5817
03:27:22,478 --> 03:27:26,799
ipm regime there so

5818
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:28,479
last question before we hit the little

5819
03:27:26,799 --> 03:27:29,438
short fire ones at the end

5820
03:27:28,478 --> 03:27:30,879
you're gonna have to forgive me i'm

5821
03:27:29,439 --> 03:27:32,079
gonna mispronounce the name but i have a

5822
03:27:30,879 --> 03:27:33,679
feeling you guys will know exactly what

5823
03:27:32,079 --> 03:27:35,760
i'm talking about one of our viewers

5824
03:27:33,680 --> 03:27:38,960
wanted to know what are your thoughts on

5825
03:27:35,760 --> 03:27:41,600
the sealed wallopini greenhouses is that

5826
03:27:38,959 --> 03:27:42,959
how you say it walopini i don't know

5827
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:44,720
wally peony

5828
03:27:42,959 --> 03:27:46,639
uh that's what we have on our property

5829
03:27:44,719 --> 03:27:48,639
when you say sealed

5830
03:27:46,639 --> 03:27:51,119
you know um

5831
03:27:48,639 --> 03:27:53,599
i you know we like to have a flow

5832
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:57,200
through design because

5833
03:27:53,600 --> 03:27:59,359
the the humidity stays nice stable it's

5834
03:27:57,200 --> 03:28:02,079
stable you know the temperatures are

5835
03:27:59,359 --> 03:28:04,000
more stable the plants love it

5836
03:28:02,079 --> 03:28:06,799
everything just grows

5837
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:08,959
yeah it's a huge biological sink and we

5838
03:28:06,799 --> 03:28:11,119
have them now all over so we've been

5839
03:28:08,959 --> 03:28:13,278
working with wally peonies for a long

5840
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:15,520
time inspired people other people to do

5841
03:28:13,279 --> 03:28:17,040
it and we have lots of designs that

5842
03:28:15,520 --> 03:28:18,960
we've just freed up and given out to

5843
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:20,960
people we've been working on it anytime

5844
03:28:18,959 --> 03:28:22,959
we do consultations we always talk to

5845
03:28:20,959 --> 03:28:24,719
people about you know wally peonies and

5846
03:28:22,959 --> 03:28:27,278
bringing that in and then you're

5847
03:28:24,719 --> 03:28:29,358
utilizing all beneficial things you're

5848
03:28:27,279 --> 03:28:31,680
utilizing the geothermal from the earth

5849
03:28:29,359 --> 03:28:33,200
and then you're utilizing the heat

5850
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:35,840
you know from the sun

5851
03:28:33,200 --> 03:28:40,079
and that's stability it's awesome

5852
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:42,238
it's a great way to grow yeah fantastic

5853
03:28:40,079 --> 03:28:43,439
so we're on to the last little quickfire

5854
03:28:42,238 --> 03:28:45,520
questions

5855
03:28:43,439 --> 03:28:46,960
um so the first one we'll probably

5856
03:28:45,520 --> 03:28:49,760
probably get two answers here what's

5857
03:28:46,959 --> 03:28:49,759
your favorite strain

5858
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:52,879
uh

5859
03:28:51,439 --> 03:28:54,000
well i'm gonna have to say the

5860
03:28:52,879 --> 03:28:54,959
homesteader

5861
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:56,398
because that's what we're doing right

5862
03:28:54,959 --> 03:28:57,839
now and it's been really amazing to me

5863
03:28:56,398 --> 03:28:59,599
and i've been only wanting to smoke it

5864
03:28:57,840 --> 03:29:02,478
so i'm gonna go with the homesteader and

5865
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:04,640
that's got its roots in um

5866
03:29:02,478 --> 03:29:07,119

5872
03:29:17,680 --> 03:29:22,639
say homesteader yep they're so uplifting

5873
03:29:21,120 --> 03:29:24,239
that's great that's a good answer just

5874
03:29:22,639 --> 03:29:26,159
out of curiosity

5875
03:29:24,238 --> 03:29:28,478
that jack herrera that was used in the

5876
03:29:26,159 --> 03:29:30,318
zelly's is that that famous one that

5877
03:29:28,478 --> 03:29:31,039
goes around or just a just a different

5878
03:29:30,318 --> 03:29:34,000
one

5879
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:36,239
oh it absolutely is clone that came from

5880
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:37,840
oregon yeah it came from eugene it's

5881
03:29:36,238 --> 03:29:40,238
really special one of the one of the

5882
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:42,799
best ones so that was really special and

5883
03:29:40,238 --> 03:29:45,279
now it's in a lot of our genetics so

5884
03:29:42,799 --> 03:29:47,199
that was a really wonderful mother that

5885
03:29:45,279 --> 03:29:48,800
we got

5886
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:49,520
and super lemonades are a big part of

5887
03:29:48,799 --> 03:29:52,000
our

5888
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:53,760
um genetics and we like that lemon

5889
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:55,600
mm-hmm yeah see that's great because

5890
03:29:53,760 --> 03:29:57,520
those are like two cut species or two

5891
03:29:55,600 --> 03:29:59,840
strains i should say specifically where

5892
03:29:57,520 --> 03:30:01,200
if you get that cut that's on the money

5893
03:29:59,840 --> 03:30:02,880
you know like it's just it's almost

5894
03:30:01,200 --> 03:30:05,359
unbeatable isn't it

5895
03:30:02,879 --> 03:30:07,759
yeah i like it a lot it's so true or

5896
03:30:05,359 --> 03:30:09,279
when you find that one seed too that

5897
03:30:07,760 --> 03:30:11,359
you're just like whoa this plant is

5898
03:30:09,279 --> 03:30:13,760
amazing you just want to be able to

5899
03:30:11,359 --> 03:30:15,439
propagate it yeah finished outdoors for

5900
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:18,159
us really nicely

5901
03:30:15,439 --> 03:30:19,840
yeah so a slightly you know derivative

5902
03:30:18,159 --> 03:30:23,200
question instead of favorite strain

5903
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:23,200
what's your favorite land race

5904
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:27,920
acapulco gold

5905
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:31,040
i'm going to go with acapulco gold too

5906
03:30:27,920 --> 03:30:32,879
which has roots in the in the um

5907
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:34,800
the jack herrera although

5908
03:30:32,879 --> 03:30:36,959
the chocolate thai i'll go with

5909
03:30:34,799 --> 03:30:38,639
chocolate thai since she went with them

5910
03:30:36,959 --> 03:30:40,879
yeah and i could go with chocolate type

5911
03:30:38,639 --> 03:30:42,318
second

5912
03:30:40,879 --> 03:30:45,559
i should just both switch to chocolate

5913
03:30:42,318 --> 03:30:45,559
tart now

5914
03:30:46,079 --> 03:30:49,439
that's good did you guys

5915
03:30:47,680 --> 03:30:50,960
sorry i was gonna say did you guys see

5916
03:30:49,439 --> 03:30:53,840
any of the uh

5917
03:30:50,959 --> 03:30:54,879
the pearl tie that body had

5918
03:30:53,840 --> 03:30:57,600
no

5919
03:30:54,879 --> 03:30:59,759
i hadn't seen it that was but we were

5920
03:30:57,600 --> 03:31:02,960
oh we had brought down some of his uh

5921
03:30:59,760 --> 03:31:04,559
thai strains uh to jamaica uh okay yes

5922
03:31:02,959 --> 03:31:07,839
he would have seen him there anyway

5923
03:31:04,559 --> 03:31:09,119
and the pakistani chitral

5924
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:10,880
yeah that's another good one which

5925
03:31:09,120 --> 03:31:12,160
probably would have done well in jamaica

5926
03:31:10,879 --> 03:31:14,559
as well wouldn't it because they they

5927
03:31:12,159 --> 03:31:16,559
flower a little later don't they

5928
03:31:14,559 --> 03:31:18,238
yeah we brought that down so that's

5929
03:31:16,559 --> 03:31:20,079
that's going down there

5930
03:31:18,238 --> 03:31:21,840
so we'll see how they go brought down to

5931
03:31:20,079 --> 03:31:23,039
so many different types of varieties

5932
03:31:21,840 --> 03:31:26,719
we'll see what what comes up we're

5933
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:28,479
excited to see what happens out of it so

5934
03:31:26,719 --> 03:31:30,318

5936
03:31:30,318 --> 03:31:33,359
excited to pop next

5937
03:31:34,959 --> 03:31:39,119

yeah a lot of the purifiers

5962
03:32:30,478 --> 03:32:34,159
family genetics not grass family

5963
03:32:32,398 --> 03:32:35,519
genetics that's gonna be a top one

5964
03:32:34,159 --> 03:32:37,119

breeders out there that are just now

5968
03:32:43,200 --> 03:32:47,680
stepping in you know we've been trading

5969
03:32:45,200 --> 03:32:50,000
seeds for three decades now we've all

5970
03:32:47,680 --> 03:32:51,600
been working together and if we weren't

5971
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:54,000
working directly with the person then

5972
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:56,079
indirectly we were working with them and

5973
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:58,079
now it's like all of everybody's work

5974
03:32:56,079 --> 03:33:01,439
that they're able to put forward and

5975
03:32:58,079 --> 03:33:04,159
aficionado means amazing yes

going keep going

5978
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:10,478
we already said spliff he has some

5979
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:13,279
really amazing strengths yeah

5980
03:33:10,478 --> 03:33:16,318
and i mean i know that yeah evolved

5981
03:33:13,279 --> 03:33:18,640
evolved oregon i mean he's been amazing

5982
03:33:16,318 --> 03:33:21,359
lion tree lion tree farms they're really

5983
03:33:18,639 --> 03:33:24,478
doing awesome stuff with th cv

5984
03:33:21,359 --> 03:33:26,238
lion paw he's also working with like cbg

5985
03:33:24,478 --> 03:33:28,398
people are starting to specialize in

5986
03:33:26,238 --> 03:33:30,639
different like cannabinoids and then you

5987
03:33:28,398 --> 03:33:32,079
want to make sure to get those

5988
03:33:30,639 --> 03:33:34,719
so then you can interbreed because

5989
03:33:32,079 --> 03:33:37,920
they've got like really super high cbg

5990
03:33:34,719 --> 03:33:38,959
or thcv house of harlequin yeah house of

5991
03:33:37,920 --> 03:33:41,680
harlequin

5992
03:33:38,959 --> 03:33:43,759
wade laughter big ups to wade laughter

5993
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:47,040
thank you wade for bringing forth all

5994
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:49,359
the harlequin what an amazing humble

5995
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:51,840
beautiful person

5996
03:33:49,359 --> 03:33:53,680
i mean he is of the earth you know if

5997
03:33:51,840 --> 03:33:55,520
anybody gets to grow some of his strains

5998
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:58,800
were only lucky

5999
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:59,760
yeah well what a testament

6000
03:33:58,799 --> 03:34:01,358
so

6001
03:33:59,760 --> 03:34:02,159
moving on to the next little question

6002
03:34:01,359 --> 03:34:03,359
though

6003
03:34:02,159 --> 03:34:05,680
kind of similar to the first one but you

6004
03:34:03,359 --> 03:34:07,680
get a few choices desert island strains

6005
03:34:05,680 --> 03:34:08,960
so i'll let you take two i find two's a

6006
03:34:07,680 --> 03:34:10,238
good number because everyone wants three

6007
03:34:08,959 --> 03:34:13,679
so it makes it that little bit harder

6008
03:34:10,238 --> 03:34:16,000
you can only take two strains with you

6009
03:34:13,680 --> 03:34:16,000
oh

6010
03:34:16,318 --> 03:34:19,600
two strains with you

6011
03:34:19,840 --> 03:34:22,880
that's all you got forever

6012
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:28,160
i would probably take um

6013
03:34:25,279 --> 03:34:30,000
the healer is the seed that uh a strain

6014
03:34:28,159 --> 03:34:32,000
that we've that we've created i think i

6015
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:34,478
would go with the healer that is you

6016
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:36,559
know the the half cbd half

6017
03:34:34,478 --> 03:34:37,840
um yeah they're beautiful one to one i

6018
03:34:36,559 --> 03:34:39,600
would do that because it's really good

6019
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:41,520
if you don't feel good so that one to

6020
03:34:39,600 --> 03:34:43,120
one is super awesome if you're having a

6021
03:34:41,520 --> 03:34:44,960
hard day on the island you know if

6022
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:47,120
you're feeling like wow

6023
03:34:44,959 --> 03:34:49,519
this day is hard i got sunburned i'm

6024
03:34:47,120 --> 03:34:51,520
gonna go for the one to one i'll take

6025
03:34:49,520 --> 03:34:53,840
like a gold i'll take like a golden

6026
03:34:51,520 --> 03:34:55,600
pineapple

6027
03:34:53,840 --> 03:34:57,680
like i think i would go with a gold i

6028
03:34:55,600 --> 03:34:58,880
think i would go with an acapulco gold

6029
03:34:57,680 --> 03:35:01,359
i think i'm going to go with a healer

6030
03:34:58,879 --> 03:35:03,519
and an acapulco gold so a one-to-one

6031
03:35:01,359 --> 03:35:06,880
which is an ac dc cross with like a

6032
03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:09,600
really awesome a40 afghu

6033
03:35:06,879 --> 03:35:11,278
type super high marker

6034
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:13,120
because that's the reason why we created

6035
03:35:11,279 --> 03:35:14,880
it

6036
03:35:13,120 --> 03:35:16,319
so i'm gonna take the homesteader and

6037
03:35:14,879 --> 03:35:20,159
the healer because after i'm done

6038
03:35:16,318 --> 03:35:24,359
homesteading i need to do some healing

6039
03:35:20,159 --> 03:35:24,359
that's good telling a story

6040
03:35:24,879 --> 03:35:27,920
all right

6041
03:35:25,760 --> 03:35:29,760
sorry the next one is

6042
03:35:27,920 --> 03:35:30,960
as long as there's lots of it there has

6043
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:33,439
to be a lot

6044
03:35:30,959 --> 03:35:36,238
right yeah yeah infinite infinite okay

6045
03:35:33,439 --> 03:35:38,030
there's plenty okay that's that matters

6046
03:35:36,238 --> 03:35:41,119
quantity probably was the first question

6047
03:35:38,030 --> 03:35:42,319
[Laughter]

6048
03:35:41,120 --> 03:35:44,160
so

6049
03:35:42,318 --> 03:35:46,159
the flavors flavor of the month so to

6050
03:35:44,159 --> 03:35:47,680
speak tends to be very much a cyclical

6051
03:35:46,159 --> 03:35:50,639
thing what's your prediction for the

6052
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:52,559
next big flavor of the month

6053
03:35:50,639 --> 03:35:54,879
i think it might be the hemp i think the

6054
03:35:52,559 --> 03:35:57,439
flavor of the month is going to be a

6055
03:35:54,879 --> 03:35:59,759
super high the cherries are coming on

6056
03:35:57,439 --> 03:36:03,040
strong yep and i think that's not just

6057
03:35:59,760 --> 03:36:06,000
cherry wine like there's a lot of cherry

6058
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:08,720
sherberts and puffs and cherried [ __ ]

6059
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:12,398
diesels it's amazing the the the sour

6060
03:36:08,719 --> 03:36:15,039
diesel and the and the chem dog and

6061
03:36:12,398 --> 03:36:19,199
and the og i mean

6062
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:22,160
they're so gnarly and so good still and

6063
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:24,880
it's like you can like have all the new

6064
03:36:22,159 --> 03:36:26,959
varieties and i mean the cookies

6065
03:36:24,879 --> 03:36:29,519
have taken over you know in a lot of

6066
03:36:26,959 --> 03:36:31,759
ways there's like a certain spice

6067
03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:33,279
that you get from that that people like

6068
03:36:31,760 --> 03:36:34,960
a lot um

6069
03:36:33,279 --> 03:36:37,040
but um

6070
03:36:34,959 --> 03:36:40,478
you know i think that people are gonna

6071
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:42,880
go for the more lemony uplifting stuff

6072
03:36:40,478 --> 03:36:44,639
personally coming up here in the future

6073
03:36:42,879 --> 03:36:46,559
i think that we're sees an uprising the

6074
03:36:44,639 --> 03:36:47,840
grapefruits too i think that the

6075
03:36:46,559 --> 03:36:49,439
grapefruit strains are going to start

6076
03:36:47,840 --> 03:36:51,439
going through the roof but i also think

6077
03:36:49,439 --> 03:36:55,120
they're going to see a huge surge in

6078
03:36:51,439 --> 03:36:56,880
really low thc and super high cbd full

6079
03:36:55,120 --> 03:36:58,960
spectrum cannabinoids and that will be

6080
03:36:56,879 --> 03:37:01,679
in like the the hemp work that has been

6081
03:36:58,959 --> 03:37:04,079
done in colorado and beyond

6082
03:37:01,680 --> 03:37:05,920
yeah cool i like those predictions

6083
03:37:04,079 --> 03:37:08,079
uh one other thing is there's there's

6084
03:37:05,920 --> 03:37:10,559
definitely gonna be like new

6085
03:37:08,079 --> 03:37:12,559
cannabinoids that we learn about so it's

6086
03:37:10,559 --> 03:37:14,639
gonna be a lot about learning those

6087
03:37:12,559 --> 03:37:17,119
cannabinoids and i think the strains

6088
03:37:14,639 --> 03:37:19,439
there's going to be a lot of specific

6089
03:37:17,120 --> 03:37:22,079
strains for cannabinoids that's going to

6090
03:37:19,439 --> 03:37:24,079
be the future

6091
03:37:22,079 --> 03:37:25,840
that's a that's a that's one i kind of

6092
03:37:24,079 --> 03:37:26,879
thought about myself actually

6093
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:29,359
so

6094
03:37:26,879 --> 03:37:32,159
lucky last one here we go if you could

6095
03:37:29,359 --> 03:37:33,760
go back to one place in time anywhere

6096
03:37:32,159 --> 03:37:36,238
where would you go and what seeds would

6097
03:37:33,760 --> 03:37:36,238
you collect

6098
03:37:40,559 --> 03:37:46,238
i think i would have gone back to 1982

6099
03:37:44,398 --> 03:37:47,920
in south africa and i would have gotten

6100
03:37:46,238 --> 03:37:50,559
the durbin poison

6101
03:37:47,920 --> 03:37:52,719
darn it i missed out

6102
03:37:50,559 --> 03:37:54,000
have you tried a good durban that like

6103
03:37:52,719 --> 03:37:55,039
you know and it's won you over type of

6104
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:57,120
thing

6105
03:37:55,040 --> 03:37:59,200
well we've we've got somebody in south

6106
03:37:57,120 --> 03:38:01,279
africa that has sent us seeds that he's

6107
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:02,800
saying is definitely the best but i've

6108
03:38:01,279 --> 03:38:05,760
yet to see

6109
03:38:02,799 --> 03:38:06,639
the durbin that i smoked in the 80s that

6110
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:08,960
to me

6111
03:38:06,639 --> 03:38:12,000
what i had seen was a beautiful durban

6112
03:38:08,959 --> 03:38:14,719
poison i have not seen that since then

6113
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:18,478
so yeah i think i would definitely like

6114
03:38:14,719 --> 03:38:18,478
to go back like

6115
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:25,200
pre-industrial revolution probably mid

6116
03:38:22,799 --> 03:38:27,599
set you know anything before

6117
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:29,840
you know eighteen hundreds maybe let's

6118
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:33,199
say a thousand years ago and and i'd

6119
03:38:29,840 --> 03:38:36,079
like to go into the pygmies pygmy tribes

6120
03:38:33,199 --> 03:38:39,279
and smoke pygmy weed and build like

6121
03:38:36,079 --> 03:38:41,039
pygmy bridges and and villages that's

6122
03:38:39,279 --> 03:38:43,120
what i'd want to do and their rhythms

6123
03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:46,239
they're i don't want to play drums

6124
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:47,920
and sing with pygmies and grow weed in

6125
03:38:46,238 --> 03:38:49,920
the jungle in the middle of africa

6126
03:38:47,920 --> 03:38:52,159
that's a good answer josh

6127
03:38:49,920 --> 03:38:54,879
that's the best answer i've ever heard

6128
03:38:52,159 --> 03:38:57,039
yeah yeah i think that one's really good

6129
03:38:54,879 --> 03:38:58,799
that's great all righty well i think

6130
03:38:57,040 --> 03:39:00,800
that one might bring us to the end of
