00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:41,519

Maple Leaf indicia I am testing out some

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,759
fenos that my friend and I made and uh

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,839
yeah just kind of going through

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,759
different Afghans and seeing what I

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,320
think I've been doing this uh double

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,599
limes number 10 clone that I got back

45
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:05,718
from skunk Tech from out of the seed was

46
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,239
a super lime leaning one but it's got a

47
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,239
little bit of I don't know it's real the

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,400
sour dub gives it a little bit of an

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:18,159
extra kick and uh I got the I just

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,760
busted out the old old bong my big tall

51
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,318
bong got it Crystal Clean it looked like

52
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,799
it was fresh out of the head shop and

53
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:27,159
it's it's hitting it's definitely the

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,840
goods right now that's what I've been

55
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,359
smoking

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,080
on beautiful stuff beautiful stuff well

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,200
let's jump into it so our first story

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,800
for today let's chat about our good

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,919
friend burner burner recently released

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,400
an interesting quote quote where he

61
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,639
stated I make $0 from weed it's all

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,599
music and clothing all that [Â __Â ] he

63
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,158
specifically quoted that given cannabis

64
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,839
is not federally legal you cannot make

65
00:02:54,158 --> 00:03:00,359
proper money off it however Brands like

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,280
clothing and wrap is legal

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,480
this begs the

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,120
question what do we think about that is

69
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,119
that is that possible do we think

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,360
burner's lying is it even remotely

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,360
possible cookies is not making

72
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,399
money uh you

73
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,560
know I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,719
to assume that people are making more

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,039
money than they would like to let on but

76
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,120
uh I've seen that before for sure uh

77
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,438
it's definitely something that happens

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,599
but at the same time

79
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:37,598
um you know I wouldn't be surprised if

80
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,238
most people who

81
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,158
are as close to profitable as they could

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,039
get in the legal industry right now it's

83
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:48,000
almost like being able to stay afloat is

84
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,639
the closest thing for a lot of a lot of

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,239
operations I think if you can like

86
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,518
upgrade your lights or you can expand to

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,480
a new whatever it is whether it's a new

88
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,039
property or something like that like I

89
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,840
would consider that to be pretty

90
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:07,798
profitable right now to not just be

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,959
losing money or or you know going under

92
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,599
or even like just barely breaking even

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,918
um it's really you know it'd be hard to

94
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:22,639
know but um like I said it's definitely

95
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:25,519
not unheard of too to downplay your

96
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,519
success as well you know in the in the

97
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,680
business so I

98
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,120
don't I actually have some Rel

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,759
relatively deep thoughts on that one and

100
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,478
we could maybe go back because I do

101
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
think what he's saying is probably true

102
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,399
if you go back to like the very

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,038
beginning of cookie um he was sort of

104
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,439
hired as like the hype man right because

105
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:47,038
he had a bunch of like hip-hop

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,439
connections and he was going to be sort

107
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,038
of like the face of cookie if you will

108
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,478
even back with like the original group

109
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:54,719
of guys that like were starting to

110
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,319
popularize it right and so one of the

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,680
things they did was like for him doing

112
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,680
that he got to be able to have a

113
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,120
clothing company right interesting thing

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,680
about a clothing company is that's just

115
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,959
a normal business so you don't get taxed

116
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,720
like crazy with like you don't have like

117
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,478
the 280e and all the restrictions that

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
can of people have you just have a

119
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,240
clothing company so like if you're

120
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,879
selling $180 t-shirts made in and or

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,000
sweatshirts and stuff made in China like

122
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,038
that's pretty

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,879
profitable you know so I bet the

124
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,519
clothing part is probably more

125
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,439
profitable than the weed because it's

126
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,279
way less taxed

127
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,879
you know like having a clothing company

128
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,079
there's no special fees most cannabis

129
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,719
people you have to pay for the right to

130
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,519
be in the game whether you want to have

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,680
a store you want to have a breeding

132
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,439
facility you want to grow you literally

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,160
you're not getting taxed on your profit

134
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,759
although you get taxed on that too you

135
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,720
get taxed just to enter into the game to

136
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,720
get the license to have the fees to do

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,199
the thing right and the other thing I

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,479
would say about cookie and mean Gan will

139
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,600
probably agree is that like they're not

140
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,879
trying to be like a small local

141
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,840
California thing where like they're not

142
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,800
too concerned with profit yet I don't

143
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,679
think they're concerned with expansion

144
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,800
and I would consider cookie to be one of

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,400
those companies that their whole game

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,960
plan is to get probably bought out by

147
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,478
somebody big and so every new state that

148
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,079
opens whether it's Florida or New York

149
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,240
or New Jersey or whatever they're

150
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,079
opening Flagship stores in those new

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,680
spots

152
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,318
and that costs loot so they're probably

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,439
more in like the investment expansion

154
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,960
mode than they're in in like the like uh

155
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,918
what's the best way to put it like you

156
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,799
know stacking cash

157
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,959
mode and it's also possible although I

158
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,800
don't know anything like personally a

159
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,478
lot of like legitimate cannabis people

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,918
have been hired as sort of like the

161
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,800
front man for like bigger companies and

162
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,519
like they don't own nearly as much as

163
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,879
they

164
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,038
say you know so it's like I don't I

165
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,479
wouldn't be surprised if cookie isn't

166
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,639
isn't making money because they're

167
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:15,598
expanding so fast that they're probably

168
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:19,319
more like borrowing money to

169
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,360
expand right so you know he probably

170
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,879
does make more money off his albums and

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,720
his clothes because those are lightly

172
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,599
taxed and it goes directly to him I bet

173
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,080
there's a lot of hands in the cookie jar

174
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:33,598
if you will of people that need to get

175
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,359
paid you know where there's probably not

176
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,560
a lot of hands in his music or in his

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
clothing

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,120
thing for sure yeah yeah I I remember

179
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,198
when I was a when I was a kid people

180
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,360
used to say you know the The Grateful

181
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,400
Dead don't make money from the shows and

182
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,680
the m music they make money from the

183
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,638
t-shirts and the stickers you know

184
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,959
because it is really like that is

185
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,960
something where you're like okay this

186
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,198
little bit of money to make basically

187
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,198
these little things and then because of

188
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,720
The Branding there were a lot of money

189
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,840
you're making this whatever 25 cent

190
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,479
sticker and it's $5 and they're selling

191
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,598
them everywhere and everybody has one A

192
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,399
lot of people who can't you know like I

193
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,959
even experienced that myself a little

194
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,279
bit with like having booths at shows a

195
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,038
lot of people would come who could buy

196
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,679
the T-shirt but they couldn't buy the

197
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,158
packs of seeds or they could buy the the

198
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,280
sticker and they couldn't Buy the

199
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,719
T-shirt and so like it's definitely like

200
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,638
having something that's more accessible

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,560
is good and in the world of of weed too

202
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,680
you can go ahead and box up the shirts

203
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,000
and you can sell them anywhere and it

204
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,158
has been a really undeniably super

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,440
popular brand as far as uh merchandising

206
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,759
because I mean you can go pretty much

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,519
anywhere and see somebody with a cookies

208
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,200
t-shirt you can look on TV and you'll

209
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,959
see oh there's a guy right there on this

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,440
show he's got wearing a cookies hat or

211
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,639
whatever it is so they did do well with

212
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,279
that it's all a was a really interesting

213
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,600
thing to watch because um I actually

214
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,439
have buddies who like burner when he

215
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,079
first started making music he started

216
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,720
recording at my friend's studio in in

217
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,120
the bay at solidarity records and I

218
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,320
remember I got the calendar from my

219
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
buddies and it's like on this month is

220
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,720
this friend of mine this is this month

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,278
is this friend of mine and then a guy I

222
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,240
don't know and a guy I'm like who's this

223
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,958
dude you know and uh and they were like

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,919
oh it's this new dude burner you know

225
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,119
he's he's got he's he's got popping a

226
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,360
little bit in the Bay Area and

227
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,278
everything and that was right around the

228
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,399
time when people started to hear about

229
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,600
cookies people started hearing about

230
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,360
burner so it's interesting because now

231
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,120
in like retrospect everybody looks at it

232
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,399
and goes oh they got the rapper and he

233
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,200
popularized the weed and I watched it as

234
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,600
like more like I think the weed

235
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,440
popularized the rapper because he was

236
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,200
the guy who had it and it kind of was

237
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,120
like going feeding like a feedback loop

238
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
to where you know he met people and he's

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,000
like look at this and everybody's like

240
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,599
whoa so when he started his rap career

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,639
and he met people like Whiz Khalifa and

242
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,159
different people he he was the one with

243
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,120
that bay weed where those guys were like

244
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,078
damn what is this and they had the

245
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,120
really good OG like you know like not so

246
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,958
knows that's an excellent point it was

247
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,639
probably half half music and half cookie

248
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,399
promotion and it's still that way like

249
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,559
even when when he does stuff in the bay

250
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,799
or they do events and stuff like that

251
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,039
he's always when he's whenever he's like

252
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,559
whenever he's performing it's always he

253
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,399
brings the cookie van you know and and

254
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,879
the and this and the that and it's all

255
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,919
promoted and they they do a good job of

256
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,679
cross

257
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:42,159
promotion you know but I don't I

258
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:44,519
basically think in general I don't know

259
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,439
if any big cannabis companies are making

260
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,078
money yet I don't think so I think

261
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,680
staying alive is a big win right now I

262
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,278
think they're burning investor money in

263
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,479
the hopes that when they really when the

264
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,519
money really starts to come in all that

265
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,039
investor money bought them market share

266
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,039
but it's probably not profitable right

267
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,319
now you know the other thing that's

268
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,759
interesting about cookie is that as far

269
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,519
as I'm aware and I don't know if this is

270
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,639
true in other states but it's definitely

271
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,159
true in California is they don't

272
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,879
actually touch

273
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,159
weed like all of the weed that they get

274
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:23,120
is third-party contracts and stuff

275
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:25,600
they're a clothing company and a

276
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,240
store yeah and this plays into the

277
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,320
follow-up question I was going to ask

278
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,278
which is that given they do have this B

279
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,000
business model of Outsourcing the

280
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,720
Productions to other facilities other

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,440
producers could it possibly be that that

282
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
accounts for a part of why their

283
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,720
profitability is down and as an

284
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,439
extension of that idea to what degree

285
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,360
does this statement apply to small

286
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,760
businesses do you think that it is

287
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,200
possible to still be a small profitable

288
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,159
dispensary

289
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,079
producer

290
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,879
I I would say probably that the only way

291
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:01,319
to be profitable is to be small

292
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,399
I think if you're big right now you're

293
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,600
burning investor money I don't know What

294
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,120
U Mean jeene thinks but I have not heard

295
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,879
of anybody raking in cash that's huge um

296
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,560
they're almost all surviving off

297
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,240
infusions I mean in fact if I'm not

298
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,078
mistaken I think cookie and their in

299
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,399
their original investors just got into a

300
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,799
fight over the last round of investment

301
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
that they all brought

302
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,599
in you know um and because they're

303
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,360
trying to fund a bunch of new businesses

304
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,120
and new States

305
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,879
and new stores and all that and that

306
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,679
cost money you

307
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:42,480
know yeah I mean to me I I I agree like

308
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,439
I've if I if somebody want like wanted

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,039
to start doing weed stuff and they're

310
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,040
already doing some weed stuff but they

311
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:52,319
were like where's you know where can you

312
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:55,399
get in and whatever like I I have never

313
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,639
felt like you

314
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,839
would never felt like having huge

315
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,919
overhead and big ambition and doing all

316
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,600
that stuff is like the more easy win

317
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,439
like we have huge investors and we're

318
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,440
going to do all this stuff I've always

319
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,160
looked at it like you know especially

320
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,880
now I think somebody who has just um

321
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,919
something small that they can really

322
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,240
keep the quality control way up on to

323
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,559
the point where people who get it can

324
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,320
really like it really resonates with

325
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,719
them where they they get it and they go

326
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,399
oh this is really what I want to get

327
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,560
again and then you can build that

328
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,480
organically and then maybe eventually

329
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,638
you could turn it into a bigger brand I

330
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,480
feel like that's more practical um I

331
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,079
think

332
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,240
uh there's very few people who could

333
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:46,559
pull off what like what it what it

334
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
appears that cookies the brand is able

335
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,078
to do regardless of whether or not those

336
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,159
Optics are accurate and all that qu

337
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:58,838
those questions but I think um you know

338
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:01,319
I don't think that that is an easy thing

339
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:04,199
to do just in general from the logistics

340
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,759
of it and the position in the market and

341
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,240
everything just the way everything is

342
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,480
it's crazy but the big big big brand

343
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,399
right

344
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,278
now uh the couple of them are the ones

345
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,198
who are actually taking really pretty

346
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,120
weed and they're actually spraying it

347
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:23,198
with how whatever kind of flavors and

348
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,039
it's all fake so you can get hazelnut

349
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:29,719
macchiato you can get fro Loops you can

350
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,240
get lemon lime you can get

351
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,720
watermelon bubbly whatever the hell it

352
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,680
is and it's all fake but the weed was

353
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
pretty good weed when it started and

354
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,838
then there well don't get me wrong

355
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,839
sometimes it's horrible weed when they

356
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,720
started but the very biggest of it is

357
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,880
where it's like actually like pretty

358
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,320
like Oreos or Lemon Cherry gelato or

359
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,240
whatever it is and then they take it and

360
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,720
they have a menu and it's like

361
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,919
watermelon grape you know like I said

362
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,680
hazelnut whatever it is and you smell it

363
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,159
and you go whoa

364
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,799
it smells exactly like the thing that's

365
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,838
crazy and that's always been crazy as a

366
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,799
breeder when someone says this is grape

367
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
and it smells like grape this is lemon

368
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,838
and you're like oh it actually smells

369
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,159
like lemon peel I thought you were going

370
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,560
to give me something that smelled like

371
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,879
like Jack or train wreck and I'd say no

372
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,399
it just smells like those but then you

373
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,439
smell it really smells like lemon peel

374
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,078
you go whoa that's amazing but what

375
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,639
they're doing now is they've realized

376
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,078
that that is really impressive and the

377
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,799
way to get around it is by just doing

378
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:33,719
that so the guys who are making huge

379
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,799
amounts of money right now are the guys

380
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,040
who are basically making fake wheat and

381
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,078
it's the equivalent of having like you

382
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,958
know you go somewhere and you go oh okay

383
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,919
well that's cool that's that's um you

384
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,359
know that's orange soda and it's

385
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,519
sparkling water with orange squeezed in

386
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,759
it like yeah cool but when somebody's

387
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,919
got corn syrup and artificial orange

388
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,039
color and artificial orange flavor and

389
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,439
you put that together and you have an

390
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:04,078
actual bottle of soda that's like that's

391
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,199
what people go crazy over and both

392
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,039
things are on the market but you can

393
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,879
sell the hell out of this new fake stuff

394
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,519
and that funny

395
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:16,480
enough people figured out that that was

396
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:19,519
the next thing to go okay this is a way

397
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,039
to have success that is is outside of

398
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,240
what people had thought of doing and

399
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,480
that to me was just mindblowing I was

400
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,519
like are you kidding this was like a

401
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,079
scam that you would do when you were

402
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,639
broke and you had to fake something and

403
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,679
like something that someone would do

404
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,560
back in the 80s or 90s and you'd be like

405
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,439
I got this friend and he did this crazy

406
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,359
[Â __Â ] you know but it's what they're

407
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,319
doing and that's the Big Brand that's

408
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,879
the only thing that's like bigger right

409
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:49,078
now that has more momentum than anybody

410
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,879
is these brands that are doing this and

411
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,559
they have nice packaging and they have a

412
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,360
product where when you open it and you

413
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,559
bought it and it said it was

414
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,480
watermelon oh it's watermelon whereas

415
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,399
breeders are sitting here trying to make

416
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,120
yeah it's like watermelon yeah I can see

417
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,119
it I can see it that's oh that's really

418
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,479
nice these guys are just like no they

419
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,838
put it in this big thing almost like a

420
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,240
oven or refrigerator freeze dryer type

421
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,318
thing a big thing and it basically just

422
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,759
fogs it with all these you know whatever

423
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,599
it is and it turns it into that wheat

424
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:26,078
and that's like the next thing that's

425
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,838
really big and so anyway that's the only

426
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,720
thing that I've seen that has been the

427
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,279
next step of going

428
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,200
oh wow that's even more popular because

429
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,319
a couple of the brands are really

430
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,919
killing it right now especially in New

431
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,200
York and on the east coast and you know

432
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,080
there's like certain whole markets where

433
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,319
that just dominates and the the buds

434
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,519
that they roll in the

435
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,599
thca you know and it looks like a

436
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,918
powdered donut or it looks like whatever

437
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,159
and I just look at it and go it's just a

438
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,840
new kind of Moon Rock basically which

439
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,600
has always been garbage to me but those

440
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:00,079
are those little gimmicks and uh you

441
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,599
know they've managed to do do good off

442
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,480
of that but that's like the new thing

443
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:08,119
that is the big the big thing but you

444
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,960
know um other than that it's like I

445
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,519
don't see getting established and having

446
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,120
a big brand having a big I think it it

447
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,440
would be better to get established and

448
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,959
have something really small and then if

449
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,038
you can get a little bit more people to

450
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,120
appreciate it grow it organically at

451
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,960
this point because it just seems uh it

452
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:31,119
seems so hard to to um you know have any

453
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,319
kind of Market ship at this point nobody

454
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:37,359
wants to admit it and we can all debate

455
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:40,480
on what size it starts at but there is a

456
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:43,158
size upon which at least till this point

457
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,038
everything above that size of grow

458
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:50,159
produces

459
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:52,679
mids right and so what uh he was just

460
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,679
describing is basically in my mind it's

461
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,000
like how do we polish this turd we have

462
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,360
this sea of mids and it's not very

463
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,679
exciting

464
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,279
okay it's not very good weed we've tried

465
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,600
all this different stuff okay like I'm I

466
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,079
I think I'm pretty good at growing weed

467
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,359
now I'm growing Acres now I'm growing

468
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,960
800 lights now I'm growing this or that

469
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,879
and honestly my weed is not that great

470
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,440
okay and so what they're doing in order

471
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,840
to pump that weed from not that great

472
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,038
into something desirable is all the

473
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,480
things that you just heard about roll it

474
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:26,960
in thca roll it in Keith spray it with

475
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,319
fake turps you know get packaging

476
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,120
everything that's making it like not

477
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,439
about the quality of the weed itself

478
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,639
because they don't really have that to

479
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,880
stand on and so what's common now is

480
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,400
like buying weed in in colored myars

481
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,679
where you can't even see what's inside

482
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,840
it until you've already made your

483
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,798
purchase so The

484
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,480
Branding and the and the artwork and

485
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:50,038
this like he's saying the nose when you

486
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,079
open the bag it's all everything but the

487
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,038
weed because the thing that we haven't

488
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,960
figured out yet is we've got more people

489
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,158
have more control and more data than

490
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,558
they ever have and they're getting

491
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:05,360
really really good at growing

492
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:08,639
weight but the quality is going down on

493
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,558
average I would say you know it really

494
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,159
is and so now they're trying to figure

495
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,119
out a way to polish that and to get

496
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,280
excitement onto something about not the

497
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,038
weed because nobody wants to admit that

498
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,839
oh we're blowing this thing up and our

499
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,000
weed is just not that

500
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,359
good it just isn't and so and so that's

501
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,839
the problem with scale right now with

502
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:34,038
anything big okay is that um I mean you

503
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:37,199
know he'll tell you back in the day even

504
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,720
a 10,000 square foot that today is

505
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
considered tiny and legal that was a big

506
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,839
grow in

507
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,360
meno I mean if you were trying to get

508
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,558
away with a quarter acre you know like

509
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,759
you know you probably weren't doing it

510
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,440
all in one spot you probably had a patch

511
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,038
here and a patch there and this and that

512
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,759
and D D D D and you tried to break it up

513
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,440
a little bit and not just make it and so

514
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,440
now with these Mega Farms they've just

515
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,960
flooded it there's just endless amounts

516
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,279
of cheap boo in my opinion you know it's

517
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,000
almost like you know what it reminds me

518
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:11,038
of is uh I call it American

519
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,798
beers because it literally

520
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,960
because can Canada BC Bud was like

521
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:20,278
America's First Taste of like super high

522
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,558
EC grown for weight grown for looks

523
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,798
commercially grown Warehouse weed grown

524
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,798
at scale packaged and sold to be

525
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,558
cheap and I think that's what we've

526
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:32,200
gotten pretty good at legal and a lot of

527
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,038
like the the you know everybody throws

528
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,600
around craft as a term but it's

529
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:38,879
basically just like you know treating

530
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,079
your herb nicely at every stage and then

531
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,799
hoping you get a little something

532
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,158
special at the end that's being lost in

533
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,759
the chase for money at the moment and

534
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,080
there's not really a Discerning or a way

535
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,960
to grade or label it where people can

536
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,558
tell the difference very

537
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,840
easily so a lot of times the best weed

538
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:01,599
gets buried in the sea amids

539
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,240
no that that's such a pertinent point

540
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,359
and for the longest time people have

541
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,880
discussed the idea of who's going to be

542
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,319
the cuse light of cannabis you know

543
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,000
who's going to be the the bulk for the

544
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,399
masses and I guess I wonder is this it

545
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,079
have we reached it is it going to be

546
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,000
that artificial turps is for the masses

547
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,639
and the the craft brew equivalent is

548
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,159
like actual real cannabis with those

549
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,159
legitimate

550
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,240
turs yeah the

551
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,038
I'll just say one thing and then I'll

552
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,599
let homie speak the part that bothers me

553
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,440
the most about all this stuff is that

554
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:40,119
when it comes to flow or say like basic

555
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,480
kinds of hashish we have decades and

556
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,319
Decades of like testing and experience

557
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,798
that shows like good and bad what it

558
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:51,480
does to people right I don't know what

559
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,158
all these artificial turps infused like

560
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,319
he's saying in a cloud a cloud of

561
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,679
artificial whatevers being sprayed on

562
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,399
pounds to infuse them with these

563
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,600
watermelon Tangy gelot like flavors of

564
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,400
different things like that's never been

565
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,359
tested longterm being combusted we don't

566
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,880
know if it's like you remember when

567
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,479
everybody found out that like smoking

568
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,360
dabs when it's when the The Banger is

569
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,798
like 950 degrees is actually

570
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,278
carcinogenic I wouldn't be surprised if

571
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,158
people found out that these like

572
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:27,440
artificially flavored TP weed isn't the

573
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,360
healthiest option compared to just

574
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,120
actual weed

575
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:36,038
yeah crazy you know find out that like

576
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,519
you know it's like uh do you do you

577
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:40,879
remember in the uh in the not the I

578
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,119
guess it was pretty much the original

579
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,360
the original Batman movie when it when

580
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,959
the Joker starts selling all the all the

581
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,759
weird [Â __Â ] and it starts turning

582
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,000
everyone into the Joker because the

583
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,558
weird combinations of chemicals like if

584
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,919
you know about chemistry there's all

585
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,278
this weird stuff where it's like if you

586
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,080
have this thing it's fine with this

587
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:04,240
thing thing and it it seems like natural

588
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:07,720
natural weed it like for whatever reason

589
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,000
there's the good luck of all it produces

590
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,480
hundreds and hundreds of chemicals and

591
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,359
they all they all work good together and

592
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,839
it's not a big deal you know but a lot

593
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,399
of things if you burn several different

594
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,199
chemicals together or heat them up

595
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,519
there's certain reactions and you don't

596
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,319
know what they are and so if people

597
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,918
start doing things with this weird

598
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,918
artificial stuff it's like we don't

599
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,080
really know what all that is going to do

600
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,799
and I'm not like particularly scared but

601
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:38,480
there's potential there where it's like

602
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:40,119
think about it just in recent history

603
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,159
there was all those people that ended up

604
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,798
with lung problems because of the

605
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,240
additives they were putting into the

606
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,839
pens to help with the viscosity and it

607
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
started do you remember you I mean you

608
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,918
know I can't remember exactly what it

609
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,079
was but there was definitely people that

610
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,720
were getting their lungs messed up and

611
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,918
getting medical conditions and it turned

612
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,720
out because they were adding like

613
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,440
vitamin e acetate and this and that d d

614
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,399
d and they had to ban that stuff I mean

615
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,399
I mentioned the Cherry glowing banger

616
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:10,959
but when people first started doing dabs

617
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:13,239
in the modern era all my friends were

618
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,200
dropping their dabs into glowing Cherry

619
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,880
bangers until they found out that a lot

620
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,798
of tpps at those temps produce Cyanide

621
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,278
and Arsenic and other compounds that you

622
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,839
probably don't want to be

623
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:30,200
inhaling you know along with your herbs

624
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:33,079
so um I would not be surprised if

625
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,840
something that makes my weed smell like

626
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,398
watermelon

627
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,319
kiwi isn't the healthiest thing to

628
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:41,678
combust and draw into my lungs on a

629
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,798
regular basis I could be wrong some

630
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,120
people might be just basically using

631
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,480
like air fresheners like the liquid air

632
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,000
freshener [Â __Â ] you put in your car like

633
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,599
you don't really know what it is as soon

634
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,839
as it's an additive you're like well

635
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,199
what's the additive it some of these

636
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,599
could be like good um like Botanical

637
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,440
things that are extracted from real

638
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,158
stuff some of them could even be

639
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,038
cannabis-based tpen like I wouldn't

640
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,080
think it was that bad if someone said oh

641
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,319
I'm going to go ahead and take this

642
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,599
fraction off of like your cherry limeade

643
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,879
and I'm going to go ahead and soak this

644
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,519
weed in it and make pre-rolls out of it

645
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,039
or do whatever like it's like yeah

646
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,759
you're just kind of up in the numbers

647
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,200
and there these different things that

648
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,038
are natural but I also wouldn't be

649
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,440
surprised if there's people who are

650
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,440
literally taking like going oh yeah this

651
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,120
is this we're just going to put [Â __Â ]

652
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,640
Airwick in this pound oh it's crazy now

653
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,639
you know I mean I know people have at

654
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,278
certain times used things that are like

655
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,480
that just to make weed smell like

656
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,038
whatever because people are like well it

657
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,720
smells different and now it has a smell

658
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,359
it's definitely been done in the old

659
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,798
days and I'm sure a lot of this stuff is

660
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,798
just kind of random and not really very

661
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,158
well vetted as far as what it is or

662
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,720
where it's sourced you know even if they

663
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,440
tell you they might tell tell you it's

664
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,480
cannabis derived they might tell you

665
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,240
it's Botanical or it's fruit based or

666
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,679
whatever it is but then it's like yeah

667
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,679
but what are you where where's the

668
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,559
quality control and what is it their

669
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,200
customers are guinea pigs in my opinion

670
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:19,319
that's what they are they're guinea pigs

671
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,440
and since weed has fought so long to

672
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,798
like get a basic amount of respect and

673
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,600
understanding where it's not like this

674
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:28,918
horrible devil thing taking all the

675
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,079
tried andrue tested stuff and setting it

676
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,480
aside for this like new new that's

677
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,359
completely untested and has a bunch of

678
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,880
funk because you're trying to basically

679
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,199
pretty up the fact that you grew a bunch

680
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,960
of bad

681
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,600
weed you know I mean that's like

682
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,079
honestly in in

683
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:49,119
Mendo and I'm not gonna like this is

684
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,558
probably the reason why most people grow

685
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,119
good weed is not only because they like

686
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:57,278
to good weed but because they wanted the

687
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,398
broker to be like yes I like this I'm

688
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,159
going to take it off off you so like if

689
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:02,558
you did a really good job it just made

690
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,000
everything else in your life that much

691
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,678
easier everyone was happy you're happy

692
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,720
the broker's happy the people the broker

693
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,120
giving it to her happy everyone's happy

694
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,640
all the way along down the line because

695
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,518
the quality is there if you didn't grow

696
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,600
good weed you might have to sit on

697
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,200
it you know and then you're not happy

698
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,678
because you sat on it so you know now

699
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,319
they're trying to figure out ways to

700
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,640
Market bad

701
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,439
weed that's it right I'm I'm sure sure

702
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,880
almost certain that we're going to have

703
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,240
further deep dives into the spray turs

704
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,480
it's hard to believe this is just a

705
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,079
tangent feels like a whole Topic in and

706
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,679
of itself but I think what Noto dog said

707
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,480
is pertinent you know I think as time

708
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,240
goes by more stuff is going to come to

709
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,278
the surface and uh will yet it's yet to

710
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,399
be seen as to whether uh it's entirely

711
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:52,398
safe and what sort of uh repercussions

712
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,959
there might be associated with it but

713
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,678
while I'm on the topic Noto dog you

714
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:00,240
actually predicted perfectly what the

715
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,880
next discussion point is which is that

716
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,359
cookies parent company is being sued by

717
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,840
cookies retail

718
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:11,000
LLC so in a recent news story by mjbiz

719
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,119
daily published by Chris Roberts it

720
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,640
covers that how cookies the parent

721
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:19,719
company is being sued for a100 million

722
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,799
dispute they claim that burner AKA

723
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,640
Gilbert Milan who the co-founder of

724
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:25,720
cookies parent company licensed the

725
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,159
brand and products and the images to

726
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,759
other companies such as cookies retail

727
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,278
LLC they alleged that the cookies parent

728
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,079
company failed to register itself as a

729
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,679
franchise which was required by state

730
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,639
and federal law and as a result of doing

731
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,399
this they were able to withhold certain

732
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,480
information about their

733
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,719
finances cookies retail LLC alleges that

734
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,759
the parent company also heavily

735
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,079
overinflated the profitability of the

736
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:53,720
company as well as minimized the ongoing

737
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,199
expenses of operating a store they

738
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,839
report they were forced to pay for

739
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,519
clothing and cannabis products that they

740
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,119
were sent but never requested or ordered

741
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,839
and they also report that they have

742
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:08,558
invested over $100 million to set up 33

743
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,839
different stores across the USA and are

744
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:13,759
seeking damages of the same amount due

745
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:16,119
to poor profitability overall burner

746
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,640
declined to comment on the case however

747
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,239
seems pretty concerning that one of the

748
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,720
most popular brands in the industry may

749
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,359
not be as profitable as it seems on the

750
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,200
surface the case alludes that there may

751
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,000
have been a degree of misappropriation

752
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,600
of the funds so that may be a factor in

753
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,759
it all but I guess overall it seems that

754
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,678
cookies May in fact not be as profitable

755
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,359
as it once seemed or May at least appear

756
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,440
how does this affect the industry and as

757
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,319
a followup what does this mean for

758
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,000
people like say the jungle boys do we

759
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,398
need to wonder are they maybe not as

760
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,960
profitable as they seem is everyone

761
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:51,439
maybe not as profitable as they seem or

762
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,440
is this maybe a cookies exclusive

763
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,079
issue

764
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,638
um well I would say I don't think I

765
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,439
don't think very many people are

766
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:06,678
profitable as we spoke about before I

767
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,759
think a lot of these uh big

768
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,720
companies their entire business model is

769
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,200
hoping that it goes federally legal and

770
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,480
they get bought

771
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,159
out you know and I I think that people

772
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,720
thought they were going to get rich

773
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:27,519
quick and you know um I I think there

774
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,120
was a lot of excitement four or five

775
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,798
years ago go um that there was just

776
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,038
going to be this vast amount I mean they

777
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:34,440
were talking about oh it's going to be

778
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,919
bigger than alcohol it's going to be

779
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,480
like worth 30 40 50 billion a year it's

780
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,960
going to be this massive thing and I

781
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,880
think people thought that they were

782
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,480
going to get rich

783
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,559
quick and weed has always been sort of a

784
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,880
day-to-day grind where if you whatever

785
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:51,200
you're doing if you want to do a good

786
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,080
job at it you kind of have to be

787
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,600
consistent and I think people are

788
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,960
realizing that they're not going to get

789
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,959
rich quick I don't have a lot of

790
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,319
sympathy for a bunch of Rich investors

791
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,000
that tried to dive into our world and

792
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,319
steal it from us so I don't feel bad

793
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,798
that they're not making the type of

794
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,918
money that they thought they were with

795
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:12,240
their

796
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,720
investment you know um yeah what do you

797
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,720
think about it

798
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,038
dude yeah I mean

799
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,480
it's I don't yeah I don't I don't see it

800
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,480
being

801
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,480
like in general the whole the whole deal

802
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,960
of it everything being legalized and

803
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,880
regul Rel ated and everything it's

804
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,519
not you can look at like services or

805
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,919
products or whatever is whatever is

806
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,120
going to be whatever's going to do the

807
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,600
best is what's really useful and what's

808
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:45,000
really necessary right so you look at

809
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:49,079
like um you look at like the post office

810
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,038
and you go okay well Amazon is like

811
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:54,319
a you know a lot of people think of like

812
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,319
Amazon like oh it's this thing where you

813
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,839
buy things from Amazon and Amazon's the

814
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,278
one who sells it to you but really

815
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,398
Amazon is like another post office now

816
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,798
they do have things they sell but for

817
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,359
the most part when you buy something

818
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,679
from Amazon you're buying it from a

819
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,798
different seller so something like

820
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,200
Amazon is this really valuable product

821
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,038
they bring value it's like okay this

822
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,480
company should do really good because

823
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,879
it's something that okay everybody can

824
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,000
really use it basically anything you

825
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,240
want to get it's there you

826
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,240
know so naturally it's going to be super

827
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,079
profitable it's going to make tons of

828
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:35,240
money well everybody wants weed so of

829
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:38,319
course weed is going to be super

830
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,798
profitable but nobody needs regulated

831
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,720
weed and nobody needs legal weed it

832
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,398
wasn't necessary nobody needs the [Â __Â ]

833
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,480
everybody can get weed you know what I

834
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:50,959
mean so like naturally they're at a huge

835
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,720
disadvantage by trying to have this huge

836
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,880
system set up for everybody to make

837
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,278
billions and billions of dollars when

838
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,760
it's like guess what everybody was

839
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,278
already making billions and billions

840
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,200
ions of dollars there wasn't like there

841
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:06,558
yeah there was the post office and then

842
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,358
there is Amazon but Amazon has a service

843
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:13,119
that the post office can't provide but

844
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,598
regulated weed at the store it only can

845
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,760
provide a service to a certain Little

846
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,280
slice of people who bu will buy weed at

847
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,639
the store but there was already so many

848
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,399
billions of dollars being spent on weed

849
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,639
and there was no stores so obviously the

850
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,319
store wasn't really NE necessary so it's

851
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,399
like the store is kind of like this uh

852
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
kind of a

853
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:36,398
useful

854
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,358
little it's just that's a mess I would

855
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,559
actually say it's an imp I would

856
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:48,759
actually say that the stores are a

857
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:50,799
barrier right like legitimately and and

858
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,760
what I mean by that is that I don't

859
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,879
actually

860
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,000
view I don't actually view weed as legal

861
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,400
maybe maybe that's like controversial or

862
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,400
whatever but

863
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,079
like I think if herb was legal then

864
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,400
small Growers should be able to sell

865
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,880
direct to customers within our

866
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,960
state right and I think part of the

867
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,960
problem is that in order for people to

868
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,519
go grow good weed it has to not only go

869
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,358
through distribution but it has to get

870
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:23,400
into a store and most of those places

871
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:25,799
aren't like they're not making the

872
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,440
decisions on the best weed they can get

873
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,880
they're making the decisions on What's

874
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,358
the most profitable for them you know

875
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,160
and so there's a lot of corruption in

876
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:35,838
that regard too like there's a whole

877
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,358
Peola Scandal that's gone on in

878
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:42,599
California where for a while it was um

879
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,559
you had to pay for shelf space for a lot

880
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,720
of these stores right where it's like

881
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,119
it's not only they're they're going to

882
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,919
buy your your stuff I want you to pay I

883
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,720
have limited shelf space you need to pay

884
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,519
me for some of that shelf space because

885
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,799
there's big companies with Rich

886
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,280
investors that are paying me for an

887
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,079
advantage and what what you read

888
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,880
I think is investors getting frustrated

889
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,160
that weed has become a worse investment

890
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,519
than them just putting their money in

891
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,480
treasury bonds or any other kind of

892
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:11,280
stock like they poured all this money in

893
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,280
and not only are they not profiting but

894
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,519
they're not getting the money back

895
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,200
out and they're mad because a lot of

896
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,440
these big I mean there's a there's a

897
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,279
crew up here um in in our neck of the

898
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,838
woods called

899
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,800
flana and they raised 250 million dollar

900
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:32,880
and then this past year they shuttered

901
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,079
like all their Cana

902
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,960
operations so they already blew through

903
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,560
a quarter of a billion dollars and

904
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,838
weren't able to make enough money even

905
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:46,358
to stay

906
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:48,239
functioning right and so um you know

907
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:51,119
like when you like for instance when

908
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,879
cookies rais money when you raise money

909
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,760
that that amount of money you're giving

910
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
away a percentage of your company to

911
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,040
raise the

912
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,679
money right like investing they're not

913
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,079
just like that's what they're they're

914
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,679
getting they're getting some kind of

915
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,680
percentage some kind of stock percentage

916
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:10,199
well if you were blowing it up as far as

917
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:13,239
profitability you wouldn't need outside

918
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,598
funding right so the game right now in

919
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:18,078
big legal weed is all these people are

920
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,318
pouring in large amounts of money hoping

921
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,119
to gain market share and then they're

922
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:25,400
getting mad when it's not as promised

923
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,200
because there's all these dudes like oh

924
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,440
yeah give me the money I'll take that

925
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,318
100 Mill million dollars I'll make us

926
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,920
all

927
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:34,318
rich and then five years later they lost

928
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,720
it and they're like well I did get a fat

929
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,599
salary and I bought a couple of houses

930
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,118
before this thing went bunk I'm actually

931
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,000
doing okay couple people made good money

932
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,519
I was just thinking it was funny like

933
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,760
can you imagine if you just had a

934
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,400
quarter billion dollars and you just

935
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,680
like oh let's just take a quarter

936
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,000
billion dollars and let's just like blow

937
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:55,440
up some some bootleg [Â __Â ] like we're

938
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,318
just going to take a quarter billion

939
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,318
dollars and start an online ta CA

940
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:04,759
shipping operation like how profitable

941
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:06,639
you could be with that much money how

942
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,800
many people could be actually working in

943
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,239
some kind of an organization versus

944
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,200
loano where they basically had like one

945
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,838
Warehouse with a bunch of weed from a

946
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:18,078
bunch of hippies that they ended up not

947
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,119
being able to pay and they just flopped

948
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,440
the whole thing like it's so much

949
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:26,318
resources I mean in my in my opinion

950
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,039
cookie entire play is when weed goes

951
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:30,599
federally legal they want some big group

952
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,679
to look at the fact that they've got all

953
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,400
these stores in California and Florida

954
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:36,440
New York this that everything else and

955
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,358
they're like we're just going to buy

956
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,838
into this new profitable industry and

957
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,799
this is one of the most desirable

958
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:45,159
companies and then everybody that owns

959
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,000
stock in it makes out like a bandit but

960
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,118
they have to get there and I think I

961
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
even think you know he brags about like

962
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,720
you know somebody offered to buy cookies

963
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,519
for like some 800 million or something

964
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:58,919
and they turned it down um that might

965
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,679
have been a bad move on on their part

966
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,920
because that was still when hope was

967
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:07,399
high and reality hadn't set in and the

968
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,559
reality is is that somehow this quasi

969
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,880
legal weed situation we have took an

970
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,920
extremely profitable 215 and made life

971
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,559
worse for almost

972
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,119
everybody yeah and I mean I just can't

973
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,880
help but look at it in that light of

974
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,599
going okay yes here's this thing and

975
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,079
it's so it's worth so much money it's so

976
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,920
profitable it's such a great business

977
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,519
and at the same time look at it and go

978
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,240
yeah but this aspect of it it's like

979
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,599
yeah weed is super profitable legal weed

980
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:40,399
is super profitable but all said and

981
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,519
done after the Smoke Clears or the dust

982
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,000
settles or however you want to say it is

983
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:50,639
really the regulated market is there any

984
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,358
real utility to it like in reality

985
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:57,118
everybody can easily grow weed trade

986
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:59,000
weed sell weed buy weed it you don't

987
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,760
like even if you like say you want to

988
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,880
sell ice cream right you need to have

989
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,000
like a storefront that is an ice cream

990
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,519
shop like I'm gonna I'm GNA be hog and

991
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,838
dos or I'm going to be Baskin Robbins I

992
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:15,880
need a storefront I need one in every

993
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:18,358
city because I need to have a freezer

994
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,640
and I need to put my ice cream in there

995
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,440
I'm going to be a burger place I need to

996
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,759
have a place where there's a place to

997
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,440
drive up and pay for the burgers I need

998
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,920
a fryer for French fries I need

999
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,039
refrigerators for all my stuff I need

1000
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,559
employees that'll make all the stuff I

1001
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,679
need to do all this stuff weed is like

1002
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,599
you really don't need a storefront for

1003
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:40,318
weed when you look like you look at the

1004
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,280
cookie store and there's this wall full

1005
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,880
of all this weed I'm like bro I can

1006
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,200
stick all that [Â __Â ] in a backpack in the

1007
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,480
trunk like you can pull up and it it's

1008
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:52,598
weed it just isn't like there's not that

1009
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,760
much utility in the legal Market it's

1010
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,359
great to have storefronts because

1011
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,520
distribution is huge and anybody who is

1012
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,480
like a weed grower back in the day would

1013
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,719
go oh if we had stores in every city and

1014
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,920
we could just sell weed there it's like

1015
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,118
yeah that would be great but if it costs

1016
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,400
a huge amount of money the amount of

1017
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,920
investment that it really takes and the

1018
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,599
actual utility of the whole marketing

1019
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,079
Empire you kind of look at it and you go

1020
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:24,359
oh it's it's cool but I don't think it's

1021
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,280
cool on a level of investing a quarter

1022
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:29,400
billion dollars on it it might have been

1023
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,920
a lot better to go okay how do we keep

1024
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,838
this stripped down to the point where

1025
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,440
we're

1026
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,358
basically Amazon you know what I mean

1027
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,800
like it's just very basic and their

1028
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:45,880
utility is there but instead everything

1029
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,960
is like on this thing like it's this big

1030
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,358
showcase for everything one thing we

1031
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,480
should say

1032
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:55,239
too because it's a state by state

1033
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,240
model nobody has any plan for the

1034
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:59,239
inevitable over production that happens

1035
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,000
right whatsoever and so there's no

1036
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,358
there's no real like like balance

1037
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,159
between how many people can get licenses

1038
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,239
because they you have to give the state

1039
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,440
so much money to get started that

1040
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:14,719
they're down to accept it so anyone that

1041
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,800
wants to get started that has the

1042
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,358
funding that can go through the process

1043
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,640
can get it as long as you're willing to

1044
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:24,239
Shell it out and California way over

1045
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:26,400
every state ends up over producing and

1046
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,000
then that excess seems to magically find

1047
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,079
its way all over the rest of the

1048
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,880
country you know um so cookies are you

1049
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,480
trying to say here what are you trying

1050
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,480
to say what are you trying to

1051
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:44,440
say like this are you insinuating I'm

1052
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,760
saying I I'll I'll say it straight out

1053
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,480
90% the the legal Market is the is

1054
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,960
almost the entire market now and what I

1055
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,039
mean by that is that the big legal Farms

1056
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,599
they supply all the weed for the legal

1057
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,639
market and they're oversupply is

1058
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,599
probably 90% of the black market yeah

1059
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:06,279
and that's why our area is hurting so

1060
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,559
bad is that like all of their overage

1061
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,640
like you you type in Canada destroys

1062
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,680
weed and like in Google will pop up like

1063
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,400
they destroy probably 25% of their crop

1064
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,919
a year because it gets too old and it's

1065
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,920
unsold there is no unsold weed in

1066
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,159
California it just

1067
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,920
disappears you know and so right now

1068
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,759
small people the small producers for

1069
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,760
some reason have all thist extra weed

1070
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,640
that they can't sell sell but the big

1071
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,240
producers the people with acreage and a

1072
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,400
thousand lights or whatever it all just

1073
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,959
disappears for some reason the guy who

1074
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,358
has 30 extra pounds he cannot find

1075
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:44,159
anything to do with it like locally at

1076
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:46,799
the stores but the guys who grow 26

1077
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,440
million pounds of weed every year

1078
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,880
they're like yeah I don't know you know

1079
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,159
these stores it's shit's hot right now

1080
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,680
you know

1081
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:58,399
like our operation and then New York is

1082
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,598
complaining because every other BEDA in

1083
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,318
New York City has branded myard

1084
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,359
California wheat yeah you know so in a

1085
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:09,318
weird way legalization has created the

1086
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:12,239
largest domestic black

1087
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:14,039
marketeers that has ever existed and

1088
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,838
everybody's turning a blind eye to it

1089
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:19,039
because those large Farms they give so

1090
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,880
much money to the state to exist every

1091
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,920
year upfront has nothing to do with

1092
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,960
profit it's about like per license

1093
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,400
there's a fee and then there's all these

1094
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,599
other fees so some of these big farms

1095
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,720
are paying you know they're paying

1096
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,640
hundreds of thousands to a few million a

1097
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:38,838
year of investor money just to exist and

1098
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,480
that seems to be a a massive paper

1099
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:43,199
shield and now you've got now you've got

1100
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,719
people like it's not just like that you

1101
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,759
know that Catalyst CEO guy the you know

1102
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:50,838
uh from the stores in California there's

1103
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,800
people that are starting to scream about

1104
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:55,599
okay well these people own they do 100

1105
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,280
acres of greenhouse where does it all

1106
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,160
go it's almost like it's like the

1107
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,760
emperor has no clothes nobody wants to

1108
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:06,000
talk about you know um that aspect so in

1109
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,119
my I guess what I would say is that the

1110
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,639
current rules and the current situation

1111
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,000
we've kind of danced around it whether

1112
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:15,318
it's taxes the regulation it's worked

1113
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,838
horrible it's been really bad for the

1114
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:20,599
Legacy people that existed it's been

1115
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:23,519
really bad for consumers because I'll

1116
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,359
I'll guarantee you in 215 you could get

1117
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,559
cheaper and better quality weed from

1118
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:31,039
most dispensaries than you can get today

1119
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,519
no problem yeah so it's bad for the

1120
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,279
producers it's bad for the consumers

1121
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,039
it's bad for the investors they're not

1122
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,839
making any money right like that's why

1123
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,159
they're people don't file lawsuits

1124
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,639
because they're doing well with their

1125
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,960
money they file lawsuits when they feel

1126
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,558
like they got taken advantage

1127
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,400
of right that's the story that you were

1128
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,800
reading about yeah and the the

1129
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,519
regulation was was proposed a lot

1130
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,280
differently you know there was a lot of

1131
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,159
protections that were supposed to be put

1132
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,760
in place in California that just got

1133
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,440
stepped right over like it wasn't you

1134
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,520
know I always knew that even if you put

1135
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,318
a cap on how much people can grow

1136
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:09,800
they'll just put the other ones in other

1137
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,480
people's names and people will get

1138
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,000
around it but they didn't even make

1139
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,240
people have to do that it was like

1140
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,719
you're only going to be able to grow

1141
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,759
this much and then they were like yeah

1142
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,078
screw it we'll just you can grow

1143
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,200
whatever you want and the whole thing

1144
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,519
you know the whole thing yeah got

1145
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,279
completely done different I mean Gavin

1146
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,639
Newsome came up and oh we're going to

1147
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,880
make sure everything's really good for

1148
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,639
the small farmers and everything and

1149
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,720
then you know that one thing I've

1150
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:37,960
noticed about these questions is that we

1151
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:40,799
could really go on for a long time about

1152
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,318
any one of them yeah so we wanted to

1153
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,480
switch to the next one that would be

1154
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:48,000
cool too because yeah we'll go we'll go

1155
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,599
that's exactly it well I was gonna say

1156
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,400
without going too deep down the rabbit

1157
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,280
hole I think the logical conclusion to

1158
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,880
this discussion is as we've talked about

1159
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,119
you know it seems like the game plan for

1160
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,039
cies as well as other big companies is

1161
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,640
set themselves up in a prime position

1162
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,358
for federal legalization the question

1163
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:08,239
though is do we expect that to happen

1164
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,199
before they blow through the cash is the

1165
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,719
downfall of cookies possibly going to

1166
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:14,279
occur due to that plan not being able to

1167
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,159
be fulfilled with

1168
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,319
legalization I'm sure it's been a part

1169
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:21,039
of their internal

1170
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,039
meetings someone sweating about it yeah

1171
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,119
Cash Cash burn versus that's why they

1172
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,920
raised a bunch of new money and they're

1173
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,400
partially getting sued because those

1174
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,159
initial investors thought that they were

1175
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,400
getting diluted out from their position

1176
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:34,920
on the new money

1177
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,760
race you know so it is it's about you

1178
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,079
know right now the industry is that's

1179
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,720
and that is distorting everything a

1180
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,440
bunch of Rich investor money propping up

1181
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:46,519
unprofitable

1182
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,679
businesses is affecting the ability for

1183
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:50,960
smaller businesses to be

1184
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:52,199
profitable because they're not competing

1185
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,559
against other people that are doing

1186
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:58,000
better than them they're just competing

1187
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:58,000
against people that are funded to lose

1188
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:05,000
certainly yeah it's it's it's ruining

1189
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,239
the it's ruining what is all the big

1190
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,079
potential and then what you know a lot

1191
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,519
of people just suspect like all right

1192
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,200
and and it it is the case it's like okay

1193
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:17,559
well if we can just lose money lose

1194
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,719
money lose money until everybody fails

1195
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:21,559
then we'll be the last ones but what a

1196
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,000
lot of people didn't anticipate was that

1197
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:24,839
they would lose a lot more money than

1198
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,199
they thought and they actually lost

1199
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,239
money until they failed which is crazy

1200
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,719
because it's like they're like okay well

1201
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,639
we'll just you know keep doing this and

1202
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:35,879
we'll we'll kind of undermine the whole

1203
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:38,440
thing and it's like yeah but now you

1204
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,039
undermined the thing so badly that it

1205
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,318
doesn't have any there there's no

1206
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,199
there's nothing practical left you know

1207
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:48,480
and that's definitely what what's been

1208
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,439
going on and it you know it could change

1209
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,039
when things become more realistic but

1210
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,639
we're not sure you know

1211
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,079
that's certainly I think we could Muse

1212
00:48:55,639 --> 00:49:00,000
on it all day so why don't we flick for

1213
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,440
something a little more lighthearted

1214
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,239
this one actually just one I remembered

1215
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:09,119
on the fly but I want to touch on to it

1216
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:11,919
recently we saw the slightly unexpected

1217
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,838
partnering of Mike Tyson with Royal

1218
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,519
Queen seeds talking about money getting

1219
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,000
into the industry or maybe getting out

1220
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:21,358
of it Mike Tyson notably has the ranch

1221
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,880
where he produces cannabis haven't heard

1222
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,239
anything about it whether it's good or

1223
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,318
bad but I guess the question is do we

1224
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,759
expect to see more celebrity is jumping

1225
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,318
on the Cannabis corporate bandwagon

1226
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,280
making their own seed lines or do we

1227
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:35,519
think this might be a little shortlived

1228
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,519
any

1229
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:41,279
thoughts

1230
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:43,318
um I would not I would W if I had to

1231
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,200
wildly guess I would say he's just

1232
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:46,960
buying seeds from someone making them

1233
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,838
and branding them

1234
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:54,720
himself you're 100% now that some of the

1235
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:56,119
seeds he's offering is gelato 41 Auto

1236
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,759
though notably there are one or two

1237
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,640
strains that have nice little um

1238
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,119
references in the name we've got punch

1239
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,920
pie I guess a reference to punching um

1240
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,440
and then we've also got a goat L which

1241
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,200
is just a gelato 41 Auto but I guess you

1242
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,880
know in his honor sort of

1243
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,358
thing yeah I mean you know that's the

1244
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,880
thing about when you take something and

1245
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:22,199
you bring it

1246
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:25,400
into uh being mainstream is you're

1247
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,039
naturally going to get all that type of

1248
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,599
branding you know what I mean like

1249
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:32,079
you're going to have like the whatever

1250
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,000
you know like you want if it was when I

1251
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,440
was a kid it would be like the He-man

1252
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,719
strain like oh it's He-Man Str it's the

1253
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,159
classic joke like in Space Balls like

1254
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,439
it's it's Space Balls the flamethrower

1255
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:48,798
it's space balls you know The Lunchbox

1256
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,079
it's whatever like the the the the you

1257
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:53,480
know the cross branding is like oh okay

1258
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:55,039
well we make cereal but like it'd

1259
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,280
probably sell a lot better if we put

1260
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,358
Mike Tyson on the box

1261
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,160
and so when you got somebody like it's

1262
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,880
Royal Queen seeds it's not even like

1263
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,519
Mike Tyson started a seed company Royal

1264
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,280
Queen is just like we're making the Mike

1265
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,400
Tyson line they're just putting Mike

1266
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,119
Tyson on the front of the wedy Box you

1267
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,639
know so like it's naturally gonna happen

1268
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:18,559
and I think it's going to happen a lot

1269
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:21,598
more the only thing is in some cases

1270
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:24,400
like at least like like Mike Tyson is

1271
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,280
like Stone to the Bone 247 like he

1272
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,720
smokes a lot of dope and he has for ever

1273
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,920
you know he's like been a smoker since

1274
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:35,039
way way back and uh there's a lot of

1275
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,960
different people I'm sure who were going

1276
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,639
to do it and you're like wait do you did

1277
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,240
were you ever into weed like this is the

1278
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,838
you know we're gonna have the Gwyneth

1279
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:46,358
paltro vagina cented Vape or like what

1280
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:47,920
are what's the next thing where it's

1281
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:50,039
just going to get ridiculous but at

1282
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,639
least in the case of like Tyson like

1283
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:54,759
with the weed branding stuff it's like

1284
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:56,159
he smokes he's into weed you know like

1285
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,559
at least he's probably going to have

1286
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:01,960
like some Stony pot whatever whatever is

1287
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,280
going on there you know uh and you know

1288
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,960
I don't see like a huge issue with it as

1289
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,720
far as that but I'm sure that we're

1290
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,240
going to start to see it where it starts

1291
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:15,480
to get really really ridiculous where

1292
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:18,078
you're like where is the where's the

1293
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:21,199
overlap here like what does this have to

1294
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,079
do with any of the weed you know like if

1295
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,239
you if you know Tyson a little bit you

1296
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,318
know like he really he's always high

1297
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:29,838
he's just like he's just smokes all the

1298
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:32,199
time he's never sober he said he used to

1299
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,639
box all his fights Stoned on weed like

1300
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:36,358
all those crazy fights that you saw when

1301
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,159
we were kids is like he was stoned

1302
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:42,400
you're like all right well [Â __Â ] you know

1303
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,598
it's at least there's that you know but

1304
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,000
as far as like seeds it then it makes a

1305
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:48,519
little bit less sense because what

1306
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,119
what's the point and then you look at it

1307
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:52,639
and you're like okay punch it's probably

1308
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,760
like a purple punch cross but but it's

1309
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,879
Tyson so let's use the purple punch you

1310
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,799
know and it's you can just pick sure the

1311
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,760
GU sitting around in the in the

1312
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:04,119
boardroom you know going well I mean we

1313
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,119
got the we got the we we gave him the

1314
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,720
money to use his name so like what do

1315
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:12,318
you think we'll use the let's call it

1316
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:15,118
you know one punch knockout and it'll be

1317
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,079
wedding cake with purple punch and it'll

1318
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,079
be you know this is GNA be the kids are

1319
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:22,640
going to love it guys you know and let's

1320
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,318
[Â __Â ] put it in a hula hoop and you

1321
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,598
know it's just some [Â __Â ] craziness

1322
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:30,759
but uh you know I don't know it's all

1323
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,559
it's all interesting um but I but I'm

1324
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,680
curious to see what like the next level

1325
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:37,440
of it is where and I know it's already

1326
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:40,199
out there and I'm probably not noticing

1327
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,639
it but like I said with like you know

1328
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:44,358
like with these celebrities where it has

1329
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,199
nothing to do with anything and then the

1330
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:48,798
idea is really weird and I mean it'll

1331
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,199
probably be really funny to laugh at

1332
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:53,318
when you're really high and just trying

1333
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:55,838
to scratch your head and be like we got

1334
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:57,039
the [Â __Â ] you know this is the Bill

1335
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,279
Cosby IND

1336
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:02,759
or you know like what the [Â __Â ] are they

1337
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:06,240
doing here you know I think a lot of it

1338
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,720
is what you're saying but I think part

1339
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:11,159
of it is just that because weed is

1340
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:15,239
coming out of the Shadows for the first

1341
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:17,759
time it doesn't have any estab it has

1342
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:20,078
tens of millions of regular users in the

1343
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,839
United States people who smoke weed so

1344
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,720
there's a massive Market there which the

1345
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:28,199
new which they want to fill but there

1346
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:31,118
are no like any other kind of consumer

1347
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:33,118
good there are no luxury Brands there

1348
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,920
are no commercial Brands there are no

1349
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:39,519
bargain B brand there's no Brands so

1350
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,000
people looking at weed Mike Tyson or uh

1351
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:44,920
or you know Whiz Khalifa or uh you know

1352
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,039
Belushi or you know all these people why

1353
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,760
not me why can't I have a brand and

1354
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:53,440
everybody feels like they can get in on

1355
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,480
the ground floor because who's their

1356
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,679
competition right like and it's going to

1357
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,079
take a long while for Brands to

1358
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,919
establish itself I mean like in the

1359
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,839
South Coca-Cola is so dominant in some

1360
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,159
spots people when they order a soda they

1361
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:09,920
just say I want a

1362
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:12,000
Coke right like like Coca-Cola became

1363
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:17,119
dominant enough they became the

1364
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,920
word for soda in certain parts yeah like

1365
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,000
in the midwest where I'm from it's pop

1366
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,318
you know but like pop could be different

1367
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,719
things but like you're saying yeah one

1368
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:27,480
thing becomes so dominant you know so

1369
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:30,639
dominant and so we're going to like

1370
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,599
California became legal in what 2018 or

1371
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,078
something so we're really the first half

1372
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:37,760
a decade

1373
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,680
in and so what marketing is going to

1374
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,160
work nobody has any idea but there's

1375
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,919
obviously a lot of rich people that want

1376
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,318
to throw their hat in the ring and see

1377
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,159
if it works

1378
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:51,519
out yeah and I mean like you know um

1379
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:53,679
like George Foreman was a huge star for

1380
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:56,519
a long time and he had been around for a

1381
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,558
long time and he was well respected by

1382
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,480
most people and everyone knew the name

1383
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,680
and he was a heavy duty fighter and he

1384
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,639
was well known and you know like I don't

1385
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,480
want to like I don't want to like tell

1386
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,679
people there's no Santa Claus or nothing

1387
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,400
but like George Foreman doesn't make

1388
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,199
grills he doesn't make grills guys but

1389
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,559
he but he made the most money in his

1390
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,519
entire life and career off those grills

1391
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:22,160
off the grill but he didn't sit around

1392
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:24,559
in his kitchen and go damn you know what

1393
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,519
you know what I really need I need an

1394
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,680
electric grill in my kitchen where I can

1395
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,679
collect the grease and lose a couple

1396
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,759
pounds

1397
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:36,279
because here's a good point right you've

1398
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,480
spent a bunch of your podcast career

1399
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,839
interviewing individual people that

1400
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,920
poured their heart and soul into weed

1401
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:45,318
various things a lot heavy focus on

1402
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,760
breeding obviously but other things too

1403
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:50,880
right when modern marketing comes in

1404
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,760
most of the time modern marketing you're

1405
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,119
dealing with people that have nothing to

1406
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,640
do but the

1407
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,720
marketing so that's a huge sight mic

1408
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,199
shift of like you talking directly to

1409
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:04,798
mean jeene about his past and Mendo or

1410
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:07,038
breeding or what his Vibe is right like

1411
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:10,199
there's companies that are like I'm just

1412
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:13,440
gonna hire this person I'm gonna have a

1413
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:15,879
marketing campaign I'm gonna hire actors

1414
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,559
I'm GNA hire you know sports figures I'm

1415
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,400
GNA hire celebrities or musicians and

1416
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,440
they're going to promote my brand

1417
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,559
because most things aren't promoted by

1418
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,639
the people you know that make them when

1419
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,160
you see when you see car advertisements

1420
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,440
it's not the engineers at the Ford plant

1421
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:35,519
in you know in Michigan or or Georgia

1422
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,358
it's like Jimmy Hendrick and like a a

1423
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,519
car racing across the Rio Grande you

1424
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:43,199
know like marketing is way different and

1425
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:44,639
so we have to get used to the idea that

1426
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,679
there's going to be this weird new

1427
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:51,078
disconnect of marketers that the only

1428
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,078
thing they're doing in weed is

1429
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,719
marketing yeah that's right so he's

1430
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,318
saying that like he he's down with Mike

1431
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:59,719
Tyson because at least Mike Tyson has

1432
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:02,239
been a obvious heavy toker his whole

1433
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:04,358
life and has been down for the cause but

1434
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:05,838
most people marketing it they're just

1435
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:07,358
going to Market it because they think

1436
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:08,960
they're a marketable person that's going

1437
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,679
to make money off the campaign and it's

1438
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,119
going to reflect well on your brand and

1439
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,239
that was only my take on it of like

1440
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:18,079
whether or not like on my personal

1441
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,000
opinion like what do you think about

1442
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,000
them using his name for seeds and stuff

1443
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,960
and I'm like well at least he's a

1444
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,519
pothead you know but like that might

1445
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,240
have had not very much to do with why

1446
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:33,440
they actually picked him they might have

1447
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:36,239
realized like huh he's a huge name and

1448
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,440
he's not anti-weed he's Pro weed so I

1449
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,399
bet he'd be available as a name they

1450
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,200
might have thought like damn it would be

1451
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,160
cool if we could get like uh if we could

1452
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:46,639
get like Floyd Mayweather like that

1453
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:48,078
would be cool and then they're like oh

1454
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,598
you know he don't smoke he's not going

1455
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,519
to want to do this like you're not going

1456
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,480
to be able to get him but guess what

1457
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,119
Tyson already sells weeds so he's on

1458
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,719
this list of people who we could get and

1459
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,838
when we look through the list we go huh

1460
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:04,118
I'll bet our money we'd get the most

1461
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:06,558
Bang from our for our B from advertising

1462
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:08,760
through there so like you said like a

1463
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,359
lot what I notice on you know I

1464
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,720
addressed it more from the perspective

1465
00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:15,920
of what I notice online which is where

1466
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:18,639
people go oh now Jay-Z's getting into

1467
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,880
weed now so and so is getting into weed

1468
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,639
they're like what does this guy even

1469
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,640
know about weed and I'm like guess what

1470
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:26,558
guys Jay-Z is not rolling the joints

1471
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,759
he's not putting the he not shaking the

1472
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,519
weed in the pre-rolls and picking out

1473
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,640
the smells and [Â __Â ] they already have a

1474
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:37,119
whole weed company and they go to Jay-Z

1475
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:40,038
and they go dude let's partner and

1476
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,519
here's the deal we do everything we just

1477
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:46,359
need your name and we're going to call

1478
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:50,519
this [Â __Â ] Jay-Z weed and they know that

1479
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:52,759
because he already has 1.5 billion fans

1480
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:55,599
around the globe that all they need to

1481
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,760
do is tap into this little percentage of

1482
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,440
it and they're going to be able to sell

1483
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,000
instantly all this Jay-Z weed and when

1484
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,519
you look online yeah and all the real

1485
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,920
weed heads are like what does he have to

1486
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:08,719
do with weed he never made no he's never

1487
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,159
taken clones he's never done nothing and

1488
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:13,558
I'm like yeah but like you said with the

1489
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:16,519
cars you know guess what like Matthew

1490
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:19,240
mccon he doesn't work at the Lincoln

1491
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:22,559
Factory that's not

1492
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:25,558
how hats or leather gloves or anything

1493
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,640
like that people are in such a bubble so

1494
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,640
weed people look at it and they go oh

1495
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:31,639
you can't do that you can't do this and

1496
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,639
it's funny because like even me I'm in

1497
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:35,719
such a little weed bubble that when

1498
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:37,318
there's things done by seed companies

1499
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:40,159
like that where it's a little bit

1500
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:41,759
dubious in whatever way even a lot of

1501
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:44,719
people who I know who grow weed who have

1502
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,119
grown weed longer than me and I'm having

1503
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,639
a conversation they're kind of looking

1504
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:50,280
at me like well what is like is this

1505
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:54,358
stuff that you're talking about is it

1506
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:56,519
unethical or is it like what like what

1507
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,920
do you mean don't you just like slap

1508
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,318
names on [Â __Â ] and is it does any of this

1509
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,798
[Â __Â ] matter like what are you even

1510
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,038
talking about because they're not inside

1511
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,599
this little

1512
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:09,440
intellectualized academic bubble of like

1513
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:12,640
this is what real weed stuff is and it's

1514
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,599
so hard for people and even like my

1515
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,838
myself included with the kneer reaction

1516
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:20,119
is to just go this is all [Â __Â ] but

1517
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:22,279
then if you compare it to how everything

1518
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:24,039
really works you go yeah it is [Â __Â ]

1519
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,000
but guess what like that's how

1520
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:30,839
everything functions it's just because

1521
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,960
big Brands they hire big advertising

1522
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:37,038
companies to pitch them ideas for themes

1523
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,159
and stuff they want their brand to be

1524
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:42,160
associated with marketing

1525
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:44,038
campaigns yeah you know and so what's

1526
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,639
going to happen with weed eventually

1527
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:47,640
this is just the beginning of it is like

1528
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:50,038
you're gonna have some guys in New York

1529
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,000
spitballing marketing ideas based on

1530
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,599
what

1531
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,440
demographic they're trying to go after

1532
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,960
with weed and then they're going to

1533
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,720
pitch that to the weed company and the

1534
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,159
weed company's going to pitch pick the

1535
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,519
one they want you know what I'm saying

1536
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:06,558
like that's how selling cars or guitars

1537
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,679
or clothes or music or whatever works

1538
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,880
yeah weed was just wasn't just ready to

1539
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:14,399
like be dumped into actual capitalism we

1540
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,599
were our own weird little autistic

1541
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,680
corner of of the world and now we're

1542
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,039
like you know we got tossed in and so

1543
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:27,199
yeah you get Martha Stewart Jim balushi

1544
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:29,640
Mike Tyson you know whoever

1545
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:31,879
yeah totally and I think if nothing else

1546
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:34,000
at the very core of it it's an indicator

1547
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,838
of the degree of

1548
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,480
normalization that is occurring because

1549
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,318
as you were saying we're starting now to

1550
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,599
see it just being branded and marketed

1551
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:43,920
in the way we see everyday brand you

1552
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,039
know the Lincoln brand marketed so you

1553
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,200
know in evolving space we'll uh we'll

1554
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:52,240
have to wait to see if we get the Oprah

1555
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:55,598
OG onto our next story I wanted to chat

1556
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:58,159
about the winner of the ego Clash 2023

1557
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:02,798
of the ice water hash section so the

1558
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:05,838
2023 ego Clash has come and gone let me

1559
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:08,759
just quickly flick our screen over um

1560
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:12,719
and the winner for the ice has category

1561
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:15,559
for 2023 was none other than triome

1562
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:19,038
toris who took out first place with his

1563
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:21,920
cut of blockberry I just pull a photo up

1564
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,480
of it um interestingly this cut of

1565
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,960
blockberry is not the Super boo cut nor

1566
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:31,119
the three to cut both of which equally

1567
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,880
have won a number of Cups and are quite

1568
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,039
well known this is a different cutting

1569
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,318
that triome torus found in a packet of

1570
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,799
the F1 beans himself now I think the

1571
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,480
thing that jumps out to me the most

1572
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:44,159
about this win is that it kind of flies

1573
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,000
in the face of some of the common

1574
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,318
sentiment you hear about people feeling

1575
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,559
the current genetic pool especially the

1576
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:53,719
hype strains are rather stagnant and

1577
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,720
boring given the ego Clash is a blind

1578
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:58,358
judge contest uh judged largely by

1579
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:00,798
people who' be considered industry

1580
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:02,519
leaders and thought leaders um and top

1581
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,358
contributors they all agreed that the

1582
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:07,400
blockberry was the most impressive

1583
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:10,440
sample out edging many other well-known

1584
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,760
competitors so for me this causes the

1585
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,318
question to be asked does this fly in

1586
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,880
the face of people criticizing the

1587
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:18,400
current hype strains saying they're

1588
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,680
boring and what does this mean given

1589
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,559
that it was able to out Edge several

1590
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:26,358
other

1591
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,960
entries well I was down there um and I

1592
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:30,159
didn't get to see all the different

1593
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:33,440
stuff I just kind of was hanging out you

1594
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:37,278
know like a casual um the cool thing

1595
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,920
about that contest is that if you enter

1596
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:42,039
Then You're a judge and if you're a

1597
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,039
judge you can have like a buddy to help

1598
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:47,440
you judge because it's overwhelming

1599
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:50,119
because they have 42 hash entries and

1600
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,720
you basically have to try them all if

1601
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,559
you want to judge them and so you only I

1602
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,679
think the whole thing starts the judging

1603
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:00,240
starts in the morning at 11: or whatever

1604
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,879
and you have until 5: or whatever in the

1605
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,318
afternoon you have to sit there and just

1606
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,278
try them all smoke them all you know

1607
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,119
I've peaked in and kind of seen what was

1608
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:10,000
going on and everybody's really trying

1609
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:13,720
their best taking notes doing all the

1610
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,519
stuff but it is cool because it's being

1611
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:18,639
judged by the people who entered their

1612
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,079
own stuff it's not being judged by

1613
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:23,920
people who don't have any skin in it you

1614
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:26,200
know so people are are are trying to

1615
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,000
judge what is um

1616
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:32,159
is their thing and you know uh like

1617
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,798
really going with what is you know their

1618
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:38,159
taste and and um so it's

1619
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:40,000
not basically it should be about as

1620
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:41,679
transparent as you can

1621
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,639
get

1622
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:47,118
um that said like it's an interesting

1623
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:47,118
thing

1624
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:53,000
because when

1625
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:55,318
you're to judge what's

1626
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,679
like it's got It's got to you kind of

1627
01:05:55,318 --> 01:06:00,759
got to judge it like objectively so

1628
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:04,159
you're going to look at it and you're

1629
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:07,440
going to go how is it presented how well

1630
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:11,278
did they process it dry it how clean is

1631
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:15,440
it how pure is it how much flavor does

1632
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:17,760
it have what you know so my point being

1633
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,318
that in any competition regardless of

1634
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:24,278
how you try to design it you're

1635
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:27,199
naturally going to be picking what is

1636
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:29,480
the best and you might not actually be

1637
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,759
picking what is your favorite and that's

1638
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,559
just the nature of competitions where

1639
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,480
you're trying to be objective so there

1640
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,319
might be something that somebody likes

1641
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,599
better that's really odd but that they

1642
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:43,558
look at it and they go like me like my

1643
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,318
tast in music somebody might go oh

1644
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,480
what's your favorite M and I'm like I

1645
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:49,318
don't even really want to tell you

1646
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,838
because I already know it's not that

1647
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:56,239
good or what's your favorite way to make

1648
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:58,239
a burger well I know there's better

1649
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:00,038
cheeses but sorry but I like American

1650
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,479
cheese on my burger I know it's this

1651
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:04,480
weird [Â __Â ] and it's basically total

1652
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,920
garbage processed food but it tastes

1653
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,240
[Â __Â ] amazing on a cheeseburger right

1654
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:13,119
so I wouldn't like go necessarily judge

1655
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:15,719
the burger competition and be like Oh

1656
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,480
yeah this stupid little Burger over here

1657
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:20,318
this is the best one even though that

1658
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,519
one might be my favorite so it's always

1659
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:26,719
hard to really know what that stuff is

1660
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:29,358
like the the flower was like um I can't

1661
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:32,639
remember but I think it was like Lemon

1662
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,558
Cherry gelato one and I'm like well as

1663
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:37,759
everybody who has a lot of different

1664
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,960
kinds of weed I don't have a lot of

1665
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,599
buddies who when I talk to them they're

1666
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,079
like dude all I've been smoking is this

1667
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,720
Lemon Cherry gelato but when you look

1668
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:49,480
and you go okay what was harvested

1669
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:52,558
perfectly grown perfectly presented in

1670
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:55,079
the jar trimmed the best cured really

1671
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,760
good it burned really good it had the

1672
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:00,640
most flavor out of all these samples it

1673
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,839
had the most smell it was the most clear

1674
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,440
it smelled like it was preserved the

1675
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:06,759
best you're going to go this is the best

1676
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,920
sample of weed meaning that like this

1677
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,000
grower and this guy how he handled the

1678
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,278
weed he did the best work and it

1679
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,278
deserves to win because we're judging it

1680
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:17,000
this many points for this this many

1681
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:18,960
points for this and this many points for

1682
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,439
this and then there might be one thing

1683
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,000
that's odd there that someone's like

1684
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:25,039
this is my favorite but the dude

1685
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,198
probably should have Jarred it a day

1686
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:27,719
later

1687
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:30,039
and he could have trimmed it a little

1688
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,520
bit better and it burnt a little rough

1689
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:34,600
because of what it is and it's not going

1690
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,600
to win a cup but it might be the thing

1691
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,440
that you look at and go this is the very

1692
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:42,239
best so my take on the way that all

1693
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:45,559
these things work is that

1694
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,959
contests have those like inherent

1695
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:51,679
builtin flaws and they're not they're

1696
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,920
like not you know they're the feature

1697
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:57,679
they're not the bug contests just by

1698
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,039
Nature are kind of weird because you you

1699
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,000
know like in the old days if you were to

1700
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:03,880
have that kind of a contest like an old

1701
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,439
Harvest thing people would have been you

1702
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,880
would have had a bunch of a bunch of

1703
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,719
dudes who were hippies and bikers and

1704
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,279
dope dealers and whatever and they'd be

1705
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:14,679
smoking and they'd go that [Â __Â ] bag

1706
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:16,560
right there that's the best [Â __Â ] here

1707
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:19,119
but now you have a bunch of people who

1708
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,679
are essentially scientists and they're

1709
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:24,880
analyzing the samples for all the points

1710
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:29,158
to see what is the thing that is the

1711
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,000
very best and out of that I am fully in

1712
01:09:29,158 --> 01:09:34,679
I'm in full belief that that sample of

1713
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,198
hash was probably the best made hash

1714
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:37,600
that was in the contest I'm sure there

1715
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:40,479
was a few judges who probably had

1716
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:43,719
another one as number one other but as

1717
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,399
it all levels out and you see the most

1718
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:50,439
judges have it as number one it winds up

1719
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:52,559
being the winner so that doesn't say too

1720
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:54,719
much about your question but that's just

1721
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,400
so that people understand how these

1722
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,920
contests work that they're not like

1723
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:02,439
necessarily going to be the thing that

1724
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,239
you would show up and say it's the very

1725
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:07,519
best one it's my favorite but it's the

1726
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:10,238
one that the most people will look at

1727
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,800
and go this dude really nailed it like I

1728
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,639
guarantee the dude you're not going to

1729
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:17,199
win that contest and not be an excellent

1730
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,440
hash maker and it had to be excellent

1731
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,719
starting material it had to be excellent

1732
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,960
from the genetics it started with the

1733
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:26,560
way it was grown the way it was washed

1734
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:29,000
the way it was dried the way it was

1735
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,120
presented and packaged like because I've

1736
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,198
seen Brandon who runs the thing I've

1737
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:38,039
seen people show up and have like sloppy

1738
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:41,039
jars and he's like dude he's like if you

1739
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:42,760
packaged it sloppy I don't even I don't

1740
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:45,640
even have to question the way that you

1741
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,600
washed it I already know you didn't do

1742
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:49,360
you already are not operating at the

1743
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,640
level that these other guys are you're

1744
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:54,960
not bringing your aame and he'll just

1745
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,840
disqualify three or four entries at the

1746
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,399
beginning at every one of the ego Clash

1747
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,360
cuz he's like dude it's all smashed on

1748
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:03,079
the sides and it looks all [Â __Â ] up

1749
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,599
those ones you might smoke them and be

1750
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:07,519
like oh those are my favorite but it's a

1751
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,840
competition and it has to be presented

1752
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,159
right it's like at a dog show you might

1753
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,360
have the dog and you go oh this dog is

1754
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:16,599
amazing but you're like yeah but you

1755
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:18,639
guys dude you didn't even like the dog

1756
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,120
you forgot to brush the butt or

1757
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,880
something and the hair's [Â __Â ] up like

1758
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,840
you can't do that that's not how you

1759
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,319
compete when you come to a competition

1760
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,560
you have to make sure that everything is

1761
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:34,119
all perfect and then from there starts

1762
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:37,159
the judging of what you know the flavor

1763
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:39,238
the genetics the way it actually the way

1764
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:42,039
what it does on the nail how it actually

1765
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:44,599
goes up how it makes you feel what it's

1766
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:47,279
like when you exhale it how it leaves

1767
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:50,360
your mouth feeling and after all that

1768
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,158
that was the one that everybody liked

1769
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:54,759
and if you look at the genetics those

1770
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:57,079
aren't lightweight um things those

1771
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:00,239
things are p in a lot of flavor you can

1772
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:02,119
see the combination you go okay I could

1773
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:04,439
see how the things in this could lend

1774
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:07,479
themselves to some real heavy flavors

1775
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:09,599
and all that and um and the last thing

1776
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:13,079
to say about that as far as the more to

1777
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,760
answer the question of the of the uh the

1778
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,719
the modern hype genetics is like you

1779
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,960
said it's a different cut than the ones

1780
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:23,079
that people already knew but the reality

1781
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,198
is when you take these things and you

1782
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:28,719
mash them up and you make something new

1783
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:31,599
um I've seen like I've made like a

1784
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:34,119
cookie cross and toss hit it with my

1785
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,960
mail and grown it and had a lot of them

1786
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:39,119
be like you know whatever and then had

1787
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:42,079
one plant that I was

1788
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:45,000
like I don't care what the genetics are

1789
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:48,399
you can tell me that it was runs crossed

1790
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,119
with OG crossed with gelato but if it

1791
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:53,759
grew this plant nobody's going to care

1792
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:56,679
we're all going to agree that this one

1793
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,280
was really really good so you know in my

1794
01:12:56,679 --> 01:13:02,719
opinion as far as like hype versus Old

1795
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:05,479
School versus whatever um it really

1796
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,079
comes down to like which plant you pick

1797
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:09,959
and then you know I'm sure before they

1798
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:12,479
ever got to the point where they got

1799
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,520
that to the ego Clash a lot of people

1800
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,479
had already rooted through their bags

1801
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,480
and their hashing a lot of people were

1802
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:21,479
raised their eyebrows and went wow you

1803
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:23,799
got something special here you know so

1804
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:25,399
that's like my take on the on that kind

1805
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,199
of stuff is it's like yeah you might

1806
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:31,319
have a lot of so so stuff but if you

1807
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:35,079
select the right plant you might find

1808
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:37,519
that plant out of anywhere it's like

1809
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:40,760
it's genetic so you could relate it to

1810
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,440
like having like a super athlete like

1811
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,280
yeah you're going to get more Super

1812
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:47,198
athlet you're going to get more people

1813
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:48,599
running fast and winning in Kenya but

1814
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:50,439
that doesn't mean that you're not going

1815
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,159
to get somebody you're not going to get

1816
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:54,678
a crazy runner from Scotland it's just

1817
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:57,359
going to be harder to find the guy from

1818
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:59,639
Scotland that can outrun the kenyons but

1819
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,319
the fastest guy in the world might be

1820
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:04,800
Scottish he might be Dutch or it could

1821
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:08,000
be whatever but if you are gonna put

1822
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,239
together an Olympic team to to run long

1823
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,359
distance you're going to be like wow

1824
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:13,638
these kenyons are whooping your ass and

1825
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:16,559
that's how it is genetics is genetics so

1826
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:19,199
like you're gonna have you know like pit

1827
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,360
bulls are gonna fight really great but

1828
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,879
it might turn out who that's crazy we

1829
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:26,399
got an aita that just kicked some pit

1830
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,920
bull's asses and it's crazy and that's

1831
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,158
the de same deal with those kind of

1832
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,800
plants so you know that's my take on

1833
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:34,439
like the modern height is like go

1834
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,520
through enough plants find the special

1835
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:40,079
one and you might have that crazy thing

1836
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,440
and that you know it's a mix of those

1837
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:46,119
things that's the I I have a couple

1838
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:47,599
riffs on it I think I mean for one uh

1839
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:49,439
you know he talked about it in the very

1840
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,199
beginning of what he was chatting about

1841
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:56,359
but I almost think ego Clash is more

1842
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:57,559
like endurance Clash okay because if

1843
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:00,920
you're going to

1844
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:03,039
smoke uh you know him and I are both

1845
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,960
mostly flower people too so it would be

1846
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:08,399
really hard for us but if you're going

1847
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,198
to go there and you're going to smoke 42

1848
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:13,839
kinds of what people think of as their

1849
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,678
best hash their best foot forward what

1850
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,880
they're hoping could win and you're

1851
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:22,239
going to smoke 42 kinds of hash in five

1852
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:24,719
hours right you're not really going to

1853
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:26,559
be able to discern much with effect

1854
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,560
because you're just stacking thing on

1855
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,920
top of thing on top of thing on top of

1856
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,719
thing over and over again so really in a

1857
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:37,239
way it's it it's like he said it's about

1858
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:39,158
presentation these guys are hash makers

1859
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:41,678
they know when something looks right

1860
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:44,920
they know when someone hit hit it really

1861
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:48,199
perfect you know um I think a lot of

1862
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,440
times flavor is a lot more important in

1863
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:53,519
these competitions than effect because

1864
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:56,238
you can judge flavor St but H you know

1865
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,080
hash by hash where because effect

1866
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,279
compounds it's like if I'm smoking my

1867
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,639
15th

1868
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:05,639
dab and the and each dab before that was

1869
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:09,520
14 different things and then I'm taking

1870
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:11,039
my 16th dab six minutes later me judging

1871
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,480
whether it's a creeper or whether it

1872
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:16,439
hits me fast or slow or the you're not

1873
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:18,198
it's all just blending in at some point

1874
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:20,198
I mean I'll tell you this when you're

1875
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:23,559
doing a pheno hunt or something you can

1876
01:16:20,198 --> 01:16:25,479
only smell so much weed before like your

1877
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,239
nose is just like you have to take a

1878
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:29,039
break for a while you know or smell some

1879
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:30,519
coffee or something really strong to get

1880
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:33,920
your pallet back

1881
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:36,400
so as far as ego Clash goes I think it's

1882
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,480
become like it's the coolest like

1883
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:41,079
Northern California competition that's

1884
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,799
currently existing since Emerald cup is

1885
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:44,920
shifted to a more corporate thing and

1886
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,520
more south and this and that like what

1887
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:50,520
Brandon does is real and he invites a

1888
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,360
bunch of real hash smokers I think it's

1889
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,600
more of a a flavor and a presentation

1890
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:58,198
competition than it is like what's the

1891
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,120
best hash because no one would say well

1892
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:02,799
I'm going to judge the best hash by

1893
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:06,000
smoking you know eight different kinds

1894
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,560
in hour for five hours in a row like

1895
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,760
what if the best hash is the is is was

1896
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,560
the first but you're on

1897
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:16,239
38 you know like in all those effects

1898
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,800
compound and the other thing I'll say

1899
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:20,399
get just getting back to the genetics

1900
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,639
portion is I don't I think everything

1901
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,519
you're saying about like a lot of

1902
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:27,000
genetics being muddled recently is true

1903
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:30,400
okay and I do think that the classics

1904
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:34,079
are in general a lot quite a bit better

1905
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:37,359
but when it comes to Hash over the last

1906
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:40,399
10 years is really the first 10 years

1907
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,599
that people have been breeding for this

1908
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,879
type of

1909
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,800
extract so as time goes on people are

1910
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,400
washing stuff you can I've seen stuff

1911
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,600
that's amazing

1912
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:53,839
flour but it tastes like a

1913
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,679
tire you know like when you make it into

1914
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,279
rosin and it might make make your brow

1915
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,359
sweat but it doesn't translate and so

1916
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:03,800
what people are doing now is they're

1917
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:06,279
breeding for the medium of

1918
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,039
extraction right for water hash for

1919
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:10,920
freeze drying for treating it in

1920
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,679
different ways and it's not so much

1921
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,039
about how quality the flour is it's

1922
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,520
because you might have some amazing

1923
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,920
flour but like does it wash well what

1924
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,159
does it look like when it's washed how

1925
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,840
when when I put it through these

1926
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:26,439
treatments what does the end product

1927
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:28,639
look like right like I'll tell you that

1928
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:31,238
now a lot of times two terms you hear in

1929
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:33,840
hash all the time is the thing's a

1930
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:36,638
washer or it's a

1931
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,679
dumper right 10 years ago these terms

1932
01:18:36,639 --> 01:18:42,719
did not exist did you ever hear oh that

1933
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:46,239
thing's a washer dude no I mean back in

1934
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:48,119
the day you washed your trim right

1935
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,158
washed your trim so it was all dry so

1936
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,479
most stuff washed because once you let

1937
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:55,319
the resin firm up uh a lot of things

1938
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:58,119
that when they're still green they'll

1939
01:18:55,319 --> 01:19:00,439
melt in the water they would actually do

1940
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:03,119
really you could actually make stuff

1941
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:04,919
like I have things that you can't wash

1942
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,599
fresh but if you wash them once they're

1943
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,079
already dry and that's what Brandon told

1944
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,360
me too he goes you know some of these

1945
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:14,800
things that you can't wash fresh he goes

1946
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:17,719
the reason why that you can't wash them

1947
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,920
fresh is because the resin is so good

1948
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:22,719
that it'll actually with stand drying

1949
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,520
and if you wash it when it's dry instead

1950
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:27,480
you'll get hash that's so good

1951
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,600
that it didn't really need to be washed

1952
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:32,519
when it was wet but you can have you

1953
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,159
know you can have almost a comparable

1954
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:37,239
product off of your dry weed so you just

1955
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:39,238
wash it dry if you really want to get

1956
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:41,799
something off it and I didn't expect him

1957
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:43,799
to say that because I know everything's

1958
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,560
how it's done it's very standard but he

1959
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,400
was like no he's like some of this stuff

1960
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,480
it's worth washing dry that's the only

1961
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:52,158
way you're gonna get it you know so

1962
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:55,959
really for the last five or 10 years is

1963
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:59,439
the first era where cannabis has been

1964
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,399
bred or been being bred specifically for

1965
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,678
how it comes out in the way people are

1966
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:06,559
making hash

1967
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:09,279
today and so you should see strains that

1968
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:12,639
might not be like I mean Skittles is a

1969
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:14,559
premium example okay like Skittles is

1970
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:17,760
not attractive

1971
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,080
flower like you would never like in 2006

1972
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,560
if you had Skittles you know like before

1973
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,960
the hash Revolution like people would

1974
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,080
just look at it and they' think it was

1975
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,439
like b or c Grade weed yeah but it turns

1976
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:30,639
out that like when you put it through

1977
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:32,559
the processes that we use to make rosin

1978
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:35,920
or like really highgrade ice water these

1979
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,320
days it shines and its tur profile gets

1980
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:42,239
concentrated and it's amazing and it's

1981
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:43,920
its effect is heightened and so like I

1982
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:47,799
don't think it's fair to compare strains

1983
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:50,520
of old to strains of now because now

1984
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:53,279
they're breeding things that might suck

1985
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,639
but they're an amazing washer you see

1986
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,479
what I'm saying where before we were

1987
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,079
breeding for like mold resistance or a

1988
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:00,559
certain size or when it was going to

1989
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:03,039
finish you're putting different filters

1990
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,560
on what you want the product to be and

1991
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:09,000
now for the first time ever we're like

1992
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:12,360
what strain makes the most fire water

1993
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,439
has yeah it's a big I was just going to

1994
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:16,359
say it's a big thing of breeding is

1995
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:19,879
actually like what's your goal which

1996
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:22,119
traits are valuable to you so like it

1997
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:25,000
it's not one size fits all it was like

1998
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:27,880
when Tangi was big like you couldn't

1999
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,198
like wash Tangi but if you made BHO of

2000
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,560
it it was amazing and the flow wasn't

2001
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:33,960
very good but I would smell somebody

2002
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,280
dabbing it and I would go what are you

2003
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,520
guys dabbing and they'd be like oh it's

2004
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:40,238
Tangi BHO and I'd be like oh it smells

2005
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,880
so good it smells like you're like

2006
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:45,039
vaporizing grapefruit peels over there

2007
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:48,079
you know it was so cool now they even

2008
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:51,319
advertise like oh this is a 6%

2009
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:53,760
washer because they're breeding things

2010
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:55,039
that like hey if you extract it in this

2011
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,960
form

2012
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:00,319
this stuff not only yields well but

2013
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:03,639
comes out fire yeah right and so in a

2014
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:07,399
way um you're taking people that like me

2015
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:10,239
or or mean jeene that mostly bred flour

2016
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:12,000
okay for flour and now you're getting a

2017
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:13,718
class of breeders that are essentially

2018
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,198
resin

2019
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:18,800
Farmers right they're farming

2020
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:21,359
resin and and not just farming resin

2021
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,360
like he said like Tangi not just farming

2022
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:27,158
resin like but farming resin that works

2023
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:30,158
with with a specific extraction method

2024
01:22:27,158 --> 01:22:31,920
because I'll tell you all those things

2025
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,638
that got entered into ego Clash the

2026
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,039
people that made them the hash makers

2027
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:37,039
that made them they were like oh man

2028
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:39,319
that came out

2029
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:40,479
exceptional that washed and DED look at

2030
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:42,359
the way it looked look at the way it

2031
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:43,799
came out look at the way it you know

2032
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:45,119
what I'm saying so like there's specific

2033
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,960
cultivars that all of a sudden they're

2034
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:51,238
like whoa yeah and it might have

2035
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:54,119
excelled just in that realm but that's

2036
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:55,718
great for that type of competition for

2037
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:58,158
sure it doesn't mean they're breeding

2038
01:22:55,719 --> 01:23:00,000
better weed it just means they're

2039
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,599
putting different selection pressure on

2040
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,880
the weed they're breeding and asking it

2041
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,840
to do different

2042
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,679
things and it might produce better than

2043
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,480
some weed from a long time ago that

2044
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,359
never had those selection pressures put

2045
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:13,399
on

2046
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:15,158
itself do you see what I'm saying yeah

2047
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:18,079
and some of the old things too that

2048
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:20,119
people have that are like real standard

2049
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:22,679
Old Flower Staples that people like to

2050
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:25,719
smoke like you might discover like oh

2051
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:27,920
well you only need to grow like it with

2052
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:30,880
with some of the stuff that I have you

2053
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,480
know um people will be like oh I I'm

2054
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,440
going to do this I'm G to cross it with

2055
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:36,519
this I'm going to make it wash and I'm

2056
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:38,399
like yeah I mean that that'll definitely

2057
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,880
work and I do the same thing where I'm

2058
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,599
like okay I'm going to cross this with

2059
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,440
that like with cherry limeade I did it I

2060
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,360
crossed with a bunch of stuff to try to

2061
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:49,319
figure out one that would get the flavor

2062
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:52,238
and would still wash and um the reality

2063
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:54,759
is though like if you also just go

2064
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,718
through if you just instead of our keep

2065
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,679
looking through a dozen plants if you go

2066
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,399
ahead and look through two or 300

2067
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:03,639
females of some of these things like

2068
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:06,719
lime you'll go oh wow this one is

2069
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:10,199
actually a crazy washer but because you

2070
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:12,800
have never pushed it in that direction

2071
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:15,638
that never became the predominant thing

2072
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,840
that pops out of a population because

2073
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:21,079
who would have thought you were going to

2074
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:24,480
take all your in the 90s and throw it in

2075
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:26,760
while it's still wet and smash it up and

2076
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:29,759
make hash out of it like the weirdest

2077
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,000
idea but then people did it it was great

2078
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,639
and so yeah you don't know those things

2079
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,760
till you try them and so you can still

2080
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:38,239
look through the old things and go oh

2081
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,920
because that's the thing that too I try

2082
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,879
to tell people there isn't new weed we

2083
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:45,560
don't have it there's no new weed that

2084
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,679
trait of having resin that wants to

2085
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,039
break off you have to get it from

2086
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,639
somewhere and it's been here for

2087
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:53,600
thousands of years it's just a matter of

2088
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:56,000
incorporating certain traits into your

2089
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,960
lines like this before scientific

2090
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,560
testing like you were just talking about

2091
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,279
the '90s or back in the day how many

2092
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,560
different things didn't make the cut

2093
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,880
because we're like oh that's not the

2094
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,199
good one but it had like CBG or CBD or

2095
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,679
high levels and we're just like all

2096
01:25:08,198 --> 01:25:11,879
smoking it in joints we're like this is

2097
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:14,880
definitely not the selection so until

2098
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:17,760
you had testing you couldn't select for

2099
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,319
CBG or CBD or C it which it would like

2100
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,639
if you were doing a smoke test you were

2101
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:23,639
like that one didn't hit me the right

2102
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:26,319
way uhuh and so it could be within that

2103
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:28,679
population but until you start selecting

2104
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,599
for those traits and trying to maximize

2105
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:32,719
them and that's what I think is

2106
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,840
happening with hash now is people are

2107
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:38,520
breeding specifically for hash when hash

2108
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:41,319
used to be like a side product to the

2109
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:44,040
flower and and we're now seeing so we

2110
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:47,198
should be seeing people coming up with

2111
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:50,359
really good hashers if you will because

2112
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,118
they've been working on breeding things

2113
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:56,479
for that one

2114
01:25:52,118 --> 01:25:59,158
trait to make really exceptional looking

2115
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:01,919
hash yeah and it sounds funny to people

2116
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:04,479
now but back in the day hash that was

2117
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:07,079
really really high quality nobody knew

2118
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:10,439
how to smoke it if you had really really

2119
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:13,800
good hash so here's a funny thing I I'm

2120
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:17,439
my friend Felix his his father was

2121
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:20,560
Reinhardt Delp and he was the guy who

2122
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:24,678
patented ice water hash extracting in

2123
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:27,039
the 90s and as far back as 94 95 I was

2124
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:30,000
riding in the car in high school at

2125
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:32,679
lunch with Felix and Felix is like hey I

2126
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,880
got some hash and Felix pulls out his

2127
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:36,600
hash and you hold his hash up and you

2128
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,440
can look through it like a piece of

2129
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,560
glass and I go this is Hash how would

2130
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:42,879
you make hash like this he goes my dad

2131
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,920
he extracts it he uses cold water he

2132
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:49,239
uses ice and water to be able to make

2133
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,118
this and I was like wow okay it's crazy

2134
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:55,319
and I didn't realize but yeah he was he

2135
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:58,639
was he was using fresh wheat so no doubt

2136
01:26:55,319 --> 01:27:00,960
that hash didn't explode until all I

2137
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:04,000
like call them the acutron all the

2138
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:06,198
various bangers all the various scrapers

2139
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,840
all the ways to heat it learning what

2140
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:09,519
temps to do like we were talking about

2141
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,119
cherry red bangers when they first

2142
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,800
started and arsonic and cyanide learning

2143
01:27:12,118 --> 01:27:16,839
what temps they needed to safely be at

2144
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:20,360
learning how to heat the Banger not

2145
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,760
chazzing the Banger it had to go through

2146
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:25,960
like he was saying we when we first

2147
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:27,679
smoked BHO we lit like these charcoal

2148
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,279
you know like you didn't really or you

2149
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:33,520
smeared it on top of weed you didn't

2150
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:36,198
have any of the gear that people

2151
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:39,159
consider essential today there was no TP

2152
01:27:36,198 --> 01:27:41,559
slurpers there was no like hash pearls

2153
01:27:39,158 --> 01:27:44,638
there was no glp mops to Cle like there

2154
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:47,239
was none of any of that that all had to

2155
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:51,000
develop once like the little industry

2156
01:27:47,238 --> 01:27:53,439
sort of happened just two kitchen knives

2157
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,920
yeah hot knives knives yeah hot knives

2158
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:57,519
you know yeah I I I had a buddy who used

2159
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,399
to make a lot of oil and he was the one

2160
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,239
who showed me how to make BHO back

2161
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:04,079
around 2000 and he was the f I had never

2162
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:06,319
heard of it I didn't know anything about

2163
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,359
it and he was like this is what this is

2164
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:12,279
a technique that people use they use

2165
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:14,679
Liquid gases to extract things from

2166
01:28:12,279 --> 01:28:16,960
plants and this is something that they

2167
01:28:14,679 --> 01:28:18,960
do and it can be used for weed and I was

2168
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,639
like wow that's crazy D and so he like

2169
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,279
showed me yeah this is what you do and

2170
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:26,279
use the butane and all that and so back

2171
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:28,840
then there was no way to smoke it so

2172
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:30,880
what we used to do is take a bong with a

2173
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,239
pretty good siiz bowl and we would pack

2174
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,000
it full of weed and we would sit there

2175
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:39,759
and we would smoke the weed gently so it

2176
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,760
wouldn't snap until all there was was

2177
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:45,800
Ash until no matter what you did you

2178
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:48,760
couldn't get any uh smoke to come off

2179
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:51,560
the ash or the bowl and that Ash would

2180
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:54,760
basically just be a scaffolding that

2181
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:56,520
would be left just straight nothing but

2182
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,840
carbon that could not burn because it

2183
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:01,719
had already lost all the carbohydrates

2184
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:05,600
and everything out of it and then we

2185
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:08,399
would drip using a um using a a safety

2186
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:11,199
pin unfolded we would we would heat with

2187
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:14,479
the torch drip it until you had

2188
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:16,439
reconstituted the Ash and and made it be

2189
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:18,839
made it have oil in it then you would

2190
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:20,479
use the torch to heat the ash which was

2191
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,880
completely neutral it couldn't burn

2192
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:24,759
because you'd already taken everything

2193
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:28,199
out of it and then you would be a ble to

2194
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:30,800
just vaporize the hash oil back out of

2195
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:32,919
the Ash and you would get clean hash oil

2196
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,279
burning that way I holding the torch

2197
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:36,880
really far away from it a torch lighter

2198
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,118
but then what he figured out which

2199
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:42,159
people have started to do more only over

2200
01:29:39,118 --> 01:29:44,519
the last couple years was the cold start

2201
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,799
which was not what we called it so what

2202
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,199
he would do was he would take like the

2203
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,159
meth pipes that had the bubble on the

2204
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:54,599
end that or a big bubble of glass with a

2205
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,960
little hole on the top and we would heat

2206
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,440
them with the torch until you could bend

2207
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:02,198
it so that it could sit in the bong as a

2208
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:04,678
down a down tube and then the bubble

2209
01:30:02,198 --> 01:30:07,599
would go out straight from the bong and

2210
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:09,520
then we would put the oil in that and

2211
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,199
then through the hole on the top and

2212
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,119
then we would use the torch on the

2213
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,359
bottom to heat it until you see the

2214
01:30:13,118 --> 01:30:17,359
vapor come off of it and you would only

2215
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,599
have to have about this much vapor in

2216
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:21,238
the bong and you would hit it and it

2217
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,199
would be the biggest bong hit you ever

2218
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:27,118
had from the tiniest little amount but

2219
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:30,158
it was cold start cold start honey oil

2220
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:32,118
uh bong hits and it was the most crazy

2221
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:34,559
potent after you smoke that for a little

2222
01:30:32,118 --> 01:30:37,399
bit you don't get high off of anything

2223
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:40,800
else it's all you can really smoke and

2224
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:42,479
um that was like the coolest thing to us

2225
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,880
because we were like dude you could make

2226
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:47,279
it off of weed that was just like he he

2227
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,000
told me he's like you know when you're

2228
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,279
smoking and you pull off the little

2229
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
leaves and you have all the little stems

2230
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,519
and all that he's all don't throw all

2231
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,359
that on the tray is I'll set up a little

2232
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,800
jar and as you're going through fill up

2233
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:00,799
that jar and when you get done you'll

2234
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,920
have a whole bunch of it and you can

2235
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,400
blast it and you'll have the same

2236
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:08,199
quality of this honey oil that we're

2237
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:10,599
smoking and I was like who what a trip

2238
01:31:08,198 --> 01:31:13,118
and so we used to just sit there and

2239
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:15,520
smoke that and what would happen was

2240
01:31:13,118 --> 01:31:17,238
because of cold starting it in there it

2241
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,239
would also be an interesting

2242
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:21,198
distillation process to where when you

2243
01:31:19,238 --> 01:31:23,279
would get to the end of it you would

2244
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:24,960
notice that you might get it might be

2245
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,639
like a little bit bit left that was a

2246
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,198
little extra runny and like green

2247
01:31:27,639 --> 01:31:31,560
especially because he would make hone he

2248
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:34,118
would make hash oil the old school way

2249
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:36,920
using like alcohol and purifying it

2250
01:31:34,118 --> 01:31:39,198
through uh charcoal filters and doing

2251
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,920
all this filtration process and then you

2252
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:42,839
know so not with butane regular

2253
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,319
traditional hash oil and when you would

2254
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,840
get to the end of that there would be

2255
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:48,840
this little fraction there that would be

2256
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,639
like you could tell it wasn't as good as

2257
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,760
the rest and if you smoked it it would

2258
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,719
be a little more harsh so when you got

2259
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:57,239
to this certain point you'd notice it

2260
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,279
get a little bit extra runny and have a

2261
01:31:57,238 --> 01:32:01,158
little bit of a off color and we would

2262
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:03,599
tip it over and heat it out until it all

2263
01:32:01,158 --> 01:32:06,198
dripped out and get it clean and then we

2264
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,800
would put the fresh stuff in and it was

2265
01:32:06,198 --> 01:32:11,238
the biggest pain in the ass and you

2266
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,079
couldn't sell the [Â __Â ] nobody wanted it

2267
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:14,759
you tried to figure out like guys this

2268
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:17,359
is the most you've never been this

2269
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:20,119
blasted but you couldn't do anything

2270
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:21,880
with it and that I think was why people

2271
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:24,198
at a certain point started making

2272
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,400
[Â __Â ] moon rocks because you're you

2273
01:32:24,198 --> 01:32:28,000
got to put it on something right like

2274
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,920
there's got to be a way to smoke this

2275
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:35,439
[Â __Â ] so we would like drip it on joints

2276
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:38,520
and now people make like um make like uh

2277
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:41,198
why is my my my mind slipping right now

2278
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,880
but the oh the hash hole joints you know

2279
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,839
or stuff like that when it's too melty

2280
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:48,920
you got to put it in somewhere where it

2281
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,679
can soak into something but back then

2282
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,118
people just really didn't know how to do

2283
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:56,079
it so breeding for it would have been

2284
01:32:53,118 --> 01:32:58,238
like the goof [Â __Â ] you could ever do

2285
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,600
because you're not going to be able to

2286
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:02,439
sell it and tell everybody bro just bend

2287
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:05,360
a meth pipe they're gonna be like what

2288
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:06,799
the [Â __Â ] are you talking about a t

2289
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:10,000
nobody

2290
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:13,239
wants weed but now that's the standard

2291
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,760
like people care SM and crack it's fine

2292
01:33:13,238 --> 01:33:18,879
you know it's crazy I guess say I guess

2293
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:22,320
you could say in closing that weed

2294
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:25,239
breeding for hash making is

2295
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:27,198
advancing the ear and the acutron and

2296
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:29,799
the stuff that they use and the way that

2297
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:32,319
we consume hash also seems to change now

2298
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:34,960
every two or three years and the cool

2299
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:37,519
thing about ego clash and the way the

2300
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:39,239
reason why I like the name is because it

2301
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:42,639
is a bunch of

2302
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:45,439
hashm perfectionist judges who are all

2303
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:48,118
judging each other and even though the

2304
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,960
tech and the breeding changes every few

2305
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:52,759
years because it's a young enough

2306
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:55,359
industry that as people find out new

2307
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,800
better ways of doing things it spreads

2308
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:00,839
wildly it's pretty cool in that sense

2309
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:03,199
because they are pushing it forward and

2310
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:07,039
it's not a mature industry yet so

2311
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:08,599
there's lots of change every few years

2312
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:10,079
there's new pieces of gear people

2313
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,440
weren't using there's different ways

2314
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:15,238
like he was saying cold starts we've

2315
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:18,479
gone from 900 degree Cherry glowing

2316
01:34:15,238 --> 01:34:20,599
bangers to cold starts to different Tech

2317
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:22,439
to how you heat it up to how you this

2318
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:24,400
like and that's probably going to keep

2319
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:26,960
happening for a while

2320
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:29,319
until the Arc of improvements

2321
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,760
slows and then like the generally

2322
01:34:29,319 --> 01:34:35,000
accepted practices because that Arc has

2323
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:37,920
slow just spread and nobody's able to

2324
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,800
make Leaps and Bounds advancements big

2325
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:43,000
right now it's young enough that Leaps

2326
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:47,079
and Bounds happen every couple years and

2327
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,039
I would expect for breeding that hash

2328
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:51,479
would probably like there's still Leaps

2329
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:53,238
and Bounds and hash breeding just like

2330
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:56,399
he was saying Brandon figuring out that

2331
01:34:53,238 --> 01:34:59,638
like some things wash better dry some

2332
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:01,759
things wash better fresh there's a lot

2333
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:04,279
of tech and information they're going to

2334
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,960
get about how to treat certain strains

2335
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:09,719
of weed to maximize what they can do for

2336
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:12,000
you in the little jar for sure so it's

2337
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:13,520
so there's a lot of change and there's a

2338
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,960
lot of advancement and it's all

2339
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,600
happening pretty quick and the ego Clash

2340
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,158
I think is a really good venue for

2341
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,760
people that are really knowledgeable to

2342
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:25,399
get together and shoot the [Â __Â ] and see

2343
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,960
what they think is their

2344
01:35:25,399 --> 01:35:31,198
top and somewhere right now somebody's

2345
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:33,880
sitting on the genetics that are the

2346
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:36,559
very best new hash plant that's the

2347
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:38,480
crazy stuff you know and if it wins a

2348
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,520
couple things then it'll be maybe the

2349
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,638
new hype genetics and we'll be like well

2350
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,480
what are so what is this stuff but it's

2351
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,239
like it has the Merit and so it's what

2352
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:49,718
you want for these traits and somebody's

2353
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:52,599
sitting on them right now and has had

2354
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:55,760
them forever just like I'm like you guys

2355
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:58,760
just figured out cold start like that

2356
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:00,480
it's 25 years fellas you know like we

2357
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:02,840
were doing this so long ago that I

2358
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:05,158
didn't even think to like I was like oh

2359
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:06,679
this must this is how people do it now I

2360
01:36:05,158 --> 01:36:08,839
don't I never understood why people

2361
01:36:06,679 --> 01:36:11,079
didn't just put the hash in there first

2362
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:13,000
and then heat it up I'm like you guys

2363
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:14,880
think of that it works really good we

2364
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,039
were doing it a long time ago it was

2365
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,719
great you know you get it's just like

2366
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:22,118
when you barely tort your bong hit you

2367
01:36:19,719 --> 01:36:24,520
just barely heat it up and you just get

2368
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:27,599
some and then when I saw people do it I

2369
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:29,280
was like all right there it's back you

2370
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,760
know it's a Trippy thing and the same

2371
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:34,359
with the same with the genetics like

2372
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,880
people realize like oh [Â __Â ] you can wash

2373
01:36:34,359 --> 01:36:40,279
Sour Diesel like yeah you can and so if

2374
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:42,199
you mix that with you know runts and

2375
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:43,920
then you have some Sour runs and you

2376
01:36:42,198 --> 01:36:45,479
grow 200 of them then all of a sudden

2377
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,719
you have something and you're like it's

2378
01:36:45,479 --> 01:36:49,198
it's it's just these two dumb things and

2379
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:51,439
you're like yeah but wait till you see

2380
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:54,399
this plant you know and that's what

2381
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:56,359
happens it's awesome

2382
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:59,439
that's it love it so many so many

2383
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:01,880
Fantastic points there and I like the uh

2384
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:04,198
the Monica the endurance Clash that it

2385
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,560
certainly makes sense why the Tes would

2386
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:09,879
help you to shine through but I could

2387
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,080
not smoke 42 kinds of hash that quality

2388
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:15,039
in five hours and not probably feel like

2389
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:17,158
I was floating in order to judge it you

2390
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:19,519
have to smoke hashes you're you probably

2391
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:22,759
don't smoke flour very much you're

2392
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:27,080
probably smoking hash all day long to

2393
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:29,360
train to be able to smoke uh 42 kinds of

2394
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:31,880
extremely high-grade hash in a very

2395
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:33,920
short period of time even with a homie

2396
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:36,359
with you to like help you breathe and

2397
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,399
take some oxygen every now and again

2398
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:40,158
yeah he's just got like the face mask I

2399
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,079
did the math you got to take a dab every

2400
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:44,079
seven and a half minutes so that's what

2401
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:46,079
I'm saying yeah and all of them are some

2402
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,319
of the highest grade hash in

2403
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:50,238
California you're probably like as high

2404
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:55,079
as you're going to get by like H like

2405
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:57,799
hit six or seven and you've got 35 to go

2406
01:37:55,079 --> 01:38:00,559
you know that's it well look one last

2407
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:02,800
point of view I want to take a look at

2408
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:05,199
before we move on from the blockberry is

2409
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:08,000
I want to put it out there that at this

2410
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:10,719
point I think blockberry should be

2411
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
considered Elite genetics my reason for

2412
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:15,840
that is that there are at least three

2413
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,599
different cuttings that have emerged

2414
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:21,719
from a relatively small F1 pool of seeds

2415
01:38:19,599 --> 01:38:24,520
each one of these Cups has won each one

2416
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:27,039
of these cuting has won multiple cups

2417
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,520
and uh the the extra thing I'll add

2418
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,319
because I would agree with what you said

2419
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,920
notto dog about the hash being breed for

2420
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,799
that it's actually one cups in the

2421
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,560
flower category it's actually won more

2422
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,760
cups in the flower category than the

2423
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:41,480
hash category it's done both so I'm not

2424
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:44,119
aware of any strain that has produced as

2425
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:47,079
many cuttings that have all three three

2426
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:49,519
cuts each of them won multiple Cuts cups

2427
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:51,599
God that's a tongue twister um and so

2428
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,440
yeah I'm interested to hear any thoughts

2429
01:38:51,599 --> 01:38:57,000
disagree agree

2430
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:59,238
my definition of Elites is just

2431
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,439
basically it doesn't have to be everyone

2432
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:03,559
because it's almost never everyone but a

2433
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:06,479
decent percentage of knowledgeable

2434
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:09,599
smokers all agree that this is

2435
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:10,959
fire like that to me is an elite like

2436
01:39:09,599 --> 01:39:13,079
you can have Elites that aren't your

2437
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,560
preference but you still agree that

2438
01:39:13,079 --> 01:39:16,158
they're really high quality maybe you

2439
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,159
don't like the flavor of the high but

2440
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:20,638
like a bunch of your friends love it and

2441
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,439
you trust what they you know so I would

2442
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,279
say yeah like if once you've started

2443
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:26,118
winning multiple Awards with flower and

2444
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:29,158
hash and you've got multiple fenos

2445
01:39:26,118 --> 01:39:32,439
coming out of the same line um obviously

2446
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:36,519
that line can throw out some fire you

2447
01:39:32,439 --> 01:39:40,039
know for sure yeah I'm always I'm always

2448
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:43,880
impressed honestly when there's any seed

2449
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:49,760
line that has more than one

2450
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:52,000
plant that you even hear about because

2451
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,920
for the most part things that people put

2452
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,679
out they can even be

2453
01:39:53,920 --> 01:40:00,719
I've made a lot of crosses and um a lot

2454
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:03,079
of them you know like basically

2455
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,840
everything that I put out someone will

2456
01:40:03,079 --> 01:40:07,559
hit me up and they'll say that it's

2457
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:09,440
their favorite but just because that's

2458
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,560
the case doesn't mean that I'm ever

2459
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,678
going to hear about it anywhere I heard

2460
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:16,840
about it because I made it somebody

2461
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:18,679
contacted me about it directly other

2462
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:20,599
people didn't hear [Â __Â ] about that plant

2463
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:22,679
like maybe if they're friends with that

2464
01:40:20,599 --> 01:40:24,880
person but for something that really

2465
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:27,639
Rings back bells and there's more than

2466
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,960
one that came out of a line and like

2467
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:33,079
like naos talked about this before

2468
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:35,439
there's like nl5 Hayes there's multiple

2469
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:37,920
cuts that are like Famous Cuts where

2470
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:39,479
you're like that's that electric boogalo

2471
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,960
these Pips these different things you're

2472
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:45,198
like okay so that thing is a crazy like

2473
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:47,960
a true real elite like I did a cross

2474
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:49,759
that I did like I put out P cream and

2475
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,719
there's one cut that skunk Tech

2476
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:54,800
circulated and it's really great and

2477
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:56,960
then these people hit me up from England

2478
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,159
and they're like oh my God this thing's

2479
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,800
crazy and then this other guy hit me up

2480
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:02,719
from England and he's like this is the

2481
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,400
craziest cut and I'm like where' you get

2482
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,118
it is it theirs and he's all no it came

2483
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:08,960
from my buddy he popped it and I was

2484
01:41:06,118 --> 01:41:10,759
like okay and then another guy I'm like

2485
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,079
this is this the one that you got from

2486
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,400
that did you get it from skunk Tech and

2487
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:15,439
he's like no my buddy popped it from

2488
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:17,839
seed and I'm like okay so this is a

2489
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:20,638
really really good seed line it has more

2490
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:23,719
than one plant yeah where while I'm

2491
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:26,359
looking around people are talking about

2492
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:28,118
it and so you can tell like there's good

2493
01:41:26,359 --> 01:41:30,639
stuff that went into that and in that

2494
01:41:28,118 --> 01:41:33,559
particular case I made tons of crosses

2495
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:35,679
with that mail and a lot of the crosses

2496
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:37,360
there's a couple people who hit me up

2497
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:39,639
and they're like I love this it's my

2498
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:42,479
favorite it's really good but I don't

2499
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:44,840
hear about those ones but the p scam

2500
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,718
because of just the way that it meshed

2501
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,960
there was a lot of people who found

2502
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:51,198
things where that where they're talking

2503
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,480
about it I see it being reviewed I see

2504
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:56,118
it get mentioned in multiple places and

2505
01:41:53,479 --> 01:41:58,799
I'm like okay this is killer but you

2506
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:01,839
know the flower sure but they're not

2507
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:04,320
washing at a level that it's winning

2508
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,440
hash cups too because it's too greasy

2509
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:07,960
it's not producing so if you have

2510
01:42:06,439 --> 01:42:10,319
something where it's winning a whole

2511
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:12,599
bunch of flower cups a whole bunch of

2512
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:15,359
hash cups you're hearing about it all

2513
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:17,599
over the place it's like if that's not

2514
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:20,759
Elite then there's no such thing as

2515
01:42:17,599 --> 01:42:22,520
Elite like it you have to you you it

2516
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,639
doesn't matter who made it or whether

2517
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:26,800
you like the flavor you think e that's

2518
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,239
not I don't like that kind of [Â __Â ] it's

2519
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:32,239
like you objectively you have to say

2520
01:42:29,238 --> 01:42:35,879
yeah this is a real crazy thing because

2521
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:38,678
it's it's bomb like I used or even like

2522
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:40,520
shout out to like you know a JJ at top

2523
01:42:38,679 --> 01:42:43,719
dog because like take stardog for

2524
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:47,159
instance which is older but still modern

2525
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:49,239
there's the Corey Haim there's the guava

2526
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:51,000
there's the Kate Upton there's probably

2527
01:42:49,238 --> 01:42:53,359
one or two there's at least three or

2528
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,118
four fos

2529
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:58,679
heard of them there's at least three or

2530
01:42:55,118 --> 01:43:01,559
four named fenos that are still traded

2531
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:04,480
and available at clone Sellers as of

2532
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,920
right now that you know he made that 15

2533
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:07,919
years ago or whatever and it's still

2534
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,840
bouncing around and it popped from

2535
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:13,639
multiple different people and JJ never

2536
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:15,840
found any of those fenos that was all

2537
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:17,400
found in seed he sold and then people

2538
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,239
found something they loved and we're

2539
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:23,238
like hey this is and people might know

2540
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:26,678
the Corey name and they don't they've

2541
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:29,039
never heard of starg they're like I have

2542
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:30,359
that like oh that's the or the and

2543
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:32,238
you're like yeah that's starg and

2544
01:43:30,359 --> 01:43:35,039
they're like what starg it's like they

2545
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:38,238
know the cut more than the cross and

2546
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,560
that shows a disconnect from like

2547
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:41,359
something like I'm saying where people

2548
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,800
hit me up directly and go dude I bought

2549
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:45,198
your seeds and I found this thing and

2550
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:48,920
it's really good there's still a connect

2551
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:50,960
there where it it's still close to home

2552
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:53,520
but there's these Cuts where like the

2553
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,599
electric Baloo where it's like holy [Â __Â ]

2554
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,360
it's like yeah it's nl5 Haze but the

2555
01:43:55,599 --> 01:43:59,639
people who have it don't even know that

2556
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:02,079
because it stands alone you don't have

2557
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:04,760
to know that it's this legendary Cross

2558
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:07,760
or this popular Cross or a breeder that

2559
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:10,960
you respect made it or whatever it is

2560
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:12,880
just Elite weed it just is that good

2561
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:14,760
where it rings Bells where you're like

2562
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:18,000
yeah that's that thing and that's you

2563
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:21,239
know that's uh yeah I think I'll say one

2564
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,880
final thing on it maybe back in the day

2565
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:25,439
not to talk back in the day but back in

2566
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,480
the day the way that any Elite happened

2567
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:29,638
was it basically sort of happened semi-

2568
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:32,279
organically where it just spread amongst

2569
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:35,560
different heads and it really only got

2570
01:44:32,279 --> 01:44:37,359
popular if enough people loved it that

2571
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:39,840
there could be demand for it and people

2572
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:41,598
wanted it and so now we have sort of a

2573
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,199
situation with this modern marketing

2574
01:44:41,599 --> 01:44:45,119
that we talked about a little earlier in

2575
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:48,198
the chat where people can like

2576
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:50,279
manufacture Elites so there's going to

2577
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:53,079
be ones that like get pumped up and

2578
01:44:50,279 --> 01:44:58,800
hyped but don't stand the test of time

2579
01:44:53,079 --> 01:45:01,399
the real to me test of an elite is 15 20

2580
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,039
years later is it still desirable those

2581
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:06,238
things we were talking about those hazes

2582
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:08,800
those hazes are old really old they're

2583
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:11,158
still desirable yeah you know JJ was

2584
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,639
releasing stardog in like 08 or I you

2585
01:45:11,158 --> 01:45:14,559
know it was a long time ago they're

2586
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:16,599
still traded and popular people still

2587
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,199
want them so it's the same thing with

2588
01:45:16,599 --> 01:45:21,039
like music right like is it going to be

2589
01:45:18,198 --> 01:45:22,799
a flash in the pan or is it going to be

2590
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:23,479
20 years later people are still buying

2591
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,400
the

2592
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:30,079
album because you know it is and so

2593
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:33,198
there's a certain amount the real true

2594
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:36,439
Elites the only thing that that that

2595
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:37,719
separates them is time so probably this

2596
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:39,319
stuff you're talking about right now

2597
01:45:37,719 --> 01:45:41,158
that just won the hash competition if

2598
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:44,000
it's got multiple fenos that are doing

2599
01:45:41,158 --> 01:45:46,879
amazing in flower and hash competitions

2600
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,639
it's on its way and if it's a real true

2601
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:51,639
amazing Elite then people will be

2602
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,279
wanting it 10 or 15 years from now yeah

2603
01:45:51,639 --> 01:45:56,039
and it's going to parent it's going to

2604
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:58,479
parent future Elites you know that's

2605
01:45:56,039 --> 01:46:01,158
that's how it works yeah they spawn F

2606
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:04,079
they spawn families yeah it's like you

2607
01:46:01,158 --> 01:46:07,000
said there's you there's the plant then

2608
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:08,719
there's the the smoker and the grower

2609
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,158
who's like hey can I get that plant

2610
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,880
because I want to grow it and I want to

2611
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:15,319
smoke it then there's the buyer who's

2612
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:18,400
like I want to buy that [Â __Â ] from you

2613
01:46:15,319 --> 01:46:20,519
and then there's more Growers who are

2614
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:23,238
like I gotta get that because the buyers

2615
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:25,800
want to buy it from me and then just

2616
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,158
keeps on going like that and so it's

2617
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:32,199
it's like when people try to downplay

2618
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:35,439
anything that is really really popular

2619
01:46:32,198 --> 01:46:38,559
and say that it's only hype I always

2620
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:41,039
tell them like maybe it's running

2621
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:44,119
partially on hype and maybe it's

2622
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:46,960
overrated and there's too much hype but

2623
01:46:44,118 --> 01:46:51,079
I've seen plenty of people take a plant

2624
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:53,639
and go oh this is the one right here and

2625
01:46:51,079 --> 01:46:56,519
sorry but it has

2626
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:59,199
actually like people have to like it if

2627
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:02,520
they don't like it you can't just create

2628
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:04,279
a whole big movement of people really

2629
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:07,679
wanting this stuff it was like the case

2630
01:47:04,279 --> 01:47:10,079
with cookies at first PE some people had

2631
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:12,520
it some people didn't and a lot of

2632
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:14,800
people were like it's [Â __Â ] none of

2633
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:16,880
this is any good and I was like yeah

2634
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,159
whatever and I was given animal cookies

2635
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:22,560
and I didn't even flower it and I

2636
01:47:19,158 --> 01:47:24,559
finally flowered it and a dude showed up

2637
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:27,159
who didn't who had never even heard of

2638
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,719
cookies and looked at it and was like

2639
01:47:27,158 --> 01:47:30,559
I'll give you like double what I'll give

2640
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,239
you for anything else for that [Â __Â ]

2641
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:35,360
right there and I was like oh you have

2642
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:37,319
people who want it and he goes no dude I

2643
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:39,799
just want it I just know what it is I

2644
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:43,238
can just take one look at that [Â __Â ] and

2645
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:45,960
I just it's animal cookies I I want it

2646
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:48,118
like that's what I I need all that what

2647
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:50,399
do you got of that and I was like oh

2648
01:47:48,118 --> 01:47:52,000
[Â __Â ] okay and I already knew it was good

2649
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,039
I knew it had a lot of resin because the

2650
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,158
pound was like this big I was like yeah

2651
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:57,920
it's good then I smoked it and I was

2652
01:47:56,158 --> 01:48:00,319
like okay I actually got high and it

2653
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:02,359
kind of made me feel a little weird I

2654
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:04,639
smoked some of it like backstage at reg

2655
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:07,920
on the river and I kind of was a little

2656
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,800
bit like weirded out and I was smoking

2657
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,158
really heavy at the time and I was like

2658
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:14,480
all right there's a lot of something in

2659
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:17,000
this it's definitely not totally normal

2660
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:19,319
and then I went okay I just need to

2661
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,319
accept that the reason this got so

2662
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:23,799
popular in the Bay Area was because it's

2663
01:48:21,319 --> 01:48:25,639
pretty good [Â __Â ] weed and and after

2664
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:27,360
all said and done I'm still like yeah

2665
01:48:25,639 --> 01:48:28,760
it's really good and I've seen a lot of

2666
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:30,118
cookies that I thought sucked and I've

2667
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:32,920
seen a lot of stuff related that I

2668
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:34,880
didn't think was that good but I've

2669
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:36,520
never seen anything that got the only

2670
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:39,599
thing that I can think of that got

2671
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:41,719
really big for a little wave that always

2672
01:48:39,599 --> 01:48:45,159
pops up as being the same one everybody

2673
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:48,520
always mentions is purple punch and

2674
01:48:45,158 --> 01:48:50,279
still I still look at it like or the

2675
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:52,840
other one too that you would know from

2676
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:55,920
up here was Barry White yeah but there's

2677
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:58,279
still and nope sorry let's go one more

2678
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,639
deeper and go to that old flow cut that

2679
01:48:58,279 --> 01:49:03,519
everybody renamed Blackberry Blackberry

2680
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:07,079
cush yeah and they sold the hell out of

2681
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:09,480
that and it totally was th those those

2682
01:49:07,079 --> 01:49:12,039
plants are the ones that was like there

2683
01:49:09,479 --> 01:49:15,799
was something so good about him that it

2684
01:49:12,039 --> 01:49:18,000
tricked everybody but it wasn't even

2685
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:20,560
back th those ones were organically

2686
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,920
hyped before the purple purple punch was

2687
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:24,719
internet hype I feel like from

2688
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:27,000
photographs yeah but like the the

2689
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:29,520
Blackberry was hyped because the grower

2690
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,319
loved to grow it the smoker if you're

2691
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,159
already smoking a bunch of Stony dope

2692
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:36,639
and you try it like back in the day I

2693
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:38,439
couldn't notice if weed wasn't strong

2694
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:40,199
because I just smoked three joints of

2695
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:44,118
some other [Â __Â ] that was real strong and

2696
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:46,198
I'm smoking BHO and bubble hash and dry

2697
01:49:44,118 --> 01:49:48,359
seed hash and I'm just like sitting here

2698
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:50,439
smoking everything and you smoke a joint

2699
01:49:48,359 --> 01:49:52,839
you're like oh that's tasty yeah you're

2700
01:49:50,439 --> 01:49:54,799
not going to go oh I'm not high cuz

2701
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:56,880
still running off the high from the last

2702
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,440
two hours of smoking five different

2703
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:02,118
types of [Â __Â ] and you're just convinced

2704
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:04,039
oh it's great and then buyers start

2705
01:50:02,118 --> 01:50:06,079
getting it who only have a little bag of

2706
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:08,840
weed and they're

2707
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:11,760
like this doesn't do anything and you're

2708
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:13,239
like it does I smoke it in the morning

2709
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,960
you smoke it in the morning and nothing

2710
01:50:13,238 --> 01:50:16,479
happens and you learn like real Elites

2711
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,560
like this is kind of crazy too like you

2712
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:20,198
can take Sour Diesel for a minute

2713
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:23,119
there's probably going to be real Elites

2714
01:50:20,198 --> 01:50:25,000
that like are in fashion they go out of

2715
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:28,158
fashion but then they're so good that

2716
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,840
they come back into fashion again later

2717
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:31,679
because it's like there was enough

2718
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,560
downtime where a bunch of new smokers

2719
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:35,679
come in and they're like what is that

2720
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:39,239
and that kind of

2721
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:41,239
happen yeah sour the OG the sour like

2722
01:50:39,238 --> 01:50:43,678
it's just like you know Led Zeppelin

2723
01:50:41,238 --> 01:50:45,519
made its last album in 1979 but there's

2724
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:49,679
some kid in high school that's like

2725
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:51,239
Blown Away by two and like they just

2726
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:53,480
can't and like they're gonna go out

2727
01:50:51,238 --> 01:50:56,759
there and so it like Reg grabs new

2728
01:50:53,479 --> 01:50:58,479
people so to me that's what an elite is

2729
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:02,039
it's like something that stands the test

2730
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:04,479
of time because you can hype whatever

2731
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:08,000
but like over time the only thing that

2732
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:10,238
will keep it that good is it it having

2733
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,560
an organic base of people that think

2734
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:16,598
it's amazing yeah in in a

2735
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:19,280
nutshell 100% you know the uh the

2736
01:51:16,599 --> 01:51:21,679
checklist to Greatness is not short by

2737
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,960
any means and while we're talking about

2738
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:25,960
special plants that works out nicely

2739
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:29,158
because I wanted to chat about a very

2740
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:32,078
special plant the USDA has recently

2741
01:51:29,158 --> 01:51:35,359
approved a genetically modified cannabis

2742
01:51:32,078 --> 01:51:38,920
or hemp plant that produces neither THC

2743
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:41,319
nor CBD The Strain nubbed dubbed Badger

2744
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,239
G does not produce either and instead

2745
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:45,599
only produces

2746
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:47,598
CBG it's actually the second plant to

2747
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:49,520
get approved that's genetically modified

2748
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:51,960
after another plant that just produces

2749
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:54,400
very low levels of THC and CBD was

2750
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:55,960
approved this strain was developed by

2751
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:58,359
the University of Wisconsin and they

2752
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:02,520
created it by knocking out a critical

2753
01:51:58,359 --> 01:52:03,960
Gene called cannabidiolic acid synthes

2754
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:07,560
which is a gene which essentially

2755
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:11,480
bottlenecks the conversion of CBG into

2756
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:13,800
THC or CBD thus the plant is not capable

2757
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:16,238
of producing either I guess I'd love to

2758
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:18,599
know anyone have any thoughts about this

2759
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:20,718
any concerns where are we headed next

2760
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:22,560
and do we have any concern about cross

2761
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:25,359
pollination with this one I wonder with

2762
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:29,039
the normal THC producing

2763
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:32,799
plants I mean with the dangers of THC

2764
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:35,439
and CBD being so high I'm actually

2765
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:37,960
campaigning for us to genetically modify

2766
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:40,399
a plant that actually doesn't produce a

2767
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,319
plant I've already invented it and I've

2768
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:45,960
completely modified it it's called

2769
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:48,238
invisible girl um I dropped it years ago

2770
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,760
and it's actually really popular you

2771
01:52:48,238 --> 01:52:55,238
don't seem to really see it on the

2772
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:58,400
market but um it is invisible so that's

2773
01:52:55,238 --> 01:53:00,238
big and it's not even normally invisible

2774
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:05,000
there's things that are invisible that

2775
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:07,919
you can still actually touch but this is

2776
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
actually interdimensionally invisible

2777
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:14,279
and I I've patented that term and

2778
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,520
trademarked and term and and uh yeah the

2779
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:19,078
terminology I also invented the uh

2780
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:22,679
patenting of terminology or invisible

2781
01:53:19,078 --> 01:53:25,359
girl and it's outstanding and it's fully

2782
01:53:22,679 --> 01:53:27,319
safe it doesn't have all the it the harm

2783
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:31,399
reduction is significant when compared

2784
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:33,759
to THC or CBD which are historic air is

2785
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:36,039
much healthier

2786
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,000
chemicals yeah and so we're just

2787
01:53:36,039 --> 01:53:40,840
basically I just figured you know while

2788
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:45,118
we're at it let's just do away with the

2789
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:47,639
whole thing and uh and we're GNA um you

2790
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:53,078
know it's amazing like it's it's just

2791
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:54,800
the best so you know that's my like just

2792
01:53:53,078 --> 01:53:58,000
that's while we're doing it like let's

2793
01:53:54,800 --> 01:54:00,400
just get rid of the you know THC let's

2794
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,319
just have weed with no CBD we should get

2795
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:04,679
rid of the fiber you know let's get rid

2796
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:07,399
of the fiber uh we're just basically

2797
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:10,760
going to modify out everything useful

2798
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:12,799
and valuable and and and could be

2799
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:15,639
considered Noble by any culture out of

2800
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:18,840
the weed and then um I think we're going

2801
01:54:15,639 --> 01:54:20,800
to be really successful you know like I

2802
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,880
I have big investors on the line and

2803
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,000
we're going to take off here and

2804
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:28,078
I'll let Francis the only the only thing

2805
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,198
the only riff I'll say on that is all

2806
01:54:28,078 --> 01:54:32,880
agriculture except for weed Works hand

2807
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:35,799
inand with

2808
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:39,920
universities developing [Â __Â ] over time

2809
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:43,560
right um and so like whether it's corn

2810
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:47,078
or soybeans or apples or any kind of any

2811
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:48,880
kind of of you know plant that you know

2812
01:54:47,078 --> 01:54:51,920
a lot of times a lot of the research and

2813
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:55,039
development is done at like UC Iowa or

2814
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:56,679
UC Davis you know VAR various colleges

2815
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:58,679
that are famous for agriculture in

2816
01:54:56,679 --> 01:55:01,239
different regions around the country and

2817
01:54:58,679 --> 01:55:04,440
so as hemp becomes a big commodity

2818
01:55:01,238 --> 01:55:07,759
product you're going to get professors

2819
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:10,598
and phds and graduate students messing

2820
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:12,840
around with the Jean Pool it's no

2821
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:14,440
different than like that mustard plant

2822
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:17,560
that like you you bred it into

2823
01:55:14,439 --> 01:55:19,719
cauliflower broccoli mustard greens

2824
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:21,599
brussel sprouts you know they're going

2825
01:55:19,719 --> 01:55:25,279
to they're going to start adapting weed

2826
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:28,078
for very specific needs right I don't

2827
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:30,920
know what CBG does I'm not like super

2828
01:55:28,078 --> 01:55:32,799
big on all the CBD CBG you know there's

2829
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:34,679
that funny thing of like it's an amazing

2830
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,760
tonic for everything and it also does

2831
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:38,359
nothing and it's amazing because you

2832
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:41,880
can't feel it or you can't sense the

2833
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:43,598
change but it's really positive so I do

2834
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:45,520
think that you know you're talking about

2835
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:48,960
cross-contamination or

2836
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:51,079
pollination um you know I'd be curious

2837
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,560
to know are they growing male fields of

2838
01:55:51,078 --> 01:55:54,078
males and females that are going to be

2839
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,079
throwing off pollen or is it going to be

2840
01:55:54,078 --> 01:55:58,599
a bunch of feminized stuff grown in

2841
01:55:56,078 --> 01:56:01,920
crops because there might not be any

2842
01:55:58,599 --> 01:56:05,279
pollen in that regard uh because most I

2843
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:07,599
think most large scale cannabis or hemp

2844
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:10,158
projects do seem to be heading in the

2845
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:12,279
feminized Direction there doesn't seem

2846
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:14,679
to be a lot of like 100 Acre plots of

2847
01:56:12,279 --> 01:56:18,399
like raw male and females just like

2848
01:56:14,679 --> 01:56:22,319
throwing off pollen these days um but if

2849
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:26,039
there are any money-making cannaboids

2850
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:28,439
from THC to CBD to CBG to whatever I

2851
01:56:26,039 --> 01:56:30,760
would expect universities and private

2852
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:33,000
groups to start playing around with the

2853
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:36,360
genome and the thing about

2854
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,960
CBG which probably you know is like

2855
01:56:36,359 --> 01:56:40,198
there's all these restrictions in the

2856
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:42,560
farm bill and stuff on how much THC you

2857
01:56:40,198 --> 01:56:44,359
can have and how much this you can have

2858
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,320
so those things might just be like a

2859
01:56:44,359 --> 01:56:49,759
problem or an impediment to like

2860
01:56:47,319 --> 01:56:52,319
breeding in that sense I don't know what

2861
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:55,560
they're going to do with the CBG but but

2862
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:58,679
if they can find some marketable extract

2863
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:01,719
or reason to have CBG then maybe

2864
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:04,039
crisping some weed to make CBG is worth

2865
01:57:01,719 --> 01:57:05,439
it right like I don't particularly

2866
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:08,840
that's not the direction that I would

2867
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:12,678
ever go but it's silly to think humans

2868
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:15,719
take plants and animals and we wildly

2869
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:18,158
mess with them here's okay so here's a

2870
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:20,840
cool example you guys like there are

2871
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:23,078
paintings from like 500 years ago of

2872
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:25,920
vegetables that you can go look up and

2873
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:27,759
if you go look up 500y old watermelon

2874
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:31,039
you will see these watermelons that have

2875
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:33,280
like little pockets of red full of seeds

2876
01:57:31,039 --> 01:57:36,399
and most of it is like white pith that

2877
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:38,359
you can't use and over the last 500

2878
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:42,039
years we've bred these watermelons to be

2879
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:46,759
almost entirely within the shell right

2880
01:57:42,039 --> 01:57:49,519
juicy red no pith a lot of times no seed

2881
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:53,199
you know so we've never been able to

2882
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:55,599
work on weed before un iers ities and

2883
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:58,238
agriculture is going to take a look and

2884
01:57:55,599 --> 01:58:00,840
I would expect to have over the next 20

2885
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:03,638
or 30 years hemp that is extremely

2886
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:06,000
specific for fiber that's extremely

2887
01:58:03,639 --> 01:58:08,880
specific for like certain

2888
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,800
cannaboids um that's extremely specific

2889
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,319
for um you know maybe like we were

2890
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,760
talking about earlier maybe EXT

2891
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:16,920
Botanical extracts that produce high

2892
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:19,719
levels of

2893
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:21,639
tpin and if there's money in it they'll

2894
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:23,920
try to isolate it and they'll try to get

2895
01:58:21,639 --> 01:58:25,560
plants that produce it at a high level

2896
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:28,118
and if all they want out of it is that

2897
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:30,000
tarpine or that CBG or that fiber

2898
01:58:28,118 --> 01:58:32,238
they'll breed to the exclusivity of

2899
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,840
everything else because all the rest of

2900
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:38,559
that shit's just in the

2901
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:41,880
way you know yeah and up until the farm

2902
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:44,800
bill I don't think universities you can

2903
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:46,719
correct me if I'm wrong but um I think

2904
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,079
you used to be able until four or five

2905
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:52,599
years ago you had to get the dea's

2906
01:58:49,078 --> 01:58:55,359
permission to do anything with weed yeah

2907
01:58:52,599 --> 01:58:57,560
I mean hemp used to be just as illegal

2908
01:58:55,359 --> 01:58:59,559
as anything and I mean that's the funny

2909
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:03,599
thing with you know

2910
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:05,079
like when when CBD stuff started being a

2911
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:08,400
thing you know people would be like oh

2912
01:59:05,078 --> 01:59:11,759
this is cannabis this is cannabis CBD

2913
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:14,920
this is hemp CBD and I'm like it's all

2914
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,159
like the hemp is all cannabis guys like

2915
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,800
this is not a that's not a thing and it

2916
01:59:17,158 --> 01:59:21,598
always tripped me out to here but that

2917
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,560
was because as a government definition

2918
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,039
there was

2919
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:27,320
there was a difference at a certain

2920
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:30,399
point um but yeah I mean I totally agree

2921
01:59:27,319 --> 01:59:32,399
like you're going to have uh I can't

2922
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:34,519
remember at a certain point I remember

2923
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:36,479
somebody telling me Oh CBG is really

2924
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:39,400
good because it's like it's good for

2925
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:40,959
anti-anxiety or something like that I

2926
01:59:39,399 --> 01:59:44,118
can't remember what it was but it it

2927
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:47,840
does have a value to it you know and

2928
01:59:44,118 --> 01:59:50,960
um as far as I know like CBG is like the

2929
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:53,800
the precursor to the other things that

2930
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:56,760
are more commonly valued you know and so

2931
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:58,960
you yeah you just need to basically make

2932
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,119
it so that instead of it hitting that

2933
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,198
certain point where it turns into other

2934
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,639
things it just keeps on producing this

2935
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:07,399
thing and it never stops have you read

2936
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:09,520
that thing about how they're developing

2937
02:00:07,399 --> 02:00:12,158
like strains of yeast or whatever to

2938
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,280
grow cannaboids without even using

2939
02:00:12,158 --> 02:00:16,319
plants they're gonna they're going to do

2940
02:00:14,279 --> 02:00:17,920
that in every direction as soon as you

2941
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:19,759
make it legal and you allow these

2942
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,440
universities and these research groups

2943
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,679
and these Farmers to start playing

2944
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:24,638
around with it

2945
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:27,199
playing around with plants to produce

2946
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:29,159
things we want them to produce is

2947
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:30,960
ancient yeah no that I mean they're

2948
02:00:29,158 --> 02:00:33,559
gonna we already have gone from a point

2949
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:35,039
so originally when you had a medicine it

2950
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:38,599
would have been a chemical that was

2951
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:41,359
derived from a plant and you and and you

2952
02:00:38,599 --> 02:00:43,119
know everything is basically these these

2953
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:45,319
carbon chains and these little these

2954
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:46,719
molecules have these little tweaks to

2955
02:00:45,319 --> 02:00:47,880
them and it makes it a little bit

2956
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:50,000
different and you go from having

2957
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:52,039
musculine to having ecstasy or you go

2958
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,960
from having this to having that

2959
02:00:52,039 --> 02:00:55,519
everything is just slightly different

2960
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:57,279
and what they figured out at a certain

2961
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:59,280
point was basically that you just need a

2962
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:01,319
source of the carbon and so they started

2963
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:02,920
using petrolium based carbon and so

2964
02:01:01,319 --> 02:01:04,599
that's why a lot of the medicines and

2965
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:07,158
everything that we have they're

2966
02:01:04,599 --> 02:01:09,679
inherently kind of toxic versus the

2967
02:01:07,158 --> 02:01:11,960
natural plant versions of them when they

2968
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:13,199
make synthetic opioids and all these

2969
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:15,480
other things right they're just

2970
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:17,919
naturally made from this weird [Â __Â ] it's

2971
02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:20,198
like com almost like somewhere between

2972
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:21,679
gasoline and Vaseline and plastic and

2973
02:01:20,198 --> 02:01:23,359
there's these little chains that are the

2974
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:25,920
right length where they can tweak them

2975
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:30,719
in a lab and use them as these bases for

2976
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:33,480
other [Â __Â ] so um as far as I understand

2977
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:36,399
it because of the nature of how yeasts

2978
02:01:33,479 --> 02:01:39,359
are you can use them if you mess with

2979
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:42,439
them the right way to produce almost

2980
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:45,880
anything that in nature is a carbon

2981
02:01:42,439 --> 02:01:48,638
based molecule that makes a chemical so

2982
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:52,159
not only can you make canono but you can

2983
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:53,639
also make other things with yeast to

2984
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:54,960
where you can make like a lot of

2985
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:57,279
medicines and different things with

2986
02:01:54,960 --> 02:02:00,719
yeast and as weird as it sounds they

2987
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:05,479
might be significantly more healthy than

2988
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:06,880
petroleum based uh carbon as a Bas I

2989
02:02:05,479 --> 02:02:10,598
don't

2990
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:14,520
know since we have a cannaboid system

2991
02:02:10,599 --> 02:02:17,520
we're now in the infancy of they used to

2992
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:19,800
also with the DEA the DEA only used to

2993
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:23,079
give permission to

2994
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:24,719
study cannabis and hemp look or and and

2995
02:02:23,078 --> 02:02:27,000
weed looking for

2996
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:28,319
harm right they would only approve like

2997
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,599
if you were like I want to see if it

2998
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:33,399
like reduces inflammation or lowers my

2999
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:35,960
blood pressure they would deny the

3000
02:02:33,399 --> 02:02:38,799
actual raw material needed to study it

3001
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:40,920
so they've only loosened up recently to

3002
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:42,119
allow people so you have this situation

3003
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:44,319
right now where you have this thing

3004
02:02:42,118 --> 02:02:46,559
that's been in use in humans for a

3005
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:49,118
really long time we have a cannaboid

3006
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,400
system that it affects and we barely

3007
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:53,000
know how it works and I would expect

3008
02:02:51,399 --> 02:02:55,960
over the next next decades there to be

3009
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,800
an explosion in studying it because most

3010
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:00,039
medicine whether it's penicillin or

3011
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:02,199
aspirin or this or that or whatever A

3012
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:06,800
lot of times a lot of medicine and a lot

3013
02:03:02,198 --> 02:03:09,319
of treatments come out of studying

3014
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:11,400
natural right like na naturally

3015
02:03:09,319 --> 02:03:13,279
occurring things concentrating them

3016
02:03:11,399 --> 02:03:16,238
purifying them seeing how they work with

3017
02:03:13,279 --> 02:03:18,238
the human body and then being like Oh

3018
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:20,718
just like that like this is crazy but

3019
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:22,118
like they you know they had that uh you

3020
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:24,599
know they have they have all these

3021
02:03:22,118 --> 02:03:26,238
weight loss drugs now that were

3022
02:03:24,599 --> 02:03:28,679
developed for

3023
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:30,118
diabetes and then they and then they

3024
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:32,840
discovered that people are now they're

3025
02:03:30,118 --> 02:03:35,519
like ozen pack or whatever they all are

3026
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:40,199
so getting back to weed and hemp all

3027
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:42,920
these CBN CBG CBD THC all that we are in

3028
02:03:40,198 --> 02:03:45,678
the very very very beginning of actually

3029
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:48,840
looking at what these how these things

3030
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:50,199
affect us we have all this like like

3031
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:51,480
antidotal evidence I might have

3032
02:03:50,198 --> 02:03:53,919
mispronounced it or whatever we have all

3033
02:03:51,479 --> 02:03:56,439
this in the field evidence of like what

3034
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:59,760
people perceive it does but like even

3035
02:03:56,439 --> 02:04:01,678
with all this like legal testing I can't

3036
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,400
look at a chart and be like oh it's got

3037
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:05,078
these Tarpin it's got this THC

3038
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:06,839
percentage it's got this mix it's GNA

3039
02:04:05,078 --> 02:04:10,479
make me feel like

3040
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:12,639
so I don't know that eventually we'll be

3041
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:15,759
able scientifically to figure out what

3042
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:18,159
blends of what do what I don't know how

3043
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,440
far away we are from all that but

3044
02:04:18,158 --> 02:04:24,198
universities breeding stuff and doing

3045
02:04:20,439 --> 02:04:26,799
specific things they might need to breed

3046
02:04:24,198 --> 02:04:29,719
specific cannaboids just so they can

3047
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:33,279
study what that cannaboid does by itself

3048
02:04:29,719 --> 02:04:36,599
without influence from THC or CBD or CBN

3049
02:04:33,279 --> 02:04:38,679
or whatever 100% And even in older

3050
02:04:36,599 --> 02:04:43,159
literature they tell you you know that

3051
02:04:38,679 --> 02:04:47,199
there might be three or 400 different um

3052
02:04:43,158 --> 02:04:49,319
useful drugs that are in cannabis in

3053
02:04:47,198 --> 02:04:53,319
general you know what I mean and when

3054
02:04:49,319 --> 02:04:57,118
you test for things e you know you get

3055
02:04:53,319 --> 02:05:00,078
the you get the COA that says what it

3056
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:03,399
was tested for it doesn't tell you about

3057
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:05,000
the things that it wasn't tested for so

3058
02:05:03,399 --> 02:05:08,118
we only test for a small amount of

3059
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:10,639
cannaboids so yeah and like you saying

3060
02:05:08,118 --> 02:05:13,158
earlier with like the with like the the

3061
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:16,199
the the Batman and Joker thing it's like

3062
02:05:13,158 --> 02:05:19,078
okay so now what happens when you mix

3063
02:05:16,198 --> 02:05:21,719
this type of chemical with this chemical

3064
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:23,479
with that chemical and the interaction

3065
02:05:21,719 --> 02:05:28,118
between all these different molecules

3066
02:05:23,479 --> 02:05:32,279
it's like it's not all just okay you

3067
02:05:28,118 --> 02:05:35,158
take okay alcohol does this and Tylenol

3068
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:39,479
does this like no alcohol and Tylenol

3069
02:05:35,158 --> 02:05:41,759
it's a deadly combination right but you

3070
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:43,078
you don't know that unless you have them

3071
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,000
separate if you had a plant that

3072
02:05:43,078 --> 02:05:47,118
produced both you'd be like this thing

3073
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,840
is deadly toxic and it would be like no

3074
02:05:47,118 --> 02:05:50,920
actually it has two very valuable

3075
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:53,440
chemicals in them yeah they're separate

3076
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:55,639
you need to use sep but this even

3077
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:59,118
sometimes the same chemical you know uh

3078
02:05:55,639 --> 02:06:01,719
botulism which kills you is Botox which

3079
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:04,078
takes away my wrinkles yeah so so me and

3080
02:06:01,719 --> 02:06:07,198
my son we watch this we watch this show

3081
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:09,238
on Netflix and it's called Uh 72

3082
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:11,399
deadliest animals and it's they have

3083
02:06:09,238 --> 02:06:14,078
like the South America version the Asia

3084
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:16,279
version the Africa version right and you

3085
02:06:14,078 --> 02:06:20,118
watch it and they'll tell you this

3086
02:06:16,279 --> 02:06:22,359
animal has this deadly venom and without

3087
02:06:20,118 --> 02:06:25,000
fail every time you get through this

3088
02:06:22,359 --> 02:06:26,920
show they say you know like they go

3089
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,559
through and they go when this happens

3090
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:31,000
you get paralysis and then necrosis and

3091
02:06:29,559 --> 02:06:32,239
this thing happens and that thing

3092
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,198
happens and then they get all the way to

3093
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:37,238
the end and they go scientists right now

3094
02:06:34,198 --> 02:06:40,039
in Argentina are studying this because

3095
02:06:37,238 --> 02:06:42,759
it turns out that this chemical if you

3096
02:06:40,039 --> 02:06:46,000
use it this way is actually a cure for

3097
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:49,840
this and you're like oh so essentially

3098
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:52,479
everything that is a really outstanding

3099
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:55,159
toxin is some kind of an incredible

3100
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:56,959
medicine but you have to know the dosage

3101
02:06:55,158 --> 02:07:00,359
and the right way to use it so it's like

3102
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:03,239
oh if you inject it it's terrible but if

3103
02:07:00,359 --> 02:07:05,960
you eat it when it hits your gut it does

3104
02:07:03,238 --> 02:07:09,919
this it turns out or whatever if you put

3105
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:12,840
it in your ear it's like oh [Â __Â ] okay so

3106
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:15,559
every and that's the nature like of

3107
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:18,078
everything you know is like every every

3108
02:07:15,559 --> 02:07:20,920
poison that's why they say it's the it's

3109
02:07:18,078 --> 02:07:22,279
the dose you know like I would imagine

3110
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:25,679
they made it

3111
02:07:22,279 --> 02:07:30,078
so they could just study CBG as an

3112
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:32,440
isolated cannaboid without anything else

3113
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:34,359
and if it ends up becoming popular it'll

3114
02:07:32,439 --> 02:07:37,000
only because they can put it in some

3115
02:07:34,359 --> 02:07:39,880
kind of consumer product that people

3116
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,880
want to buy and a lot of the motivation

3117
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:44,599
I figure initially comes from them

3118
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:46,359
wanting to go oh we're gonna sell CBG

3119
02:07:44,599 --> 02:07:48,639
and we have this idea because it's going

3120
02:07:46,359 --> 02:07:50,880
to be this thing and we're going to make

3121
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:55,239
the new suppository and then you buy our

3122
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:58,118
CDT and you know but the thing about all

3123
02:07:55,238 --> 02:08:00,198
that is like you said it has it has a

3124
02:07:58,118 --> 02:08:02,759
lot of a lot of value the same way I'm

3125
02:08:00,198 --> 02:08:06,638
talking about the toxin science and

3126
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:08,760
studies and and you know modification

3127
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:11,359
and crisper and all these things they're

3128
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:13,280
the same way like it's you know you can

3129
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:15,158
it's like they they say you know you can

3130
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:18,599
eat with a fork or you can stab yourself

3131
02:08:15,158 --> 02:08:21,679
in the leg but like it's not the same

3132
02:08:18,599 --> 02:08:23,800
it's still the same thing so this plan

3133
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:26,800
that they've modified like you said if

3134
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:28,480
it's male female and the pollen's flying

3135
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:30,719
everywhere and it's basically getting

3136
02:08:28,479 --> 02:08:32,759
all the way into the atmosphere and it's

3137
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:36,520
now there's modified stuff and it's

3138
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:39,639
lowering the you know the the global

3139
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:41,880
quality of all of our different things

3140
02:08:39,639 --> 02:08:44,118
that's [Â __Â ] up but if they're making

3141
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:46,559
like polyploids and it won't breed with

3142
02:08:44,118 --> 02:08:48,759
anything else and it produces very few

3143
02:08:46,559 --> 02:08:51,599
males and all that kind of stuff it's

3144
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:55,559
like it's not so bad the thing I think

3145
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:57,199
that gave the GMOs a really bad name and

3146
02:08:55,559 --> 02:08:58,800
it's important for people to understand

3147
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:00,759
this and I think most people don't

3148
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:03,880
understand it is the fact that

3149
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:06,800
genetically modifying things so far has

3150
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:08,800
mainly been used by people who want to

3151
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,960
modify things so that you can spray them

3152
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:14,199
with Roundup Roundup

3153
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:17,480
Ready crops have been

3154
02:09:14,198 --> 02:09:19,879
the actually used and the whole thing is

3155
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:22,238
a scam to be able to sell more

3156
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:24,319
herbicides and they're like oh it's

3157
02:09:22,238 --> 02:09:26,319
going to save people from world hunger

3158
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:29,078
and I'm like look by the time you have

3159
02:09:26,319 --> 02:09:30,799
the ability to genetically modify things

3160
02:09:29,078 --> 02:09:32,880
you guys could do a lot of things to

3161
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:35,000
modify to help to solve world hunger

3162
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:37,760
there's a lot of traits that are really

3163
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,439
really commercially valuable that you

3164
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:43,199
can incorporate super easily into these

3165
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:45,078
things that are not just hey we can hit

3166
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:47,598
the whole [Â __Â ] planet with agent

3167
02:09:45,078 --> 02:09:50,599
orange now and it won't matter it's like

3168
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:54,440
no it that's not a good idea but the

3169
02:09:50,599 --> 02:09:56,840
idea for them was like we get more

3170
02:09:54,439 --> 02:09:59,039
profits here and we get more profits

3171
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:01,480
here like we have the disease we have

3172
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:03,639
the Cure we have this thing like you

3173
02:10:01,479 --> 02:10:05,198
know it would be great if you could do

3174
02:10:03,639 --> 02:10:06,960
this but you know what would make you do

3175
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:09,479
better is if you could just spray your

3176
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:12,679
whole field with Roundup and then you

3177
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:15,678
wouldn't have to worry about it and that

3178
02:10:12,679 --> 02:10:18,158
is horrible but at the same time you

3179
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:21,078
look at stuff and you go okay so if you

3180
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:24,039
if you modify things in certain ways and

3181
02:10:21,078 --> 02:10:27,479
you go through the due diligence of

3182
02:10:24,039 --> 02:10:30,118
figuring out like you said you know like

3183
02:10:27,479 --> 02:10:31,839
is this going to spread via poen is this

3184
02:10:30,118 --> 02:10:34,158
going to be you know there's all these

3185
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:36,078
things you can do to make things so that

3186
02:10:34,158 --> 02:10:39,399
like okay well we also modified it so

3187
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:43,158
that it cannot reproduce outside of our

3188
02:10:39,399 --> 02:10:44,479
reproduction techniques there's no

3189
02:10:43,158 --> 02:10:48,839
they're gon they're gonna want to figure

3190
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:51,598
out too like which why why does weed

3191
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:53,319
make what part what what aspect effect

3192
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:56,000
makes it anti

3193
02:10:53,319 --> 02:10:58,359
nausea what what which which substance

3194
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,920
reduces inflammation because

3195
02:10:58,359 --> 02:11:03,078
inflammation leads to so much disease if

3196
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:05,480
they can figure out isolated you know

3197
02:11:03,078 --> 02:11:07,719
isolated compounds that help reduce

3198
02:11:05,479 --> 02:11:10,359
inflammation you know like they're going

3199
02:11:07,719 --> 02:11:12,880
to look at anything positive that can

3200
02:11:10,359 --> 02:11:14,839
come out of hemper Cana and try to

3201
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:18,520
figure out what

3202
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:20,880
components actually make that happen you

3203
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:21,760
know and and I think and I think that's

3204
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,440
just

3205
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:28,199
continue you know so I just I I expect

3206
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:30,279
to see dozens upon dozens upon dozens of

3207
02:11:28,198 --> 02:11:33,000
those type of Articles over the next

3208
02:11:30,279 --> 02:11:34,519
years because as as people start to play

3209
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,679
with things they're going to take it in

3210
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:38,360
different directions and they might just

3211
02:11:36,679 --> 02:11:40,760
be taking it in different directions so

3212
02:11:38,359 --> 02:11:43,558
they can study it further so they can

3213
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:47,360
extract whatever it is pure and then

3214
02:11:43,559 --> 02:11:48,800
start to play with it by itself um and

3215
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:50,198
you know like anything else it's going

3216
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,719
to be a tool and there could be good and

3217
02:11:50,198 --> 02:11:53,919
bad that there might even be stuff that

3218
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:56,399
we think is amazing that comes out of it

3219
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:57,880
that later on we're like that was bad

3220
02:11:56,399 --> 02:11:59,118
yeah because that's how humans are you

3221
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:01,359
know it's like I'm sure when people

3222
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:03,719
invented styrofoam they were like this

3223
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:05,118
is the bomb look at how many different

3224
02:12:03,719 --> 02:12:06,719
things we can make into it look at how

3225
02:12:05,118 --> 02:12:09,198
durable it is look at how well it holds

3226
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:11,118
up to heat and this and that and then 50

3227
02:12:09,198 --> 02:12:15,759
years later we're like oh this doesn't

3228
02:12:11,118 --> 02:12:17,960
dissolve it's just like plastic yeah so

3229
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:20,679
yeah yeah so that that's that's

3230
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:22,319
basically what I think of GMO weed is

3231
02:12:20,679 --> 02:12:24,880
univers ities are going to get a hold of

3232
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:26,359
it and they're going to apply their

3233
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:27,800
their science and they're going to apply

3234
02:12:26,359 --> 02:12:29,479
their labs and they're going to apply

3235
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:31,279
their technology like they do to all

3236
02:12:29,479 --> 02:12:33,919
kinds of other plants and they're going

3237
02:12:31,279 --> 02:12:36,238
to see what comes of it and it might

3238
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:39,118
lead down bad paths and it might lead to

3239
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:41,279
interesting interesting ideas or

3240
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:43,359
whatever um or they could be talking

3241
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:46,759
about weed and Cana as the wonder drug

3242
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:48,960
because it's spawned this whole new

3243
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:51,400
class of drugs that is helping with

3244
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,000
whatever that we don't even know

3245
02:12:51,399 --> 02:12:55,039
you

3246
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,158
know yeah definitely it's going to be an

3247
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:59,399
evolving sort of space as Federal

3248
02:12:57,158 --> 02:13:00,759
legalization continues and more research

3249
02:12:59,399 --> 02:13:03,719
is

3250
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:06,000
undertaken moving on to our last story

3251
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:08,599
before we do some of our final

3252
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,800
thoughts let me get our little picture

3253
02:13:08,599 --> 02:13:14,480
up uh we have some serious controversy

3254
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:16,520
in the community with a video emerging

3255
02:13:14,479 --> 02:13:18,519
of the breed a be Leaf in which he has

3256
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:20,480
heard threatening his girlfriend and

3257
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:22,440
what appears to be hitting her there's

3258
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:24,118
no video so we can't corroborate that

3259
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:26,319
entirely but it does sound to be that

3260
02:13:24,118 --> 02:13:28,479
way now there's numerous issues at play

3261
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:30,118
here obviously it goes without saying

3262
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:32,359
violence against women is never

3263
02:13:30,118 --> 02:13:34,198
acceptable and not surprisingly many

3264
02:13:32,359 --> 02:13:36,558
people have distanced themselves from

3265
02:13:34,198 --> 02:13:39,678
him within the professional community

3266
02:13:36,559 --> 02:13:41,520
and landcape interestingly a somewhat

3267
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:43,760
vocal group of people have come out

3268
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:46,440
saying that he should not be supported

3269
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:49,360
to the point that his seeds and clones

3270
02:13:46,439 --> 02:13:51,638
should be thrown away it begs the

3271
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:53,399
question that has been around for many

3272
02:13:51,639 --> 02:13:55,880
years already about separating the art

3273
02:13:53,399 --> 02:13:58,000
from the artist so the question becomes

3274
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:59,480
what do you guys think do the seeds know

3275
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,118
anything about the actions of their

3276
02:13:59,479 --> 02:14:03,519
creator or is this simply too big of an

3277
02:14:02,118 --> 02:14:07,479
issue to

3278
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:10,520
ignore um my personal perspective not to

3279
02:14:07,479 --> 02:14:12,919
put it on anybody else is that I always

3280
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:16,040
like to separate the seeds and the plant

3281
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:18,559
from the person right and so the line

3282
02:14:16,039 --> 02:14:20,198
that I would draw is if you look at that

3283
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:24,599
and you're like that's not my kind of

3284
02:14:20,198 --> 02:14:26,558
person then you should not support

3285
02:14:24,599 --> 02:14:28,880
anything that they're doing currently or

3286
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:31,360
in the future if your values don't align

3287
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,840
with that person's but that doesn't mean

3288
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:34,679
that the seeds that they made eight

3289
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:38,679
years ago or a clone that they released

3290
02:14:34,679 --> 02:14:41,920
is somehow contaminated and should be

3291
02:14:38,679 --> 02:14:46,158
eliminated you know because that person

3292
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:47,920
did some some nasty stuff um I could see

3293
02:14:46,158 --> 02:14:51,679
not wanting to support that person in

3294
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:54,239
the future you know because there's tons

3295
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:55,800
of of uh you know there's tons of other

3296
02:14:54,238 --> 02:14:56,959
breeders you can support and everything

3297
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:00,279
else there's no

3298
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:01,840
shortage right um it's always been a

3299
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:03,238
weird thing in the community I mean look

3300
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:04,639
at you know I don't even want to name

3301
02:15:03,238 --> 02:15:06,319
names because it's like people will get

3302
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:08,359
upset but there's people that have been

3303
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:10,039
accused of ratting there's people that

3304
02:15:08,359 --> 02:15:13,679
have been accused of working with the

3305
02:15:10,039 --> 02:15:15,760
government um you know lots of you know

3306
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:18,039
lots of breeders or people that have

3307
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:20,719
contributed to Cana maybe haven't had

3308
02:15:18,039 --> 02:15:22,599
the greatest personal lives so that's

3309
02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:24,078
not to excuse him or say you should

3310
02:15:22,599 --> 02:15:26,400
support him in the future but I don't

3311
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:28,359
know about like if you got seeds from

3312
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:30,039
him 5 years ago about flushing them

3313
02:15:28,359 --> 02:15:31,558
because they're contaminated from

3314
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:35,118
touching a bad

3315
02:15:31,559 --> 02:15:41,480
person you know yeah I mean I have like

3316
02:15:35,118 --> 02:15:44,519
a similar view of it in in that uh you

3317
02:15:41,479 --> 02:15:46,638
know statistically like just looking at

3318
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:49,000
how things work you can imagine that

3319
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:51,480
it's pretty likely that anything that

3320
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:54,039
you really like that you have probably

3321
02:15:51,479 --> 02:15:56,519
at one point went

3322
02:15:54,039 --> 02:15:59,158
through

3323
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:01,400
somebody's it's probably got some weird

3324
02:15:59,158 --> 02:16:03,638
stories attached to it attached to some

3325
02:16:01,399 --> 02:16:06,558
weird people and just because you don't

3326
02:16:03,639 --> 02:16:09,000
know it makes you think oh well this

3327
02:16:06,559 --> 02:16:12,599
one's better than that one over there

3328
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:15,118
it's like yeah I mean we already you we

3329
02:16:12,599 --> 02:16:19,920
you know these groups that were

3330
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:23,078
basically The Outsiders in society who

3331
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:25,440
held a lot of the genetics and people in

3332
02:16:23,078 --> 02:16:27,479
general like I know for a fact that a

3333
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:29,319
lot of people who were the people who

3334
02:16:27,479 --> 02:16:32,159
grew weed back in the day these people

3335
02:16:29,319 --> 02:16:34,959
were the people who you know batched up

3336
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:38,000
meth who did really crazy [Â __Â ] who

3337
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:40,759
definitely were hyper violent in certain

3338
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,799
cases and there was a lot of ties with

3339
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:44,359
organized crime there was a lot of

3340
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:46,840
different organizations that are

3341
02:16:44,359 --> 02:16:49,399
associated with certain genetics there's

3342
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:52,398
a lot of that it just is is a reality of

3343
02:16:49,398 --> 02:16:55,599
the thing what I would say possibly is a

3344
02:16:52,398 --> 02:16:57,599
kind of an easy fix and not normally

3345
02:16:55,599 --> 02:17:02,239
something that I would say is good

3346
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:05,200
because I'm fond of history and

3347
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:06,558
accuracy you know if you really really

3348
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:10,880
really

3349
02:17:06,558 --> 02:17:15,358
can't stomach these type of

3350
02:17:10,879 --> 02:17:18,759
people you maybe can leap frog them a

3351
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:21,719
little bit in the storyline to say that

3352
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:24,439
this guy did he really do any really

3353
02:17:21,718 --> 02:17:26,638
novel work I mean I don't know him

3354
02:17:24,439 --> 02:17:29,120
personally I didn't see what he did I

3355
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:31,000
only know what I saw online basically

3356
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,079
and what is represented there as the

3357
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,879
story but from what I can tell I don't

3358
02:17:33,079 --> 02:17:37,920
know that he actually did anything so

3359
02:17:35,879 --> 02:17:40,959
you could probably just skip over the

3360
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:43,120
dude in The Saga and go H let's just

3361
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:44,879
jump back to the guy right before who he

3362
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:46,599
actually stole all the [Â __Â ] from in the

3363
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:49,199
first place if that's the case and then

3364
02:17:46,599 --> 02:17:51,840
if he did really make some crosses like

3365
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:54,760
it's pretty easy to say this is this

3366
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:57,760
crossed with this and this is what it is

3367
02:17:54,760 --> 02:18:00,120
and the normal honor that you bestow on

3368
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:02,079
somebody like that you know is hella

3369
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:04,760
cool like Bodie or something where

3370
02:18:02,079 --> 02:18:07,039
you're like yeah this was a this was

3371
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:09,719
alapo gold and it was gathered by these

3372
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:12,719
dudes and this is the story and by the

3373
02:18:09,718 --> 02:18:14,959
way bod got it at one point increased it

3374
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:17,000
and I got the seeds from bod and you add

3375
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:19,279
in bod even if he didn't really do

3376
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,840
anything and he doesn't want any credit

3377
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:24,319
for it because it's not his stuff but he

3378
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:26,359
you know he's the one who brought it to

3379
02:18:24,318 --> 02:18:28,478
have everybody be able to get it and you

3380
02:18:26,359 --> 02:18:30,679
want him to have his place in history

3381
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:32,599
because you know he's Honorable in terms

3382
02:18:30,679 --> 02:18:35,398
of the plants he's Honorable in terms of

3383
02:18:32,599 --> 02:18:37,318
the way he treats people in general and

3384
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:40,079
his General Outlook and the things he

3385
02:18:37,318 --> 02:18:42,359
does and his energy that attaches to it

3386
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:44,760
and you're like oh like you know like

3387
02:18:42,359 --> 02:18:46,679
it's almost like if if bod got the [Â __Â ]

3388
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,000
from this dude and then you got it from

3389
02:18:46,679 --> 02:18:50,920
bod you'd be like yeah I got it from bod

3390
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:53,000
and it's this cool stuff now cuz you

3391
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:55,200
know like you got it from him cuz you've

3392
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,638
met the dude and the vibe was cool so

3393
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,519
you're not that worried about the dude

3394
02:18:56,638 --> 02:19:00,920
before who was an [Â __Â ] or whatever

3395
02:18:58,519 --> 02:19:02,800
yeah I almost feel like in this case you

3396
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:05,000
could kind of just kind of like yeah

3397
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:07,879
let's pull just like an old school

3398
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:10,200
history move where you just kind of bust

3399
02:19:07,879 --> 02:19:12,358
the face off the idol and you're like I

3400
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:16,559
don't know which Pharaoh this was you

3401
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:18,439
know like that's like I think it kind of

3402
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:20,959
basically comes down

3403
02:19:18,439 --> 02:19:23,920
to if you disagree with what the dude

3404
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:25,839
did okay which is not hard to do you can

3405
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:27,760
just say I'm not going to give him any

3406
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:31,120
money or support him in any of his

3407
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:33,639
future endeavors uhuh right it doesn't

3408
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:35,319
mean any clone or seed he produced years

3409
02:19:33,638 --> 02:19:37,839
ago or something like that needs to be

3410
02:19:35,318 --> 02:19:39,840
like eliminated from the gene poool

3411
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:42,120
because like there's not like he didn't

3412
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:44,920
attach any karmic debt to those seeds or

3413
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:47,120
anything like that and you know he's

3414
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:50,200
right there's a lot of stories up here

3415
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:52,560
that we don't tell you know like Mendo

3416
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:54,840
you know like old weed world was never

3417
02:19:52,559 --> 02:19:57,639
this magical land there's a lot of

3418
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:59,799
ugliness on some of these famous roads

3419
02:19:57,639 --> 02:20:02,159
there's a lot there's addictions there's

3420
02:19:59,799 --> 02:20:03,759
violence there's weird stories that

3421
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:06,600
aren't the greatest there's people that

3422
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:09,359
are very flawed individuals I mean

3423
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:11,720
imagine if you believe Neville and you

3424
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:14,840
were like okay well you know Sam ratted

3425
02:20:11,719 --> 02:20:16,358
me out so let's eliminate skunk and haze

3426
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:19,559
from any future

3427
02:20:16,359 --> 02:20:21,159
work let's just ditch both of those

3428
02:20:19,559 --> 02:20:23,879
things because

3429
02:20:21,159 --> 02:20:26,000
he got me arrested and threw you know

3430
02:20:23,879 --> 02:20:27,478
like if you believe his story it doesn't

3431
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,120
paint I'm not saying it's true I'm just

3432
02:20:27,478 --> 02:20:32,079
saying like if you believe it it paints

3433
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:34,040
him in a pretty bad light so I think

3434
02:20:32,079 --> 02:20:35,680
there's a lot of shade balls in Cana I

3435
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:38,000
think you can choose who you give your

3436
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:40,639
money to I think you should spend your

3437
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,439
money with people that whose values you

3438
02:20:40,639 --> 02:20:45,879
align with if you so

3439
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:48,079
choose um and if you don't want to give

3440
02:20:45,879 --> 02:20:49,519
that dude any money because you saw the

3441
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:51,280
IG and you're like man he's an

3442
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:52,800
aggressive [Â __Â ]

3443
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,079
I'm just going to give my weed money to

3444
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:57,318
someone who's not that way there's a

3445
02:20:55,079 --> 02:20:59,879
bunch of breeders you know that you can

3446
02:20:57,318 --> 02:21:01,239
spend your money on and he got those

3447
02:20:59,879 --> 02:21:03,879
seeds from someone

3448
02:21:01,239 --> 02:21:05,398
else he got those cuts from someone else

3449
02:21:03,879 --> 02:21:08,358
everybody stands on the shoulder of

3450
02:21:05,398 --> 02:21:11,719
others at best most of us are just

3451
02:21:08,359 --> 02:21:14,760
mildly altering things here or there and

3452
02:21:11,719 --> 02:21:16,959
passing on to the next person and and in

3453
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:18,760
some cases like there's you know there

3454
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:22,199
there's times when it's like yeah you

3455
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:24,559
actually really somebody really did do a

3456
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:26,760
step that makes it so that you're like

3457
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:29,079
oh and then this person did this Step In

3458
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:30,800
some cases it's like somebody just sold

3459
02:21:29,079 --> 02:21:33,039
something and they attached their name

3460
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:35,239
to it and they didn't actually take any

3461
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:37,000
steps except reselling it and then if

3462
02:21:35,239 --> 02:21:40,398
that's the case you're

3463
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:43,079
like well I mean this guy was the source

3464
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:45,318
but if he didn't actually even do

3465
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:47,398
anything to it he didn't even like this

3466
02:21:45,318 --> 02:21:49,398
guy didn't even F2 the [Â __Â ] it's just

3467
02:21:47,398 --> 02:21:52,279
somebody else's thing and he just he

3468
02:21:49,398 --> 02:21:55,279
bred it with a sharpie on a label like I

3469
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:58,280
I I don't know the dude's story but but

3470
02:21:55,280 --> 02:22:00,520
but there are definitely mention of

3471
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:03,439
people saying like oh that clone that he

3472
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:05,359
sells for 20 grand or whatever that was

3473
02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:06,920
just so and so's clone and he changed

3474
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:08,880
the name and he said he bred it and he

3475
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:12,200
didn't breed it and I'm like all right

3476
02:22:08,879 --> 02:22:14,679
well if that's the case I see no reason

3477
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:16,240
to have added his name to the story in

3478
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:18,159
the first place and you should probably

3479
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:20,280
just call it the name it was before

3480
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:23,318
because this whole thing was an error

3481
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:25,680
right this historical error so don't

3482
02:22:23,318 --> 02:22:27,639
don't spend 20 grand on a clone and

3483
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:31,559
don't give him the 20 grand if you are G

3484
02:22:27,639 --> 02:22:33,439
to buy a clone no for sure no sure yeah

3485
02:22:31,559 --> 02:22:35,478
and then if you if you did and you find

3486
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:37,520
out that the Clone was originally named

3487
02:22:35,478 --> 02:22:39,559
someone else and it's bred by somebody

3488
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:42,399
like if you buy this thing and it's

3489
02:22:39,559 --> 02:22:44,680
called super Haze and you spay 20 grand

3490
02:22:42,398 --> 02:22:47,439
for it and it turns out oh it's actually

3491
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:49,280
A5 then you should have stopped calling

3492
02:22:47,439 --> 02:22:51,239
it super Haze a long time ago and

3493
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:53,079
stopped mentioning this guy as a guy who

3494
02:22:51,239 --> 02:22:54,840
did anything in it and just start

3495
02:22:53,079 --> 02:22:56,879
calling it A5 again because it's not

3496
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:58,280
even historically accurate there's no

3497
02:22:56,879 --> 02:23:00,679
reason to add the name but I don't know

3498
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:03,200
the details to know if that is exactly

3499
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:06,120
the case or if people exaggerated it and

3500
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:08,079
he did F to it or whatever the thing and

3501
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:10,520
it's this different thing I don't even

3502
02:23:08,079 --> 02:23:13,398
know any of that but what I am saying is

3503
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:16,120
that if anybody if anybody like can't

3504
02:23:13,398 --> 02:23:18,478
stomach to say his name because they

3505
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:21,240
don't even want to give him the credit

3506
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:23,119
of adding to

3507
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:25,318
because you if you if somebody says hey

3508
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:27,079
where did you get this and you say oh I

3509
02:23:25,318 --> 02:23:29,039
got it from NATO then people are going

3510
02:23:27,079 --> 02:23:30,799
to be like oh well even if this dude

3511
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:33,279
said NATO is not cool I'm gonna hit him

3512
02:23:30,799 --> 02:23:34,959

I said that's like more the hot take

3526
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:10,000
because the way I look at it is more

3527
02:24:07,239 --> 02:24:12,680
like all right if the dude did any bit

3528
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,079
of work that is part of the story and

3529
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:17,680
history is full of the like you said

3530
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:20,398
it's full of the dirty part of the

3531
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:22,600
history if you're really a historian and

3532
02:24:20,398 --> 02:24:24,680
you're like oh skunkman if you really

3533
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:26,880
believe the story that skunkman Sam was

3534
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:28,880
a rat but you still want to grow the

3535
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:31,799
stuff that he bred and you want to have

3536
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:34,879
that pyronics Haze or whatever and

3537
02:24:31,799 --> 02:24:37,119
you're like oh but but Sam back in the

3538
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:38,959
day like you could always say hey it was

3539
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:41,880
an old Santa Cruz strain and I got it

3540
02:24:38,959 --> 02:24:44,119
from pyronics I can add I can add

3541
02:24:41,879 --> 02:24:47,278
another element to it

3542
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:49,399
too brought it right when I was doing

3543
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:51,479
the History Podcast there for a couple

3544
02:24:49,398 --> 02:24:54,599
of years right

3545
02:24:51,478 --> 02:24:57,278
there was a lot of stories where certain

3546
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:58,120
salacious details just get left out of

3547
02:24:57,279 --> 02:25:00,159
the

3548
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:01,640
tale because you don't want to be a

3549
02:25:00,159 --> 02:25:03,680
negative person you don't want to be

3550
02:25:01,639 --> 02:25:05,278
rumor mongering you don't want to be

3551
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:07,720
obviously that dude had a video so it's

3552
02:25:05,279 --> 02:25:10,040
like proof or whatever but generally

3553
02:25:07,719 --> 02:25:12,679
speaking under the hood in a lot of can

3554
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:14,840
of stories there can be violence there

3555
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:16,439
can be addiction there can be robbery

3556
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:18,639
there can be thieving there can be the

3557
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:21,398
whole range of human

3558
02:25:18,639 --> 02:25:24,959
activity also occur in and around the

3559
02:25:21,398 --> 02:25:26,799

3562
02:25:29,639 --> 02:25:33,760
people you know there's all that and so

3563
02:25:32,159 --> 02:25:36,799
a lot of times when you're like trying

3564
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:39,318
to tell people like real history you're

3565

3571
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:57,079
you want to repeat the rumor as fact and

3572
02:25:54,359 --> 02:25:59,359
like disparage somebody's character so

3573
02:25:57,079 --> 02:26:02,079
there's edit and and I'll say this too

3574
02:25:59,359 --> 02:26:03,239
is that genetics are forever and

3575
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:05,879
everyone gets

3576
02:26:03,239 --> 02:26:08,318
forgotten so like you know if if that

3577
02:26:05,879 --> 02:26:11,398
dude touch something that was valuable I

3578
02:26:08,318 --> 02:26:13,079
guarantee you 20 30 years from now if

3579
02:26:11,398 --> 02:26:15,318
that thing if whatever he has is still

3580
02:26:13,079 --> 02:26:17,879
around most people will have no idea it

3581
02:26:15,318 --> 02:26:19,799
came from him for sure if you asked

3582
02:26:17,879 --> 02:26:21,759
people to name the top three or four

3583
02:26:19,799 --> 02:26:24,398
people that were involved in sour most

3584
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:27,120
people couldn't do it yeah we're all

3585
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,959
going to be forgotten and if you study

3586
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:30,920
the history if you want to know like oh

3587
02:26:28,959 --> 02:26:34,358
you want to know about like the Holy

3588
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:37,920
Roman Empire like you want to know about

3589
02:26:34,359 --> 02:26:41,040
the lineage of the European Kings coming

3590
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:44,879
from France and England or you want to

3591
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:47,680
know about like like you can't just like

3592
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:50,959
history doesn't work in a way where you

3593
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:53,439
can just go ahead and uh we're going to

3594
02:26:50,959 --> 02:26:55,599
admit all the stuff that's ugly because

3595
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:58,159
when you really look at it you're like I

3596
02:26:55,600 --> 02:27:00,359
hate to tell you guys but like

3597
02:26:58,159 --> 02:27:04,000
you're what there's not going to be

3598
02:27:00,359 --> 02:27:06,479
anything left when you relate things to

3599
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:09,159
certain they say don't get to know your

3600
02:27:06,478 --> 02:27:10,519
Heroes yeah and there's all you that guy

3601
02:27:09,159 --> 02:27:12,359
in the Rolling Stone married his

3602
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:15,200
14-year-old cousin you know and he was

3603
02:27:12,359 --> 02:27:16,600
40 and you're like oh or this person did

3604
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:18,120
this and you're like oh no that's

3605
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:20,479
terrible and you're like and you can

3606
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:22,800
just people are complicated and that's

3607
02:27:20,478 --> 02:27:24,920
not to excuse dude because obviously

3608
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:26,519
like being an [Â __Â ] to anyone much

3609
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:29,719
less someone you're in a relationship

3610
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:32,239
with or you have some age on it doesn't

3611
02:27:29,719 --> 02:27:35,278
the the video does not look good and so

3612
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:37,318
I could absolutely see people deciding

3613
02:27:35,279 --> 02:27:40,200
I'm not going to give that person anym

3614
02:27:37,318 --> 02:27:41,879
of my money because there's dozens or

3615
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:43,479
hundreds of other people out there in

3616
02:27:41,879 --> 02:27:45,799
the weed community that I don't feel

3617
02:27:43,478 --> 02:27:48,159
that way towards that when I have money

3618
02:27:45,799 --> 02:27:50,199
to burn I'll just spend it with them

3619

the only person I ever get the only

3642
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:56,040
person I ever saw on the forums get

3643
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:57,680
fully cancelled for a while for their

3644
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:01,080
actions was

3645
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:03,960
Rez and even after that he still has a

3646
02:29:01,079 --> 02:29:08,079
comeback and sell seeds and there's

3647
02:29:03,959 --> 02:29:10,959
there's Nuance to the story and you know

3648
02:29:08,079 --> 02:29:12,760
like you can you know I'm not I'm not

3649
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:16,398
trying to defend anyone or anything like

3650
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:18,478
that I'm just saying that like you know

3651
02:29:16,398 --> 02:29:20,559
lots of people do lots of bad things

3652
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:22,398
some of them are elevated uh that video

3653
02:29:20,559 --> 02:29:25,318
was ugly nobody likes to see some dude

3654
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:27,639
in their 40s or 50s like berating or or

3655
02:29:25,318 --> 02:29:30,478
yelling at some like what you look to be

3656
02:29:27,639 --> 02:29:32,879
much much younger female hard hard to

3657
02:29:30,478 --> 02:29:34,519
hear the audio it was it wasn't it

02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:42,000
audio it probably makes your skin crawl

3660
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:44,639
it was ugly uh I don't support it um and

3661
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,639
uh you know that dude will have to

3662
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:48,199
decide like how he want like he was

3663
02:29:46,639 --> 02:29:50,639
saying he has to decide how he wants to

3664
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:52,279
be as a person does he want to offer a

3665
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:55,000
big apology does he want to try to make

3666
02:29:52,279 --> 02:29:57,399
it right does he maybe he's just an

3667
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:01,200
[Â __Â ] and uh you know there's [Â __Â ]

3668
02:29:57,398 --> 02:30:04,199
that make seeds and clones they exist

3669
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:06,479
and everybody has to like uh analyze

3670
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:08,760
like what does this have to do with

3671
02:30:06,478 --> 02:30:10,639
their life and what does this have to do

3672
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:13,600
with their plant and what does this have

3673
02:30:10,639 --> 02:30:16,039
to do with whatever it's all very

3674
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:19,559
interesting in these times when

3675
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:23,960
everything is basically like you have

3676
02:30:19,559 --> 02:30:25,799
access to all this information it's like

3677
02:30:23,959 --> 02:30:28,079
guess what guys there's a lot of bad

3678
02:30:25,799 --> 02:30:30,239
apples and I'm not giving be Leaf any

3679
02:30:28,079 --> 02:30:32,879
money any of my money but I don't think

3680
02:30:30,239 --> 02:30:35,079
I ever any of my money before ever so

3681
02:30:32,879 --> 02:30:37,559
it's like there's no change you weren't

3682
02:30:35,079 --> 02:30:39,000
looking for the next that you know

3683
02:30:37,559 --> 02:30:40,600
you're like I've seen that I know what

3684
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:43,760
the [Â __Â ] so I don't approve of him but

3685
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:46,318
it doesn't like you know and uh doesn't

3686
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:48,719
change your day no did he be cancelled

3687
02:30:46,318 --> 02:30:51,840
forever I don't you know like I don't it

3688
02:30:48,719 --> 02:30:55,840
was in in even in in public Cano world

3689
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:57,960
it was pretty ugly yeah put it that way

3690
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:59,799
Dad if you're like he was saying about

3691
02:30:57,959 --> 02:31:01,199
brother or father or whatever if you if

3692
02:30:59,799 --> 02:31:04,759
you've got a daughter if you've got a

3693
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:07,600
sister you know it's like nobody wants

3694
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:10,239
no nobody wants to be talk to like that

3695
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:12,439
yeah no it's not you know but I mean

3696
02:31:10,239 --> 02:31:16,119
that's the thing is like that's

3697
02:31:12,439 --> 02:31:19,200
what that's some people's life but it's

3698
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:22,000
not 10 million people on the internet's

3699
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:24,760
life like like that's why the question

3700
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,279
here is posed by our boy as what does

3701
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:29,200
that mean about the plants what does

3702
02:31:26,279 --> 02:31:31,640
that mean about this as opposed to like

3703
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:33,840
what what what about this guy it's like

3704
02:31:31,639 --> 02:31:38,559
well the guy what the [Â __Â ] do we know

3705
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:41,960
like about that in our life who this guy

3706
02:31:38,559 --> 02:31:44,119
is I don't know the guy there's a guy

3707
02:31:41,959 --> 02:31:47,000
it's definitely not a good guy it's not

3708
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:48,720
a guy support it's not a guy and like I

3709
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:50,760
said you know like yeah that you're

3710
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:53,039
going to be disgusted hearing it and all

3711
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:55,880
that stuff but then it's crazy because

3712
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:58,080
you're like yeah guys there's billions

3713
02:31:55,879 --> 02:32:00,199
of people and a lot of them are doing

3714
02:31:58,079 --> 02:32:03,520
really [Â __Â ] up [Â __Â ] all the time and a

3715
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:05,040
lot of it is a lot crazier than this and

3716
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:06,800
we're never going to mention it but

3717
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:09,319
because we're in this wee bubble

3718
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:11,879
everybody's like I'm burning my seeds

3719
02:32:09,318 --> 02:32:14,159
I'm flushing my clones I'm doing this

3720
02:32:11,879 --> 02:32:17,398
and that and you're like cool you know

3721
02:32:14,159 --> 02:32:18,840
but it's crazy the level of you know

3722
02:32:17,398 --> 02:32:20,639
every time there's something like this

3723
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:22,359
in the weed world with thing it's like

3724
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:26,079
you're talking about the res dog and

3725
02:32:22,359 --> 02:32:28,800
then you hear the interview with with uh

3726
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:30,920
Gypsy or whatever and he's like I

3727
02:32:28,799 --> 02:32:32,559
forgive him I don't really care whatever

3728
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:34,719
and you're like well everybody else is

3729
02:32:32,559 --> 02:32:38,199
very concerned about this but the guy

3730
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:40,398
who he says he snitched on the guy that

3731
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:43,600
says the guy's like yeah he snitched on

3732
02:32:40,398 --> 02:32:48,439
me whatever I'm over it and I'm like but

3733
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:50,840
there's like 3 million 22 year olds who

3734
02:32:48,439 --> 02:32:53,479
are deep

3735
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:53,478
and I you

3736
02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:01,000
know God help me I'm not defending

3737
02:32:57,799 --> 02:33:02,759
ratting but I will say that I know to

3738
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,840
those people to handle that have been

3739
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:06,359
put into rooms where the feds are like I

3740
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:08,840
know every

3741
02:33:06,359 --> 02:33:10,600
detail and I want you to corroborate

3742
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:12,920
some of these details that I already

3743
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:14,359
know and I just want you to say these

3744
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:16,520
things and if you say these things that

3745
02:33:14,359 --> 02:33:19,159
corroborate what we already know we'll

3746
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:20,680
give you this and if we don't you're

3747
02:33:19,159 --> 02:33:22,279
going to be the only person that didn't

3748
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:24,760
talk and we're going to throw the book

3749
02:33:22,279 --> 02:33:29,120
at you and you're going to be screwed

3750
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:32,920
forever you know and I you know like

3751
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:37,720
some people some people will shut up and

3752
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:39,520
and do the rap and some people will not

3753
02:33:37,719 --> 02:33:42,559
yeah and when the people when the people

3754
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:45,200
don't the guy who got snitched out Gypsy

3755
02:33:42,559 --> 02:33:47,278
and his family and his boys and all that

3756
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,720
and if they're angry and they do

3757
02:33:47,279 --> 02:33:51,920
something I ain't going to judge them

3758
02:33:48,719 --> 02:33:53,959
for it that's your life happened to you

3759
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:57,000
I mean there there's people

3760
02:33:53,959 --> 02:33:58,959
that you do that to a stranger I'm not

3761
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:02,200
going to [Â __Â ] with you you're not gonna

3762
02:33:58,959 --> 02:34:05,438
be my friend I don't want you exactly

3763
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:09,399
your seeds but the [Â __Â ] business isn't a

3764
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:12,239
mine I mean in a nutshell I got I have I

3765
02:34:09,398 --> 02:34:14,000
have multiple I have multiple daughters

3766
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:16,039
and God help me I hope they never date

3767
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,120
anyone like be

3768
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:22,000
le

3769
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:23,319
yeah you know so a very multifaceted

3770
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,120
story but yeah tell you what the thing

3771
02:34:23,318 --> 02:34:28,159
that shines through for me the most

3772
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:30,840
about it all is that I bet you the

3773
02:34:28,159 --> 02:34:33,959
people who had res dog packs are stoked

3774
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:35,359
they did not flush them so there you go

3775
02:34:33,959 --> 02:34:37,799
I think there's certainly something to

3776
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:40,120
say about separating secret from I'll

3777
02:34:37,799 --> 02:34:43,239
say that I'll say this about red too

3778
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:47,920
almost everyone that has a sour seed

3779
02:34:43,239 --> 02:34:50,159
line secretly uses res re's bx2 as their

3780
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:52,559
pollen Source because power is

3781
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:55,200
notoriously hard to get to reverse it

3782
02:34:52,559 --> 02:34:57,278
almost never throws pollen people don't

3783
02:34:55,200 --> 02:35:01,079
want to do their own work because making

3784
02:34:57,279 --> 02:35:03,800
a a a a b a two-time back cross is three

3785
02:35:01,079 --> 02:35:06,279
separate breedings and probably a year a

3786
02:35:03,799 --> 02:35:08,199
year and a half of your time or longer

3787
02:35:06,279 --> 02:35:10,840
and so there are any number of people

3788
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:14,240
selling sour seeds out there that they

3789
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:17,398
got their pollen from that

3790
02:35:14,239 --> 02:35:19,279
line yeah I've seen it pop up a number a

3791
02:35:17,398 --> 02:35:21,439
number of times so I think you're on

3792
02:35:19,279 --> 02:35:23,920
something there and I think it's about

3793
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:26,040
time we try the uh the final segment for

3794
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:28,840
our first episode I'm going to be up

3795
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:30,960
this week we'll call it heavy thoughts

3796
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:32,398
I've uh I've got a little rant here and

3797
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:34,759
I'd love to hear you guys thoughts on it

3798
02:35:32,398 --> 02:35:36,639
so this week or today however we're

3799
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:39,760
going to label it I wanted to talk about

3800
02:35:36,639 --> 02:35:42,478
how I think that uh the the grower has

3801
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:45,079
to prioritize to grow some unique and

3802
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:47,039
interesting cultivar cuz you hear so

3803
02:35:45,079 --> 02:35:48,239
much everyone wants to smoke sativas

3804
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:51,080
everyone wants to smoke old school

3805
02:35:48,239 --> 02:35:53,840
strains but so rarely do you find people

3806
02:35:51,079 --> 02:35:55,520
actually speaking walking the walk

3807
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:57,960
talking the talk and growing it

3808
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:59,680
themselves and I think as uh as Michael

3809
02:35:57,959 --> 02:36:02,039
Jackson said starts with the man in the

3810
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:03,760
mirror you got to dedicate some space to

3811
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:05,720
some longer flowering strains and it

3812
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:08,159
might just be like one or two strains

3813
02:36:05,719 --> 02:36:09,840
one or two plants but find something

3814
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:11,840
that you're interested in and grow it

3815
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:13,359
out let it be an experience let it sit

3816
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:15,520
in the corner it might need to run

3817
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:17,439
across two flower Cycles if if you're

3818
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:19,200
running eight or nine weers but you'll

3819
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:20,880
be grateful for the experience even if

3820
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:22,880
you're not particularly thrilled by the

3821
02:36:20,879 --> 02:36:24,759
flower which I don't think will happen I

3822
02:36:22,879 --> 02:36:26,639
think you'll be very into it because at

3823
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:29,318
the end of the day the breath of our

3824
02:36:26,639 --> 02:36:31,639
experience is limited by our exposure so

3825
02:36:29,318 --> 02:36:33,239
if you haven't grown these wild more

3826
02:36:31,639 --> 02:36:35,318
jungle type plants you haven't

3827
02:36:33,239 --> 02:36:37,719
experienced the full breath of diversity

3828
02:36:35,318 --> 02:36:39,600
and unique characteristics that cannabis

3829
02:36:37,719 --> 02:36:41,599
has to offer and it'll help you to grow

3830
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,880
better plants even the nine weekers you

3831
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:46,880
know it'll give you a wider breath of

3832
02:36:43,879 --> 02:36:48,599
exposure and you'll be more skilled as a

3833
02:36:46,879 --> 02:36:50,398
grower for having grown them out and

3834
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:54,318
this will cross transfer to all plants

3835
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:56,239
you grow so you too can be if you grow

3836
02:36:54,318 --> 02:36:58,799
them out you can also be proud knowing

3837
02:36:56,239 --> 02:37:00,719
that you're contributing in a beneficial

3838
02:36:58,799 --> 02:37:02,199
way that people are always aspiring

3839
02:37:00,719 --> 02:37:04,039
talking about growing something old

3840
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:06,680
something unique something longer

3841
02:37:04,040 --> 02:37:08,640
flowering so I think overall everyone

3842
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:11,800
benefits from greater diversity there's

3843
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:13,478
no downsides and you can find a type of

3844
02:37:11,799 --> 02:37:15,119
effect that you may have never known

3845
02:37:13,478 --> 02:37:17,478
existed it might lead you to like a

3846
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:20,040
lifelong passion that you otherwise may

3847
02:37:17,478 --> 02:37:22,159
have never seen or might have missed you

3848
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:24,439
so I'd love to ask you guys what do you

3849
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:26,799
think is it as easy as I say can you

3850
02:37:24,439 --> 02:37:30,479
just Chuck a few s in the

3851
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:32,278
corner um I'll start on this one so this

3852
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,239
actually ties into sort of like I've

3853
02:37:32,279 --> 02:37:36,800
been thinking about it for a while

3854
02:37:34,239 --> 02:37:40,520
actually and you know with all the

3855
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:43,079
changes in the scene um you know a lot

3856
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:45,680
of us that have been into into herb for

3857
02:37:43,079 --> 02:37:47,279
a long time you know we did various

3858
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:49,600
things that we needed to for the market

3859
02:37:47,279 --> 02:37:51,560
and then we would do things on the side

3860
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:53,600
that we're like for ourselves or for our

3861
02:37:51,559 --> 02:37:55,559
friends or whatever but there's actually

3862
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:57,120
a new breed of grower that I kind of

3863
02:37:55,559 --> 02:38:00,478
want to highlight on this one for a

3864
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:02,760
minute and it's the hobbyist because I

3865
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:05,000
think that a lot of these rare sativas

3866
02:38:02,760 --> 02:38:07,920
and a lot of these rare things

3867
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:10,239
like it used to be that people that had

3868
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:12,600
a passion for it in weed would do it as

3869
02:38:10,239 --> 02:38:15,119
a side to like what they were actually

3870
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:16,479
doing to like survive and stuff but

3871
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:18,040
there's people out there that might be

3872
02:38:16,478 --> 02:38:19,519
mechanics they might have a different

3873
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:21,840
job they might have this or that and

3874
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:25,920
they're growing intense now and they're

3875
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:28,559
treating Kaa like boating or hunting or

3876
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:32,279
dirt biking or any other kind of like

3877
02:38:28,559 --> 02:38:33,879
hobby that they pour money into right

3878
02:38:32,279 --> 02:38:35,880
and so those people because they're not

3879
02:38:33,879 --> 02:38:38,639
doing it for any kind of commercial

3880
02:38:35,879 --> 02:38:40,159
status they have complete freedom in

3881
02:38:38,639 --> 02:38:43,000
what they want to

3882
02:38:40,159 --> 02:38:44,279
do right like what we're talking about

3883
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,840
what you're talking about is like

3884
02:38:44,279 --> 02:38:47,920
there's a lot of people that were very

3885
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:50,159
focused on the market in order to

3886
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:52,600
survive but if you have have alternative

3887
02:38:50,159 --> 02:38:55,039
income streams right and you're growing

3888
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:57,760
for you and your friends or whatever you

3889
02:38:55,040 --> 02:39:00,600
can grow 110 days sativa you can grow

3890
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:02,840
weird things you can pop some odd stuff

3891
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:04,720
from mean jeene that might have interex

3892
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:07,239
traits or this or that or whatever might

3893
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:09,079
not be like commercially viable but like

3894
02:39:07,239 --> 02:39:12,079
might have some really interesting stuff

3895
02:39:09,079 --> 02:39:14,840
in it and like not care because you're

3896
02:39:12,079 --> 02:39:17,159
just growing it for you and friends you

3897
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:18,960
know what I'm saying and so like there

3898
02:39:17,159 --> 02:39:20,680
might not there might be a lot of weed

3899
02:39:18,959 --> 02:39:21,959
out there doesn't meet somebody's

3900
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:24,318
production

3901
02:39:21,959 --> 02:39:27,079
model but they could still grow it on

3902
02:39:24,318 --> 02:39:29,600
the side for them and their friends

3903
02:39:27,079 --> 02:39:31,680
because there's lots of weed that never

3904
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:33,760
makes it to

3905
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:35,479
Market you see you know what I mean like

3906
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:37,840
even when I was even when I was doing

3907
02:39:35,478 --> 02:39:39,799
depths a headband or or sour or whatever

3908
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:41,398
else there's two or three strains most

3909
02:39:39,799 --> 02:39:43,759
of my friends it's like you're growing

3910
02:39:41,398 --> 02:39:45,159
these to pay the bills and then you got

3911
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:47,120
this little like bed or this little

3912
02:39:45,159 --> 02:39:50,039
greeny or this little patch that's like

3913
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:52,160
experiments or for you and Friends and

3914
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:56,000
that just gets passed around you and

3915
02:39:52,159 --> 02:39:58,159
friends you know um so I agree with you

3916
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,478
people should try different

3917
02:39:58,159 --> 02:40:03,239
stuff but if you're only focused on

3918
02:40:00,478 --> 02:40:06,000
money or survival you probably

3919
02:40:03,239 --> 02:40:07,559
won't you know and some people right now

3920
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,040
that are in Canada that are just trying

3921
02:40:07,559 --> 02:40:12,680
to hang on and to survive until better

3922
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:16,240
times they might have a hard time doing

3923
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:18,800
that financially because things are so

3924
02:40:16,239 --> 02:40:20,398
tight you know but if you've got other

3925
02:40:18,799 --> 02:40:22,519
income streams dreams if you're a lawyer

3926
02:40:20,398 --> 02:40:24,119
if you're a mechanic if you're a this if

3927
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:26,200
you're that and you've just got your

3928
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:28,800
you've got an 8 by8 veg and a little

3929
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:31,279
tent and it's just your hobby you have

3930
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:33,278
total freedom you can grow weird things

3931
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:35,040
that you like because all that matters

3932
02:40:33,279 --> 02:40:37,319
if you and your friend likes it that's

3933
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:40,279
it and I think there's a lot of that

3934
02:40:37,318 --> 02:40:42,920
that's starting to happen Across America

3935
02:40:40,279 --> 02:40:45,040
and those little pockets might be where

3936
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:47,960
some of the non-commercially viable

3937
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:50,200
funnest most interesting things end up

3938
02:40:47,959 --> 02:40:52,119
surviving

3939
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:53,640
because they're not surviving at Big

3940
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:56,279
Warehouse

3941
02:40:53,639 --> 02:40:57,639
grows you know those people aren't doing

3942
02:40:56,279 --> 02:40:59,680
it they're just growing whatever is the

3943
02:40:57,639 --> 02:41:01,799
most whatever is the most profitable at

3944
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:01,800
the

3945
02:41:02,359 --> 02:41:07,439
moment yeah for sure that's a thing like

3946
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:09,920
with with all the different things that

3947
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:13,279
I try to keep around

3948
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:16,120
are there's a there's a certain amount

3949
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:18,920
that are like you know I do

3950
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:21,200
have a good number of friends who are

3951
02:41:18,920 --> 02:41:22,719
like they're growing dope they want like

3952
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,159
something that's why I have things where

3953
02:41:22,719 --> 02:41:26,519
I'm like okay well what's the market

3954
02:41:25,159 --> 02:41:29,359
what are the thing what are the things

3955
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:30,760
that people actually want so that I have

3956
02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:32,479
seeds where I can give them to people

3957
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:35,478
and be like yeah this is like that but

3958
02:41:32,478 --> 02:41:39,639
it's different or that's like my take on

3959
02:41:35,478 --> 02:41:42,398
it but my favorite stuff like the lime I

3960
02:41:39,639 --> 02:41:46,358
don't see it ever being anything that

3961
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:49,840
you would really it's just not that easy

3962
02:41:46,359 --> 02:41:52,000
mechanically to manage it for or like

3963
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:54,159
post Harvest where it's like okay

3964
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:56,120
bucking it down trimming it making it

3965
02:41:54,159 --> 02:41:59,239
look nice making it look like a certain

3966
02:41:56,120 --> 02:42:02,120
thing it just doesn't it doesn't add up

3967
02:41:59,239 --> 02:42:04,279
to be ever these little round purple

3968
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:06,640
Frosty buds that you can run through the

3969
02:42:04,279 --> 02:42:08,640
machine trim and it'll look like that

3970
02:42:06,639 --> 02:42:11,519
thing that everybody wants to toss in

3971
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:16,239
their myars but to me it's still like my

3972
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:19,560
favorite weed so um it's cool it's like

3973
02:42:16,239 --> 02:42:22,639
you like Noto saying it if you are just

3974
02:42:19,559 --> 02:42:25,278
interested in having really cool weed

3975
02:42:22,639 --> 02:42:27,599
those are still the people that I'm

3976
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:30,239
focused on the most as far as trying to

3977
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:32,120
get them seeds like I want people to

3978
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:35,159
basically get it and go you know I never

3979
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:37,079
smoked weed like this before or I did

3980
02:42:35,159 --> 02:42:39,879
smoke weed that was like this but it's

3981
02:42:37,079 --> 02:42:42,079
been like 30 40 years and I remember I

3982
02:42:39,879 --> 02:42:43,759
had this one bag and I haven't seen

3983
02:42:42,079 --> 02:42:46,520
anything like it and then I grew this

3984
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:49,279
and there was it was kind of like like

3985
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:53,600
that you know it was like that old weed

3986
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:55,960
and um so you know like I really like

3987
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:59,479
those odd things and then as far as like

3988
02:42:55,959 --> 02:43:02,358
the real long flowering stuff like right

3989
02:42:59,478 --> 02:43:05,719
now I just popped like some some

3990
02:43:02,359 --> 02:43:07,920
Colombian and some congales and it's

3991
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:10,959
like just kind of odd and I popped the

3992
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:14,559
congales purely so that I can have a big

3993
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:16,719
weird bag of these thin little congales

3994
02:43:14,559 --> 02:43:20,959
buds like this where it's like

3995
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:23,438
Bo like little you know these little

3996
02:43:20,959 --> 02:43:26,799
rppers up and down the thing and there

3997
02:43:23,439 --> 02:43:28,559
these little marbles of this cool weed

3998
02:43:26,799 --> 02:43:30,519
and it grows on this plant with these

3999
02:43:28,559 --> 02:43:33,079
tiny little stems and the leaves are

4000
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:34,520
only this big and they're super narrow

4001
02:43:33,079 --> 02:43:37,000
and you look at the plant you're like

4002
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:40,040
what is this thing it's crazy and you

4003
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:43,159
would never get very much weed if you

4004
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:46,720
were trying to weigh it up but when you

4005
02:43:43,159 --> 02:43:49,520
just want to have a couple big like

4006
02:43:46,719 --> 02:43:51,478
bundles of sticks of weed that going to

4007
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:53,319
smoke sitting somewhere and you're just

4008
02:43:51,478 --> 02:43:55,119
going to grab some of it and give some

4009
02:43:53,318 --> 02:43:57,119
to somebody and smoke some and

4010
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:59,160
everything it's really great weed it's

4011
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:01,279
really cool it's neat stuff it doesn't

4012
02:43:59,159 --> 02:44:04,239
smell like what people want it's kind of

4013
02:44:01,279 --> 02:44:06,800
grassy and it has this weird like you

4014
02:44:04,239 --> 02:44:09,000
know there's some terpinolene and pinene

4015
02:44:06,799 --> 02:44:12,719
and it has this thing where people are

4016
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:15,600
like but when you smoke it you really do

4017
02:44:12,719 --> 02:44:18,358
feel different than when you like if

4018
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:20,920
you're used to weed and you've been

4019
02:44:18,359 --> 02:44:22,760
smoking weed forever and you smoke this

4020
02:44:20,920 --> 02:44:26,040
you're like

4021
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:29,000
this this is not like what I consider a

4022
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:30,520
weed high you'll actually my I'm myself

4023
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:32,840
but I'm weird I'm introspective with the

4024
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:35,239
highs because as like a breeder I like

4025
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:38,398
to kind of figure out what is this feel

4026
02:44:35,239 --> 02:44:41,199
like so when people ask me describe it

4027
02:44:38,398 --> 02:44:43,559
but the really weed that gets you really

4028
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:46,000
high that can be a really weird rabbit

4029
02:44:43,559 --> 02:44:48,799
hole because you go what the [Â __Â ] is

4030
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:51,318
different I can't really put a finger on

4031
02:44:48,799 --> 02:44:53,079
it and like the Congo is like extra like

4032
02:44:51,318 --> 02:44:55,278
that because you're like I don't know

4033
02:44:53,079 --> 02:44:58,079
everything's really bright it's like

4034
02:44:55,279 --> 02:45:01,399
everything is gone in a new resolution

4035
02:44:58,079 --> 02:45:04,398
like it's extra HD like you're like in a

4036
02:45:01,398 --> 02:45:07,719
video game and you see as you move the

4037
02:45:04,398 --> 02:45:10,079
layers of everything all the depth is

4038
02:45:07,719 --> 02:45:11,959
like very much highlighted and you're

4039
02:45:10,079 --> 02:45:13,840
really and all weed does that a little

4040
02:45:11,959 --> 02:45:16,879
bit but it's like the Congo is really

4041
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:18,600
cool like that where just like a classic

4042
02:45:16,879 --> 02:45:20,119
weird sativa High where all of a sudden

4043
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:22,720
everything really different and you're

4044
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:25,800
just kind of sitting there going damn

4045
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:27,599
this is not like the last weed that I

4046
02:45:25,799 --> 02:45:30,840
smoked it's totally different and you

4047
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:33,960
feel really good just in general like

4048
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:35,960
where the whole negative you know you

4049
02:45:33,959 --> 02:45:38,119
can get really [Â __Â ] up and like kind

4050
02:45:35,959 --> 02:45:40,079
of swamped down and negativity at

4051
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:42,399
certain points I mean I think most

4052
02:45:40,079 --> 02:45:45,398
people do but I definitely can and then

4053
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:47,199
I'll I'll like smoke that kind of weed

4054
02:45:45,398 --> 02:45:48,680
and I'll like be sitting there and it's

4055
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:49,640
one of the reasons why I like the lime

4056
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:51,000
too

4057
02:45:49,639 --> 02:45:54,799
because I'll actually look at it and

4058
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:58,879
I'll be like who the [Â __Â ] was I when I

4059
02:45:54,799 --> 02:46:01,358
felt like negative like when feeling bad

4060
02:45:58,879 --> 02:46:03,119
was like a thing I don't even understand

4061
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:06,399
how that's a real thing like was I

4062
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:08,760
faking it [Â __Â ] was going on it's so

4063
02:46:06,398 --> 02:46:11,119
weird you know and there's and and

4064
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:13,840
there's only you know that when I smoke

4065
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:15,720
like if I smoke like straight OG it

4066
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:19,239
makes me feel really high and it's

4067
02:46:15,719 --> 02:46:22,719
really interesting how like high I get

4068
02:46:19,239 --> 02:46:24,600
but I can still like kind of feel a

4069
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:27,318
little bit like negative and kind of

4070
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:29,920
like funky in a certain way or like

4071
02:46:27,318 --> 02:46:32,239
almost like a different kind of

4072
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:34,559
paranoia uh whereas there's some weed

4073
02:46:32,239 --> 02:46:37,639
where I'm just like dude things are nice

4074
02:46:34,559 --> 02:46:39,760
life is good like [Â __Â ] all that and it's

4075
02:46:37,639 --> 02:46:42,199
like very distinctly certain types of

4076
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:44,279
weed and those are the ones that I like

4077
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:47,840
so that's why I like to do that kind of

4078
02:46:44,279 --> 02:46:49,840
like the hobby thing of going okay what

4079
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,239
is this one like what's that one like

4080
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:52,760
because you dig through all these things

4081
02:46:51,239 --> 02:46:54,840
and you discover there's things that

4082
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:57,159
make you feel different that you

4083
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:59,719
might consider different than a weed

4084
02:46:57,159 --> 02:47:01,439
high and it's [Â __Â ] awesome you know

4085
02:46:59,719 --> 02:47:05,079
and you get to see the plant it's a

4086
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:07,079
whole most long flowering things are

4087
02:47:05,079 --> 02:47:09,639
going to be grown by

4088
02:47:07,079 --> 02:47:11,478
hobbyists yeah I have various good

4089
02:47:09,639 --> 02:47:13,000
friends of mine I'm not I'm not actually

4090
02:47:11,478 --> 02:47:14,719
gonna shout out who he is but I have

4091
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:16,200
like a good friend of mine that grows

4092
02:47:14,719 --> 02:47:17,879
he's got a tent and he grows seven or

4093
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:20,439
eight different sativas he's popping

4094
02:47:17,879 --> 02:47:22,358
seeds from from breeders he likes he's

4095
02:47:20,439 --> 02:47:25,279
growing them out he's given some extras

4096
02:47:22,359 --> 02:47:27,239
to friends and it's really like he's

4097
02:47:25,279 --> 02:47:30,040
always growing he's always backing up

4098
02:47:27,239 --> 02:47:32,159
moms he makes barely any money off it

4099
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:34,760
really it's like he completely earns off

4100
02:47:32,159 --> 02:47:36,840
a different kind of career but he's into

4101
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:38,439
the plants and he's into the buzz and so

4102
02:47:36,840 --> 02:47:41,318
it does he doesn't care it's like oh if

4103
02:47:38,439 --> 02:47:44,559
this piff takes 112 days I really don't

4104
02:47:41,318 --> 02:47:46,680
care if I like the weed at the end I'm

4105
02:47:44,559 --> 02:47:48,079
stoked and so those are the kind of

4106
02:47:46,680 --> 02:47:51,318
people that are going to that are going

4107
02:47:48,079 --> 02:47:54,478
to push the envelope much more so than

4108
02:47:51,318 --> 02:47:56,079
like the barely profitable Mega Farms or

4109
02:47:54,478 --> 02:47:59,159
like all these people that are trying to

4110
02:47:56,079 --> 02:48:02,039
be commercially viable it's almost like

4111
02:47:59,159 --> 02:48:04,239
for a long time what I hope happens is

4112
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:06,880
we develop a weed Community that's sort

4113
02:48:04,239 --> 02:48:08,639
of like the heirloom vegetable Community

4114
02:48:06,879 --> 02:48:10,679
for a long time where it was like those

4115
02:48:08,639 --> 02:48:12,239
guys were like making no money they were

4116
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:14,639
trading amongst each other they were

4117
02:48:12,239 --> 02:48:17,079
breeding and Growing Seeds it wasn't

4118
02:48:14,639 --> 02:48:20,079
commercially viable it was a bunch of

4119
02:48:17,079 --> 02:48:22,478
hobbyists right but you could get all

4120
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:25,120
kinds of weird tomatoes and weird

4121
02:48:22,478 --> 02:48:27,278
squashes and weird this or that that you

4122
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:29,399
could not get in the grocery store and

4123
02:48:27,279 --> 02:48:33,479
it was all because there was this big

4124
02:48:29,398 --> 02:48:36,119
diffus network of breeders and producers

4125
02:48:33,478 --> 02:48:38,199
and Growers that like to do stuff on a

4126
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:40,479
hobbyist level and then some really

4127
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:42,960
small companies doing it and then

4128
02:48:40,478 --> 02:48:44,719
eventually ended up in Whole Foods or it

4129
02:48:42,959 --> 02:48:47,159
ended up in the co-ops or it ended up

4130
02:48:44,719 --> 02:48:50,079
whatever and it got repop but it

4131
02:48:47,159 --> 02:48:52,760
wouldn't have been there had not all

4132
02:48:50,079 --> 02:48:54,959
those non-commercial

4133
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:58,520
enthusiasts had a

4134
02:48:54,959 --> 02:48:58,519
desire you see what I'm

4135
02:48:58,639 --> 02:49:04,159
saying so so I think I think the longer

4136
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:07,559
flowering stuff that is going to be

4137
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:10,119
mostly the purview of people that grow

4138
02:49:07,559 --> 02:49:11,559
weed because they like to smoke weed and

4139
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:12,920
they're and they're not looking at

4140
02:49:11,559 --> 02:49:15,680
what's the most

4141
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:18,920
efficient profitable way to grow some

4142
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:21,318
weed y I can afford in my lifestyle to

4143
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:23,840
grow this weird thing you know like they

4144
02:49:21,318 --> 02:49:25,519
joke like a boat is actually just a hole

4145
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:27,840
you throw money

4146
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:29,720
into you know what I mean like there's

4147
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:31,840
lots of people that spend lots of money

4148
02:49:29,719 --> 02:49:34,679
on hobbies that don't earn them any

4149
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:36,318
money yeah for a percentage of people

4150
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:38,159
weed is going to become that Hobby and

4151
02:49:36,318 --> 02:49:39,680
it's just going to be like dirt biking

4152
02:49:38,159 --> 02:49:41,639
and you need a dirt bike and you need a

4153
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:43,600
helmet you need gear and you need

4154
02:49:41,639 --> 02:49:45,278
registration or you know you need a boat

4155
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:48,238
you go fishing you need fishing poles

4156
02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:50,399
and lures and tackle boxes and think of

4157
02:49:48,238 --> 02:49:52,639
any hobby you can think of that dudes

4158
02:49:50,398 --> 02:49:53,840
get into there are dudes that spend

4159
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:57,559
loads of

4160
02:49:53,840 --> 02:50:00,279
money on that hobby from you know they

4161
02:49:57,559 --> 02:50:02,199
just skim off their regular life and

4162
02:50:00,279 --> 02:50:03,600
that's my hope is those are the type of

4163
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:06,600
people that are going to be the most

4164
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:09,399
likely to keep the weird non-commercial

4165
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:12,520
weed strains alive and being traded and

4166
02:50:09,398 --> 02:50:14,799
being grown out by breeders you know for

4167
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:16,720
sure and then for people even too who

4168
02:50:14,799 --> 02:50:18,879
are trying to do things the most like

4169
02:50:16,719 --> 02:50:21,639
efficiently and have all the stuff like

4170
02:50:18,879 --> 02:50:25,519
for years I would have like I was kind

4171
02:50:21,639 --> 02:50:29,639
of odd in that I've never I think the

4172
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:33,159
first year that I moved into this place

4173
02:50:29,639 --> 02:50:34,959
I grew an all clone crop but even though

4174
02:50:33,159 --> 02:50:37,799
it was an all clone crop it was this

4175
02:50:34,959 --> 02:50:41,438
really weird clone that I had from uh

4176
02:50:37,799 --> 02:50:43,679
hp13 bag seeds from Hana it's this what

4177
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:47,439
I call hash plant it's this plant that

4178
02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:49,318
I've kept since then since 2008 so 2009

4179
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:51,960
I moved into this place and I grew a

4180
02:50:49,318 --> 02:50:55,680
medical and that was I just had all

4181
02:50:51,959 --> 02:50:58,199
those you know and

4182
02:50:55,680 --> 02:51:01,159
uh other than that I've always grown

4183
02:50:58,200 --> 02:51:04,680
everything from seed so it's like

4184
02:51:01,159 --> 02:51:06,318
everything is like a hobby grow even if

4185
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:08,040
I was growing big plants and there was a

4186
02:51:06,318 --> 02:51:10,439
lot of weed it was still off of all

4187
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:11,720
these weird odd things that I was making

4188
02:51:10,439 --> 02:51:13,960
when I could have been growing blue

4189
02:51:11,719 --> 02:51:17,438
dream or whatever and had all this huge

4190
02:51:13,959 --> 02:51:19,478
amount of weed and uh but what I even

4191
02:51:17,439 --> 02:51:21,159
then even though I'd have some sideline

4192
02:51:19,478 --> 02:51:23,000
stuff it would still be what was more

4193
02:51:21,159 --> 02:51:24,920
practical like for breeding and stuff

4194
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:27,478
trying to make the new stuff for my big

4195
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:30,760
garden and then after a while I kind of

4196
02:51:27,478 --> 02:51:33,719
realized like you know what I can do all

4197
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:38,639
this and it still wouldn't hurt me to

4198
02:51:33,719 --> 02:51:41,599
have five little paws that have some

4199
02:51:38,639 --> 02:51:44,278
kind of really weird weed in them So

4200
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:48,079
eventually I started being like Oh I got

4201
02:51:44,279 --> 02:51:49,238
to grow some of these swazis or losos or

4202
02:51:48,079 --> 02:51:53,799
Cong

4203
02:51:49,238 --> 02:51:55,920
or malais or you know whatever were the

4204
02:51:53,799 --> 02:51:58,358
cool things that I could get my hands on

4205
02:51:55,920 --> 02:52:00,639
to go all right here's these weird

4206
02:51:58,359 --> 02:52:02,800
things like I'm gonna I'm gonna grow

4207
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:05,398
those and so even if you are somebody

4208
02:52:02,799 --> 02:52:08,639
who's really trying to really grow you

4209
02:52:05,398 --> 02:52:10,478
can still have some little plants off to

4210
02:52:08,639 --> 02:52:13,559
the side as its own little thing it

4211
02:52:10,478 --> 02:52:17,599
doesn't take you that much extra effort

4212
02:52:13,559 --> 02:52:19,079
and you can have something really weird

4213
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:22,439
and like here

4214
02:52:19,079 --> 02:52:24,840
for me if it's those long running things

4215
02:52:22,439 --> 02:52:27,639
part of it is that like it won't finish

4216
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:29,279
here so you can't grow it and produce it

4217
02:52:27,639 --> 02:52:32,000
because you're going to be like oh all

4218
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:35,040
my big buds got some you'd have to dep

4219
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:37,040
it and this part and then let it finish

4220
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:39,040
yeah but then what I've learned over the

4221
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:40,680
years though too is that for a lot of

4222
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:43,080
these like if it's a really weird thing

4223
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:46,318
like if it's a Congo just want like a

4224
02:52:43,079 --> 02:52:49,079
nice little bundle of it in a turkey bag

4225
02:52:46,318 --> 02:52:51,959
so what the hell do I need

4226
02:52:49,079 --> 02:52:55,359
to worry if some of it gets moldy you

4227
02:52:51,959 --> 02:52:55,358
know yeah sure

4228
02:52:55,760 --> 02:53:01,120
matter there you go that's epic to hear

4229
02:52:58,799 --> 02:53:03,199
and uh gosh you're making me think back

4230
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:05,720
I need to I need to grow some more out

4231
