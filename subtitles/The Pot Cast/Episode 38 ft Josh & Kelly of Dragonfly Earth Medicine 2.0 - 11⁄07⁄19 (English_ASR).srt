00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
right back at ya so the first question i

54
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,239
wanted to ask is the normal first

55
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,759
question but it wasn't the first

56
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,599
question i asked you last time so it's

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,879
time to do it what was your first

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:10,159
experience with cannabis

59
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,199
my first experience with cannabis was in

60
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,719
utero because my mother

61
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,639
liked to smoke

62
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,479
hash while she was pregnant and it just

63
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,199
felt good to her and she was an old

64
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,959
hippie and of the area and maybe she had

65
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,399
some morning sickness or some different

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
things she was working out but really

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,159
she was just a

68
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,359
naturalist that was living in southern

69
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,598
oregon and just wanted to you know

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
be in nature and and that was just part

71
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,639
of her medicine so and and so as i grew

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
up i was always surrounded by it and

73
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,919
luckily it was i was in southern oregon

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,239
so

75
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,719
you know that we we saw the first

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,039
you know sticky kind buds you know

77
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,120
coming in and the oregon big buds and

78
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,120
the purple cushes and

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
and i was just lucky enough to always be

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
around it i really never had to smoke

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,039
you know the mexican brick we eat and

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,560
different stuff that people had to smoke

83
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,560
and as i grew up i just always had good

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
good cannabis around and so you know

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,199
that that started my love and i and i

86
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,039
never did any other hard drugs or any

87
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,878
other things in life because that was

88
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,439
just a good print for me so that that

89
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:18,399
was my introduction and then me and

90
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,318
kelly met when i was you know

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
just 19 and that's a long time ago now

92
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,079
26 years but uh

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,879
um we're we're we're

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,319
we've had a journey in life since then

95
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,199
as well so yeah you know that's

96
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,280
something we've already talked about

97
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,079
and my first um

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,799
experience ever was i wasn't like josh

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,319
doll i grew up in virginia

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,599
um and was super conservative

101
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,280
you know

102
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,158
very

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,719
yeah east coast conservative family so i

104
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,719
never really saw it around you know i i

105
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,000
never had grown up with it i never saw

106
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,598
it around

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,479
and then i went out skiing um in wyoming

108
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,158
when i was probably about

109
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,158
14 years old

110
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,079
and a bunch of skier hot shots were up

111
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,239
on top of the mountain and everybody was

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
lighting up joints and i thought hey i

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,000
think i'll take a hit of that

114
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,238
and we were at the very top of the

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
mountain and a huge snowstorm came

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,478
through and it was a total white out and

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
i was stoned for the very first time in

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,719
my life

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,959
and it was awesome it was so great i

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
felt like wow i could see through the

121
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,439
white out and i'm the best skier in the

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,879
world and this is amazing and so like

123
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,519
josh i never really um

124
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,839
went into every happy drugs or got in

125
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,159
really to anything maybe alcohol for a

126
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,239
very very short time in my life but

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
cannabis has been a part of my life ever

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
ever since that day

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,599
how important do you feel it is to try

130
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,679
to have like a really positive first

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,680
experience and how much do you think it

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
affects people going forward in terms of

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,199
whether they're willing to try it again

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
whether they enjoy it overall

135
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,239
i think that it's

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,319
it's definitely you know that first time

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,120
is a really important time it's sort of

138
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,038
like

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,959
it's important i think to have a really

140
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,360
good experience and

141
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,399
now more and more people are able to

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,960
have good experiences i think because

143
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,399
people have an understanding of the

144
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,319
different values of oil or hash or

145
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,918
whether it's a joint and

146
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,240
even the youth have sort of an

147
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,079
understanding and and it's at its at the

148
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,079
fingertip you know you can go on to the

149
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,519
internet and you can learn so much about

150
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,599
different cannabinoids and what they

151
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,399
might do to you and stuff

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
but i think you know for us

153
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,959
at the very beginning

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
i know

155
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,478
for a lot of people that are my age um

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,400
mexican brickweed was was pretty much

157
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,478
like the first experience that they had

158
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,478
because that was what was available

159
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,038
you know in the late 70s and into the

160
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,639
early 80s that's all that i saw

161
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,478
and i think a lot of people

162
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,038
didn't necessarily have a very good

163
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,439
experience with it um maybe because the

164
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,639
way that it was cultivated or maybe

165
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,160
because

166
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,560
you know it was actually really

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,639
incredibly strong whether the

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,519
the cannabinoids show that it was super

169
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,439
high thc or not it just seemed like

170
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,000
those flowers that were coming from

171
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,360
mexico at that time are really strong so

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
people were having not necessarily a

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,000
great experience you know just with that

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,839
but there's a lot of

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,399
ways that cannabis has given out

176
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,560
nowadays too so i mean one could have a

177
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,478
first experience in so many different

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,959
ways it could be phoenix tears it could

179
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,120
be medicals and so you know there's

180
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,038
one and i would take it maybe even one

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
step further and just say

182
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,439
you know from a

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
biological standpoint we we have you

184
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,199
know more receptors in our body cb1

185
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,038
receptors in our body than any other

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
receptors so

187
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,680
we

188
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,639
may or may not be

189
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
you know having a complete

190
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,280
endocannabinoid system you know some

191
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,679
people may have

192
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,239
taken pharmaceutical drugs maybe some

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,720
people have antibiotics whatever it was

194
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,038
maybe they haven't been close to nature

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,919
and so maybe their first experience was

196
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,240
like wow you know a neurological you

197
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,000
know completion to was almost shocked to

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
their system and and

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,439
that could be you know something that

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,959
that would really affect your first

201
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,360
experience and and it could be

202
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,399
overwhelming you know at times but i

203
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
think that

204
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,758
once you start you know finding the

205
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
right dosage or finding the right

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,080
medicine that works for you you know you

207
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,800
do start completing your endocannabinoid

208
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,359
system which then allows you to

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,520
heal in ways that you know is

210
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,520
adaptogenic and your your immune system

211
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,120
can decide what it is so uh you know

212
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,120
first responses

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
is um could mean a lot of things based

214
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
off you know and i think when you're

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
when your endocannabinoid system is

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,918
really flooded

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
um you're definitely going to have a

218
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,439
much better you know experience mentally

219
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,520
and emotionally as well

220
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,959
so i think that it's really i always

221
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,560
tell people if you didn't have a very

222
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,478
good experience the first time it's

223
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
probably because you know your

224
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,199
endocannabinoid system is a lot like a

225
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,599
dry sponge it takes a while

226
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,319
for the cannabinoids to sort of be

227
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,439
uptaken by by the body and and once that

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,680
happens

229
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,079
i think the chances of having a good

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,519
experience are way better and some

231
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,038
people don't even get high on their

232
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,240
first smoke you know it's like you hear

233
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,079
a lot of people oh i didn't feel

234
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,918
anything and then two

235
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,279
three times later and then by the third

236
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,918
time you're like oh

237
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,120
yeah i got it you know and so that's

238
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,278
that's really interesting too and i

239
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,839
think that just speaks to the molecular

240
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,240
biology and and the natural medicine

241
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,080
that it is so yeah

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
yeah some really really interesting

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,839
points you raised there one i just want

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,759
to touch back on quickly is how i think

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,160
kelly you mentioned how you know some of

246
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,200
these mexican strains had such potency

247
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,519
to them

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
a lot of people speak about this idea of

249
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,639
how

250
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,080
some of the strains people think back on

251
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,439
when they first started smoking and

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
they'll talk about them as if they're

253
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
just so much stronger than the stuff

254
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,839
today and then the counterpoint is

255
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,639
raised that well because good weed was

256
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,200
kind of so sparse and it was just near

257
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,759
and far in between where you'd get it it

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
it emphasized that and it maybe makes

259
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,000
people feel like things were more potent

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
than they were do you feel that's the

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
case or do you feel that there truly was

262
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,760
this very unique profile back then which

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,240
really did make things just kind of blow

264
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,319
your socks off

265
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,200
well i mean you always hear oh people

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
bred out the cbd and they just only bred

267
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
for the high and they only bred for thc

268
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,519
which means that at one point there was

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,879
none of that happening so that's the

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,799
early 70s in the late 60s so at that

271
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,759
time you would think there would be

272
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,519
potentially a more complete or wide

273
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,120
range of cannabinoids at the time i

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,720
would i would think you know people talk

275
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
about how i smoke a whole lid you know

276
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,200
with the the term back in the day

277
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,879
and um you know and it wouldn't get you

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,399
totally ripped but it would just be like

279
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,159
a beautiful high and it was like the

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
flower power and the and like the

281
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,879
beautiful things of the of the 60s and

282
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,519
70s back to the land all that

283
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,838
was really done like on that kind of

284
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,799
herb and in that kind of medicated state

285
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
so

286
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,199
i i also know that you know i think it's

287
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,959
kind of known that the columbia

288
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,839
colombian gold was uh was really strong

289
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,479
you know

290
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,040
and or the acapulco gold was uh you know

291
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,759
really strong too and and and the

292
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,519
oaxacan some of the oaxacan streams were

293
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,439
known to be really strong so i don't

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,159
think that i've seen cannabinoid reports

295
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
from back in those days but um that's my

296
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,278
gut feeling

297
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
yeah and i think my take on that would

298
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,759
be that the terpene ratios are you know

299
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,958
really important when we talk about that

300
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,120
i think that

301
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,439
you know in the inner breeding that

302
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,240
we've done you know all the way to this

303
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,519
point now from you know back in the late

304
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,240
60s

305
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,320
we're really breeding for different

306
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
types of terpene ratios and we keep

307
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,519
seeing the mercene you know going up and

308
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,199
up you know so a lot of terpene profiles

309
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,440
are starting to be bred out of it and i

310
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,079
think when you have a really full

311
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,160
rich terpene profile

312
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,479
then you have more of a chance of like

313
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,120
getting sort of that psychedelic feeling

314
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,278
you know when you have full cannabinoid

315
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
full terpene

316
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,120
i mean and i and i've even seen that now

317
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
in tests i'd be like you know that one

318
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
really sort of felt a little bit trippy

319
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
i felt a little hallucinogenic with that

320
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,120
and maybe that's what people are talking

321
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,759
about because i can think about you know

322
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,720
my first joints it was all the mexican

323
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,958
brickweed and i was actually going into

324
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,079
it was at school in arizona for a short

325
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,599
time and

326
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,039
i mean that's the way i made my way

327
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
through college was

328
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,838
sort of swinging that around and

329
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,440
i definitely feel like

330
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,079
that flower did create a hallucinogenic

331
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,720
effect every time that you smoked it and

332
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,120
i could say the same thing about the

333
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
original purple tie stick that people

334
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,919
used to get a hold of or just the tie

335
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,240
stick

336
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,278
that was another one that really sort of

337
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,639
created like that hallucinogenic feeling

338
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,240
and maybe that's what people are talking

339
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,079
about when they talk about you know

340
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,159
getting really high maybe they weren't

341
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,159
getting necessarily really high but they

342
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,278
were feeling sort of that hallucinogenic

343
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,120
psycho

344
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,039
you know and the terpenes you know they

345
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,440
do play on that and if you travel to

346
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,120
mexico in back you know throughout your

347
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,360
life you may have seen

348
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,600
better mexican weed you know then when

349
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,278
it got bricked you know it is true you

350
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
know it affect the terpenes and so you

351
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,078
know you lose a lot of that

352
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,320
and it is sad there was um paraquat was

353
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,000
a was a really big part of you know

354
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
growing in the mexican weed and when my

355
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,159
dad was was dying of cancer he had a

356
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,480
medical intuitive that was saying that

357
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,639
the paraquat that was in

358
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,920
the mexican brickweed that the

359
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
governmental

360
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,559
agents just sprayed from the air from

361
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,559
from helicopters was you know uh was

362
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,239
really in that herb right right there so

363
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,000
that's that who knows what other and

364
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,919
that could have maybe made you feel more

365
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,919
high or psychedelic too you know what

366
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,838
was being added to it

367
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,120
but anyway that's those are some

368
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
thoughts

369
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,839
really really interesting ideas and it

370
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,959
raises my next point which is where do

371
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
you think we're going to go with

372
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,319
terpenes next and the reason why i ask

373
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,559
this is because

374
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,200
i feel like you know to kind of lend

375
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,278
from the school of thought of bodhi that

376
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,360
terpenes are almost like

377
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,039
a gateway or cannabis these days is

378
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
almost like a gateway drug to like

379
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,120
wanting to discover terpenes more you

380
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,919
know like i feel like it's only kind of

381
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
natural or intuitive to want to get more

382
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,078
into like kind of

383
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,679
perfumes and alchemy and just

384
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,278
generally exploring it more because

385
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,838
something i've noticed is like when i've

386
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,240
got some incense burning or i've maybe

387
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
smelled some ood recently if ever i

388
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,919
smoke i seem to get way more high even

389
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
though the terpenes aren't necessarily

390
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,039
from the cannabis itself so where do you

391
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,240
think we go next with terpenes

392
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,159
well i i like that that we have the

393
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
ability to explore different strains and

394
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,439
there's a market for it there's consumer

395
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,479
interest in it and there's more

396
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,279
education on terpenes and

397
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,159
when you really just start analyzing

398
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,039
strains simply from the standpoint of is

399
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,319
it high in mercene at or in high in thc

400
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,399
or not it's amazing how many strains are

401
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,720
high in mercy and that's been said you

402
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,078
know many times so when you get into

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,759
high you know

404
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,919
beta asamine or or terpenoline or you

405
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,198
know different strains like that it's

406
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,039
it's a f it's part of getting high it's

407
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,198
i mean it's urine it's just like food

408
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,198
you know you're letting down

409
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,879
saliva or different compounds in your

410
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,359
mouth as you smell things and that's

411
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,159
like a pre-digester to your food it's

412
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,919
just like kind of a pre high to smell

413
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,799
the weed i mean that's why you want

414
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,039
terpene you know ratios in your in your

415
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,958
lab test to be you know three percent to

416
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,639
six and you know maybe seven percent

417
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,679
would be amazing because that's part of

418
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,879
the high

419
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,000
so um

420
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,320
so terpenes you know food there's food

421
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
terpenes there's if you're gonna extract

422
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
terpenes and add terpenes to food and

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,799
use essences you know that's a that's a

424
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,040
really big open market there's countries

425
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,078
that won't allow cannabis derived

426
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,240
terpenes and there's ones that will um

427
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,799
but there's also people in the cannabis

428
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,198
industry that use food grade terpenes

429
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,679
and did you want to talk about that or

430
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,078
yeah no but um yeah so the the

431
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,078
food-grade terpenes are you know not

432
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,120
necessarily made to the same standards

433
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,000
or the same purity that can have uh you

434
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
know

435
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,919
uh ganja terpene may be made so

436
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,959
having cannabis derived terpenes is you

437
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,759
know a really really good thing for

438
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,399
medicine and for being able to use it in

439
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,399
food and different different drinks

440
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,159
and what i see um

441
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,958
in the industry right now which is what

442
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,559
josh just touched on is that

443
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:01,758
the more that we abuse this plant and

444
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,679
the more that we continue to grow her in

445
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
a synthetic environment and the more

446
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,559
that we disregard

447
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,440
ecology and disregard the environment

448
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,559
and microbiology the more that the plant

449
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,800
is going to react she's an adaptogen she

450
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,439
adapts so she's going to adapt to

451
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,519
whatever environment that you put her in

452
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,320
and what we notice is that you can take

453
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,039
a full spectrum cannabinoid plant with

454
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,800
full spectrum terpenes in it you can put

455
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,360
it in a

456
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,439
in an environment where she's not being

457
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,159
you know taken care of and not being

458
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
regarded in a very high manner and

459
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,198
what's going to happen is that all of

460
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,000
the terpene ratios go away thc rises and

461
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,159
the mercene rises so to me that tells me

462
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399
that those are both stressors

463
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,078
there are stressors within the plant

464
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,600
that that's what she does when she

465
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,000
starts to adapt now you can maybe even

466
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,800
take that plant that's super high mercy

467
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,839
and really high thc you can put it into

468
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,319
a deep soil beautiful living bed

469
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,318
outdoors under the sun and then you'll

470
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,360
really start to understand what the full

471
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,678
genetic is of that plant i don't think

472
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,038
that the way that we are growing now in

473
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,959
the way that we're trading these

474
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,160
genetics that we think are just the bomb

475
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
and the fire

476
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,360
you know is very respectful to the plant

477
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,759
so i feel like she's reacting by you

478
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,558
know lowering her terpene and hiring her

479
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,759
thc counts and i think that the future

480
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,639
of the medicine is nootropic i mean and

481
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,798
also you know full spectrum and and it's

482
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
really important to have nutraceuticals

483
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,798
over the pharmaceuticals to where the

484
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,360
plant is being used and i think that

485
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,798
when people are being given a choice on

486
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,639
what they want to smoke or what they

487
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,119
want to ingest

488
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,280
if they have a choice between a plant

489
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,279
that hasn't been very respected and is

490
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,279
put into these heavy synthetic

491
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,480
environments with high mercine and high

492
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,879
thc

493
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,919
as opposed to something that has been

494
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,720
totally respected and is able to show

495
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,759
its full value in its genetics they're

496
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,079
going to choose that full spectrum plant

497
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,400
so i'm really hoping that in the future

498
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,839
more and more people have an ability to

499
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
be able to

500
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,038
experience the two different varietals

501
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,880
and be able to experience um you know

502
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,558
full spectrum and i would like to think

503
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
that that's going to be the future of

504
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,720
the industry with terpenes and i think

505
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,599
the reason why the terpenes you know are

506
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,200
better or last longer with living soils

507
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,839
is because they have

508
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,319
the fungal filaments in the roots eating

509
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,038
the microbiology and really

510
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,599
adding you know the right waxes and the

511
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,000
right terpenes and the right gases

512
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,240
within the within the trichomes for the

513
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
cure to last right you know if it's

514
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
grown

515
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,000
synthetically or you know hydroponically

516
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,038
it doesn't necessarily have the same

517
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,200
body of flavor you know in the long run

518
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,279
and it may not last you know longer than

519
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,919
two weeks and still be fresh but when

520
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,558
when a plant is grown when we say

521
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,520
respectfully we say you know in a in a

522
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,839
living soil that's really active and and

523
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,759
adding metabolites to the soils and to

524
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,519
the plants so the reason why it's better

525
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,759
is because it has a

526
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,720
complete system that it's working with

527
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,200
with which allows it to complete its

528
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,038
system so and i think that a good way to

529
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,759
for people to understand it is i just

530
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,240
believe like that high thc high mercing

531
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,319
is really the cortisol of the plant it's

532
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
the plant showing its stresses and then

533
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,279
when you have a plant that has full

534
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,720
terpene and full cannabinoid ratios that

535
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,279
that plant is just really full of

536
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,120
serotonin it like has all of the happy

537
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,960
things and i believe that you really

538
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,038
feel that as well you know when you're

539
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,360
ingesting a plant that's happy you're

540
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,640
gonna have a way higher chance of of

541
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,959
having a better experience

542
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,280
of course so many points we need to

543
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,079
touch on but i mean the first one which

544
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,200
comes to mind is when you reference kind

545
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,119
of you know growing the plant

546
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,080
respectfully and how that means in a

547
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,319
really nice well catered organic matter

548
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,599
to me it raises the idea of is it

549
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,359
possible

550
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,199
because i'm not sure myself is it

551
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:12,000
possible to grow quote organically in a

552
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,798
coco medium

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,480
well

554
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,519
you know then you just start getting

555
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,400
into terms you know so i mean

556
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,440
yeah it's possible to have probably like

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,880
for the you know the usda which is to

558
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
you'd have to check your country you

559
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,360
know but i'm sure that you could just

560
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,038
use organic products that are certified

561
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,918
and say yeah it's organic but

562
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,759
from our standpoint you know the organic

563
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,759
has been hijacked in that from that

564
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,000
perspective and and that's why

565
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,879
regenerative makes a lot of sense to us

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,798
because

567
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,679
to say the word regenerative really

568
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,720
means you're regenerating life which

569
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,200
means you have living soils and so

570
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,200
uh those soils are

571
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,679
aiding in the medicine and that makes

572
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,558
the medicine better so um you know to

573
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,038
have

574
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:06,158
a more diverse soil

575
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,960
is going to be more regenerative and

576
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,440
from our perspective more natural

577
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,120
and and better than organic

578
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,200
and then you you're really addressing

579
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,798
the endophytic reaction which is within

580
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
the plant which is something that we're

581
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,839
just absolutely

582
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,320
you know

583
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,199
fascinated with because i'm incredibly

584
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,519
fascinated with the human microbiome as

585
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,279
well so if you take a plan and you're

586
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,480
growing it in cocoa and you're giving it

587
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,879
organic

588
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,200
amendments like what josh says sure you

589
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,720
can say that it's grown organically but

590
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,880
was it grown naturally was it grown in a

591
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,839
biological way the answer would be no

592
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,679
because you're not really creating any

593
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,480
biology in your coco coir there's no

594
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,960
living food web there's no you know

595
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
microbiology and it really doesn't allow

596
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,200
the plant to

597
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,279
reach its full potential because a full

598
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,480
potential of a plant is when you have

599
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,720
maximum

600
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,120
endophytes within it and it's all

601
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
working within the soil and all the way

602
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,199
up to the leaves it's it's a complete

603
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,079
cycle and microbiology you know it's

604
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,038
like well you can you can say that you

605
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,639
could be on an organic diet too

606
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,960
like if you

607
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,280
you know are you are getting fed through

608
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,840
an iv tube or something like that you

609
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,480
can say well you could put organic you

610
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,639
know nutrients into the iv and the

611
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,200
person can stay alive and you can say

612
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,720
well they have an organic diet but

613
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,360
they're completely passing the

614
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,159
microbiome which is the digestive system

615
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,038
which is the same as when you're you're

616
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,000
taking away that living soil attribute

617
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:45,119
so is that person who's you know living

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
on this organic iv diet gonna have the

619
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,719
same

620
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,720
you know full immune stimulus response

621
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
as the person who's using their

622
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
digestive tract in a full living

623
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,919
microbiome you know the answer is no

624
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,320
it's really no different for a plant

625
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,720
of course of course reminds me of like a

626
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,798
use it or lose it attitude but it raises

627
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,798
a very interesting point around

628
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,200
classifications and certifications

629
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,279
i've long been very skeptical of the

630
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,679
omri certification i'm sure a lot of

631
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,918
people are as well you can it takes you

632
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,600
know no less than five seconds to find a

633
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,080
product that's clearly not organic that

634
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,639
has an organic certification on it so it

635
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,720
raises the question do we just look to

636
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
avoid it and just go based off things

637
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
you know for sure are organic because

638
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,880
you often hear people say oh i don't use

639
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,720
anything from a bottle but at the same

640
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,480
time there are some products i use that

641
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,600
come from a bottle that i know are full

642
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,599
well organic so how do you kind of

643
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,599
navigate this minefield as it may be

644
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,000
well you touched on something really

645
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,759
important which is omri omri is a

646
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,558
registration

647
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,558
it is not an organic certification and

648
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,319
if you go on to omri's website that's

649
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,639
the first thing that they say it's a

650
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,678
registry and the language is really

651
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,679
powerful and important because omri will

652
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,960
state that this is you know um able to

653
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,840
be used in an organic for use in organic

654
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,600
yeah for use in organic agriculture but

655
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,879
it's still up to the third-party

656
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,879
certifier

657
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
on whether that's organic or not so it's

658
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,080
it's only a registry created within that

659
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
system that says you know you if you

660
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,359
didn't have

661
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
a product available

662
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,678
when in need you know that you had the

663
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,879
ability to use a chemical here and there

664
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,640
and so

665
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
and so we you know and this is not just

666
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,840
a philosophy so we we have over the

667
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,599
years been very we have products as you

668
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,918
know you know so we've had all of our

669
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:45,119
products tested so we're testing

670
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,000
raw materials for 12 years now and

671
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,959
and we you know we're really aware of of

672
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
what's

673
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,319
where there's glyphosate you know and

674
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
glyphosate's just one compound you know

675
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,639
there could be decamba or just there's a

676
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
thousand other compounds but that are

677
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,120
defoliants and whatnot but

678
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,278
so but we're careful about that so you

679
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,278
know

680
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,798
do you look for a certification well you

681
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,200
know i think at this point it's just a

682
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,679
matter of education you know if someone

683
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
says they're biodynamic

684
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,960
you know that may or may not be to the

685
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,798
usda standards or it may

686
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,798
but you would probably feel pretty good

687
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,798
about it because you know the biodynamic

688
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,639
standards are strong and people are

689
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,000
really of the earth

690
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,080
that are doing that and they're making

691
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,079
the world a better place um

692
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,480
you know other other organic standards

693
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,038
that are based solely on products so you

694
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,079
can have an organic product in a bottle

695
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,200
but

696
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,359
it if it's it still has to have a

697
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,440
stabilizer in it and usually that

698
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,639
stabilizer is a small percentage of

699
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,798
non-organic compounds so i mean from our

700
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,278
certification we really

701
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,278
recommend against anything in bottles

702
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,200
and go with raw materials because that's

703
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,798
just the closest thing that you can get

704
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,159
to something that's natural which is

705
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,158
going to feed your

706
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,039
microbiology if you're getting something

707
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,679
in a bottle if it's not like expanding

708
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,558
and blowing up in the bottle then it's

709
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,880
not alive really if it's in a little you

710
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,879
know it's it's being stabilized and i'm

711
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,480
not saying it's not useful because

712
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,559
obviously people are using things in

713
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,480
bottles and growing plants so it's it's

714
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,079
not that it's just

715
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,159
if you want to

716
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,240
regenerate life on earth you have to go

717
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,600
you know beyond beyond the bottle and so

718
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,359
that's you know we have our

719
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:33,278
certification and we've gone beyond just

720
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,359
certifying products like our our

721
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,960
certification is not okay give me a list

722
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,439
of products you know and let's go

723
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,919
through this this process of deciding

724
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,759
whether there's heavy metals in them or

725
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,440
or um uh maybe you know something like

726
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,240
pyrinthrians or something that's going

727
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,400
to

728
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,880
fail a test so what we do is we say okay

729
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,600
well let's try and grow it naturally

730
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,000
let's try and enhance our natural biome

731
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,000
and our natural plants so certifications

732
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,640
can mean a lot of things and and and it

733
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,319
really is a it takes education to learn

734
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,679
what each certification is about

735
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,918
yeah of course

736
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,640
so would your rule of thumb in general

737
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,640
be

738
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,559
you know if if you want to something

739
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,799
from a bottle so to speak just make it

740
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,359
yourself

741
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,639
i mean that's what we suggest and i i

742
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,240
think also

743
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
you know we

744
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,679
we created the certification and we've

745
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,880
actually even had people say well it's

746
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,798
so romantic you know it's like something

747
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,120
that people could only strive for and

748
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,480
maybe not or only dream of and not

749
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,158
really do

750
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,759
and the reason why we created the

751
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,240
standards that we created which is

752
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,759
really utilizing as many closed loops as

753
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,759
you can whether you're an indoor

754
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,319
gardener whether you have a tiny little

755
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,558
small plot in your backyard there's

756
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,359
still so many easy things that you can

757
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,200
do

758
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,639
to become closed loop and it wasn't

759
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,120
because

760
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,038
it just is sort of this romantic idea

761
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,038
what we're realizing is that the more

762
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,158
closed loop that you are and the more

763
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,158
vigilant that you are about what is to

764
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
your plants then you don't even have to

765
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,520
sweat it when somebody buys your whole

766
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,679
stock and they turn it into a

767
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,759
concentrate because what we're seeing

768
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,360
over and over again is people that are

769
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,000
organic certified and they're following

770
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,240
all the organic you know certificate or

771
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,398
all of the organic registering uh

772
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,599
products out there that they're still

773
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,119
failing

774
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,519
yeah and department of agriculture is

775
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,278
like yeah thumbs up it's so awesome you

776
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,759
could totally do this this is organic

777
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,519
it's usda or it's canadian certified or

778
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,398
whatever it is

779
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,558
then

780
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,639
the the flowers are concentrated and

781
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,200
they fail heavy metals tests they fail

782
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,399
all different kinds of crazy tests

783
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,558
because

784
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,558
they're they're concentrating it because

785
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,639
it's becoming concentrated so whatever

786
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,398
was in that flower what was ever in the

787
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,960
soil or whatever was in your your

788
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,959
soilless medium is going up into your

789
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,319
flower this idea of like oh you can

790
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
flush it out

791
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,960
you know

792
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,119
we always thought it was a joke and now

793
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,120
science is proving it to us that it's a

794
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,119
joke you know it doesn't just flush out

795
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,038
it goes up into the plant and it stays

796
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,759
there for its duration and it stays

797
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,519
there all the way until you know it's

798
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,200
done and and then you turn it into a

799
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,398
concentrate and it becomes really

800
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,720
apparent

801
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,839
and there's too many farmers out there

802
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,159
that have lost their entire crop because

803
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,000
it's turned into a concentrate and they

804
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,679
fail a test

805
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,440
so it's really beautiful it's like

806
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
cannabis is giving us this beautiful

807
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,159
opportunity right now

808
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,558
to

809
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,640
look at our food sources to look at big

810
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,639
agriculture to look at the what we're

811
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,720
feeding our plants to to to all of a

812
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,038
sudden have a look at the apples that

813
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,558
are you know in the store and wonder

814
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,879
geez you know

815
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,480
what's in this because now i know with

816
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,559
cannabis testing

817
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,079
it's just really leading the way and and

818
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,200
it's not surprising because it's a

819
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,278
master plant and it's what she she does

820
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,679
she gives us different ideologies and

821
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,398
she gives us you know different keys and

822
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,960
and solutions you know when we ingest

823
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:04,079
her and also when we cultivate her and

824
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,759
it's not just um you know because

825
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,038
we don't believe in the system it's just

826
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:12,240
when we you know we've learned that 75

827
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,640
million tons of top soil have been lost

828
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,759
since the industrial revolution and we

829
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,240
know that

830
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,079
um you know there's a million species on

831
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,480
earth that are you know potentially

832
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,639
going extinct maybe the great barrier

833
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,880
reef is dying you know so what we're

834
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,520
trying to say is you know our our

835
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,360
certification is certifying farms when

836
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,440
we say the word regenerative we know

837
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,678
we're regenerating life on earth and

838
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,519
it's really meaningful to us and we're

839
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,679
we're growing medicine that's beyond

840
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,599
just the term organic because

841
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,559
or the term organic at this point is

842
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,798
just a

843
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,119
sort of a word that's just been

844
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,038
you know hollowed out by the system you

845
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,798
know and so what we're doing is we're

846
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,119
you know these these close-up systems

847
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,918
are are creating ingenuity on the farm

848
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,639
so

849
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,880
you know we can put carbon back into the

850
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,399
soil because agriculture you know

851
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,159
releases up to 12 gigatons of co2 a year

852
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,879
i mean there's there's so many reasons

853
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,278
why we have to do better and we we know

854
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,240
the small farms have to save the earth

855
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:15,440
so we're creating small farm webs that

856
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,679
are saving their earth

857
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,440
that brings us to a perfect next point

858
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,480
which is that i've had a lot of people

859
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,480
message me from both around australia

860
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,798
new zealand and even some other distant

861
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,200
parts of the world and all of them ask

862
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,278
questions along the same line which is

863
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,720
you know how can i become

864
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,798
a a pure farm myself maybe not in a farm

865
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,880
sense but you know how can i try to get

866
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,599
my little tent or my little

867
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,240
uh you know backyard plot as closely

868
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,398
aligned with the dragonfly ethos as

869
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,079
possible and i guess it raises an

870
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,000
interesting point you know will you guys

871
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,398
be looking to expand internationally

872
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,720
with the certification

873
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,278
we already have we we already are

874
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,759
international and that's the beauty of

875
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,398
this is because it's community run and

876
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,000
community involved and it and it really

877
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,959
is creating

878
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,440
sort of a network um you know as the web

879
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,919
gets wider the weave gets tighter and we

880
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,000
all have an understanding

881
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,799
you know josh and i go out we and and we

882
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,119
do consultations or or we or we talk to

883
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,440
people and i always say you know people

884
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,959
like whoa that was so amazing it was so

885
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,038
great what you said and i always say

886
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
well i didn't really teach you anything

887
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,038
i'm just reminding you

888
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,519
so i think that we have all of this

889
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,879
great knowledge deep within our dna of

890
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,640
what we know is right on the earth and

891
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,080
when people you know hear about what

892
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,600
we're doing in the certification there's

893
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,519
so many that want to jump on because

894
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,599
they're reminded

895
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,839
of something that they know is a better

896
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,480
solution than than what's happening now

897
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,119
and no matter what size you know plot

898
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,759
you have you can be pure certified you

899
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,479
know we we we talk about having six

900
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,599
closed loops and the importance of that

901
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,000
and um you know so we're certifying all

902
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,759
different size farms from huge massive

903
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,359
hemp farms you know

904
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,599
to to small backyard plots and and and

905
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,359
there is a limitation on massive you

906
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,119
know hem farms and stuff but you know

907
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,519
when i talk you need to talk about 10

908
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,518
acres you know regeneratively or 20

909
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,038
that's that's pretty big and stuff so

910
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,359
that's that's the way we're

911
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:25,038
what we're thinking there and and so we

912
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:28,319
have you know um eatle green uh farm out

913
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,200
in switzerland who are certified and

914
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,918
uh

915
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,080
there's three farms in canada that are

916
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,960
certified and there's farms around the

917
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,439
us we went to thailand and we're in

918
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,798
communication with farms

919
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,000
with some some local farmers in thailand

920
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,119
and um

921
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,919
we really

922
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,000
do want to expand it into the world and

923
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,880
we do travel quite a bit in the world so

924
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,519
we would love to to visit an area to

925
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,679
really define what it is bioregionally

926
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,679
you know what pure certified would mean

927
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,399
or what you know regenerative would mean

928
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,880
in a bioregion and right now we're not

929
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,398
certifying a lot of indoor farms what we

930
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,800
have is mostly sun grown outdoor farms

931
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,159
and people with food gardens and so the

932
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,639
part of the requirements of what we have

933
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,200
is to have a food garden and to have

934
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,838
pollinator and flower gardens aside from

935
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,559
your cannabis or or even better mixed in

936
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,559
with your cannabis so and it can be done

937
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,559
indoors and we are working on creating a

938
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,159
pure certified indoor

939
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,039
um certification which would and entail

940
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,919
um

941
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,800
you know

942
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:38,000
some type of alternative energy or some

943
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,960
um ways that you've lowered your energy

944
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,918
use and your grid using led lights or or

945
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,599
some kind of a mixed spectrum um so um

946
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,279
yes i you know we would just like to

947
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,200
tell people out in the world please get

948
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,960
in touch with us i mean you know what

949
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,078
we're interested in is really earth

950
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,000
stewards uniting and telling our story

951
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
together um it doesn't have to be just

952
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,199
cannabis we you know food farms are out

953
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,759
there getting in touch with us too um

954
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,279
wineries anyone really it's it's kind of

955
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
a way of life

956
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
you know and we we support each other

957
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:12,000
the best we can as family

958
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,239
um you know to to just be natural and

959
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
make a difference and and also we we

960
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,039
find ways we can work together with

961
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,119
business

962
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,519
and it's not it's not an exclusivity

963
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,079
thing it's it's absolutely earth

964
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,838
stewards unite it's it's so important if

965
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,079
you have these wonderful ideas and

966
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,400
there's a way that you can make a change

967
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,119
within your own you know community or

968
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,880
your own neighborhood you know do it if

969
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,960
something inspires you then we're just

970
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,640
really encouraging people to do it see

971
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,119
what happens you know part of the pure

972
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,559
certification that we do also is that

973
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,599
you have to be part of community

974
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:48,719
education in some way so you know

975
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,960
go out there share share your successes

976
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,039
share your failures you know talk about

977
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,920
what worked and what didn't work we have

978
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,239
we're at this wonderful like bell curve

979
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,880
of knowledge in the human race right now

980
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,279
we're able to find knowledge at a single

981
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,000
touch of the button and we're sharing

982
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,240
knowledge in such an excited way and i

983
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,719
think that you know the more that we're

984
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,319
able to align with nature she has more

985
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,519
and more solutions with us and and

986
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,599
that's really

987
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,838
you know the main connection not only

988
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,838
are we connected by this master plan but

989
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,480
we're also connected for with our love

990
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,559
of nature and also i'll just just add

991
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,000
really quickly that our our ultimate our

992
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,960
best way of of taking on new areas is to

993
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,280
find a model farm say in australia or

994
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,358
new zealand you know a model farm that

995
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,200
would have us you know show up at the

996
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,679
farm we could have a gathering where we

997
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,279
met you know local farmers

998
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,759
and then what we do is we because our

999
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,800
certification is free it's more about

1000
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,640
you know

1001
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,200
being able to complete all of the

1002
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,118
requirements and and then once we visit

1003
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,838
you know say that model farm then we

1004
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,800
could create a

1005
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,239
peer-reviewed um

1006
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,960
inspection so once one farm is uh

1007
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,358
uh certified then they go out and

1008
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,358
certify other farms and then they can

1009
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,960
tell from that farm whether it reflects

1010
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,639
you know the level of standards and

1011
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,960
ethics that they have and that's the way

1012
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,440
that it builds within each region so we

1013
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,679
may come for the original one and maybe

1014
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,039
we try and come back again later you

1015
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,118
know on other years but um it becomes

1016
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:23,358
peer-reviewed and it and it's we take it

1017
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,720
really seriously so all farms are having

1018
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,199
everything

1019
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,639
you know every input on the farm is is

1020
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:33,279
tested and inspected to human uh grade

1021
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,679
quality and art and all of our products

1022
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,880
are also you know tested in laboratories

1023
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:41,519
so you know we we have to walk our talk

1024
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,280
and and create medicine that's

1025
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,159
um you know really valuable to the

1026
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,200
market

1027
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,279
most certainly so at the start of that

1028
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,838
one you mentioned that you had been

1029
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,519
looking at some stuff in thailand i

1030
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,519
noticed that you've been posting a

1031
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,400
reasonable amount of content from bali

1032
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:01,440
what's your involvement with that

1033
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,400
um we've been going to bali for a really

1034
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,358
long time uh let's see i think maybe

1035
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,440
about 17 17 years

1036
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,679
we've been going to bali and and it

1037
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,760
started with me at the beginning is that

1038
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,639
i was um josh and i were both

1039
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,800
instrumental in opening up a free clinic

1040
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,358
for women and

1041
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,440
in a birthing center so also for

1042
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,440
pregnant women as well as postnatal

1043
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,480
women to be able to come in and receive

1044
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,920
help um to receive care so that was

1045
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,480
something that we started and we just

1046
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,200
kept going back and then when the

1047
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,199
tsunami happened um

1048
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,118
we were the first boots on the ground in

1049
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,598
the aceh province

1050
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,480
we worked with permaculture

1051
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,480
ngos edep was one and

1052
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,480
while he which was friends of the earth

1053
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,599
and we we worked with other

1054
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,358
world ngos to to come together to create

1055
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,000
you know safe place for women and

1056
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:58,319
children during chaos

1057
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,679
so we we did a lot of work in in that

1058
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,000
area and also supported a clinic in bali

1059
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,838
as well

1060
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,679
so we have a lot of family it's it's

1061
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,320
it's sort of another home for us that's

1062
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,039
another heart space for us in the world

1063
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,800
so

1064
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,759
when we go there we you know we see a

1065
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,760
lot of family and friends and i get to

1066
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,000
be surrounded with a lot of older

1067
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,720
children that i got to see you know into

1068
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,358
the world so it's it's just a it's a

1069
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,439
root for us and we we do custom sarongs

1070
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,239
and make custom surrounds but we also

1071
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,880
you know that's a side thing but um

1072
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,598
we um work with permaculture you know we

1073
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,599
we

1074
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,760
really really like seeing the expansion

1075
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,119
of permaculture that's happening on bali

1076
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
and there's a lot of international

1077
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,280
people there and just a lot of really

1078
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,280
amazing food to table

1079
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,040
uh farm to table

1080
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,839
um

1081
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,440
raw food places and and farms that are

1082
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,960
really beautiful there so it's been

1083
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,358
really fun to watch the conscious

1084
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,358
expansion

1085
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,199
yeah being one of the

1086
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,598
countless australians who's been to bali

1087
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,199
myself i can attest that the uh the food

1088
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,240
there's great and the fact that it's

1089
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,480
grown locally and organically only helps

1090
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,479
i guess the question i'm wondering is

1091
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,639
what's the local production of cannabis

1092
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,960
like there because from my extremely

1093
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,118
extremely limited experience it was it

1094
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,720
was hard to find decent quality stuff

1095
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,800
but that's very much from the

1096
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,399
perspective of like you know someone

1097
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,079
who's not in the loop with any of the

1098
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,039
locals or anything what's it like when

1099
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,440
you're part of that inner circle

1100
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,559
well in bali particularly we wouldn't

1101
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,679
recommend it at all you know it's a very

1102
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:38,799
indonesia's incredibly strict

1103
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:41,118
even though a lot of the the older

1104
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,240
balinese and especially when you go over

1105
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,480
to sumatra you know you definitely see a

1106
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,959
lot of the locals using cannabis and

1107
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,440
it's sort of a normalcy for them

1108
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,440
um some some of the most isolated

1109
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,400
cannabis in the world you know that i

1110
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,960
believe to still be you know true land

1111
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,960
race is in sumatra or is in some of the

1112
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,800
islands in indonesia because it's been

1113
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,119
so blocked off but

1114
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,960
you know if you if you go to bali it's a

1115
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,680
really good time to take a break it's

1116
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,440
it's not a time to ask people on the

1117
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,759
streets you know where to find it or

1118
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,838
where to get it um you know people are

1119
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,800
found with with five grams and they're

1120
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,639
spending 17 years in jail as australians

1121
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,720
it's not something that you want to be

1122
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,960
doing and really the quality that you

1123
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,838
get is going to be from another island

1124
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,559
so

1125
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:27,519
um

1126
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,519
you know

1127
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,920
i would just really recommend to people

1128
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,559
that that's just not a place where where

1129
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
cannabis mixes with their vacation

1130
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,920
right but of course you see a lot of

1131
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,159
these old land races that i was just

1132
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,240
talking about and that's something that

1133
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,639
i'm really interested in you know when i

1134
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,279
went and worked over in sumatra for many

1135
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:50,078
months i learned a lot about

1136
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,079
the relationship that the locals had

1137
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,760
there with cannabis it's a very tight

1138
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,920
close relationship it's something that

1139
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,480
they used to calm down it was something

1140
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,079
that they used in their daily life

1141
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,920
when they would come into the clinic i

1142
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,160
would say you know how much do you smoke

1143
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,838
and they would say well i smoke you know

1144
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,000
six of these and they would point to

1145
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,679
their breast pocket that had the tobacco

1146
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,599
and they'd say i'd smoke eight of these

1147
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,358
a day and that's you know the cannabis

1148
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,880
pocket so

1149
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,400
even though there's this really

1150
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,680
incredible sort of

1151
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,880
strict regiment um and laws

1152
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:27,519
yeah sharia law it's really interesting

1153
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:31,039
is a c e h which is an acronym for

1154
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:34,239
arabic chinese european and hindustani

1155
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,880
and um it's it's it's it's just because

1156
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,879
c is as that sound in indonesia but that

1157
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,880
the aceh region is in northern sumatra

1158
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,400
and it's one of the most strict islamic

1159
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
areas

1160
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,519
in

1161
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,800
indonesia but it's where all the herb is

1162
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:52,559
grown so it's super kind of like and

1163
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,200
they have gorilla kind of they had that

1164
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,519
you know different autonomous

1165
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,239
regions there and and they they say that

1166
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:03,039
the their weed came from india back in

1167
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,679
the the dutch trading days and stuff so

1168
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,279
i you know exactly how long it's been on

1169
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,199
sumatra

1170
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,800
maybe hundreds of years we don't really

1171
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,480
know exactly because

1172
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,160
it has really closed off but it is

1173
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,639
interesting how it's in

1174
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,358
common you know the common person's

1175
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,358
possession in northern sumatra you know

1176
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,239
in that area and it's a real

1177
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,719
tall

1178
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:29,358
thin leafed variety

1179
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:32,199
that has you know uplifting terpenes uh

1180
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:35,440
you know more like a limonene

1181
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:38,480
beta-caryophyllene terpinilline um they

1182
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
take an incredibly long time to flower

1183
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,000
um

1184
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,720
so they're really reminiscent of

1185
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,119
of just interesting cannabis

1186
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,118
that you know is not something that and

1187
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,838
it definitely gives you a very different

1188
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,920
feeling you know we were talking earlier

1189
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,719
about oh you know those old land races

1190
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,760
and what does it make you feel like well

1191
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,318
you know that really isolated very far

1192
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,160
removed and not interbred with a lot of

1193
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:04,960
the modern cannabis

1194
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,399
um

1195
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,159
of today

1196
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,639
really gives you a totally different eye

1197
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,799
than than what the modern uh cannabis we

1198
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,159
brought we brought some seeds back so

1199
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,839
you know we're trying to give it a try

1200
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,598
to germinate them it can be a little

1201
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,519
difficult but you know what we we are

1202
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,480
always a little bit of uh

1203
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,280
you know

1204
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,679
crafty let's say

1205
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,000
yeah things manage to just appear back

1206
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,838
at home somehow

1207
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,599
and malaysia's laws are changing so

1208
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,838
we're really hopeful that indonesia's

1209
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,280
laws change with that with thailand's

1210
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,199
change the world

1211
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,040
you know is changing and and i would

1212
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:42,159
love nothing more than to be able to to

1213
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,318
work with

1214
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,639
hemp or hemp oils in indonesia because

1215
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,318
there's crazy sicknesses happening there

1216
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,239
and and i'm in love with rice and what's

1217
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,559
happened with rice is their staple diet

1218
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,399
is creating a lot of weird illnesses

1219
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,159
there so i mean they they could really

1220
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,000
use the medicine and it would be nice to

1221
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,679
see some law changes there and it was

1222
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,559
great this time that we went to bali

1223
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:02,960
there was

1224
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,838
more and more people asking us about it

1225
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,599
and really absolutely you know how i was

1226
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,759
talking about earlier of just being

1227
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,039
reminded that this is a good medicine

1228
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,599
and they would say oh well my

1229
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,639
grandmother used that in tea absolutely

1230
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,240
you know

1231
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,318
there's no like bad reflection you know

1232
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,799
on cannabis or they haven't been through

1233
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,639
like any kind of a political move they

1234
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,200
just know that it's illegal but they

1235
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,358
don't really get why it's illegal

1236
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,279
yeah it's in the village but it's not

1237
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,279
given out to the tourists there's a

1238
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,760
clear distinction and stuff so yeah

1239
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,000
that's that's what's happening there

1240
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,720
yeah kind of backs my uh limited

1241
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,079
experience admittedly i was what 14 when

1242
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,919
i went there so many moons ago but uh to

1243
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,640
jump onto something a little more recent

1244
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,079
it's been well over a year since we last

1245
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,078
talked probably should have asked this a

1246
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,119
little earlier on but what's new in the

1247
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,119
world of dragonfly

1248
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,639
oh

1249
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,560
so much

1250
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,279
i feel like you know one week in the

1251
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,559
cannabis industry feels like a year

1252
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,599
so

1253
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,239
there's

1254
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,599
so much that's happening right now you

1255
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:14,318
know we just wanted to be humble

1256
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,519
cannabis farmers and producing beautiful

1257
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:20,159
medicine for sick people and now all of

1258
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:24,880
a sudden we're learning about genetic

1259
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:28,719
coding and patenting and markering and

1260
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,720
corporate takeovers and creating a

1261
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,399
business and how you have to you know

1262
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,358
learn the rules so you know how to break

1263
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,000
them and

1264
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:39,039
it's just and federal licensure and how

1265
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,880
to do it without a consultant and

1266
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,800
you know still having our products and

1267
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,200
still growing a whole new garden and

1268
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,599
every year but mostly exciting the most

1269
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,239
exciting thing we think is just

1270
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,920
this the the collective of farmers and

1271
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,679
businesses that we're working with and

1272
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
the science of regenerative cannabis

1273
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,440
tour that we've been doing is really

1274
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,919
amazing and just the expansion of

1275
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,440
knowledge of organic and regenerative

1276
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,599
practices and

1277
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,519
we've recently formed an online

1278
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,000
communication hub where we can all

1279
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,920
communicate with each other live

1280
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,800
and it's really really excellent because

1281
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,800
there's you know you know 75 people on

1282
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,640
there that are very you know active and

1283
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,800
we all can communicate with each other

1284
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:21,679
and and it's just really really helpful

1285
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,480
and i think like as much of the heavy

1286
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:27,598
feeling of licensure and the man coming

1287
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,760
down on you and heavy duty fines and all

1288
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,680
that sort of stuff or you know people

1289
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,040
having to close up their farms because

1290
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,159
they can't make you know they're in

1291
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,960
economic struggles you know as much as

1292
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,318
all of that is really difficult and that

1293
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,240
is happening

1294
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,440
is as equal

1295
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,598
of what is fabulous and fantastic that's

1296
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,119
happening right now i mean

1297
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,838
we are so totally sparked on by people

1298
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,160
you know this is a perfect example we we

1299
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,078
got back from indonesia we had been on a

1300
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,558
flight for i don't even know it felt

1301
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,400
like 36 hours josh and i hadn't slept we

1302
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,079
spent two hours in in vancouver and like

1303
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,680
it's great in vancouver so we're able to

1304
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,960
like smoke some bulls right there in the

1305
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,558
airport

1306
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,039
just right outside of the airport and

1307
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,119
then we flew onto michigan and it was

1308
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,279
dark and it was snowing and we had just

1309
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,200
come from indonesia we're like what in

1310
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,480
the heck are we doing here this is

1311
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,279
totally crazy

1312
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,400
and then not even five hours later

1313
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,079
we walked into a room of people at the

1314
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,480
conference at the science of

1315
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,640
regenerative cannabis conference

1316
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,079
and it only took one second to realize

1317
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:37,199
why we do this

1318
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,119
like

1319
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,759
as much as it seemed like whoa that was

1320
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,920
a really crazy journey like the energy

1321
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,480
in that room of people that just want to

1322
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,400
connect over this plant and

1323
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,358
want to connect over nature and want to

1324
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,400
connect over like learning about

1325
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:54,000
microbiology and how to better their

1326
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,920
life and how to get off their

1327
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,838
pharmaceuticals because it's all in

1328
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,440
relation you know we really have this

1329
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,519
understanding that if you have healthy

1330
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,800
soil then you have healthy life

1331
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:07,759
and it's like all of that is happening

1332
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,720
too so it's this really beautiful yin

1333
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,280
and yang right now and i feel like

1334
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:15,199
they're equally as potent and it's and

1335
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,599
and and that's why i say you know one

1336
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,799
week in the cannabis industry is a year

1337
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,880
because

1338
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,039
so much is happening within that one

1339
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,280
week that you know you really want to

1340
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,358
like hold on to it and soak it up

1341
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,680
because it's just all so potent and the

1342
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,358
farm bill passed and the hemp is you

1343
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,440
know a really big frontier and

1344
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,199
feminization of seeds and you know

1345
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,119
there's there's a lot that we've been

1346
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,439
we've been talking about so

1347
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,280
that can spark uh you know more

1348
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,838
conversation

1349
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,559
so you guys brought up the science and

1350
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,558
regenerative cannabis conferences how

1351
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,119
has that been and what types of things

1352
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:54,319
can we expect to see kind of springing

1353
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,960
forth as a result of those conferences

1354
00:49:54,318 --> 00:50:00,079
well um what's really beautiful about

1355
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,880
the conferences is that it is

1356
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,800
really rooted in science and it does go

1357
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,838
through and give you really nuts and

1358
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,800
bolts

1359
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,880
information from really good presenters

1360
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,280
but it's almost been become like a

1361
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,800
spiritual thing too because

1362
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,920
i mean

1363
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,318
farmers

1364
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,559
have to band together right now and and

1365
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,800
not only is it exciting to create a

1366
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,720
natural system and get you know good

1367
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,480
product it's also kind of a beautiful

1368
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,039
networking

1369
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,079
opportunity for people to come together

1370
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,519
so you know we did it internationally

1371
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,440
this year for the first time in

1372
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,159
vancouver and

1373
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,240
um farms are just becoming you know

1374
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,639
they're just branding themselves here in

1375
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:45,358
in canada and british columbia this year

1376
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,960
so they they haven't been able to

1377
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,039
you know

1378
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,838
say you know i'm a farm until you know

1379
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,000
now so there's it's now almost new here

1380
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,239
i'm humbled i know was it was really

1381
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,599
really amazing and

1382
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,558
farmers are really really coming

1383
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,720
together

1384
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,760
and showing up in numbers and just

1385
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:06,000
really seed swapping and sharing seeds

1386
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,480
with each other it's really just an open

1387
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,480
public domain of knowledge sharing and

1388
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,400
it's not just a presentation you know

1389
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,719
we're we're staying in the parking lot

1390
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,240
in between we're eating together we're

1391
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,480
staying around at night and so we're

1392
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,399
really really connecting with the crowd

1393
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,039
and going to areas where they really

1394
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,680
haven't had conferences like maine and

1395
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:30,239
michigan and a lot of people you know

1396
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,879
were saying that you know i came here to

1397
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:36,479
learn about science of soil and cannabis

1398
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,160
and i left with 120 brand new amazing

1399
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,838
friends that i know that i can call

1400
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,279
within a minute so

1401
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,558
it's like

1402
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,720
what these are giving us is inspiration

1403
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,119
like there's so many crazy things going

1404
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,959
on in the world and you turn on your tv

1405
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,680
and if you get sucked into those

1406
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,000
doldrums of whatever that is

1407
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,519
it's like we need to get out of that we

1408
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,920
need to just look at each other in the

1409
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:02,559
faces and talk about things that inspire

1410
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,119
us and it's so amazing to be in a room

1411
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,440
with all of that those people that are

1412
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,079
that inspired by nature that really want

1413
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,920
to make a change in their own lives and

1414
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,680
we really you know recommend that you

1415
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,920
know you asked earlier what can people

1416
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:19,199
do they really want to do something

1417
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,358
what we recommend is start with yourself

1418
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,439
it starts with self-love and it starts

1419
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,239
with wanting to make changes within your

1420
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,720
own body and then that ripples out and

1421
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,479
when you have all of those wonderful

1422
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,719
feelings about yourself and the health

1423
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,599
and well-being within your own body then

1424
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,838
it's really easy to educate it's really

1425
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,400
easy to get the word out because you're

1426
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,159
really walking you know your talk

1427
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,720
and you know there's there's like we

1428
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,719
said there's science presentations and

1429
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,039
then we will have our pure

1430
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,879
certified farmer's panels in the evening

1431
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:54,318
where you can do question and answer and

1432
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:57,039
it gives each farm an opportunity to

1433
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:59,039
say what they do on their farm that you

1434
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,639
know maybe has taken some of the

1435
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,639
practices that are being taught and

1436
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,199
shown people how they've put it into

1437
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:08,239
action so it's really useful

1438
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:10,799
for people that are attending the

1439
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:13,118
conference to hear you know from five

1440
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,839
different farms that are you know

1441
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,358
publicly you know creating medicine and

1442
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,239
and putting themselves out there to say

1443
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,920
hey this is how i've taken these systems

1444
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,679
and put them into action and that's been

1445
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,960
really useful the question and answer

1446
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,399
and um and the genetics talks and you

1447
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,519
know there's a lot with genetics right

1448
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,800
now so

1449
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,559
there's been a lot of a lot of talk

1450
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,519
about that

1451
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,680
a bit of a left of field question but do

1452
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,519
you find that the people who attend

1453
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,239
these conventions or in general just

1454
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:45,199
people are part of say the pure family

1455
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,959
tend to gravitate towards certain types

1456
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,879
of genetics or do you think it's rather

1457
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,119
a diverse spectrum

1458
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,519
diverse yeah i think it's diverse but

1459
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,920
there's more and more topics of full

1460
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,000
spectrum cannabinoid profiles and full

1461
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,519
spectrum terpene profiles and the

1462
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,159
importance of that

1463
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,440
in really bringing forth the medicine so

1464
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,279
that

1465
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,079
you know we can hold a good voice for

1466
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,200
the plant so it seems to me like you

1467
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,519
know more and more people are

1468
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:13,838
gravitating to that but of course the

1469
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,838
old strains are out there and people are

1470
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,279
i mean you know there's a there's a

1471
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,078
there's a good amount of us that are

1472
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,240
keeping land race alive there's a good

1473
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,599
amount of us that are really keeping

1474
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:28,399
hash strains and and

1475
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,200
searching for the best hash strains you

1476
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,440
know this is a big part of it hemp is a

1477
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,318
big part of it and a breeding project

1478
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,920
for hemp is a really big part of it um

1479
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:41,440
you know i wouldn't say that everyone

1480
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,358
loves you know gas or fruit or flora it

1481
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,960
really is it's something for everyone i

1482
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:46,719
think that's that's what's awesome about

1483
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,480
it it's it's never uh it's always

1484
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:50,078
different

1485
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,639
of course so

1486
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,640
part of strain selection for any farmer

1487
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,480
is considering the types of pests you

1488
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,639
have to deal with in your area or within

1489
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,440
your grow environment i remember at the

1490
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:04,000
emerald cup last year i asked a question

1491
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,599
that was essentially around the lines of

1492
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,519
what happens to the predator bug

1493
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,838
excretions like is that a problem in

1494
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,079
itself and our colleague on the panel

1495
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,838
ron gave a fantastic answer but i also

1496
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,079
remember having a look over and seeing

1497
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,199
this huge grin on kelly's face when i

1498
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,440
asked that

1499
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:23,598
i would love to know what's your opinion

1500
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,599
on this what happens to the bug poop

1501
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,480
um you know

1502
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,039
there's an incredible

1503
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,679
web of microbiology and you know if

1504
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:36,000
you're even somebody that wants to order

1505
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:39,440
predators out there in the world you

1506
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,838
already probably are not spraying crap

1507
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,599
on your plants and your and you have if

1508
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,599
you look under a

1509
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,280
microscope you would see a tremendous

1510
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,079
amount of microbiology and there's

1511
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,680
cyanobacteria that's on the leaf

1512
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,079
structure of the plant and when you have

1513
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:57,199
a really healthy plant you've got a huge

1514
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:00,079
diversity of different cyanobacteria

1515
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:02,480
different types of fungi on there so a

1516
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,599
lot of the times if there is predator

1517
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,559
poop it is actually being digested

1518
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,359
by what's already on the plant you know

1519
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,519
the microbiology it feeds the plant you

1520
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,279
know the more you know natural

1521
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,599
expressions that happen on the plant and

1522
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,040
the more that we mimic nature which when

1523
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,599
you're mimicking nature you're going to

1524
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:24,400
have an incredible diversity of both

1525
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:27,359
microbiology and macrobiology

1526
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,798
on your plants and if you allow you know

1527
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:33,119
that nature and that full you know

1528
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:33,838
potential you know

1529
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,960
of

1530
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:38,719
of what is possible within nature then

1531
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,559
the plant is really absorbing that and

1532
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,159
it becomes an incredible nutrient for

1533
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,040
the plant so

1534
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:47,358
that's probably why i was smiling i was

1535
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,599
thinking you know that's probably just

1536
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:51,358
good food for the plant

1537
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,838
and depending on what state you're in

1538
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,159
and and what your your

1539
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,759
requirements are for passing tests i

1540
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,838
mean

1541
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,680
you know you have to be extremely

1542
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:03,519
careful nowadays with what happens with

1543
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,919
your flowers and whatnot and stuff and

1544
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:08,719
and and there's there's pathogen tests

1545
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,240
and and aspergillus is you know things

1546
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:11,919
that have been brought up that have may

1547
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:14,078
maybe have been associated with

1548
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,159
predators and stuff so

1549
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,318
you know you

1550
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:21,279
it's it's it's the system that's been

1551
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,759
created to grow cannabis in is

1552
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,000
almost impossible

1553
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,079
so i think it's amazing that people are

1554
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,239
doing as well as as they're doing and

1555
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,720
honestly like in life

1556
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:36,078
you kind of need to be able to to eat

1557
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:38,078
like microscopic insect poop or smoke it

1558
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,599
even that's what i think but just to

1559
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,000
survive you know of course because

1560
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,838
an immune response within the plant and

1561
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,519
within your own body as well which is

1562
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,759
just incredibly important we're

1563
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,239
suppressing our immune response with all

1564
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,280
of these outside sources of just like

1565
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,519
sterilized sterilized antibiotics kill

1566
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,079
the microbiology and the more that we

1567
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,440
learn we're realizing that microbiology

1568
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,000
is what's clean

1569
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,639
so you know worried about a little bit

1570
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,519
of poop that's from a predator you know

1571
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:09,598
might

1572
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:11,838
it's definitely something to look at if

1573
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,318
you're doing really strict regimen of

1574
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,639
testing but as far as a home grower or

1575
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,039
somebody that you know is

1576
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,679
is just making medicine for other people

1577
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:24,159
and for themselves and sharing it i mean

1578
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:25,118
that's awesome and and also you know you

1579
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:27,118
probably don't want to get your

1580
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,760
predators really late in your flower

1581
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,200
cycle it would be a really good idea to

1582
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,000
allow them to

1583
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,199
you know eat eat all of uh the pathogens

1584
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,039
on their

1585
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:41,199
you know several weeks before harvest

1586
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,039
yeah fantastic and i think you know i i

1587
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,960
don't ask that as though i feel like

1588
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,000
it's a major problem i ask it because

1589
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,280
it's it's the commonly used line which

1590
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,039
people who are

1591
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,200
whether overtly or kind of more

1592
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,519
subconsciously are critical of predator

1593
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,118
bugs and maybe organics in general

1594
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,358
that's what they use to try to kind of

1595
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,599
discredit it and i think it's an

1596
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:03,838
interesting point but maybe not as valid

1597
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,680
as maybe a other one they could come up

1598
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,519
with but i digress

1599
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,798
something we also spoke about last year

1600
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,920
though was how big of an issue aphids

1601
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,559
were

1602
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,240
how do you guys advocate to combat it

1603
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,599
you know it's it's an ever-changing

1604
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:22,798
problem what's your solution to aphids

1605
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,000
or just in general bugs outdoors

1606
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:25,599
polyculture

1607
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
absolutely

1608
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,079
there's a wonderful example

1609
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,440
you can go into williams into southern

1610
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,280
oregon

1611
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,720
and we have a whole lot of pure farms

1612
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,960
there and a lot of friends that have

1613
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,439
farms in that area it's definitely like

1614
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,679
a cannabis mecca in the world so when

1615
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,679
you go into williams area you've seen

1616
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,598
you know cannabis farms pretty much

1617
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,199
almost every single property there's the

1618
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,640
rare property that's not growing

1619
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:49,598
cannabis

1620
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:52,400
and

1621
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:55,039
they got hit really hard with aphids

1622
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,838
this year aphids is absolutely the new

1623
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,880
pathogen that everybody needs to prepare

1624
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,519
for

1625
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,838
and we know of one farm and that's casey

1626
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,838
over rising phoenix

1627
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:08,400
phoenix rising farms

1628
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:10,880
and he did an over abundance of

1629
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,920
pollinator like garden like you wouldn't

1630
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,680
believe flowers just everywhere he's a

1631
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,000
gorgeous farm and he did flowers

1632
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:21,919
everywhere and he didn't have one

1633
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,400
single aphid at all because wasps eat

1634
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,200
like triple their weight in aphids in a

1635
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,880
day so and same with you know all these

1636
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:31,439
different types of bugs out there as

1637
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,280
well as bees and i mean and as well as

1638
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,318
birds um

1639
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,960
so

1640
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:39,119
that's just a perfect example and maybe

1641
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,599
you have a

1642
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:45,358
nursery and a greenhouse and you can do

1643
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,119
a heat treatment at 120 degrees for

1644
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,598
50 degrees centigrade

1645
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,599
you know two hours or whatnot and and

1646
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,440
maybe three and you just monitor it make

1647
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,079
sure the plants are doing good but you

1648
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,920
can heat treat a nursery pretty easily

1649
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,720
and that's a really clean easy way to

1650
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,079
deal with it also you know a good spray

1651
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,078
with water

1652
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,318
um early on

1653
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,000
can can can get them but you know that's

1654
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,960
another thing and and some people have

1655
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,760
had success after heat treatments um

1656
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,358
uh

1657
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,559
with with like a

1658
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,159
a good uh

1659
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,480
swing oh yeah

1660
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,039
we've had the the best experience when

1661
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,039
when when it first came out i noticed it

1662
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,960
right away i've said whoa this is not a

1663
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:26,480
normal aphid i don't care what anybody

1664
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,639
says this is we're not dealing with a

1665
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,119
normal aphid so

1666
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:33,118
i put it into jars i fed it all these

1667
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,519
different things i was watching how many

1668
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,680
it was reproducing or cloning itself i

1669
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,838
was feeding it all different types of

1670
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,598
foods you know even brassicas and it was

1671
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:44,078
running from the brassicas like what

1672
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,000
aphid runs from a brassica like david

1673
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,680
survive off of brassicas you know it's

1674
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,838
their number one food source and this

1675
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:51,919
one was so different and

1676
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:54,318
it has like these little hooks on its

1677
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,838
chest that other aphids don't have so i

1678
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:57,838
knew that we were like up against

1679
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:59,599
something really interesting

1680
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,400
and the way that it was

1681
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,400
you know propagating um itself was like

1682
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,358
quadruple the rate

1683
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,039
at that time and so we're really

1684
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,038
watching this and i think josh and i you

1685
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,920
know we put this out on instagram right

1686
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,640
away

1687
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,720
and

1688
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,239
many several years ago

1689
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,000
and people were like what is that those

1690
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,479
look like normal aphids you know and

1691
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,920
what we noticed is i sprayed

1692
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,838
probably 25 different oils on it and all

1693
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,680
different homemade things and things

1694
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:31,358
that i could and finally we just came to

1695
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,798
what would happen

1696
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:38,239
if we mess with the bacterium which is

1697
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:40,400
inside of the aphid which has to be

1698
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,558
some kind of have have some kind of a

1699
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,639
heat issue going on

1700
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,920
and that bacterium is what helps it

1701
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:49,759
propagate and what clones itself so if

1702
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,838
you mess with that bacteria which is

1703
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,480
inside of the aphid bringing the

1704
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:57,279
temperature up high then it sterilizes

1705
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:00,079
it and we realized that really soon on

1706
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,079
so we started doing tests and how many

1707
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,559
hours and how high did the temperatures

1708
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,440
need to get and were they harming any of

1709
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,920
our pollinators or or was it harming

1710
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,519
some of the other important you know

1711
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,720
insects that we had within the

1712
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,480
greenhouse

1713
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:18,399
and we really came to that 120 degrees

1714
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,159
for two to three hours

1715
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,039
and your

1716
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:24,960
pollinators just thrive in that heat the

1717
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,640
plants thrive in that heat as long as

1718
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,798
they're damp and they're not in small

1719
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,519
pots you cannot be heating up the roots

1720
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:33,280
to that but the plants really thrive in

1721
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:36,159
that and the aphids are completely

1722
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,599
sterilized and then within a very short

1723
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,920
period of time

1724
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,680
all of your insects that like to eat the

1725
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,519
aphids will come in within a couple of

1726
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:44,639
days and just pick them off because

1727
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,599
they're not

1728
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,078
propagating and recolonizing themselves

1729
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,240
so heat treatment i think above and

1730
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,839
beyond anything else it's absolutely the

1731
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:56,000
way to go

1732
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,838
um and also pollinators if they're

1733
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,079
outside because they are in our natural

1734
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,000
environment i don't know where they came

1735
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,720
from they came like an incredible

1736
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
vengeance um i would you know venture to

1737
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,558
say that

1738
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,880
somebody made them up as an evil plan

1739
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,440
but you know i can't you know put my

1740
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,920
finger on that by any means but it just

1741
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,440
the way that it came into our community

1742
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,920
and they weren't just being passed by

1743
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,240
clones because we don't use clones we we

1744
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,000
only started with seeds and all of a

1745
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:25,279
sudden they were here

1746
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,119
so

1747
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,000
i think i think that pollinators if

1748
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,318
you're outdoors and heat treatment for

1749
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,719
greenhouses and indoors

1750
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,880
some really solid suggestions there i

1751
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,598
remember that another major point that i

1752
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,318
took away from that discussion was that

1753
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,318
the use of essential oils was

1754
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:46,639
potentially a lot more problematic than

1755
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,079
people are aware would you be able to go

1756
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:49,440
into a little more depth for our

1757
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,000
audience who maybe haven't been able to

1758
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,200
hear that discussion

1759
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,358
um

1760
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:57,759
well i mean for me i don't i don't

1761
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:00,078
really like to be covered in oil

1762
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,720
you know i don't know about you but sort

1763
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,720
of that thick oily feeling all over your

1764
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,279
body is really no different than what

1765
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:09,679
the plant feels and when you're spraying

1766
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,839
heavy oils or any kind of volatile

1767
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:13,598
essential oils or even like a coconut

1768
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,000
oil then that's going to immediately

1769
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,838
change the microbiome on your leaf

1770
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,400
surface and when you change the

1771
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:23,358
microbiome of your leaf surface then

1772
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,200
you're allowing in other problems and i

1773
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,519
always look at

1774
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,519
what you do to your garden should be you

1775
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:32,400
don't look at the first ripple you know

1776
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,079
like if you drop a stone into water and

1777
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,760
i know i've said this before but if you

1778
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,359
drop a stone into water it's not the

1779
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,319
first ripple you need to look at the

1780
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,719
very last ripple so if you spray your

1781
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,558
plants with essential oils for pests are

1782
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:48,159
you going to be bringing in more

1783
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:51,680
pathogenic leaf mildew you know or what

1784
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:53,440
other factors or stressors or the plan

1785
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,838
yeah light sensitivity or what other

1786
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,000
stressors are the plant gonna have so

1787
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:00,719
it's really not a solution

1788
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,960
and it's definitely and it's and it's

1789
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,439
more of an allopathic look at it rather

1790
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,280
than a real holistic look which we

1791
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,679
really encourage people to look at their

1792
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,359
gardens more holistically so then we can

1793
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,519
have a better understanding of looking

1794
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:14,558
at our own health more holistically

1795
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:17,280
because

1796
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,440
cannabis has an incredible lesson to

1797
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,000
teach us all which is

1798
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,480
you know what she thrives best in is is

1799
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,639
what we also thrive best in

1800
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,440
yeah of course of course

1801
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,598
so

1802
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,679
what do you think of the emerald cup in

1803
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,000
general we've had a little discussion

1804
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,239
about our talks thus far but the overall

1805
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,400
consensus i've had from a variety of

1806
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,959
guests on the show is that the kind of

1807
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,039
overall vibe and more specifically the

1808
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,280
energy that's normally in the air just

1809
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,240
wasn't quite there last year

1810
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,839
how do you feel about that one

1811
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:51,919
well first of all we really really love

1812
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,279
the emerald cup and

1813
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,880
um

1814
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,720
you know we didn't know that was going

1815
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,760
on because we were in our teepee

1816
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:02,318
it's awesome in our teepees

1817
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,480
i mean in all fairness i guess it's the

1818
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:08,000
laws that have changed you know so the

1819
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,079
laws in california have dictated the way

1820
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,199
the event can run so i mean it's not

1821
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,798
like

1822
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:14,879
you know tim and taylor came out and

1823
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,239
said oh you know we're gonna

1824
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,760
or hazel whatever we're gonna we're

1825
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:19,199
gonna run this you know like this you

1826
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,079
know you know they're they're trying to

1827
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,480
do the

1828
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,000
most heartfelt amazing you know show

1829
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,679
that they can do

1830
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,639
you know with the laws that they've been

1831
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,440
given

1832
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,759
and and if you want to get get upset at

1833
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,318
something get you know get upset at the

1834
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,799
state of california and and the way that

1835
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,719
they've created you know distribution

1836
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:41,119
you know for farmers and

1837
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:43,358
so because now you know you're not going

1838
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,720
to get as many farmers as you did before

1839
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:46,318
because they're probably through some

1840
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:47,919
kind of distribution

1841
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,000
company and maybe the distribution

1842
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,960
company is awesome or maybe they're not

1843
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,880
but

1844
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,798
um yeah you know that the tents were

1845
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,798
different than they were before and and

1846
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,639
you could you know to get directly to a

1847
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:01,519
farmer was different but

1848
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:03,038
there was as many panels as there always

1849
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,960
was and

1850
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,119
you know for us the emerald cup is a

1851
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,599
really great experience because we have

1852
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,280
two teepees and we have our cocoa going

1853
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,039
and we have all of the farmers that

1854
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,920
we're working with

1855
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,000
um around the whole time and we're we're

1856
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,039
giving you know where we have seed

1857
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,640
exchange happening and um you know we're

1858
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:25,359
able to

1859
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,880
you know consume and just really enjoy

1860
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,679
each other and really talk a lot of

1861
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,640
stories so i mean we have like you know

1862
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,279
epic

1863
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,880
times at the emerald cup and and i would

1864
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,799
say you know

1865
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,119
times have changed and that that's

1866
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,920
what's hard but at the emerald cup it's

1867
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:45,198
still a gathering of you know some of

1868
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,880
the most amazing farmers in california

1869
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:49,358
and there's really not another event

1870
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,319
that's you know better than it at all

1871
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,159
and

1872
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,480
so you know we're really stoked about

1873
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,519
what they've done and we're proud to be

1874
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,079
part of it

1875
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,480
and i can feel you know where those

1876
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,719
people are coming from too and i think

1877
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,879
you know josh really hit the nail on the

1878
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,480
head is that

1879
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,359
what people are feeling

1880
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:11,439
is the new regulations what people are

1881
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,759
feeling is you know

1882
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,798
not that same direct voice from the

1883
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,279
farmer

1884
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:19,039
not the same type of diversity they're

1885
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,640
feeling that you know

1886
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,319
three years ago

1887
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,480
a tremendous amount of farms that were

1888
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,159
there no longer in business because they

1889
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,718
couldn't stay in business because the

1890
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:31,198
exorbitant licensing fees or

1891
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:33,119
timing or you know people who have

1892
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:36,798
applied for licenses and it's just

1893
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:37,759
sitting in an office you know for years

1894
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,319
i mean

1895
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,960
it goes it goes on and on and on the

1896
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:45,839
incredible regulations that farmers and

1897
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,920
breeders and extractors and product

1898
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:52,158
makers are under is is is so significant

1899
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,480
that it absolutely doesn't surprise me

1900
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,238
that people felt that energy at the

1901
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:59,119
emerald cup

1902
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,119
yeah so i think the general consensus we

1903
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:04,319
have within the community in the moment

1904
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:06,719
is that there is a lot of elements of

1905
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:09,439
disunity and i guess distrust more

1906
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,359
specifically for the way legal changes

1907
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,519
and the way bigger companies are acting

1908
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:15,119
on them how do you see us going forward

1909
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,120
and what's the best way to kind of get

1910
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,960
everyone on the same page in terms of

1911
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,119
morals and ethics

1912
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,480
drop the competition

1913
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:24,640
we are not

1914
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:27,599
in competition with each other these

1915
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,000
outside big entities are coming in and

1916
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:32,320
they're instilling a fear within people

1917
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,399
that they need to be competitive

1918
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:36,559
we are not competitive we are not in

1919
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,559
competition we are the opposition we are

1920
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,360
not in opposition we are just an

1921
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:44,080
alternative we need to join together and

1922
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:45,839
be really happy for other farmers

1923
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,679
successes that are doing wonderful we

1924
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,920
need to be happy for

1925
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,840
you know passing out your your genetics

1926
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,719
and somebody else did a better job than

1927
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,400
what you did like that's freaking rad

1928
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,679
we need to be happy for each other

1929
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,679
because this sort of like fear-based

1930
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:04,000
competitive thing

1931
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:05,760
is coming into play and i really think

1932
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,880
that if we can drop that

1933
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:11,600
that's just the answer and realize that

1934
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,920
you know that we are really a commodity

1935
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,880
and that you know the large corporations

1936
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,920
are

1937
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,400
wanting to capitalize on

1938
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,760
our intentions and on our ethics and

1939
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:24,319
then

1940
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,960
if farmers are not mindful they could

1941
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,799
potentially join forces with you know

1942
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,198
corporations and then in the end the

1943
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,119
corporation just acts like a corporation

1944
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,678
doesn't they just sell

1945
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,359
potentially sell you off or sell off

1946
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,840
your whole

1947
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,679
your your face or what you've created

1948
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,119
your marketing what all that and then so

1949
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,719
you know this is a time when we're just

1950
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:45,760
trying to say hey you know what let's

1951
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,800
just

1952
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:51,039
not be exclusive with any one person

1953
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,279
let's just keep your autonomy let's

1954
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,679
create independence and autonomy and

1955
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,279
autonomy let's create products maybe

1956
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,920
they're together maybe they're within

1957
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,599
each farm and create a network so right

1958
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,399
now it's just

1959
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,320
don't get eaten by a corporation that's

1960
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,000
that's that basically the money you wake

1961
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,840
up in the morning and okay okay how am i

1962
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
not going to get even by a corporation

1963
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,560
and don't think that you know you've got

1964
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,158
one contract that's in front of you that

1965
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,159
that's going to be the last one that

1966
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,319
you're ever going to see and we really

1967
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,399
want to see more pro tracks rather than

1968
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,079
contracts

1969
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:27,439
no contracts

1970
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:29,920
contrary to your well well-being you

1971
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,599
know and and independence and realizing

1972
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,760
that you can work together with other

1973
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,920
farms and say hey you know what's hot

1974
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,840
what do you guys got going on and the

1975
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,840
more that you share and we talk to each

1976
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,560
other then we're creating

1977
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,760
a much larger commodity like josh said i

1978
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,080
mean we

1979
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,400
are the commodity for the first time you

1980
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,559
know this year we started realizing how

1981
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:52,399
many thousands and thousands of pounds

1982
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,640
that the pure collective already

1983
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,559
produces per year whereas these huge

1984
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:59,679
corporations are just talking about you

1985
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:03,280
know what they're going to do in 2021

1986
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:05,600
we are already doing it the only way

1987
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:08,479
that these corporations are going to get

1988
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,440
the keys to our castle is if we give

1989
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:14,000
them to them so keep the keys to your

1990
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:16,559
castle share them with your friends who

1991
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,800
are going to be respectful

1992
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,039
and ethical in the same way that you are

1993
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,520
a co-op

1994
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:26,238
for sure so you guys put out your

1995
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,679
perspective on the whole phylus debacle

1996
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:29,919
a few weeks back

1997
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,079
and to me it was you know beautiful kind

1998
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,319
of statement of authenticity and kind of

1999
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:37,359
reintegrating what we need to do to move

2000
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:40,319
forward but there wasn't a lot of

2001
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,079
views expressed on specifically how you

2002
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:43,599
see the file or situation and what

2003
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,920
they're doing do you feel like we're at

2004
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,320
a point now where it's almost very

2005
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:51,199
problematic to incorporate any sort of

2006
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:53,519
genomic testing within our kind of

2007
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,519
garden or our cultivars

2008
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,120
well i mean you know

2009
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,320
for sure we

2010
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,840
were

2011
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:01,599
totally against what happened with

2012
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,760
phylos and what happened there you know

2013
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,760
that just seemed like

2014
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,320
something that you know it really

2015
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:11,280
brought up the conversation as as

2016
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:13,198
farmers where do where do we stand you

2017
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:16,238
know what how do we work together and

2018
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:18,000
and we look to like our food systems and

2019
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:20,319
we look and we're looking to what's

2020
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,399
happened with like food i mean you know

2021
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,960
this this has happened before so we're

2022
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,960
you know we're looking into open public

2023
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,198
domain and

2024
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:34,239
and breathing and you know i do

2025
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:37,439
genomic sequencing comes from you know

2026
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:39,919
large corporate machines and so you know

2027
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,678
you'd have to be really skeptical to use

2028
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,359
that information to think that someone

2029
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,119
else isn't going to use it and maybe

2030
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,158
they have better technology to use it

2031
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,920
than you do i mean personally i just

2032
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,519
want to give a big shout out and a thank

2033
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,239
you to philos

2034
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,560
what an incredible opportunity

2035
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:59,678
that we were all given to look at the

2036
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:02,000
dark side and to realize we better get

2037
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:04,880
our [ __ ] together and we need to start

2038
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,880
creating this powerful entity you know

2039
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,440
within ourselves and how is it that we

2040
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,159
can pull together and since that time

2041
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:15,039
has happened i mean the education that

2042
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:16,799
josh and i have have searched out you

2043
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,560
know we've gone to mentors we've been

2044
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,960
talking to people that are way smarter

2045
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,520
than we are and who have had way more

2046
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,359
experience than we have on this and how

2047
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,719
do they feel about you know public

2048
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:31,519
domain and open source and and markering

2049
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,920
and patenting and what i keep coming to

2050
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,199
as far as the cannabis plant she's an

2051
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,039
adaptogen

2052
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,519
cool patent away

2053
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:41,760
because great you're going to patent a

2054
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,360
seed and then i'm going to take that

2055
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,480
seed and i'm going to put it into my

2056
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,559
deep red

2057
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,079
rich beautiful garden beds and it's not

2058
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,360
going to look like your seed that you

2059
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:50,158
just patented

2060
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:51,839
so

2061
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,238
you know we need to give credit to the

2062
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,279
cannabis plant as well she

2063
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:59,119
is not just soybean she isn't tobacco

2064
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:01,519
she isn't corn

2065
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:04,079
she's not going to be that easily

2066
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,120
controlled you know in that way and i

2067
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,479
think that

2068
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:09,840
we need to focus more on being the best

2069
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:11,439
what is the best genetic that we're

2070
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,760
going to put out this year so you can go

2071
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,879
ahead and you can you can patent your

2072
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:20,560
your 2017 strain but let's talk about

2073
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,960
what we do in 2020 we need to be pushing

2074
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,440
ourselves to be better and to create

2075
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,760
better strains um not be looking at the

2076
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:30,158
past of what was because she's

2077
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,840
constantly changing and you know when

2078
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:35,359
you say open source and

2079
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,840
and um

2080
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,679
you know genetics like that's exactly

2081
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,600
what it is so if you put every all of

2082
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:44,399
your information out in the public you

2083
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,159
know that anyone can use it so you you'd

2084
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:49,119
have to be you know

2085
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:52,319
really skeptical about or or decide

2086
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:54,719
whether you care or not i mean because

2087
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:55,679
maybe at one point you're just like well

2088
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,920
you know

2089
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,679
i'm in evolution right now like kelly

2090
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,440
said you know what i'm in the middle of

2091
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:03,679
right now is making something new and

2092
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:06,399
making something new i mean none of us

2093
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,239
really necessarily keep the exact same

2094
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:11,039
strain forever

2095
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:13,279
and if and if ganja could have been

2096
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,039
could have been patented and controlled

2097
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:17,359
i think they would have done it back in

2098
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:19,600
the 30s when they got rid of it so that

2099
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:20,719
they could chemically fertilize cotton

2100
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,560
and other

2101
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,880
wheat and stuff like bring in hygiene i

2102
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,960
think i think that the cannabis plant

2103
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,719
would have been genetically modified

2104
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,800
then and controlled then but i don't

2105
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,920
think it actually can so i think maybe

2106
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,199
on one level we may not actually have to

2107
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,520
worry

2108
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:38,479
you know about about that but we are

2109
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,880
also

2110
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:42,079
not joining that and don't condone that

2111
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,480
at all either

2112
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,158
yeah and i and i don't feel really bad

2113
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,079
that people are spending millions and

2114
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,719
millions of dollars to try to figure out

2115
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:53,920
how to patent and marker this plant like

2116
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,679
go ahead do it i i'm really having all

2117
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,920
of my bets that the cannabis plant will

2118
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,719
have the last laugh and we'll just take

2119
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,719
all of their money so you know that's

2120
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,600
that's sort of what we go on but also

2121
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:08,239
the silos thing has given us now

2122
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,640
you know like i was saying we we went to

2123
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:12,639
corvallis we sat down with alan capuler

2124
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,920
for many hours and any of you who don't

2125
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:18,320
know who alan capuler is aka mushroom

2126
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,279
please go online learn about him he's an

2127
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:24,238
incredibly intelligent geneticist he

2128
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:26,399
understands what markering and and

2129
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:28,718
genetically modifying is because he did

2130
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:31,679
that in his earlier years of life and

2131
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:33,920
and what we came to is

2132
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,679
you know since all of that has happened

2133
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,279
we are now which we were already

2134
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:40,079
planning on doing but it's with much

2135
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:42,880
more intention is we're doing a pure

2136
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:46,319
certified breeding project right now

2137
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:49,199
so that we can get seeds from a

2138
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:51,840
particular farmer and we can pass it out

2139
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:54,319
to 50 different farms we can take a

2140
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:58,079
little bit of data between ourselves

2141
01:18:54,319 --> 01:19:01,279
that is public domain that seed that

2142
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:03,359
varietal becomes actualized and that's

2143
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:05,599
really important because there's 40

2144
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:07,599
other farms that have done it so we

2145
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,760
really say bring it into the public

2146
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,560
domain if you want to

2147
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,079
you know have a seed or or a varietal

2148
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,679
that is yours that you would like to

2149
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:16,800
keep as yours you're going to have to

2150
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,440
give it out

2151
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:22,079
to a whole lot of people so that that

2152
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:24,000
becomes actualized so that nobody else

2153
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:26,079
can take that from you and we feel like

2154
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,920
that's much more powerful than paying a

2155
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:30,399
whole bunch of money to patent something

2156
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,560
that can be changed anyway

2157
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,039
so how do you feel about

2158
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,960
genomic testing in general do you feel

2159
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:39,439
like it's almost inevitable that

2160
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,800
ultimately the data set will be sold off

2161
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,678
or do you feel like there is a way to

2162
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,840
get this information while feeling safe

2163
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:48,000
about the results and not falling into

2164
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,079
the hands of say big ag

2165
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,520
well garrett guaranteed it's going to be

2166
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:53,279
sold off

2167
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,880
so to think that you're joining

2168
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,599
something and it's not going to be sold

2169
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,840
off is just this is not true i mean it's

2170
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,600
it's already been sold off everywhere

2171
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,079
it's but with food and everything so i

2172
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,159
think that human beings sell out yeah

2173
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:07,119
corporations are meant to sell out it's

2174
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:09,599
like being

2175
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:12,158
angry with a cougar that kills a bunny

2176
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,400
rabbit you know like it's the nature of

2177
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:16,879
big corporations big corporations are

2178
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,879
gonna come in and they're gonna crush

2179
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,520
and the only way that we can prevent

2180
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:24,079
that is by joining forces with each

2181
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:27,040
other like i was saying before so maybe

2182
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:29,359
you use it and you and you you know take

2183
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:32,560
what you want out of it and maybe you've

2184
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:35,039
you've created a

2185
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,159
pro tract that works for you with your

2186
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,238
with your

2187
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:39,759
uh with genomic sequencing company there

2188
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:42,319
are companies out there that might

2189
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,639
anonymize your information and you know

2190
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:46,799
you you might find a company that you

2191
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,119
you can trust you know for us you know

2192
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:52,320
and there's universities you know that

2193
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:53,279
you might trust too um to to work with

2194
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,319
but

2195
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:58,399
you know to think that big ag is not you

2196
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,559
know out there that's what it's what big

2197
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:03,039
ag does you know it's what they do with

2198
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,800
genetics and stuff i think our our value

2199
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:07,119
i think we should just not worry about

2200
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,039
it and just make our value

2201
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,840
the way that we grow

2202
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:14,238
and the the diversity of genetics rather

2203
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,840
than worrying about one strain and i

2204
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:18,158
think that it's really interesting it

2205
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:21,279
brings that sort of this this term

2206
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:24,238
ownership into the world like

2207
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:26,559
the ownership of a certain strain that

2208
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,879
you've been working with 10 years but

2209
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,440
the human beings were working with it 10

2210
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,639
000 years before that so

2211
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:35,519
it's like

2212
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:37,760
what's ownership what what is it that we

2213
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,000
own and it's like we feel like oh geez

2214
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,880
well we have to own it before they own

2215
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,560
it and i think that you know is is sort

2216
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,560
of this this fear and that's where sort

2217
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:49,440
of that that the competition thing that

2218
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,120
i was talking about like why is it that

2219
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:53,839
humans feel like we need to own

2220
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:56,399
something especially a seed like i can't

2221
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:59,039
even believe that that's legal but

2222
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:01,119
of course i can because legal is based

2223
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,119
in corporations and corporations are

2224
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,599
here to crush so

2225
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:07,279
i i love what the dalai lama says learn

2226
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,639
the rules so you know how to break them

2227
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:11,679
and we can look

2228
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:14,880
at the incredible failures that genomic

2229
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:18,399
sequencing and gmos and and even

2230
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:21,359
hybridization has given us like oh yay

2231
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:23,519
so now we have 17 different varieties of

2232
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,439
2 000 different potatoes that we could

2233
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,000
be eating on the planet but there's only

2234
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,799
17 like i'm just making up those numbers

2235
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,800
but

2236
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,719
it's like

2237
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,960
is there something about humans that

2238
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,480
likes to set up a system that we can't

2239
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,560
even work within

2240
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:41,039
and i think that if we just sort of take

2241
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,800
a step back and realize what wasn't

2242
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,560
working within genomic sequencing is

2243
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,320
we'll realize like why do we want to do

2244
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,199
that what

2245
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:49,039
it

2246
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:51,279
it just doesn't make any sense because

2247
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:54,479
then it starts to have ownership and

2248
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:56,319
like i said before i i love my varietals

2249
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:59,119
and josh and i work really hard on our

2250
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:02,158
strengths but we got those from somebody

2251
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:04,238
else 20 years ago and it's kind of like

2252
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,479
you know they give it away you know

2253
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:08,319
adage or maybe it's a grateful dead vibe

2254
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,519
you know you could the tapes were not

2255
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:10,799
you could never sell them you had to

2256
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,960
give them away and it only made

2257
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,840
everything better i mean when we gave

2258
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,000
our

2259
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,920
we give our seeds away to say nick and

2260
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,359
liz at greensource gardens and they come

2261
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,719
out with something that they like like

2262
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,519
they loved the zelly's gift and they're

2263
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,359
like

2264
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,000
oh my god i'm gonna you know put that

2265
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:28,880
into some of my genetics i mean to me

2266
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,039
i'm like oh that's that's awesome uh you

2267
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,800
saw something in our genetics that we're

2268
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:34,319
working with the oh yeah go for it you

2269
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,320
know make whatever you want out of it

2270
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:38,799
you know have it have an awesome time i

2271
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:42,079
can't wait to see the plans um you know

2272
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,639
so we why would we have seed exchanges

2273
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:46,800
and seed swaps all the time everywhere

2274
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:49,279
we go every single event that we do if

2275
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,440
we were worried about patenting or

2276
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:54,319
owning anything i think we just

2277
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:56,799
it's so diverse just fall in love with

2278
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:58,399
the diversity and just not worry about

2279
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,600
it that's that's kind of what we feel

2280
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,000
right now we've always given our

2281
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,880
genetics away we're not going to patent

2282
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,039
them

2283
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,359
and it is and and i get it too it is

2284
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,279
really weird that this you know guy is

2285
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:11,359
coming in with a three-piece suit on

2286
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:13,679
he's never even smoked cannabis but he

2287
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:16,319
wants to rule the cannabis world i get

2288
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,880
it it it is very strange you know we had

2289
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:21,759
this tight-knit beautiful cannabis

2290
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:24,000
community for you know is my entire

2291
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,800
adult life so this is like a whole new

2292
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,800
trend

2293
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,480
transition that i'm i'm sitting at the

2294
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,320
table with these people that are talking

2295
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:33,039
about cannabis and i'm like i know

2296
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:35,439
you've never even smoked it before so

2297
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:37,519
it's it's a really interesting dichotomy

2298
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:39,519
and i think that it comes back to what i

2299
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,280
was saying before you know if if we

2300
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,520
don't want the castle to be given away

2301
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,519
then don't give away the keys you know

2302
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,440
keep your genetics tight within the

2303
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,440
people that you love and see what they

2304
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:51,759
can do with it and be happy that they're

2305
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:53,919
creating something awesome and be really

2306
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,520
grateful that your own genetics came

2307
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,679
from somebody else that worked on them

2308
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,920
for a really long time be grateful to

2309
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,719
them rather than feeling like you've got

2310
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,800
some sort of an ownership over it so

2311
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,639
josh worried about some of the license

2312
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,119
producers stealing our genetics and

2313
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,719
doing better than we can with it

2314
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:11,599
it's not going to happen

2315
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,359
like

2316
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,600
go for it but you're just gonna steal

2317
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:18,399
the genetic and put it into like a

2318
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,880
stupid system and it's not gonna she's

2319
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:23,039
not gonna perform

2320
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:27,359
so it's just kind of like ah

2321
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:29,840
you know and uh you know anyway so we we

2322
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:31,519
loved the idea of open source we love

2323
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,440
the idea of being able to see the

2324
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,520
genetics and being able to see the

2325
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,839
connections that was the coolest thing

2326
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,520
about the idea of the galaxy or

2327
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,440
something like that during the time was

2328
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,920
to be able to say hey this is

2329
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:45,919
connected to all this lineage and i mean

2330
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,440
that that would be really interesting

2331
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,679
for us in genetics but i think we're

2332
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:52,079
moving into a time that we're almost

2333
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:53,760
moving away from strains on some levels

2334
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,559
and we're just looking at plants more

2335
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,600
like

2336
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,520
chemovars and and and what their

2337
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,520
chemical compounds or their terpene

2338
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,199
terpenes are and stuff and so i don't

2339
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,440
know there's a lot of ways

2340
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:07,119
to to work with the cannabis once it's

2341
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:10,158
grown now

2342
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:11,840
okay good answer good answer so

2343
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:13,920
something i wanted to ask which is kind

2344
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,840
of related but not really about genomic

2345
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,920
mapping type of thing

2346
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,360
i've seen a few people post more and

2347
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:23,679
more frequently about how sap analysis

2348
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:26,319
from leafs can be used as like a

2349
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:29,199
nutrient profiling technique how do you

2350
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:31,840
feel about that as kind of the basis for

2351
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:33,279
the evaluation of a nutrient program or

2352
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,480
kind of some new things you're

2353
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:38,158
implementing within your own cultivars

2354
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:39,759
well anytime that you can learn more

2355
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:41,679
about the plant that's all really

2356
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,079
exciting and

2357
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,920
adding a sense yeah and sap analysis has

2358
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,519
been happening with with all different

2359
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,880
types of plants you know within

2360
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,400
agriculture

2361
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,400
for a long time and now people are just

2362
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:55,039
starting to talk about it with cannabis

2363
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:57,759
and it's just another way to look at you

2364
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:59,039
know how well your plant is uptaking

2365
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,880
different minerals and different

2366
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,679
nutrients and that's really gonna still

2367
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,440
come down to the microbiology and and

2368
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:07,119
what's present and everything in your

2369
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:10,559
soil as well as

2370
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:12,960
leaves but there's also an incredible

2371
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,039
you know intuitive value of being able

2372
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,119
to look at a plant and be able to get a

2373
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:19,279
feeling for it and say yeah

2374
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:21,279
you're healthy and you just know that

2375
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:22,238
it's healthy and i think that

2376
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:24,238
you know

2377
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:27,000
what i would suggest to people that are

2378
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:29,439
listening to this is create a better

2379
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,359
relationship with with your plants in

2380
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:33,759
your house with your cannabis plants

2381
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,679
with your garden plants with the plants

2382
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,000
that are around your property because

2383
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,679
that's going to give you a better

2384
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,520
you know communication and a better

2385
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,639
relationship with plants and i and i

2386
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,960
think that

2387
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:47,840
we have this deep

2388
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,760
connection with plants as human beings

2389
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,199
on the earth because we eat them we

2390
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,600
cultivate them we can't really live

2391
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:56,799
without them they create our oxygen

2392
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,920
the symbiosis is so deep

2393
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,000
that

2394
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,000
i feel like that's a really beautiful

2395
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
thing to be able to see the health and

2396
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,560
well-being of your plants is just being

2397
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,479
in tune with that dna connection that we

2398
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,120
have with plants on the earth and i

2399
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:13,198
think a sap analysis you know is going

2400
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,399
to tell you you know whether you have

2401
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:16,638
enough you know

2402
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:19,519
trace minerals or whether it's you know

2403
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:21,039
a strong reading or a high number or not

2404
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,280
but it's not going to tell you oh you

2405
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:25,279
need more magnesium you know it's not

2406
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:27,119
going to be like oh you're you're

2407
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:28,559
you're high on boron or something like

2408
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,920
that so i mean there's this going to

2409
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:35,679
take a level of intuition i think that

2410
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:38,239
that it's extremely crucial maybe to use

2411
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,679
the sap analysis as you know part of

2412
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:42,000
your analysis

2413
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,719
you know and then and then you also have

2414
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,719
a soil analysis that you have and a

2415
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,840
bridge

2416
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,880
and and

2417
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,119
and

2418
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,359
with soil tests and soil analysis you

2419
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,599
are able to test you know your organic

2420
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:57,759
matter counts and your microbiology and

2421
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,520
that's and i think at the end of the day

2422
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,800
you're just gonna you're gonna recognize

2423
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,880
oh well this soil is really

2424
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,440
rich enough you know when you have a

2425
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,880
really live living rich soil like on our

2426
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:11,279
own land right now

2427
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,119
our greenhouses and all of our land is

2428
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:15,920
like i'm feeling

2429
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:17,599
super good right now about the plants

2430
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,880
getting into the soil right now and just

2431
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,679
taking off

2432
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,359
so

2433
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:25,440
and even even when you test a soil and

2434
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,359
you could test the soil and then you

2435
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:29,198
could say oh well it's got these certain

2436
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:30,960
amount of minerals but you still don't

2437
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:33,279
know what the plant is uptaking or what

2438
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:36,399
the plant is not uptaking so

2439
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:38,800
you know diversity in your soil is so

2440
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,399
important for the ultimate health of the

2441
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,800
plant because then it gives the plant

2442
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,158
the ability to uptake what it needs as

2443
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,199
it needs

2444
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:48,000
and

2445
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,839
i mean soil analysis after every flower

2446
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,319
cycle is really helpful if you're doing

2447
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,159
indoors you know and outdoors maybe once

2448
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,840
at the end of the year or something

2449
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:58,399
unless you're light dapping and then you

2450
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:01,840
know you could test it but i think what

2451
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:05,198
we've just come to is just add more

2452
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,880
raw materials create more biology and

2453
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:10,158
just make it just

2454
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,159
a crazy worm farm

2455
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:15,599
a crazy worm farm i like that analogy

2456
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,600
that's pretty much what it is

2457
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,079
that's good that's good so

2458
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,320
we see the claim that there's a lot of

2459
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:24,800
the hydroponically or synthetically

2460
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:26,158
produced what people would refer to as

2461
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,880
cali bud

2462
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:31,519
uh most notably strains like cookies and

2463
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,520
gelatos it'll often be kind of commented

2464
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,960
that oh those are full of pgrs just look

2465
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,840
at the way they look you know you can

2466
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,679
tell and likewise we don't see people

2467
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,000
like the cookie fam or people who

2468
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,319
produce these cultivars really talking

2469
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,238
much about the nutrients they use

2470
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:48,559
do you feel like if someone doesn't want

2471
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:51,119
to disclose something as seemingly

2472
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,679
simple as their nutrient regime

2473
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:55,599
it's not too far-fetched to assume that

2474
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,399
maybe something more than what meets the

2475
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,920
eye is going on behind the scenes

2476
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:01,920
yeah i mean that you know my guess is

2477
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,158
that they're surviving every single

2478
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,079
round that they're getting through

2479
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:08,559
and you know they're just stoked they

2480
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:09,920
have wheat at the end of the run you

2481
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,920
know and plus

2482
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,840
you know it's with cookies and and

2483
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,920
different varieties like that

2484
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,159
you know it's they're hard to grow so

2485
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:20,158
you know it's it can be it's a finicky

2486
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:22,399
plant it doesn't have like the big you

2487
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:24,319
know harvest and the big you know buds

2488
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:26,559
or whatever like that so

2489
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:28,399
um you know i mean i think if you have

2490
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,880
to question it don't smoke it don't buy

2491
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,559
it it's it's that simple yeah you know

2492
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,039
if you have to question it and you don't

2493
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,239
know what people's growing practices are

2494
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:37,840
because they're not out there in the

2495
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:39,519
open and they're being secretive and

2496
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,079
private about their growing practices i

2497
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:44,719
mean that's not ip people try to say oh

2498
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,800
my growing regimen is ip that's sort of

2499
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,760
silly okay intellectual property and

2500
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,560
what you're feeding your soil all right

2501
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:55,280
to me that's a big red flag just

2502
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,719
people that are more you know upstanding

2503
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,158
um

2504
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,079
about what it is that they're doing and

2505
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:02,559
what they're adding is the people that

2506
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:05,279
you want to support

2507
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,000
yeah of course of course

2508
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:07,759
so

2509
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,119
how do you i mean you kind of touched on

2510
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,679
the point right there but how do you

2511
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:14,479
feel about organic companies that like

2512
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:17,199
maybe produce a nutrients or a soil

2513
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:19,198
and again they won't release specific

2514
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:22,000
information about maybe the ingredients

2515
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:24,399
they use and yeah they say it's ip or

2516
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,238
it's proprietary do you feel like that's

2517
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,319
you know even if it's quite an organic

2518
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:30,638
product it's just it still needs to be

2519
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:33,039
viewed with suspicion

2520
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:34,880
well i mean i can only say what we've

2521
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:37,039
done and

2522
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,440
if you look at any of our products it

2523
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:42,000
has every single ingredient in it and it

2524
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:44,079
has the exact ratio so

2525
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,880
what we say to people is everything that

2526
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:49,279
we put out is something that is good for

2527
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,560
the world and if if you want to learn

2528
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:52,719
from it and

2529
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,920
you know you want to copy it i know

2530
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,960
that's not what we're necessarily

2531
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,800
talking about but go ahead like for us

2532
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,079
to be able to be forthright is just

2533
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,079
really important because

2534
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:06,960
i just i just think that it's important

2535
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:08,800
to share information and if people are

2536
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,960
not sharing then of course you got to

2537
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:13,199
wonder like what kind of skeletons do

2538
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,279
they have in their closet and

2539
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:17,119
and people will say well

2540
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:19,279
you know people can grow and make your

2541
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:21,039
product and and go and do it themselves

2542
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:22,960
and we're like you know more power to

2543
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:25,920
them that's that's awesome

2544
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,039
has it hurt our business absolutely not

2545
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,639
um

2546
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:30,800
people want to buy our products because

2547
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:32,480
it says exactly what's on there it's no

2548
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,520
different than if you go to a grocery

2549
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:35,279
store

2550
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,440
i want to know i want to know what

2551
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:39,439
ingredients every single ingredient in

2552
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:41,439
the food i'm eating it's no different

2553
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:43,599
than in what i'm smoking so what i'm

2554
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:45,759
putting in my soil is what i'm smoking

2555
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:49,120
so of course i want to know every single

2556
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:53,679
ingredient yeah it's it's pretty obvious

2557
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:54,960
so do you favor a fungal or a bacterial

2558
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:57,600
dominant

2559
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,239
soil during a specific stage of the life

2560
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,880
cycle because we hear things like

2561
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:05,198
having say a fungal dominant soil

2562
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,279
is good for boosting the plant's immune

2563
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:10,158
system maybe for things like terpene

2564
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:12,319
production which are often thought of as

2565
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:14,559
a secondary metabolite or a secondary

2566
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:16,880
function of the immune system whereas

2567
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:19,600
say a bacterial dominant soil might be

2568
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,840
more advantageous to promoting growth

2569
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:24,480
during vegetative or the early flower

2570
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,000
stages do you agree with these ideas or

2571
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:27,678
do you just kind of let the plant do

2572
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,520
what it wants

2573
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,760
well we let the plant do what it wants

2574
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:34,080
and but we also so

2575
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:38,079
but having said that i would say that we

2576
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:40,479
would we would go you can't just

2577
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:41,679
spoil from material to fungal dominant

2578
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:42,959
you know based off your cycle your

2579
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:45,118
plants so you kind of have to choose

2580
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,000
like you know what's a soil that you

2581
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:50,000
feel is is really live and rich and a

2582
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,479
fungal dominant soil

2583
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,279
is really really important for

2584
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:56,519
um nutrient um

2585
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:59,039
breakdown and

2586
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,480
metabolization so we would want a

2587
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:03,319
nutrient

2588
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:05,759
a fungal dominant soil and maybe for the

2589
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:07,519
vegetative we would use

2590
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:11,119
some of our fermented plant juice or

2591
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,600
some kind of high bacterial plant juice

2592
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:16,319
teas to be able to get some of that

2593
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:18,560
nitrogen or growth hormones in them in

2594
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,799
the vegetative cycle so we would that's

2595
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:23,679
how we would do it and fungi and

2596
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:26,639
bacteria they work together you know

2597
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:29,118
it's so important to have

2598
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:32,319
both of them in the soil at a lot of

2599
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:34,238
different diversity and a large

2600
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:36,880
amount you know you want to have lots of

2601
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:38,000
colonization of both

2602
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,079
and

2603
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,880
just like within our body if we were to

2604
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:45,359
check our own microbiome it changes from

2605
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:48,079
day to day it changes with whether it's

2606
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:50,158
a cool day and then you've got like lots

2607
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:52,000
of bacteria that wants to come right up

2608
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:55,359
onto the surface of the soil or whether

2609
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,039
it's super hot and they go really deep

2610
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:59,439
well the plants uptake is going to

2611
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:02,158
change from day to day as well and when

2612
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:04,319
you've got like an indoor situation um

2613
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:06,479
what we've been learning more and more

2614
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,039
is that you have to

2615
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:11,439
what we were going into gardens you know

2616
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:14,238
many years ago and doing consultations

2617
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,919
and and taking a lot of um

2618
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:17,439
microbiology

2619
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,880
a look at the microbiology that was

2620
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:20,879
happening within the soil as well as

2621
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,118
nutrient and and what was going on with

2622
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:25,279
the mineral ratios and all of that and

2623
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:27,118
we were realizing that in cannabis

2624
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:29,840
indoor gardens there's a tremendous

2625
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:31,920
amount of bacteria and people were

2626
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,960
really trying to grow these plants that

2627
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:37,600
were super bacteria rich well when you

2628
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,399
have soils that are super bacterial rich

2629
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,639
then you have such a greater chance of

2630
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:45,198
any type of a pathogen coming in and

2631
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:48,719
taking that over because fungi

2632
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:52,000
is so incredibly um voracious and it's

2633
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:54,560
it's very strong so if there it becomes

2634
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,719
like a garter and if there's

2635
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:59,039
a pathogen that's going on the soil or

2636
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:00,880
you've got suffusarium or pythium or any

2637
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:03,279
type of a root rot like that you know

2638
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:06,159
your fungi is the one that's going to be

2639
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:08,800
you know right there at the beginning so

2640
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:10,879
fungi is so incredibly important to have

2641
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:14,000
within your soil at all times as well as

2642
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,239
bacteria feeding your plant foods so

2643
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,319
you know there was that thought that

2644
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:20,799
fungi is the only thing that can break

2645
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:22,799
down phosphorus and yes that's totally

2646
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:25,199
true so then people started saying well

2647
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,679
now you want to have a really fungi rich

2648
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:29,039
you know environment more in flowering

2649
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,199
because it's going to be breaking down

2650
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,319
the phosphorus

2651
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:35,279
and

2652
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:37,198
that is true and also

2653
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:40,238
plants are still going to decide from

2654
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:42,479
day to day and and colonization is is

2655
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:45,359
going to ebb and flow within that soil

2656
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:47,678
so adding a lot of different types of

2657
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,279
food in your soil

2658
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:52,560
that's going to feed your beneficial

2659
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,639
fungi and your beneficial bacteria is is

2660
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,000
really ideal higher amounts of organic

2661
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,440
matter

2662
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,960
yeah

2663
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:00,158
yeah of course

2664
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,279
so

2665
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:04,799
this is a kind of a zoomed out question

2666
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:05,599
but i've been thinking about this one a

2667
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,880
lot

2668
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:11,280
how do we go about raising the value be

2669
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,679
it perceived or just simply in the

2670
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:15,920
marketplace how do we go about raising

2671
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:18,800
the value of sun-grown cannabis in the

2672
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,639
mind of consumers is that the end goal

2673
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,279
to get it on par with indoor or is it

2674
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:26,159
simply a case about producer

2675
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,800
well i think it's partly it's create

2676
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:30,319
good sun-grown flower you know i mean

2677
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,760
show

2678
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:35,519
where it can shine so to speak with with

2679
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,880
its um sun

2680
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,360
and um

2681
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:42,319
you know and just um helping people

2682
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:45,519
realize the ecological impact i think a

2683
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:47,519
lot of people when they go to

2684
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,840
stores or dispensaries or they look

2685
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,600
online and they're buying i think they

2686
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:54,960
if they've come across

2687
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,639
um a co-op of farms or

2688
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,960
a farm itself and they have the

2689
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:01,118
opportunity to buy from a farm that's

2690
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,600
doing something that's agile

2691
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:05,759
ecologically sound and positive

2692
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,039
that i believe that that does add the

2693
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,119
value

2694
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:10,960
at adds value and we've seen that with

2695
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:13,519
farms and we've seen that with

2696
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:16,480
dispensaries that like soulful in

2697
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:18,880
california is a really good um

2698
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:20,638
you know uh example of of a place that's

2699
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,000
really shown

2700
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,400
you know

2701
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,319
the say californians what good sun grown

2702
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:27,839
looks like and and the farms that grow

2703
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:29,118
it you know and there's there's farms

2704
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,360
that they work with and they and the

2705
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:33,439
farmers go into to the place and they

2706
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:34,880
talk about their product and they meet

2707
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:37,279
the farmers so

2708
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,440
um and when regenerative farmers all

2709
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:40,960
join together then we can actually set

2710
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:44,000
the value

2711
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:46,158
of what super high quality

2712
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,238
flower looks like and you know i think

2713
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,799
it's important too here that you know we

2714
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:53,039
really appreciate all of the indoor you

2715
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,679
know growers out there that don't have

2716
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:58,479
an option to be outdoors you know

2717
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:00,800
thank goodness for you for supporting

2718
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:03,279
you know sick people and supporting

2719
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:05,679
patients and supporting your friends to

2720
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:08,158
not be drinking or taking hard drugs you

2721
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:11,520
know showing them the way with cannabis

2722
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,479
we think that you know indoor has really

2723
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,040
helped

2724
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,559
bring the plant forward you know she's

2725
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:18,960
been the one that's been incredibly

2726
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,800
persecuted and if we can hold these

2727
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,600
strains and still have these indoor

2728
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:26,239
gardens well we're activists and still

2729
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:28,159
having a voice for that plant so

2730
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,879
you know we're not i think that there's

2731
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:32,719
an incredible value in indoor especially

2732
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,079
when you're just still respecting the

2733
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:35,920
plants so

2734
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:38,800
i don't know if the conversation is so

2735
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:41,840
much about indoor outdoor i think it's

2736
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:44,239
about like respectful

2737
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,480
way that the plant is growing conscious

2738
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:48,879
cultivation you know i mean

2739
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:51,118
what's what what's valuable about sun

2740
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,639
grown is that it's positively um

2741
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:54,479
impacting the earth as we've talked

2742
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:56,079
about numerous times already tonight and

2743
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:57,198
that's and that's a real why that's

2744
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,198
important

2745
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:01,439
and then if you're looking at an you

2746
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:04,879
know cannabis as an industry

2747
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:05,919
you know you you it's it is a plant that

2748
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,400
that is

2749
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:11,199
naturally grown under the sun and so to

2750
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,118
to be able to support farms that do that

2751
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:16,238
you know is really valuable and we've

2752
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:18,639
really seen you know farms

2753
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:20,238
have more value with their plants so you

2754
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,760
know it's you kind of have to be you

2755
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:23,198
have to be a jack of all trades you have

2756
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,719
to be a farmer and you have to be able

2757
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:27,118
to really share your story in a way

2758
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:29,679
that's enticing and and really helpful

2759
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:32,238
to um consumers and it's really

2760
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:34,158
important to us that these people who

2761
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:36,479
are cultivating this plant and have a

2762
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:38,960
tight relationship with this plant have

2763
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:41,759
a future with this plant it's so

2764
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:44,158
important that the cannabis community

2765
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:47,119
and the cannabis culture continues

2766
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,439
forward that corporate you know takeover

2767
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:51,198
doesn't completely happen and we believe

2768
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,519
that that's going to happen by people

2769
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:56,719
producing the

2770
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,920
the least amount of you know cost per

2771
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:00,000
gram

2772
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,600
for them to be able to stay in this

2773
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,920
industry and for them to be able to

2774
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,239
continue their cultivation so that's

2775
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:09,039
another reason why we really encourage

2776
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:11,678
people to do sun grown to do outdoor

2777
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:15,039
light depth to use the sun because it's

2778
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,079
so much less expensive and it re is

2779
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:19,039
really

2780
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:21,679
being able to offer that alternative to

2781
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:23,439
the corporate cannabis we need to stay

2782
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,840
in business and a good way to stay in

2783
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:28,559
business is to save a lot of money

2784
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,239
yeah of course on that same topic of sun

2785
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,239
grown cannabis

2786
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,479
what types of companion plants do you

2787
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:36,319
recommend to use in conjunction with

2788
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:38,718
cannabis farming because recently i've

2789
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:41,439
seen some posts that criticize clover

2790
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:43,679
which is often held to be a a really

2791
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:45,279
good companion plant and some people are

2792
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,600
saying oh you know it just robs the soil

2793
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:49,118
of nitrogen it's not really that good

2794
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,520
what things do you recommend to go

2795
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:54,559
alongside your canner cuttings

2796
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:57,119
well clover is an indicate you know it

2797
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,039
can be an indication it can be a

2798
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,279
communicator that tells you whether you

2799
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,399
have bugs or not so i wouldn't say that

2800
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:03,599
it's

2801
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,238
you know

2802
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:08,480
creating the problem at all and and part

2803
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:10,079
of using clover as a cover crop is to

2804
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:11,759
understand

2805
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:14,319
how to use it you know you wouldn't want

2806
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:16,800
to let it grow too long to get super

2807
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,639
infected you would want to you know kind

2808
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,279
of work it into the top layer of your

2809
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:24,000
soil and if you keep it you know young

2810
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:26,960
then and vibrant you know it's it's way

2811
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,279
less likely to have any pathogens on it

2812
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,079
so learning how to use your cover crop

2813
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,599
is

2814
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:37,359
is really important and some you know

2815
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,880
buckwheat is is a really good companion

2816
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,839
plant um

2817
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,920
sorghum uh suit in these sorghum grasses

2818
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,679
is a is a

2819
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,118
cover crop and a companion plant that

2820
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,600
you can use that

2821
01:43:47,118 --> 01:43:53,839
colonizes mycorrhizal fungi so it can

2822
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:57,679
help build the colonies of of

2823
01:43:53,840 --> 01:44:01,039
grass and of mycorrhizal fungi and also

2824
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:03,600
cover crop what's around you know

2825
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:05,600
see what's thriving in your zoning area

2826
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:07,679
if you're in an outdoor farm you know

2827
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,639
see what's thriving in your zoning area

2828
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,319
for us

2829
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:12,639
everybody we just showed a bunch of

2830
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:14,158
pictures on our instagram of our plants

2831
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:15,600
that are coming up and people said oh

2832
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:16,399
you know what kind of cover crops did

2833
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,440
you

2834
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:18,719
plant and

2835
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,198
there's a ton of them in there but we

2836
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:23,279
didn't actually plant any yet um it's

2837
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:24,000
just what's coming up in the native soil

2838
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:26,800
so

2839
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,158
that's another really huge benefit on

2840
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,079
utilizing

2841
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:32,719
closed loop methods

2842
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:35,198
that you can just see what wants to come

2843
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,679
up and what wants to thrive

2844
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:39,118
but for indoor scenarios or people that

2845
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:41,199
just have like

2846
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:43,359
you know maybe a small garden that isn't

2847
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:46,079
that connected to nature

2848
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:48,000
we really love to rotate our cover crops

2849
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:50,559
and start out with sort of a nitrogen

2850
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,800
rich one that breaks down really easily

2851
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:57,360
like chickweed at the beginning

2852
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,360
and then it can move more into um

2853
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:02,238
quinoa is a wonderful one buckwheat is

2854
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:04,960
another great one and then you can start

2855
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:07,198
moving into more like phosphorus rich

2856
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,520
and potassium-rich ones you could do a

2857
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:12,079
corn if you wanted to if you grow your

2858
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,679
own corn but whatever your comfrey is

2859
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:17,039
one that people use a lot but it's one

2860
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:19,279
that gets powdery mildew if it gets if

2861
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:20,800
it stays alive a long time so you almost

2862
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:23,519
kind of have to keep that

2863
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,880
um cut down and really fresh too and

2864
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,400
that's another thing is that you were

2865
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,480
talking about clover it's sort of

2866
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:30,638
getting a bad rap well it gets a bad rap

2867
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:33,039
because people are leaving it too long

2868
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:35,920
maybe and then you know more things will

2869
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:39,039
colonize on it so we really love to pull

2870
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:40,639
up our cover crop and lay down a new one

2871
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:42,639
continuously

2872
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:44,000
we know that i mean pretty soon it's

2873
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,079
going to be exciting we're going to be

2874
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,840
able to have hemp as a cover crop

2875
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:51,039
because you know we're producing so much

2876
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,960
hemp seed that we're going to be able to

2877
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:55,439
you know have that also and see what

2878
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:58,399
that's like so we're just continuously

2879
01:45:55,439 --> 01:46:01,759
trying new things to know you can use

2880
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:04,479
lemon balms and holy basils and

2881
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,639
and different things you know around in

2882
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:10,079
your gardens and not as a cover crop

2883
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:12,480
because then it would go crazy but um

2884
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:14,000
yeah i mean you know nettles grow all

2885
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:15,439
around but that's not necessarily the

2886
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,359
best cover crop either but we kind of

2887
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:19,439
have it as a cover crop in our area

2888
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:22,479
poppy is a really amazing cover crop you

2889
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:24,559
can grow poppy flowers and it create and

2890
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:26,718
it contains the highest amount of

2891
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,920
phosphorus

2892
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:31,760
in a plant varietal that we know of so

2893
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,319
if you take a whole bunch of poppy seed

2894
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,800
and it only takes a few poppy heads to

2895
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:38,880
do a massive cover crop in

2896
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,480
in your indoor garden or even in a

2897
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,400
massive outdoor garden

2898
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:44,158
and that's like immediately readily

2899
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:47,679
available phosphorus so we always like

2900
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:49,279
to end our our flowering with with poppy

2901
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,118
and in between you can just look at

2902
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:53,519
different valley

2903
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:55,439
values mineral values of different seed

2904
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,320
varietals and say oh yeah that would be

2905
01:46:55,439 --> 01:47:00,799
cool to try during this time and

2906
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:02,719
use your intuition use your creativity

2907
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,639
come up with new things

2908
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:05,840
of course it's all about finding what

2909
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,118
works for you

2910
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,960
absolutely

2911
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:12,559
i see a few different uk grow and hydro

2912
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,480
stores now stocking some of your

2913
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,520
products which is absolutely fantastic

2914
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:17,279
to see

2915
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:19,280
i note this because the uk has

2916
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:23,118
historically been a very kind of you

2917
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:24,639
know hydro or soilless dominated market

2918
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,479
do you feel like the tides are finally

2919
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:29,359
turning in this regard and how can we

2920
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:30,559
help to crack hydro store strongholds so

2921
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:33,439
to speak

2922
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:37,039
just through education i think that even

2923
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:39,198
the hydro stores um you know have been

2924
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:42,399
taught the wrong thing they were taught

2925
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:44,319
by big ag you know npk ratios and they

2926
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:46,238
thought that that was what was the right

2927
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:47,920
thing to do and if we have the

2928
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:51,118
opportunity to

2929
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,399
bring a totally regeneratively grown

2930
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:55,519
indoor

2931
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:58,879
deep cultivated soil with dragonfly

2932
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:01,199
earth medicine buds into a hydro store

2933
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:04,239
and say look at what is possible that's

2934
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:06,879
an incredible education you know to them

2935
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:07,919
as well so do i think that the tides are

2936
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,359
turning

2937
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,600
hell yeah

2938
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:14,399
the tides are definitely turning and the

2939
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,560
tides are turning because microbiology

2940
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:19,198
is making a comeback

2941
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:22,080
in the cannabis world and the more that

2942
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:24,238
we create healthy microbiology the more

2943
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:26,719
healthy microbiology enters our own

2944
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:28,559
microbio biome which makes us more

2945
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:31,359
intelligent which makes us make better

2946
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:34,480
decisions which helps us educate the the

2947
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:36,079
growth stores and and i think that you

2948
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:37,759
know like i said before we're on an

2949
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:40,079
incredible bell curve and we all just

2950
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,600
need to run with that and not feel like

2951
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:43,679
oh well if i'm just getting into the

2952
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,159
game and i'm just learning about this

2953
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,719
that i have nothing to offer you have

2954
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:49,679
tons to offer everybody has something to

2955
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:52,319
offer

2956
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,800
that is some kind of a teaching around

2957
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:57,198
nature or a way to do it better that's

2958
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,159
better for the earth

2959
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:02,079
so i see on some of these stores that

2960
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:03,920
you guys have got your own molasses

2961
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:06,000
product which is great because i always

2962
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,560
had people ask me a lot of questions

2963
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,118
about molasses and some of the variants

2964
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,039
like treacle and the blackstrap molasses

2965
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:14,960
and all that what type of molasses do

2966
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,399
you guys like to use and how do you like

2967
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,760
to use it

2968
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:20,960
well um

2969
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:23,039
definitely organic blackstrap molasses

2970
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,198
would be you know something that people

2971
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:28,639
usually cut corners on

2972
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:29,598
but um we're not we don't actually even

2973
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:32,400
use

2974
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:34,159
molasses anymore you know or any kind

2975
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,839
and we don't actually have a molasses

2976
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:38,879
product well that's that was the

2977
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,800
dragonfly europe and that yeah so that

2978
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,639
was interesting there was some you know

2979
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,800
enough in europe to have it but the

2980
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:47,440
point is do you use

2981
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,880
molasses or not and

2982
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:51,919
initially it was like you know

2983
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:54,239
tablespoon per gallon molasses and

2984
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,520
that's going to add to your microbiology

2985
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:58,158
but i feel

2986
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:01,360
over the years of testing that

2987
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:03,359
um the the sweetener and adding molasses

2988
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:05,118
and sugars has really been overdone and

2989
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:08,719
could potentially spike

2990
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:11,359
uh pathogen uh pathogens in your t's as

2991
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,639
well so um if you're going to use

2992
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:14,479
molasses

2993
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,560
make sure it's organic because a lot of

2994
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:19,039
people will cut that corner

2995
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,280
and um it can be a really good iron you

2996
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:24,319
know iron or mineral supplement to to

2997
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:26,559
your teas but i would not overuse it but

2998
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:29,279
use it in very trace amounts such a

2999
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,560
tremendous amount of sugar is already in

3000
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:31,359
plants

3001
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,000
and

3002
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:36,000
you know we can really see that with

3003
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,079
if you're feeding your soil a whole lot

3004
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,679
of sugars it's really no different than

3005
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:41,679
if you're feeding your own body a whole

3006
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:43,440
lot of sugars you're going to have more

3007
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:46,079
yeast problems

3008
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:49,439
which is you know pathogenic yeast and

3009
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:51,679
soils sort of have that more mildews you

3010
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:53,279
could have all different types of yeah

3011
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,039
it's going to throw off your ph it's

3012
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:57,118
going to make it way more acidic and

3013
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:00,319
repetitive use of the scene yeah so just

3014
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:03,118
be really careful in nature you know

3015
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:05,519
plants survive off other plant juices

3016
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:08,399
there isn't really like molasses that

3017
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:11,040
comes into nature so

3018
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:12,879
really think about your microbiology and

3019
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:14,639
and like i was talking about before you

3020
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,239
know that first drop and how many

3021
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:18,719
ripples it can create you know look at

3022
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:19,598
that last ripple and you and you wanted

3023
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:21,599
to be

3024
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,760
a healthy balance all the way through

3025
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:26,560
and when you use lactic acid bacteria to

3026
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:28,639
break down plant you know juices and

3027
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,800
weeds there's there's a lot of

3028
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,960
living material in there and a lot of

3029
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,119
sugars that are just naturally present

3030
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:37,118
so it's it's kind of uh it balances

3031
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:39,279
itself out we don't use any extra sugars

3032
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:41,519
on our property

3033
01:51:39,279 --> 01:51:44,559
okay and if someone did want to use

3034
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:46,560
sugars like in say like a molasses form

3035
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,080
or something along those lines is there

3036
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,599
one that you would use preferentially

3037
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:51,439
because i've had someone ask me you know

3038
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:53,760
should i use honey should i use molasses

3039
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,439
should i use agave nectar and when it

3040
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,119
came down to it i thought well molasses

3041
01:51:55,439 --> 01:51:58,719
has got a few little extra minerals in

3042
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:00,238
it but i mean i'm not sure if there's

3043
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:02,079
too much of a difference what do you

3044
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:03,678
guys think

3045
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:05,760
it's a big difference yeah there's a big

3046
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:09,199
difference honey can have all different

3047
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:12,560
its own different microbiome um honey is

3048
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:14,960
alive especially if it's non-pasteurized

3049
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,440
um it's alive it has so many different

3050
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,920
types of things in it so that can throw

3051
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:22,719
off it can be anti-bacterial in some

3052
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:23,599
forms too and different things yeah so

3053
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:26,000
you know

3054
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:28,319
as raw of a

3055
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,238
good sugar as you can get that's not

3056
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:31,359
highly processed and that's totally

3057
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:33,759
organic

3058
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:36,719
is the one that we suggest and also to

3059
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:39,599
use it in very very low ratios a half a

3060
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:42,480
teaspoon per gallon really is all you

3061
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:45,279
need to spark those initial that initial

3062
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:48,319
microbiology sparks those initial

3063
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:51,118
bacteria but it's really no different in

3064
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:54,000
a brew than in the body you know when

3065
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:56,799
you're feeling a low blood sugar and you

3066
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,439
eat a candy bar you know that that candy

3067
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,119
bar is only going to last so long but if

3068
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:03,118
you eat like something really high

3069
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:05,039
protein and really rich and full

3070
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:07,519
balanced then that's going to keep your

3071
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:10,560
blood sugar going for a really long time

3072
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,920
and the teas are no different in you

3073
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,599
know you don't want to burn out your

3074
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:15,760
microbiology you want to give it

3075
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:18,880
something that it can feed off of long

3076
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:21,760
term as well and the best i think the

3077
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:24,400
best syrup or the best sweetener that

3078
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:27,119
you can use is yacon syrup and i'll

3079
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:30,319
spell that y-a-c-o-n

3080
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:32,559
and yacon is a south american tuber

3081
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:34,799
that's really watery and really sweet

3082
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,159
and it's a prebiotic that's really high

3083
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,760
in inulin

3084
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:39,279
and it can be really good for human

3085
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,880
consumption as well

3086
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:44,880
but it's often

3087
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:47,359
boiled down and and juiced and it

3088
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:50,319
creates a molasses and

3089
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:51,920
we um are growing a lot of yacon on our

3090
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:54,799
property and encouraging a lot of

3091
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:57,118
farmers to grow yacon um on their

3092
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:59,520
property and that's a real and you can

3093
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:02,719
also sometimes find it in a natural food

3094
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:04,560
store yacon syrup

3095
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,480
everyone you hear that store that away

3096
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,880
in a neuron somewhere

3097
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:10,479
what would you say to someone who says

3098
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,400
that they really want to get into

3099
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:15,198
organics and you know they really feel

3100
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:18,399
passionately about the general message

3101
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:20,559
being put forward by dragonfly however

3102
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:22,559
they just feel like they can't quite get

3103
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,960
their crops high enough to merit

3104
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,320
switching over

3105
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:28,319
um

3106
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:30,719
i think that you just have to try it out

3107
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:32,639
you know it's no different whenever you

3108
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,880
try something new there's always a

3109
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,199
learning curve there has to be a

3110
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:38,880
learning curve i mean if there's no

3111
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:40,559
learning curve then we we wouldn't be

3112
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,400
learning how to get better and better at

3113
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,719
things and

3114
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:46,960
we hear that a lot and then we also hear

3115
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:49,520
the same person say that come back a

3116
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:51,520
year later and be like oh my god are you

3117
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:53,360
kidding me i can't even believe that i

3118
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,159
ever thought that i couldn't have higher

3119
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:57,359
yields or that i couldn't grow better

3120
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:58,399
medicine

3121
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:02,880
so

3122
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:04,879
we know that organics and living natural

3123
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,359
biological soils

3124
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,800
is the way to go because that's what

3125
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:11,439
plants grow in

3126
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:14,719
um it was humans that took them and put

3127
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:16,238
them in some other type of a medium and

3128
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:18,480
tried to

3129
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:20,559
you know create that

3130
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,198
growing

3131
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,400
cultivation practice and

3132
01:55:23,198 --> 01:55:26,479
i just think

3133
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:29,519
give it give it a little bit of time

3134
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:30,959
learn as much as you can

3135
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,760
be curious

3136
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:37,840
be creative

3137
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:41,199
get new ideas and share them and maybe

3138
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:43,520
just about you know the ending yield

3139
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:45,118
maybe it's the journey along the way and

3140
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,040
all of the good information that you're

3141
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:48,639
going to get and all of the good

3142
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:50,319
microbiology that you're going to get

3143
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:52,400
along the way as well that's going to

3144
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:54,158
help you become a better gardener in the

3145
01:55:52,399 --> 01:55:54,960
end anyway

3146
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:57,598
so

3147
01:55:54,960 --> 01:56:00,158
if this was someone's primary concern

3148
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:02,800
for switching to organics for example if

3149
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:05,439
you're forced to grow in a non-organic

3150
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,599
way just specifically to get enough

3151
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:08,879
yield to say support yourself do you

3152
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,960
feel like there's been a certain

3153
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,359
something missed there in respects to

3154
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:15,520
their relationship with the plant

3155
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:17,679
well what's missing is

3156
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,440
that it's actually the opposite that in

3157
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:22,719
a lot of

3158
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:24,638
legalized and recreational jurisdictions

3159
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:26,800
it's actually

3160
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:28,560
you have to grow it regeneratively or

3161
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:31,520
organically in order to pass all these

3162
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:33,280
tests so it's it's kind of

3163
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,199
turned into

3164
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,880
a good thing for an organic farmer

3165
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,559
because in the end it's it's kind of

3166
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,319
yeah i think a lot of people have said

3167
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,159
oh well in these new systems you almost

3168
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:43,920
have to grow organically because there's

3169
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:45,198
too many residues and different things

3170
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,960
that show up

3171
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:49,678
in the flowers so

3172
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:51,520
um i i think you have to ask yourself

3173
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,480
what do you have in your relationship

3174
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:54,320
with

3175
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:57,359
are you having your relationship with

3176
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:59,920
the fear of losing your job and being

3177
01:56:57,359 --> 01:57:01,920
forced into something that you may not

3178
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,440
believe in and may not even be part of

3179
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,719
your ethics

3180
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:08,799
or are you having a relationship with

3181
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:10,560
the cannabis plant and i think that's

3182
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:12,560
just something that you want to ask

3183
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,400
yourself some people

3184
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:17,119
just want to have a relationship with

3185
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:19,519
the money and do a nine to five

3186
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:21,279
and um you know not think about anything

3187
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:22,719
else and and

3188
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:25,519
you know there's a whole lot of people

3189
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:27,279
on the planet like that

3190
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,520
i personally

3191
01:57:27,279 --> 01:57:31,759
want to have a relationship with

3192
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,239
everything that i do in my life

3193
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:35,119
and i know josh feels the same way we

3194
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:36,238
just

3195
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:38,479
want

3196
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,718
to be involved and

3197
01:57:38,479 --> 01:57:42,959
want to be able to have integrity with

3198
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:45,520
what we're doing so that we can be proud

3199
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,840
of it and so that we can be interested

3200
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:50,239
in it and so we can remain creative with

3201
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:52,319
it and we're not just working a nine to

3202
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:53,839
five and we're looking at the bottom

3203
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:56,479
line

3204
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:58,480
and and in a way that i could really

3205
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:59,839
tell people who only are looking at that

3206
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:02,718
bottom line

3207
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:06,000
polyculture is equally as important as

3208
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:08,399
poly economy we cannot just be growing

3209
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,520
cannabis maybe anymore why not have an

3210
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:14,479
early spring crop of strawberries

3211
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:16,480
on your land or try to diversify with

3212
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:19,118
other things you know we can't just be

3213
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,718
selling a pound of wheat anymore and

3214
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:23,118
think that that's going to suffice for

3215
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:25,118
us we have to become product makers we

3216
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:28,238
have to have an ending product that

3217
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:31,039
brings more value to our flowers so that

3218
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:33,598
we can bring value to our organics and

3219
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:35,920
have a higher quality product we have to

3220
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:37,760
become more creative and and that is

3221
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:40,560
what's going to give us

3222
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:43,360
more value for what we're doing and more

3223
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:45,199
value for the product in the end

3224
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:47,279
definitely definitely so how do you

3225
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:50,238
think we can go about raising the

3226
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:52,238
general perception in the mind of the

3227
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:54,638
consumers about the quality of outdoor

3228
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:57,359
because at the moment as maybe

3229
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:59,199
ideologically inaccurate as it may be

3230
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:01,118
there is the general consensus that

3231
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:04,000
people want you know to quote that

3232
01:59:01,118 --> 01:59:06,238
indoor um how do we go about changing

3233
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:09,359
that so that people are demanding that

3234
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:11,439
high quality organic outdoor

3235
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:13,519
right well i think it matters where you

3236
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:14,559
live you know what i mean i think that

3237
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,400
uh

3238
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:20,080
people are not

3239
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:22,399
being able to see good quality outdoor

3240
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:24,158
and you know the indoor that's around

3241
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:26,158
people think that it's just about the

3242
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:27,839
looks when it's really about so much

3243
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:30,879
more than that so i think it's just a

3244
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:32,400
matter of education and and i mean we've

3245
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,560
brought our

3246
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:36,319
cannabis to different cups and different

3247
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,000
things and i mean it's incredibly

3248
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:40,000
crystally and

3249
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,319
it looks really beautiful it smells

3250
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,479
really good and i think that in certain

3251
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:46,960
ways we've redefined what's even

3252
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:48,959
possible to grow outdoors up in british

3253
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,760
columbia and

3254
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,480
um

3255
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:56,000
you know the light deprivation has added

3256
01:59:52,479 --> 01:59:58,959
a lot of quality to sun grown you know

3257
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,639
plants so light depth is a really easy

3258
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,000
sell to people

3259
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:03,760
and um

3260
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:08,000
i think that just

3261
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:09,840
having a good cure and a good quality um

3262
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,158
way of harvesting

3263
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,679
your sun grown and just being able to do

3264
02:00:12,158 --> 02:00:15,679
it right i think

3265
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:17,840
when people say you know

3266
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:20,639
can i make the leap of faith organics i

3267
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:23,360
mean it's not much of an actual leap

3268
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:26,719
because you know just building a really

3269
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:29,439
good soil and having a really quality

3270
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:31,840
stable base within your soil is going to

3271
02:00:29,439 --> 02:00:34,000
give you the ability to take advantage

3272
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,560
of the sun and green and create you know

3273
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,760
good flower from it so we see

3274
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:41,520
really amazing outdoor sun-grown

3275
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:44,800
cannabis so i think you know it's

3276
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,760
possible to do it in other areas and

3277
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,920
you know

3278
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,320
it's what it's what makes people feel

3279
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:52,800
better most of the time too

3280
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:55,359
yeah and i think that people who say

3281
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:57,279
that you know indoors better than sun

3282
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,279
grown they just haven't had good sun

3283
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:01,039
grown i mean that's really what it comes

3284
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:02,158
down to which is what josh pretty much

3285
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:04,639
just said

3286
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,158
and i think that that's important so the

3287
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:07,760
more sun grown

3288
02:01:06,158 --> 02:01:10,559
that's out there with really good

3289
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,440
varietals that do well you know in the

3290
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,440
sun

3291
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:15,039
because what people are doing is that

3292
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:18,719
they're taking

3293
02:01:15,039 --> 02:01:21,118
these indoor varietals or a clone or a

3294
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:23,039
seed that has been grown indoors for a

3295
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:26,719
really long time in a synthetic

3296
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:29,679
environment or in in a soilless medium

3297
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:32,079
and then they try to grow it outside and

3298
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:35,359
they don't understand why it doesn't do

3299
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:37,359
very well well that plant doesn't have

3300
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:40,158
the intelligence

3301
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:43,198
of a natural system it's lost its

3302
02:01:40,158 --> 02:01:45,759
intelligence it's lost the ability

3303
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:48,000
you know to be able to uptake and grow

3304
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:51,119
to its full potential because it's only

3305
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,760
been used to sort of that iv feeding

3306
02:01:51,118 --> 02:01:56,000
more allopathic npk

3307
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:57,679
that doesn't understand microbiology or

3308
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,639
an endophytic

3309
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:02,239
you know reaction within the plant

3310
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:04,319
so

3311
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:07,039
you know outdoor is really wonderful

3312
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:09,039
when you're working with outdoor strains

3313
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:10,960
and just like josh said

3314
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:13,439
i mean i wish i could give every single

3315
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,359
person out there listening you know one

3316
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:17,039
of our flowers and

3317
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:18,479
you know they would they would say

3318
02:02:17,039 --> 02:02:20,399
something really different and there's

3319
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:23,039
often a really good feeling that comes

3320
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:24,479
with it i mean if we hear that a lot you

3321
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:25,920
know people smoke our weed and they're

3322
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:27,519
like oh you know i

3323
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,760
i usually have a certain feeling

3324
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:31,280
associated with it but i think when you

3325
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:34,239
get a really good

3326
02:02:31,279 --> 02:02:36,479
sun-grown herb and and even within in

3327
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:38,718
our experience people have a better

3328
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:40,399
feeling from it so i mean if you're go

3329
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:41,679
why are you smoking the wheat are you

3330
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:42,799
smoking the weed because of what it

3331
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:44,239
looks like

3332
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,119
or are you smoking the weed because of

3333
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:49,039
how it feels so maybe you know

3334
02:02:47,118 --> 02:02:50,559
challenge yourself on on why you're

3335
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:51,760
doing it

3336
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,480
definitely

3337
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:56,880
so the pure seal itself is very much

3338
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:58,959
communally orientated and accredited

3339
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,520
certification do you see this model

3340
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:03,679
expanding into other facets of the

3341
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:06,159
community over say multiple avenues and

3342
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:08,319
specifically do you think we'll ever see

3343
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:11,039
something like say a pure dispensary

3344
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:13,198
where it's just full of flowers and

3345
02:03:11,039 --> 02:03:14,960
products produced under the pure

3346
02:03:13,198 --> 02:03:17,839
certification

3347
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:20,399
yeah it's happening already so it's

3348
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:22,079
exciting this is already happening and

3349
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:23,839
product makers want to have the peer

3350
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:26,880
certification so that they're only

3351
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:29,840
sourcing flowers from pure certified uh

3352
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:33,359
farms and it creates this beautiful

3353
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:35,119
sacred commerce that's regenerative and

3354
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:36,880
yeah there's been lots of talk about

3355
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:38,639
that there's dispensaries that totally

3356
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:41,039
want to come on board and see what

3357
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:43,279
that's like so what we're looking at as

3358
02:03:41,039 --> 02:03:46,319
a whole collective right now is

3359
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:48,000
different certifications uh that's still

3360
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:49,039
pure certified

3361
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,599
um

3362
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:54,000
that represents that same

3363
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:58,319
really high quality and

3364
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:00,880
community monitoring and community run

3365
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:04,158
one of the questions that got submitted

3366
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,400
by one of our fans was if they say just

3367
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:07,679
bought a stock standard because i know

3368
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:08,960
that there's so many variables here

3369
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:10,560
let's just say they bought a pretty

3370
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,480
standard farm

3371
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:14,480
how long would you guess it would take

3372
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:16,399
for them to get it up into shape to the

3373
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:19,118
point where it would probably pass the

3374
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:22,158
pure certification

3375
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:24,960
i mean it's really hard to say i mean it

3376
02:04:22,158 --> 02:04:26,799
would take having you know

3377
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:29,279
when we say closed loop systems that

3378
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,639
means some type of system that you've

3379
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:33,359
you know some

3380
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:35,118
that works on top of itself some compost

3381
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:36,960
or some you know good things that you

3382
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:39,439
have that you're

3383
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:41,840
catching water saving water making your

3384
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:44,000
own seeds i mean i would say you know

3385
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:46,159
you can't just get it and within two

3386
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,920
weeks maybe you've bought someone else's

3387
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:50,479
farm that's already done something

3388
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:53,199
really amazing i mean you could actually

3389
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:55,439
you know come in and and pretty quickly

3390
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:57,759
then we've we've had people take you

3391
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,598
know five years that are just coming to

3392
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:01,679
it that said we're finally ready we've

3393
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:04,000
been five years in the making and we

3394
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:05,760
really want to do this and then we've

3395
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,520
had other farms that have done it in one

3396
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,440
year that they put all of their energy

3397
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,920
and effort in and every bit that they

3398
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:13,919
had you know to creating more closed

3399
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:16,078
loop systems um

3400
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:18,319
so it's really not a time thing it's an

3401
02:05:16,078 --> 02:05:19,840
energy thing and and also depending on

3402
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:22,559
where you are because if you're in the

3403
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:25,119
tropics being closed loop is is a whole

3404
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,079
lot easier than if you're in the desert

3405
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:28,319
so

3406
02:05:26,078 --> 02:05:31,519
you know there's different variables for

3407
02:05:28,319 --> 02:05:34,479
people but what is really cool

3408
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,400
is that the tremendous amount of closed

3409
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:37,759
loops that have come to our attention

3410
02:05:36,399 --> 02:05:40,078
you know like

3411
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:42,960
people have created closed loops out of

3412
02:05:40,078 --> 02:05:45,599
just pure brilliance and that's just

3413
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:48,158
really awesome so yet again it brings

3414
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:50,480
that intuitive sense of creativity and

3415
02:05:48,158 --> 02:05:52,799
and that your land is

3416
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:54,399
specific to you and that you know

3417
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:56,239
everybody is a little bit different in

3418
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:58,399
the way that you do things on your own

3419
02:05:56,238 --> 02:06:01,359
land or in your own indoor garden or

3420
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:03,279
your own tiny backyard garden

3421
02:06:01,359 --> 02:06:05,198
you know is it's a holistic

3422
02:06:03,279 --> 02:06:08,078
certification so you know you have to be

3423
02:06:05,198 --> 02:06:09,519
ready to not be using non you know toxic

3424
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:11,840
substances like

3425
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,520
butane or propane or

3426
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:15,599
some type of height we don't allow

3427
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,000
hydrocarbon extracts like we've talked

3428
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:19,920
about before and and people can

3429
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,399
you know tell us

3430
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,000
how clean it is and they can give us

3431
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:26,158
tests and they'll say all kinds of

3432
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,039
things but in the end we just

3433
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:31,399
for us it's a toxic compound and to

3434
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:33,840
clean it a toxic compound out seems

3435
02:06:31,399 --> 02:06:36,879
counterintuitive and it's just

3436
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:39,440
it's it's supporting an industry that

3437
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:41,359
creates a you know toxic compound and

3438
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:42,960
and that's not okay so as a you know

3439
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:46,719
pure certified farmer you just have to

3440
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:49,198
be able to have a food garden and you

3441
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:51,198
have to be able to have

3442
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:53,919
flowers growing and you have to be able

3443
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:56,839
to have some you know ways of making

3444
02:06:53,920 --> 02:07:00,078
soil and you have to be able to have a

3445
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:02,880
functional um farm and you know that can

3446
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:03,920
come within one year it might take a few

3447
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,359
years

3448
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,158
of course

3449
02:07:05,359 --> 02:07:08,319
so

3450
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:10,479
to change the topic ever so slightly

3451
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:13,599
what are some cultivars or strains

3452
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:16,238
you've been vibing with a lot lately

3453
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:17,119
well um you know there's

3454
02:07:16,238 --> 02:07:20,000
uh

3455
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:20,799
a lot of hemp strains that are being you

3456
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,238
know

3457
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,159
explored and those are really

3458
02:07:22,238 --> 02:07:25,678
interesting to us right now because some

3459
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:28,638
of them are

3460
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:31,279
you know really high in terpenes and

3461
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:33,599
and other ones are high in cbg and other

3462
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:36,639
ones are high

3463
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:38,560
thc and different things so

3464
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:40,319
right now we're just really interested

3465
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:41,199
in exploring

3466
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:44,559
uh

3467
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:47,118
you know cultivars that are unique you

3468
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,039
know i mean and and so some of those

3469
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:51,679
cultivars are

3470
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:55,039
i mean it the cherry wine has been

3471
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:56,480
around for a while as a hem cultivar but

3472
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:59,439
we've been playing around with the

3473
02:07:56,479 --> 02:08:00,638
cherry wine and the auto and the

3474
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:02,479
spectrum

3475
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:03,760
and those have been really interesting

3476
02:08:02,479 --> 02:08:06,158
and um

3477
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:09,199
yeah we're looking into doing some more

3478
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:11,519
varieties on that front

3479
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:14,158
and we've been still you know moving

3480
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:17,599
forward our own varietals

3481
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:20,559
you know we have our 840 mail that we

3482
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:23,199
still work with um as well as other

3483
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:25,840
males that have been made off of that

3484
02:08:23,198 --> 02:08:27,839
you know our zelly's gift we rejuvenated

3485
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:29,679
this year and we did some in-line

3486
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:31,920
breeding with it

3487
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:34,078
way back so something that's been really

3488
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:36,880
interesting to us is we brought out a

3489
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:39,679
lot of our early 2000s seeds just

3490
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:42,000
recently for all of our varietals on for

3491
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:44,960
this year and now we're growing them

3492
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,439
again so we can re-breed those back in

3493
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:50,239
and we can really create stability and

3494
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:52,479
what we're seeing in stability which you

3495
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:55,039
know stability is a shaky term in the

3496
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:58,078
cannabis industry and i realize that but

3497
02:08:55,039 --> 02:09:00,719
what we're seeing is as we

3498
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:03,679
bring even our lineage further of what's

3499
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:04,480
interesting to us um

3500
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:06,800
we're

3501
02:09:04,479 --> 02:09:08,238
choosing plants and then they're being

3502
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:12,239
tested

3503
02:09:08,238 --> 02:09:15,678
we're really moving into and most of our

3504
02:09:12,238 --> 02:09:17,359
varieties are full spectrum full terpene

3505
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:18,480
and that just seems to be coming

3506
02:09:17,359 --> 02:09:21,279
naturally

3507
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:23,039
with with treating them well and so

3508
02:09:21,279 --> 02:09:25,759
we've been even seeing some of our old

3509
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:30,078
like temple spice varietal now that's

3510
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:32,159
starting to have cbd creep into it so

3511
02:09:30,078 --> 02:09:35,039
i think that it you know we're moving

3512
02:09:32,158 --> 02:09:37,759
along our own stuff and and like josh

3513
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:40,479
said we're like now 80

3514
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:42,320
hemp on our property and we're really

3515
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:44,718
interested in

3516
02:09:42,319 --> 02:09:47,599
working with the hemp varietal that

3517
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:50,560
finishes here so our really big goal

3518
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:54,078
this year in breeding is to try to bring

3519
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:56,400
forth an early finishing high cbd hemp

3520
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:58,960
varietal and also we're working with

3521
02:09:56,399 --> 02:10:00,799
some autoflower seeds that we got from

3522
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:05,039
heart rock mountain

3523
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:06,480
and the cali gold and that's been a a

3524
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:09,039
project they've been working on for a

3525
02:10:06,479 --> 02:10:11,519
long time and so we're excited to

3526
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:12,800
you know to work with some auto flowers

3527
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:15,679
um

3528
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:18,960
and we are you know working with some

3529
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:23,199
hash varieties that we've gotten from

3530
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:26,560
uh you know kush kirk and and some 24k

3531
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:30,399
varieties and um

3532
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:32,239
some snapple cookie varieties and and

3533
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:34,879
different things like that just to see

3534
02:10:32,238 --> 02:10:37,039
you know what kind of uh

3535
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:39,920
syrup we can get just kidding

3536
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:42,800
but we have reindeer reindeer syrup is

3537
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:44,800
is another variety that's a rude or

3538
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:47,760
alice strain that we've been you know

3539
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:49,920
that we're that we're going to try out

3540
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,679
and um so that's really interesting this

3541
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:53,599
year i don't know we've gotten a lot of

3542
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:55,118
strains from a lot of different people

3543
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:58,639
this year and we're just doing our best

3544
02:10:55,118 --> 02:10:59,439
to do a little bit of everything just to

3545
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:02,480
see

3546
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:04,719
to further explore you know what we're

3547
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:07,198
what we can grow you know we've got some

3548
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:09,198
land raised varieties happening some

3549
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:12,559
milana creams

3550
02:11:09,198 --> 02:11:14,879
i'm going and yeah

3551
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:16,320
yeah a really nice diverse mix of

3552
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,199
genetics there

3553
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:22,559
when can we expect to see the launch

3554
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:24,559
itself of dragonfly genetics because a

3555
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:26,880
few people have told me they're hunting

3556
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:29,119
for your seeds like nothing else and you

3557
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,118
know the struggle is real to get them

3558
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:34,000
certainly seems like there's demand when

3559
02:11:31,118 --> 02:11:35,679
is it gonna be time

3560
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,439
um you know

3561
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:42,399
maybe we'll do some this fall this fall

3562
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:44,479
it might be a good idea to to do that

3563
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:48,000
and you know we have given out a lot of

3564
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:50,559
seeds when we see people and uh

3565
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,359
you know i guess it's just a matter of

3566
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:55,920
you know making it happen and we make a

3567
02:11:53,359 --> 02:11:57,359
whole lot of seeds every year and we

3568
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:00,719
give them all away

3569
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:03,039
so our genetics are out there

3570
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:06,399
and uh i guess it's just people that see

3571
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:08,639
us in passing we're happy to gift them

3572
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:10,238
with varietals but we do always ask

3573
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:13,679
people you know how are you gonna grow

3574
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:15,839
these and it's a really nice idea for us

3575
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:16,800
to know that our seeds are going out

3576
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,279
into

3577
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:21,279
a respectful garden or you know somebody

3578
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:22,479
that's gonna turn them into something

3579
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:25,039
really cool

3580
02:12:22,479 --> 02:12:26,799
um but i you know i don't know

3581
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:28,560
we just keep giving them away and people

3582
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,260
keep out i think that we give away too

3583
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:32,840
many to actually sell any

3584
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:35,360
[Laughter]

3585
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:37,440
so yeah we'll see

3586
02:12:35,359 --> 02:12:39,439
what we really want is a field test kit

3587
02:12:37,439 --> 02:12:41,279
so that we can really do you know a lot

3588
02:12:39,439 --> 02:12:43,839
of the breeding that we really you know

3589
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:45,920
analyze you know the analyzing on our

3590
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,400
own property so i mean eventually we get

3591
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,078
a good field testing kit and that would

3592
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:51,759
really help our breeding and that would

3593
02:12:50,078 --> 02:12:54,880
really help us you know feel good about

3594
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,360
putting seeds out into the world

3595
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:59,599
of course and i know that you have some

3596
02:12:57,359 --> 02:13:02,799
interesting kind of collaborations or at

3597
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:04,880
least working closely with snodgrass

3598
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:07,199
family farm genetics can you tell us a

3599
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:09,599
little more about this

3600
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:11,598
well you know they they have really

3601
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:14,319
amazing breeding products that they're a

3602
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:17,119
part of and since they're you know

3603
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:19,519
family to us you know we've we've traded

3604
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:21,039
genetics back and forth over the years

3605
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,400
and um

3606
02:13:21,039 --> 02:13:24,319
really um

3607
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:26,879
bobby and meredith just have a really

3608
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:29,118
beautiful piece of land and and they're

3609
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:30,800
just exploring you know genetics that

3610
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:31,839
have come to them throughout their

3611
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,679
things so we don't have any

3612
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,840
collaboration you know official

3613
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:36,639
collaborations happening

3614
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,159
um

3615
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:40,400
at the moment other than we've been

3616
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:41,920
sharing scenes for years and reading off

3617
02:13:40,399 --> 02:13:43,598
of each other's stuff

3618
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:45,440
so in that way it's really collaborative

3619
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:46,719
yeah no it would be really fun to come

3620
02:13:45,439 --> 02:13:48,719
out with something with something

3621
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:50,239
together when we come with something

3622
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:51,439
when we get to something that's really

3623
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:53,359
beautiful but

3624
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:56,158
um yeah i would know they every year

3625
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:58,399
they they explore a huge variety of

3626
02:13:56,158 --> 02:13:59,679
genetics and do a lot of breeding so

3627
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:01,519
it's always really interesting to find

3628
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:03,679
out what they come up with

3629
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:06,320
and would you ever consider doing like a

3630
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:08,960
rather formal collab with someone who

3631
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:11,840
you really closely align with like maybe

3632
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,760
you know duke diamond or someone along

3633
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:15,599
those lines who you respect and vibe

3634
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:18,400
with their work already

3635
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:20,960
always oh yeah for sure we love that

3636
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:22,719
yeah we're all about collaborating

3637
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:24,480
you know in any way that we can with

3638
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:27,439
information

3639
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:29,359
with uh you know good flowers with seeds

3640
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:31,439
we even have some heavy days genetics

3641
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:33,598
going on right now yeah we do what i'm

3642
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:35,198
saying we're pretty stoked so you know

3643
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:37,840
there could be a collab coming right

3644
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:39,839
there just saying

3645
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:41,279
big grin on my face thanks very much

3646
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:43,279
guys

3647
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:44,960
um so the next thing i wanted to ask you

3648
02:14:43,279 --> 02:14:47,840
is they're coming up really beautiful by

3649
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:49,920
the way really gorgeous so super excited

3650
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:51,440
about it oh you guys are too kind i'm

3651
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:52,880
sure you're giving him a very loving

3652
02:14:51,439 --> 02:14:54,960
home

3653
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:57,760
oh we for sure are

3654
02:14:54,960 --> 02:15:00,000
so with that being said how important is

3655
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:01,920
it in your opinion to continually be

3656
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,359
pheno hunting

3657
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,158
it's everything

3658
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:08,639
i mean that's what makes it exciting

3659
02:15:06,158 --> 02:15:10,799
if we're not pheno hunting then i always

3660
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:12,400
feel like what am i doing you know

3661
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,960
everything that we've gotten up to this

3662
02:15:12,399 --> 02:15:16,559
point we did without you know only maybe

3663
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:18,719
in the last five years if we've been

3664
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:21,520
doing it even any testing

3665
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:23,679
everything was pheno hunting and what it

3666
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:25,840
smelled like and what it looked like and

3667
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:27,599
how it did in the garden and what it

3668
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:29,279
made you feel like when you smelled it

3669
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:31,679
or touched it or you're next to it or

3670
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:33,840
when you smoked it or you ingested it or

3671
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:35,679
put it into your food you know

3672
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:38,639
pheno hunting is

3673
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:41,039
is being a cannabis cultivator

3674
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:41,840
they go hand in hand

3675
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:44,000
so

3676
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:46,480
this is a bit of a peculiar one but i

3677
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,158
really wanted to kind of dig in here but

3678
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:52,399
i tried some mach 1 that was grown in

3679
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:54,799
the states outdoors with you know the

3680
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:56,960
kind of the pure type of i think it was

3681
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,800
grown on a pure farm but you know if not

3682
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:00,880
we'll just say you know very closely

3683
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:04,320
aligned with that type of thing

3684
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:06,800
and to be honest it just didn't come

3685
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:08,880
across to me as it was on the same level

3686
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:11,199
as some of the indoor stuff

3687
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:13,920
in terms of the caps in terms of the mac

3688
02:16:11,198 --> 02:16:16,559
specifically and so my question is do

3689
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:19,359
you feel like there may be some cuttings

3690
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:21,440
that are just more suited for outdoor

3691
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:23,039
than indoor or for indoor than outdoor

3692
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:25,279
or do you think that anything has the

3693
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:27,439
potential to shine just as good in

3694
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:29,599
either or

3695
02:16:27,439 --> 02:16:31,678
um well i think that i touched on that a

3696
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:34,398
little bit before is that you know a lot

3697
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:36,879
of these varietals uh have been grown

3698
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:38,558
indoor for so long they've been cuttings

3699
02:16:36,879 --> 02:16:41,679
off of indoor they've been put in

3700
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:44,478
synthetic or soilless mediums and they

3701
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:46,558
don't really have the intelligence to to

3702
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:49,679
go into an outdoor

3703
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:51,840
uh cultivation you know methodology or

3704
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:53,840
or practices so you know it's

3705
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:56,639
particularly with the mac that's a

3706
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:59,120
really indoor varietal and you know it's

3707
02:16:56,638 --> 02:17:01,679
been cloned off a whole bunch of times

3708
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:03,760
so i think it would take you know

3709
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:05,920
several runs if we ever get an indoor

3710
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,599
clone uh from somebody or something that

3711
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,920
we're really interested in wanting to

3712
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:11,599
grow out we take a couple of years to

3713
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,000
grow it out to see what its full

3714
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:17,679
potential is because guaranteed for

3715
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,558
getting a synthetic clone from somebody

3716
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:22,159
it takes a long time for that clone to

3717
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:24,159
come to its full potential because it

3718
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:26,840
doesn't have the intelligence of

3719
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:30,558
biological uptake

3720
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:31,760
so you know it's going to take some time

3721
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:33,518
and i think that the plant's

3722
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:36,000
intelligence needs to match the

3723
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:38,880
intelligence of the soil

3724
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:41,040
of course so something i wanted to ask

3725
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:44,959
you guys your perspective on was the use

3726
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:47,840
of quote natural growth regulators so

3727
02:17:44,959 --> 02:17:50,239
i know that i've heard and seen a lot of

3728
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:52,478
people using gibberellic acid in the

3729
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:55,039
vegetative stages and some people will

3730
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:57,920
consider this to be on par if not the

3731
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:59,200
same thing as using pgrs you know the

3732
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:01,760
more kind of

3733
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:03,359
synthetic uh natural ones but other

3734
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:05,040
people will say oh but it's just a

3735
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:06,159
natural hormone that's in the plant

3736
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,920
anyway

3737
02:18:06,159 --> 02:18:10,159
where do you sit on that do you view it

3738
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:11,760
as a natural thing or is a synthetic

3739
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:12,718
thing

3740
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:16,318
well

3741
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:18,638
gibberellic acid is a natural compound

3742
02:18:16,318 --> 02:18:20,879
that's found in nature so i wouldn't say

3743
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:23,839
it's not a synthetic compound but i

3744
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:26,239
think that you know anything that's been

3745
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:27,439
it could be that it's synthesized and it

3746
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:29,519
could be that

3747
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:32,719
some of those i think it's kind of like

3748
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:34,478
do you like isolate you know cbd or do

3749
02:18:32,718 --> 02:18:36,398
you like full spectrum

3750
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:38,318
you know medicine i think that you know

3751
02:18:36,398 --> 02:18:40,239
when you start just using gibberellic

3752
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:42,079
acid on its own

3753
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:43,920
you know you're you're

3754
02:18:42,079 --> 02:18:45,840
you just don't know what the source is

3755
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,079
and i think that you can get plenty of

3756
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:51,359
gibberellic acid just in

3757
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:53,200
like nettles or you know in some kind of

3758
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:54,880
plant and i would just much rather get

3759
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:57,040
it from that so

3760
02:18:54,879 --> 02:18:59,518
you know to me that's just uh it's kind

3761
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:02,080
of like using an isolate

3762
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:03,920
that's what i think

3763
02:19:02,079 --> 02:19:06,159
yeah okay and so

3764
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:08,239
would you view it i guess just as a

3765
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:10,079
clarifying point as

3766
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:12,318
somewhat akin to

3767
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:14,398
uh tricontinol where it's like yeah just

3768
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:16,638
get it from the alfalfa it's all good

3769
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:18,638
exactly that'll be that's a perfect

3770
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:21,119
analogy i mean it's kind of like yeah

3771
02:19:18,638 --> 02:19:23,759
exactly it's just

3772
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:26,160
you know humans desire to

3773
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:28,559
think that it's one compound over the

3774
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:30,638
all it's not to say you know cbd on its

3775
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:33,599
own can cure but you know the whole

3776
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:36,239
entourage is way better gibberillic acid

3777
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:37,760
you know on its own can grow plants

3778
02:19:36,239 --> 02:19:40,398
exponentially

3779
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:43,040
and i've even heard with feminization

3780
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:44,879
that gibberilic acid used in conjunction

3781
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:47,040
with colloidal silver

3782
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:49,599
um in the early flowering stages can be

3783
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:51,280
a way to feminize your plants silver

3784
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,280
theosulfate which is what's commonly

3785
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:54,720
used for feminization so

3786
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:59,040
you know um

3787
02:19:54,719 --> 02:20:01,279
gibberilic acid is is is a really

3788
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:03,439
heavy um

3789
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,479
growth hormone

3790
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:07,359
and

3791
02:20:04,478 --> 02:20:08,959
yeah so i i anything that's isolated

3792
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:12,000
like that we're just automatically

3793
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:14,879
skeptical of and we don't use it

3794
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,799
yeah good point good point so i'm gonna

3795
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:18,559
take a bit of a step off the edge here

3796
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:20,159
and talk about something random that i

3797
02:20:18,559 --> 02:20:22,559
saw the other day on instagram but i'd

3798
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:25,039
love to gauge your opinion on it what do

3799
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:27,600
you think about the introduction of

3800
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:28,800
mushroom spores from psychedelic

3801
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:31,120
mushrooms

3802
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:32,879
into your grow media because i mean i'm

3803
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:34,960
sure we've all seen the odd mushroom

3804
02:20:32,879 --> 02:20:37,039
poppets head up throughout a flowering

3805
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:38,799
cycle when you flip the lights on what

3806
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:41,920
if it turns out you know you had some

3807
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:44,000
cubenses or something like that pop up

3808
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:45,600
well i mean i think then you would have

3809
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,520
the most awesome thing in the world

3810
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,280
happening you know because who who

3811
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:51,359
wouldn't want psychedelic mushrooms

3812
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:54,000
popping up underneath their their ganja

3813
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:55,439
i mean any any sane person would want

3814
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,239
that you know

3815
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:58,079
so

3816
02:20:56,239 --> 02:21:01,359
i i'm

3817
02:20:58,079 --> 02:21:03,680
i'm going to say that you know to say

3818
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:04,800
psychedelic mushrooms

3819
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,920
is

3820
02:21:04,799 --> 02:21:07,599
you know

3821
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:09,280
a little bit broad so you'd have to go a

3822
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:12,479
little bit deeper you'd say okay which

3823
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:15,840
ones do i want wood loving psychedelic

3824
02:21:12,478 --> 02:21:17,679
natural mushrooms like azure essence or

3825
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:18,540
cyanescence

3826
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,920
or um

3827
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:22,479
[Music]

3828
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:24,000
uh potent psilocybe which is already the

3829
02:21:22,478 --> 02:21:27,358
cyan essence but anyway those are wood

3830
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:30,239
loving so you you could inoculate

3831
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:32,800
um you could get wild

3832
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:36,398
and um spores and wild patches and

3833
02:21:32,799 --> 02:21:38,079
mycelium and and inoculate those in your

3834
02:21:36,398 --> 02:21:39,119
grow medium you would just have to be

3835
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:41,439
pretty

3836
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:42,880
you know intentional about giving it

3837
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:43,840
enough other

3838
02:21:42,879 --> 02:21:47,119
other

3839
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:48,880
um food to eat like so wood chips

3840
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:50,960
you know a lot of people are doing huge

3841
02:21:48,879 --> 02:21:52,409
culture and wood chips well that works

3842
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:53,839
really really good for

3843
02:21:52,409 --> 02:21:56,559
[Music]

3844
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:58,719
wood loving psychedelic mushrooms

3845
02:21:56,559 --> 02:22:00,318
so i think that's really really smart

3846
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:02,559
when it comes to

3847
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:04,639
um cubensis

3848
02:22:02,559 --> 02:22:08,959
that's gonna be more of

3849
02:22:04,639 --> 02:22:12,079
a manure loving mushroom so um a way

3850
02:22:08,959 --> 02:22:15,919
that a person could utilize a kubenzus

3851
02:22:12,079 --> 02:22:18,879
run would be to um you know make compost

3852
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:21,120
and sterilize your comp your compost

3853
02:22:18,879 --> 02:22:23,438
with you know through turning

3854
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:24,960
um the compost and then you know you'd

3855
02:22:23,439 --> 02:22:26,800
have to know

3856
02:22:24,959 --> 02:22:28,239
mushroom cultivation but you could

3857
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,279
inoculate

3858
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:33,119
a manure compost and put it on as a top

3859
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:37,280
dress to your plants

3860
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:39,120
and grow a flush of cubensis with your

3861
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:41,120
weed

3862
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:44,160
but cubens is really like super high

3863
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:46,000
humidity and and flowering cannabis

3864
02:22:44,159 --> 02:22:49,119
doesn't necessarily like super high

3865
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,120
humidity so that's

3866
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:51,840
that you true

3867
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,760
find there it would be like you would

3868
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:56,159
want to have your

3869
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:58,239
mushrooms flowering during vegetative

3870
02:22:56,159 --> 02:23:00,639
time and then be done the best way to do

3871
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:02,879
that before flowering two greenhouses

3872
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:04,559
one on one side which is a flower

3873
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:06,318
flushing um

3874
02:23:04,559 --> 02:23:09,840
mushrooms and that one on the other and

3875
02:23:06,318 --> 02:23:12,398
that would be pushing co2 air into the

3876
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:15,280
other greenhouse which was growing

3877
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:16,398
weed and that would be beautiful

3878
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:18,560
and so

3879
02:23:16,398 --> 02:23:20,799
what are some mushrooms be it

3880
02:23:18,559 --> 02:23:23,199
psychedelic or not that you would

3881
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:25,679
recommend people to try to incorporate

3882
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:27,439
into their life and ingest kind of

3883
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:30,398
regularly if possible

3884
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:33,120
all the medicinal mushrooms rishi chaga

3885
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:35,840
cordyceps aguerocon

3886
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:38,479
um turkey tail

3887
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:40,318
lion's mane it's a nootropic there's so

3888
02:23:38,478 --> 02:23:42,559
much damage that's going on within our

3889
02:23:40,318 --> 02:23:44,879
brains within wi-fi that we need to

3890
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:47,600
start introducing nootropic medicine

3891
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:49,119
which is the lion's mane um you know

3892
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:51,200
incorporating a lot of the different

3893
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:53,520
tree polypores because then it takes all

3894
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:55,280
of the intelligence from the tree and

3895
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:57,200
puts it into the polypore and then it

3896
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:59,520
makes it where you're actually getting

3897
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:00,399
direct tree medicine

3898
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,200
through

3899
02:24:00,398 --> 02:24:05,599
the the polypore so allying with

3900
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:08,240
mushrooms right now at this time of

3901
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:10,640
earth's toxicity is really important and

3902
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:13,359
then how do you utilize that in you know

3903
02:24:10,639 --> 02:24:14,799
in what mushrooms do you use in your

3904
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:16,559
cannabis grow

3905
02:24:14,799 --> 02:24:18,959
because a lot of ones she she mentioned

3906
02:24:16,559 --> 02:24:20,478
like chaga is not one that you can grow

3907
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:23,039
you know that's that's a wild mushroom

3908
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:23,840
that only grows on birch trees but

3909
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:27,680
um

3910
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:30,559
you know you can inoculate logs and use

3911
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:33,439
that as a as as a way of building your

3912
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:38,000
beds and you could have reishi or lion's

3913
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:41,040
mane or maitake logs making a raised bed

3914
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:44,079
and you can bury um lion's mane logs in

3915
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:46,880
the soils so there are ways of

3916
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:50,398
of building your soils with uh medicinal

3917
02:24:46,879 --> 02:24:52,639
mushrooms um through log spawn so people

3918
02:24:50,398 --> 02:24:54,079
can look up log spawn and find out more

3919
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:56,559
about that but that's and then also

3920
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:59,680
garden giants like ellie said is king's

3921
02:24:56,559 --> 02:25:00,478
tropharia or rugoso annulata

3922
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:03,280
and

3923
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:05,438
that's actually amazing compost eating

3924
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:08,000
mushroom and it's really useful in

3925
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:10,559
living soils and if you and if you can't

3926
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:14,239
grow it then find somebody who is

3927
02:25:10,559 --> 02:25:15,680
growing it you know in an organic um

3928
02:25:14,239 --> 02:25:16,959
cultivation

3929
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:20,079
because

3930
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:22,559
yeah ally medicinal mushrooms are are

3931
02:25:20,079 --> 02:25:25,280
really important and a lot of them you

3932
02:25:22,559 --> 02:25:27,519
can't grow you know like lion's mane

3933
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:29,439
it's something that would be difficult

3934
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,040
to to grow inside of your indoor

3935
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:33,280
cultivation of cannabis but you

3936
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:34,800
certainly can find it out in the woods

3937
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:36,640
or you can find somebody else that's

3938
02:25:34,799 --> 02:25:39,199
cultivating in it

3939
02:25:36,639 --> 02:25:41,439
in a respectful way um turkey tail is

3940
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:43,840
another one you can grow on the logs

3941
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,760
yeah and like agaricon is is almost

3942
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:48,159
impossible to get unless you're buying

3943
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,880
like the mycelium of somebody who is

3944
02:25:48,159 --> 02:25:53,280
cultivating the mycelium

3945
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:55,119
or reishi you know it's it's sometimes

3946
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:57,520
finicky depending on where you're

3947
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:59,680
growing it so

3948
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:01,840
i think we we think that it's okay to be

3949
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:02,800
sourcing it from other people that are

3950
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:06,398
growing

3951
02:26:02,799 --> 02:26:08,398
organic medicinal mushrooms as well

3952
02:26:06,398 --> 02:26:09,840
it's hard to spread yourself that thin

3953
02:26:08,398 --> 02:26:11,840
right

3954
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:14,719
i mean it's i think it's a crucial part

3955
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:17,040
of a really sweet like farm to have

3956
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:18,959
mushrooms growing on it so i you know

3957
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,280
we're all about you know people taking

3958
02:26:18,959 --> 02:26:22,239
it on oyster mushrooms i mean that can

3959
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:24,960
be

3960
02:26:22,239 --> 02:26:26,000
a huge easy thing to grow on your

3961
02:26:24,959 --> 02:26:27,599
property

3962
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,200
yeah definitely i think i'm probably

3963
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:30,159
going to go eat some after this there

3964
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:31,200
you go

3965
02:26:30,159 --> 02:26:33,439
so

3966
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,520
this is something i've been dying to ask

3967
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:38,800
you guys about for a while

3968
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:39,600
how do you feel about the rise of what i

3969
02:26:38,799 --> 02:26:42,799
call

3970
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:45,600
cbd everything so like you know cbd

3971
02:26:42,799 --> 02:26:48,000
burgers from in and out and cbd candy

3972
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:49,200
from the gas station is this a positive

3973
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,159
thing

3974
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:54,079
yeah we have cbd gas we just got for our

3975
02:26:52,159 --> 02:26:57,680
car it was incredible

3976
02:26:54,079 --> 02:26:59,520
the car really loved it um

3977
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:01,359
yeah well it's great because then more

3978
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:03,200
hemp is being farmed and there's more

3979
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:05,439
people cultivating it

3980
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:08,800
then the plant gets to come more out of

3981
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:11,040
her prohibition she gets to like make

3982
02:27:08,799 --> 02:27:12,318
make more of a scene you know into the

3983
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,920
world and

3984
02:27:12,318 --> 02:27:15,039
and more and more people are cultivating

3985
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:18,159
her and

3986
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:21,120
as more hemp is is being grown more land

3987
02:27:18,159 --> 02:27:22,799
is being remediated and that's a huge

3988
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:24,240
positive um

3989
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:26,639
on the earth so

3990
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:28,639
cbd everything hurrah then that also

3991
02:27:26,639 --> 02:27:30,159
means that people's cannabinoid

3992
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:32,799
receptors are going to start getting

3993
02:27:30,159 --> 02:27:34,719
flooded and that's wonderful too and

3994
02:27:32,799 --> 02:27:37,039
that's only going to help people become

3995
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:38,239
more healthy i mean it feels like you

3996
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:40,560
know

3997
02:27:38,239 --> 02:27:42,478
a phase and it feels like something

3998
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:44,639
that's

3999
02:27:42,478 --> 02:27:45,920
fad and it's kind of like

4000
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:47,199
you know maybe it makes you roll your

4001
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:49,439
eyes in a little bit but it's just kind

4002
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:51,439
of a testimony of just like

4003
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:54,318
create rules and everyone's just gonna

4004
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:56,479
exploit it on on all fronts so i mean

4005
02:27:54,318 --> 02:27:59,279
really the main teaching is

4006
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:02,559
you know to to think that cbd is like

4007
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:04,640
the be all endo compound is really

4008
02:28:02,559 --> 02:28:05,680
not true i mean so

4009
02:28:04,639 --> 02:28:08,799
it's just

4010
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:11,359
it doesn't have thc in it so it's a non

4011
02:28:08,799 --> 02:28:13,358
it's not intoxicant so people can put it

4012
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:17,760
in everything and i mean if people was

4013
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:20,559
putting a full spectrum

4014
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:22,398
extract in there instead of just cbd i

4015
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:24,799
mean that would be

4016
02:28:22,398 --> 02:28:26,799
awesome and i would love to go i would

4017
02:28:24,799 --> 02:28:28,159
love to have it in everything i eat

4018
02:28:26,799 --> 02:28:30,079
because really

4019
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:32,079
we that's why our we have an

4020
02:28:30,079 --> 02:28:33,039
endocannabinoid system is for it to be

4021
02:28:32,079 --> 02:28:35,680
fully

4022
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:37,439
saturated you know and having it in your

4023
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:39,520
foods and smoking in our ways of doing

4024
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:40,960
that so i think it could be really

4025
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:44,399
healthy and maybe

4026
02:28:40,959 --> 02:28:47,279
back in evolution hemp was fed to

4027
02:28:44,398 --> 02:28:49,119
animals and animals ate it in cbd and

4028
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:51,760
all the compounds were in the animal and

4029
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:54,640
then the people ate the animals and so i

4030
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:56,559
think that hemp and cannabinoids were

4031
02:28:54,639 --> 02:28:59,920
have been an essential part of our food

4032
02:28:56,559 --> 02:29:01,199
chain through evolution so really it's

4033
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:03,920
only

4034
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:06,479
respectful to our evolution that we have

4035
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:08,559
now cbd products and everything i just

4036
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:11,599
think that maybe we should demand more

4037
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:14,639
than just cbd

4038
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:17,520
of course and so how do you feel about

4039
02:29:14,639 --> 02:29:19,760
vape pens are they a necessary evil and

4040
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:22,560
given they do have generally speaking

4041
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:25,280
such a bland cannabinoid profile how do

4042
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:27,199
you think we can go about getting this

4043
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:28,479
what seems to be like a vital stepping

4044
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:30,479
stone between

4045
02:29:28,478 --> 02:29:33,119
the casual enthusiasts and the more

4046
02:29:30,478 --> 02:29:35,599
hardcore fans to incorporate a more

4047
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:37,439
holistic profile in it and really give

4048
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:40,239
people these medicinal benefits they're

4049
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:43,359
maybe not seeing otherwise

4050
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:45,359
yeah i mean you know the vape pen is

4051
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:48,479
kind of like

4052
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:51,280
the remote control like for the tv you

4053
02:29:48,478 --> 02:29:53,199
know like back when it then you it was

4054
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:55,520
just convenient you know it was just it

4055
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,600
didn't really matter you could still

4056
02:29:55,520 --> 02:30:01,120
you know do whatever you needed without

4057
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:03,520
it but the vape pen is just kind of like

4058
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:05,359
people want to drive around or travel to

4059
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,920
other countries and have a vape pen it's

4060
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:10,079
just it's like it's more of like

4061
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,840
a lifestyle thing

4062
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:13,920
you know nowadays i think the the thing

4063
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:15,840
that sucks about vape pens is that

4064
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:18,960
there's just such a such a

4065
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:18,960
these are fake

4066
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:28,478
but they're very convenient for people

4067
02:30:26,079 --> 02:30:31,600
and i think that's what people

4068
02:30:28,478 --> 02:30:34,000
also have you know depending a high

4069
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:36,079
so a high quality vape would be one that

4070
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,920
doesn't have weird residues on it

4071
02:30:36,079 --> 02:30:38,879
because of where it was manufactured in

4072
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,680
china

4073
02:30:38,879 --> 02:30:42,559
so

4074
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:46,000
vape pens can be toxic

4075
02:30:42,559 --> 02:30:47,279
to the consumer and also toxic to the

4076
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,639
environment because they're just

4077
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:51,520
disposable

4078
02:30:48,639 --> 02:30:54,959
so an ecologically minded person really

4079
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:57,520
doesn't love vape pens

4080
02:30:54,959 --> 02:31:00,478
that i guess that would be my answer

4081
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:02,960
or make sure that they're refillable and

4082
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:05,119
you know ones that

4083
02:31:02,959 --> 02:31:07,519
because like josh said

4084
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:10,160
i think steep hill just did a massive

4085
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:11,920
study a blind case study

4086
02:31:10,159 --> 02:31:15,200
of shopping and all the different

4087
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:16,760
dispensaries and they found that

4088
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:19,680
i don't know the percentage but an

4089
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:21,520
overwhelming percentage of the vape pens

4090
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:23,280
you know were just toxic in and of

4091
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:25,680
themselves because of the coil that was

4092
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,880
heating up so

4093
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:30,880
i think that we can do better i just i

4094
02:31:28,879 --> 02:31:34,318
think that you know with these beautiful

4095
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:36,559
extracts that can be made from flour

4096
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:39,600
i think that we can do better

4097
02:31:36,559 --> 02:31:41,279
and um you know refillable reusable ones

4098
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:44,479
that have glass

4099
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:46,399
um also people are maybe a hemp plastic

4100
02:31:44,478 --> 02:31:48,159
vape pen you know i mean

4101
02:31:46,398 --> 02:31:49,840
let's just hope that innovation can

4102
02:31:48,159 --> 02:31:51,119
catch up if we can get

4103
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:53,040
a good

4104
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:55,040
you know vaping unit that makes it

4105
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,880
there's there's maybe reasons why vaping

4106
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:59,280
makes sense you know it's less smoke and

4107
02:31:56,879 --> 02:32:01,119
it's less carbon and if you have a

4108
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:03,800
challenged lung i mean i'm not going to

4109
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:05,359
demonize anything i think we can be a

4110
02:32:03,799 --> 02:32:07,199
non-discriminatory

4111
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:09,920
non-discriminatory

4112
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:12,399
ganja ingestors i think you know it's a

4113
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:14,239
right place at the right time you know

4114
02:32:12,398 --> 02:32:16,159
what did rome do as the romans you know

4115
02:32:14,239 --> 02:32:17,840
i mean like you might have to smoke out

4116
02:32:16,159 --> 02:32:19,600
of a vape pen you know what i mean every

4117
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:21,120
once in a while

4118
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:22,479
but i'm not you know

4119
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,560
you know it's not going to be the

4120
02:32:22,478 --> 02:32:26,559
natural choice

4121
02:32:24,559 --> 02:32:28,318
of course

4122
02:32:26,559 --> 02:32:30,079
so one thing i wanted to bring up with

4123
02:32:28,318 --> 02:32:32,239
you guys before we jump on to some of

4124
02:32:30,079 --> 02:32:34,398
our fans suggested questions was this

4125
02:32:32,239 --> 02:32:35,199
idea of the green renaissance i know

4126
02:32:34,398 --> 02:32:37,439
that

4127
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:39,680
julie and the good folk over at skunk

4128
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:41,439
magazine have been pushing this idea

4129
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:42,559
hard and you guys are well on board with

4130
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:45,359
it too

4131
02:32:42,559 --> 02:32:47,359
what kind of stimulated you to push and

4132
02:32:45,359 --> 02:32:49,680
put your backing behind this idea of the

4133
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:52,000
green renaissance

4134
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:54,159
well i just think that it's kind of what

4135
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,719
makes sense it's what's natural you know

4136
02:32:54,159 --> 02:32:57,920
we like like julia stated it's you know

4137
02:32:56,719 --> 02:33:00,398
it's it's

4138
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:03,520
not a rush you know it's more of an

4139
02:33:00,398 --> 02:33:05,199
awakening it's more of a re awakening

4140
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:06,479
and a um

4141
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:08,800
you know something

4142
02:33:06,478 --> 02:33:11,840
that's more long-lasting and it kind of

4143
02:33:08,799 --> 02:33:15,119
has an essence to it so you know it just

4144
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:17,920
it feels good to to think of it as

4145
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:20,399
you know something that's emerging and

4146
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:22,559
and you know a lot of people talk about

4147
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:25,119
you you know kids don't want to be

4148
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:26,398
farmers anymore and and indigenous

4149
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:27,439
cultures and different places in the

4150
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:29,039
world but

4151
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:31,439
actually a lot of kids do want to be

4152
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:33,200
farmers thanks to weed you know and i

4153
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:35,040
mean as long as the governments don't

4154
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:37,920
[ __ ] it up too much you know we might be

4155
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:40,160
able to you know have a lot of young

4156
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:41,840
amazing farmers that want to grow you

4157
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:43,760
know because we get people that are

4158
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:46,000
young all the time that be like you know

4159
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:49,439
the greatest dream on earth would be to

4160
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,760
have their own farm so

4161
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:54,559
um i think that you know there's just a

4162
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:57,040
lot of ways to look at things

4163
02:33:54,559 --> 02:33:59,439
of course so we might slide into some of

4164
02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:01,359
the fan suggested questions

4165
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:03,920
these are in no

4166
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:05,840
particular order or rank but the first

4167
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:07,760
one i've written down what are some

4168
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:10,079
inputs that people can easily grow for

4169
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:12,159
themselves on a small scale that would

4170
02:34:10,079 --> 02:34:15,359
be beneficial to both their gardens and

4171
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:15,359
possibly even their body

4172
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:22,479
nettle comfrey um alfalfa is awesome

4173
02:34:20,159 --> 02:34:24,239
super easy to grow you can cut alfalfa

4174
02:34:22,478 --> 02:34:27,199
so many times in a year and it just

4175
02:34:24,239 --> 02:34:29,520
keeps coming up same with comfrey those

4176
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:32,000
are all really easy things to grow

4177
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:34,079
edible flowers are really great to grow

4178
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,799
you know they contain

4179
02:34:34,079 --> 02:34:39,039
you know terpenes and and they're nice

4180
02:34:36,799 --> 02:34:40,639
for our own bodies

4181
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:42,960
and i think you know lots of different

4182
02:34:40,639 --> 02:34:44,559
diversity um

4183
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:46,398
is is great

4184
02:34:44,559 --> 02:34:49,680
but those are the four that are really

4185
02:34:46,398 --> 02:34:52,239
easy to grow and anyone can do it i mean

4186
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:54,159
you can grow yarrow you know there's

4187
02:34:52,239 --> 02:34:55,199
there's a lot of different

4188
02:34:54,159 --> 02:34:57,280
um

4189
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:59,760
foliar sprays that you can i mean if you

4190
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:01,920
can grow ginger and garlic i mean really

4191
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:03,520
i think this is what you should grow as

4192
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:05,280
much as you can

4193
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:07,600
like what the how about this what can

4194
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:09,040
you grow grow that

4195
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:12,239
because really

4196
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:14,000
it's it's not just like choosing one

4197
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:15,359
thing you know there's it's there's a

4198
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,200
world out out there we're on the

4199
02:35:15,359 --> 02:35:19,120
internet right there anyone lives

4200
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:21,359
wherever they live they could be in sao

4201
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:23,359
paulo brazil right now and 20 million

4202
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:25,280
people around them and what can they

4203
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:26,880
grow they can just grow simple cover

4204
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:29,600
crops

4205
02:35:26,879 --> 02:35:32,239
and pots and then just take the cover

4206
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:34,720
crop and cut it and make a fermented

4207
02:35:32,239 --> 02:35:36,398
plant juice out of it and they can water

4208
02:35:34,719 --> 02:35:38,000
all their plants you know in their house

4209
02:35:36,398 --> 02:35:40,239
from that um

4210
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:43,200
you know there's there's so many things

4211
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:46,639
you can grow and i think it's just

4212
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:48,640
explore botany you know understand

4213
02:35:46,639 --> 02:35:50,559
kinship gardening and the evolution of

4214
02:35:48,639 --> 02:35:52,318
plants and just try and grow as much as

4215
02:35:50,559 --> 02:35:54,559
if you can grow a moringa tree that

4216
02:35:52,318 --> 02:35:55,760
would be awesome because you could just

4217
02:35:54,559 --> 02:35:58,559
sit there and

4218
02:35:55,760 --> 02:36:00,239
cut the moringa tree back all day and

4219
02:35:58,559 --> 02:36:01,920
another thing people can grow as

4220
02:36:00,239 --> 02:36:03,520
spirulina

4221
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,439
i mean you can grow

4222
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,120
algae and you're in an aquarium in your

4223
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:08,800
house and that's something that's really

4224
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:11,760
healthy for you

4225
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:13,840
and it's also good for your garden so

4226
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:16,880
and you can grow deciduous trees because

4227
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:19,359
leaves are really amazing uh leaf mold

4228
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:20,719
is is so beautiful for soils and that's

4229
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:23,600
something that can be collected every

4230
02:36:20,719 --> 02:36:26,318
fall and it offers great oxygen around

4231
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,479
your property so growing fruit trees

4232
02:36:26,318 --> 02:36:29,279
also you can use fruit

4233
02:36:28,478 --> 02:36:30,079
there's

4234
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:32,560
yeah

4235
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:35,280
really the sky is the limit just what

4236
02:36:32,559 --> 02:36:37,439
what grows well in your zone and area

4237
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:39,520
that you feel like you can take on that

4238
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:41,520
makes it really easy that then will make

4239
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:43,120
you more curious to want to grow more

4240
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:45,280
things

4241
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:47,680
and there's lots of plants with known

4242
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:50,960
high biomass so those that look for

4243
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:53,120
plants high in biomass

4244
02:36:50,959 --> 02:36:55,119
definitely spirulina is definitely one

4245
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:57,600
that's been on my radar for a minute now

4246
02:36:55,120 --> 02:37:00,240
and it ties into this next question of

4247
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:02,079
what is a good place to start in regards

4248
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:04,478
to bringing what would be considered a

4249
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:06,000
very nutrient deficient soil back to

4250
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:07,760
life what are some of the ingredients

4251
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:10,398
you would first and foremost be looking

4252
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:11,280
to incorporate

4253
02:37:10,398 --> 02:37:13,279
um

4254
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:14,640
well

4255
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:16,960
life

4256
02:37:14,639 --> 02:37:19,039
so you know you could plant cover crops

4257
02:37:16,959 --> 02:37:21,599
on it

4258
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:24,160
and turn that in and that would be the a

4259
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:26,960
really fast simple way

4260
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:30,478
go to the forest and find some

4261
02:37:26,959 --> 02:37:32,879
area that is living and

4262
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:36,318
really healthy you can bring that back

4263
02:37:32,879 --> 02:37:38,879
i would look maybe to worm castings or

4264
02:37:36,318 --> 02:37:42,159
some kind of compost or

4265
02:37:38,879 --> 02:37:44,079
um composted manure or some kind of

4266
02:37:42,159 --> 02:37:47,200
animal healthy

4267
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:49,760
animal place that's near you

4268
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:52,399
maybe someone has alpacas or

4269
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:54,559
llamas or something or rabbits

4270
02:37:52,398 --> 02:37:56,639
and you can get some good pigeons i mean

4271
02:37:54,559 --> 02:37:57,840
you can get some pigeon poop and

4272
02:37:56,639 --> 02:37:58,879
chickens

4273
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:00,159
something like that you don't want to

4274
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:02,079
overdo it with that kind of stuff

4275
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:04,559
because it can be hot but if you're

4276
02:38:02,079 --> 02:38:07,520
trying to get quick life back in there

4277
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:09,439
you know animal manures when when it's

4278
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:11,520
coming from a healthy source is a really

4279
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:13,600
good way of doing it or worm castings

4280
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:16,000
and and one of the most immediate ways

4281
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:18,399
that people in suburban areas is just

4282
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,478
always keeping nice compost going and

4283
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:24,799
having worms in it so that you always

4284
02:38:20,478 --> 02:38:27,039
have good accessible inoculant biology

4285
02:38:24,799 --> 02:38:29,679
soil to put on top of any of your plants

4286
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:31,920
at any time so just using your kitchen

4287
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,760
scraps and then that makes people more

4288
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:35,920
knowledgeable about hey maybe i want to

4289
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:38,478
grow organic food because then that's

4290
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:40,000
going into my compost pile which my

4291
02:38:38,478 --> 02:38:42,879
worms are eating which is then going to

4292
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,120
go into my cannabis and and put bokashi

4293
02:38:42,879 --> 02:38:47,279
and you know bokashi and when your food

4294
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:49,359
scrap so your food scraps are already

4295
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:51,840
pre-digested when they when they go on

4296
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:53,520
the worm farm you know

4297
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:55,040
at one point you're just playing you

4298
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:56,800
know what i mean

4299
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,920
yeah okay

4300
02:38:56,799 --> 02:38:59,840
so

4301
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:02,159
the next question i have i'm honestly

4302
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,079
not too sure about the context of so i'm

4303
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:05,680
just hoping you guys kind of understand

4304
02:39:04,079 --> 02:39:06,559
it better than what i do but someone

4305
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:09,600
said

4306
02:39:06,559 --> 02:39:10,639
how do you feel about the flowcanna

4307
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,640
slash

4308
02:39:10,639 --> 02:39:15,519
other sellouts

4309
02:39:12,639 --> 02:39:17,920
um and how all of the regenerative

4310
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:20,880
cannabis farming award recipients get

4311
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:23,359
lumped into this same group

4312
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:26,000
well i mean

4313
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:28,318
to say that the regenerative farm award

4314
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,799
winners got lumped into a group is just

4315
02:39:28,318 --> 02:39:33,039
it's not it's not like it wasn't

4316
02:39:30,799 --> 02:39:34,398
premeditated by any means it would what

4317
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:37,520
it was was

4318
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:39,760
flocano was wanting to work with really

4319
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:42,159
intentional conscious farmers in

4320
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:44,318
northern california and when you win the

4321
02:39:42,159 --> 02:39:45,760
farm award you just get to be known and

4322
02:39:44,318 --> 02:39:48,159
people are like hey i want to get your

4323
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:50,398
product so i mean i think it was just

4324
02:39:48,159 --> 02:39:52,159
uh you know it's just kind of a natural

4325
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:54,159
thing you know

4326
02:39:52,159 --> 02:39:55,760
what the pro i think here's the i think

4327
02:39:54,159 --> 02:39:58,000
what the problem is

4328
02:39:55,760 --> 02:40:02,318
is that

4329
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:04,959
when companies get really really huge

4330
02:40:02,318 --> 02:40:08,159
they start taking investment from other

4331
02:40:04,959 --> 02:40:11,119
companies and with flocana they just got

4332
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:13,279
really huge and they took investment

4333
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:16,079
from companies

4334
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:18,159
that are not in line with regenerative

4335
02:40:16,079 --> 02:40:21,680
practices so it put

4336
02:40:18,159 --> 02:40:24,318
it's starting it started to put

4337
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:26,559
an ethical question in with the farmers

4338
02:40:24,318 --> 02:40:29,278
so you know what they're you know what

4339
02:40:26,559 --> 02:40:31,278
you want them to to be doing a good

4340
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:32,720
thing but when they're taking investment

4341
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:36,000
from companies

4342
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:38,959
you know that are connected to marlboro

4343
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,719
or altria or companies that are you know

4344
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:42,639
harmful to the earth

4345
02:40:40,719 --> 02:40:45,119
you just have to

4346
02:40:42,639 --> 02:40:48,239
it's it's really hard to navigate you

4347
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:50,240
know that territory so people are torn i

4348
02:40:48,239 --> 02:40:52,799
would just say in the community right

4349
02:40:50,239 --> 02:40:54,559
now you know on on that subject right

4350
02:40:52,799 --> 02:40:56,559
now because of those

4351
02:40:54,559 --> 02:40:57,359
because of those principles

4352
02:40:56,559 --> 02:40:59,840
and

4353
02:40:57,359 --> 02:41:02,479
and it's really important to say that

4354
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:03,760
you know there are there are you know

4355
02:41:02,478 --> 02:41:06,799
new

4356
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:09,120
horizons that uh cannabis farmers

4357
02:41:06,799 --> 02:41:10,879
haven't thought about before you know

4358
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:12,640
when cannabis farmers are signing

4359
02:41:10,879 --> 02:41:14,879
contracts that's why we were saying it's

4360
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:17,680
so important to only sign protracts

4361
02:41:14,879 --> 02:41:19,839
right now because and and we can use

4362
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:22,398
this as an example you know when when

4363
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:24,398
farmers are signing contracts they

4364
02:41:22,398 --> 02:41:26,239
weren't necessarily thinking about well

4365
02:41:24,398 --> 02:41:28,799
geez this company could sell out to

4366
02:41:26,239 --> 02:41:32,398
something else and then where is my ip

4367
02:41:28,799 --> 02:41:34,239
and and where is is is my sops you know

4368
02:41:32,398 --> 02:41:37,199
within that or what is the name where is

4369
02:41:34,239 --> 02:41:40,079
my branding of my own farm so it just is

4370
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:43,359
really giving us the ability to

4371
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:45,840
become more intelligent and more savvy

4372
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:48,399
with the corporate cannabis world and i

4373
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:51,200
think the more that we see you know

4374
02:41:48,398 --> 02:41:53,599
what corporate cannabis um you know is

4375
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:56,079
capable of is the more that we need to

4376
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:58,479
come up with smarter alternatives but

4377
02:41:56,079 --> 02:42:01,200
you know with the floccana thing they

4378
02:41:58,478 --> 02:42:03,438
have really beautiful farms that are

4379
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:05,840
working with them and they have not

4380
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:07,359
changed and how they're cultivating and

4381
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:09,600
they haven't you know they're still

4382
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:12,318
growing regenerative and they're still

4383
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:14,559
you know creating wonderful education

4384
02:42:12,318 --> 02:42:16,559
within community and there and everybody

4385
02:42:14,559 --> 02:42:19,439
is really wonderful it's just

4386
02:42:16,559 --> 02:42:23,039
we're being caught in a corporate

4387
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:25,760
riffraff that as cannabis farmers we are

4388
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:27,520
new to and we need to become more savvy

4389
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:29,279
it's similar to what happened with filos

4390
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:32,479
too i mean they started joining forces

4391
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:34,640
with syngenta and monsanto and

4392
02:42:32,478 --> 02:42:36,559
and dow chemicals and all these things

4393
02:42:34,639 --> 02:42:37,358
that's just when you start getting you

4394
02:42:36,559 --> 02:42:39,439
know

4395
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:41,600
that that much investment you start

4396
02:42:39,439 --> 02:42:44,318
having to like what you'd say sell your

4397
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:45,760
soul you know to to the monster and

4398
02:42:44,318 --> 02:42:46,639
that's why we were just saying we want

4399
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:48,398
to

4400
02:42:46,639 --> 02:42:51,119
be independent of that and we don't want

4401
02:42:48,398 --> 02:42:52,799
to be swallowed by corporations

4402
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:55,279
that's just you know it's

4403
02:42:52,799 --> 02:43:00,318
new it's new territory we we have to be

4404
02:42:55,279 --> 02:43:02,479
um dolphin pods in an ocean of sharks

4405
02:43:00,318 --> 02:43:03,278
yeah great analogy

4406
02:43:02,478 --> 02:43:04,879
so

4407
02:43:03,279 --> 02:43:07,680
where do you hope to see the craft

4408
02:43:04,879 --> 02:43:09,759
cannabis market in 10 years from now and

4409
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,920
how do you think big ag will factor into

4410
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:15,200
this picture

4411
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:17,600
well i think big ag can just folly

4412
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:20,240
around with the idea that they can

4413
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:22,559
cultivate cannabis in a way that's you

4414
02:43:20,239 --> 02:43:24,318
know better for people i think it's just

4415
02:43:22,559 --> 02:43:27,920
gonna be

4416
02:43:24,318 --> 02:43:30,398
funny to watch them you know

4417
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:33,279
fall on themselves over and over and i

4418
02:43:30,398 --> 02:43:34,239
had to be like whatever on that front i

4419
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:36,560
think

4420
02:43:34,239 --> 02:43:38,239
um craft whether it's you know when

4421
02:43:36,559 --> 02:43:39,519
someone says the word craft cannabis i

4422
02:43:38,239 --> 02:43:42,239
mean you would ha

4423
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:44,319
to me i'm like does that mean organic or

4424
02:43:42,239 --> 02:43:46,719
regenerative so it's not descriptive

4425
02:43:44,318 --> 02:43:49,439
enough and so just because they're small

4426
02:43:46,719 --> 02:43:51,679
doesn't necessarily make them good so

4427
02:43:49,439 --> 02:43:53,600
if if it's crafting it better i would

4428
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:55,840
hope that it's already regenerative or

4429
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:57,760
you know i i use the word regenerative

4430
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:59,920
instead of organic because

4431
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:01,439
we want you know you know more than

4432
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:03,279
organic so

4433
02:44:01,439 --> 02:44:04,559
and in the future what i would like to

4434
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:06,319
see is

4435
02:44:04,559 --> 02:44:09,199
a really huge

4436
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:10,318
value for consciously cultivated

4437
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:12,399
cannabis

4438
02:44:10,318 --> 02:44:14,239
what i would like what i i'm assuming

4439
02:44:12,398 --> 02:44:16,239
that it's going to be like

4440
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:18,799
safeway or some kind of large

4441
02:44:16,239 --> 02:44:22,159
supermarket chains selling food all over

4442
02:44:18,799 --> 02:44:25,199
the place but the farmers market in any

4443
02:44:22,159 --> 02:44:27,279
town is always gonna have better food i

4444
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:30,159
think that there's gonna be

4445
02:44:27,279 --> 02:44:31,600
like micro brews or more valuable or

4446
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:34,559
something like that i think that you

4447
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:37,120
know consciously cultivated small farms

4448
02:44:34,559 --> 02:44:39,439
that have better strains and a better

4449
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:41,680
story i'd like to see that that be a

4450
02:44:39,439 --> 02:44:42,559
really well defined

4451
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:44,720
um

4452
02:44:42,559 --> 02:44:47,039
you know market to where people are

4453
02:44:44,719 --> 02:44:49,519
really well educated on what corporate

4454
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:51,760
cannabis looks like and what potentially

4455
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,840
regenerative craft cannabis looks like

4456
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:56,800
and i think that you know it's really

4457
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:59,439
easy to green wash and it's super easy

4458
02:44:56,799 --> 02:45:01,199
to green wash the term craft

4459
02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:03,359
so just because they're small are they

4460
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:05,840
using the same synthetic nutrients that

4461
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:07,200
big corporate cannabis is using

4462
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:10,079
it definitely needs to be more

4463
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:12,560
definitive and you know what we want to

4464
02:45:10,079 --> 02:45:14,639
see in 10 years from now in the cannabis

4465
02:45:12,559 --> 02:45:17,439
industry is

4466
02:45:14,639 --> 02:45:19,358
much more conscious cultivation

4467
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:21,760
because the earth needs it

4468
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:23,840
we need it as it's you know as its

4469
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:27,520
consumer and the plant really deserves

4470
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:29,439
it for um you know healing us for you

4471
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:30,640
know so many years since the beginning

4472
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:32,398
of humanity

4473
02:45:30,639 --> 02:45:34,478
and i'd like to see

4474
02:45:32,398 --> 02:45:37,119
processors and really conscious food

4475
02:45:34,478 --> 02:45:39,438
companies and which we are seeing so you

4476
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:40,399
know what we're seeing is the beginning

4477
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:42,639
of

4478
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:45,358
conscious commerce i mean

4479
02:45:42,639 --> 02:45:47,199
a company that wants to make

4480
02:45:45,359 --> 02:45:49,920
a cannabis product

4481
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:52,240
has to source their products

4482
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:54,159
if they go to source their products and

4483
02:45:52,239 --> 02:45:56,079
they come across the peer certification

4484
02:45:54,159 --> 02:45:58,398
and pure farms i mean it's kind of a

4485
02:45:56,079 --> 02:46:01,039
no-brainer i mean of course they want

4486
02:45:58,398 --> 02:46:03,039
that so i would i would i i'm seeing a

4487
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:04,319
high value

4488
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:06,880
for

4489
02:46:04,318 --> 02:46:08,639
consciously cultivated products and i i

4490
02:46:06,879 --> 02:46:10,639
guess we can just leave it there

4491
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:12,559
i think that's going to grow it does

4492
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:14,079
grow that's why natural food stores are

4493
02:46:12,559 --> 02:46:15,920
growing that's why

4494
02:46:14,079 --> 02:46:18,959
the whole movement is growing because

4495
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:20,879
people want they're tired of being sick

4496
02:46:18,959 --> 02:46:22,639
and the system incorporation is just

4497
02:46:20,879 --> 02:46:24,879
constantly making us sick everywhere and

4498
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:27,119
it's just it's not cool and that's why

4499
02:46:24,879 --> 02:46:29,839
cbd is so popular because it all of a

4500
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:32,640
sudden is offering an alternative it's

4501
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:34,639
giving us a little bit of a gauge on

4502
02:46:32,639 --> 02:46:36,959
what's happening with humanity and

4503
02:46:34,639 --> 02:46:39,840
what's happening with society right now

4504
02:46:36,959 --> 02:46:41,759
is that people are you know

4505
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:44,000
feeling disenfranchised and

4506
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:46,800
disillusioned from

4507
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:49,040
big pharma and big ag we're learning how

4508
02:46:46,799 --> 02:46:51,039
to do it better and

4509
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:53,439
heck if if it's going to be cannabis

4510
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:55,520
that leads the way that's going to give

4511
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:58,000
people you know more knowledge of ways

4512
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:59,200
to do it better then that's freaking

4513
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,959
awesome

4514
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:03,680
so you know a lot of people are saying

4515
02:47:00,959 --> 02:47:05,438
oh cbd this cbd that well

4516
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:07,840
that's definitely a gauge on what

4517
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:09,760
society is wanting and that's outside of

4518
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:11,120
the pharmaceutical world right now and

4519
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:12,960
to me that's

4520
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:13,920
awesome

4521
02:47:12,959 --> 02:47:16,478
so

4522
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:18,960
given the success of the dragonfire of

4523
02:47:16,478 --> 02:47:21,840
the dragonfly brand in regards to

4524
02:47:18,959 --> 02:47:24,398
cultivating sustainable cannabis do you

4525
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:27,200
have any plans or interests to become

4526
02:47:24,398 --> 02:47:29,680
involved in say large-scale production

4527
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:29,680
of hemp

4528
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:35,600
uh well what we're definitely

4529
02:47:32,719 --> 02:47:38,799
interested in

4530
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:41,680
hemp production and um you know how

4531
02:47:38,799 --> 02:47:43,759
large can it be is basically what we're

4532
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:45,359
looking at this year you know i mean

4533
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:48,159
this is a year when we're deciding

4534
02:47:45,359 --> 02:47:50,479
whether feminized seed hemp growing is

4535
02:47:48,159 --> 02:47:52,879
something that we certify

4536
02:47:50,478 --> 02:47:56,398
uh we're deciding on you know can there

4537
02:47:52,879 --> 02:47:59,199
be a a hundred or a four hundred acre

4538
02:47:56,398 --> 02:48:00,398
hemp farm you know can a 400 acre hemp

4539
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:02,560
farm be

4540
02:48:00,398 --> 02:48:04,478
pure certified or regenerative we don't

4541
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:06,559
have that right now and they would have

4542
02:48:04,478 --> 02:48:07,278
to really stand out and have some kind

4543
02:48:06,559 --> 02:48:09,199
of

4544
02:48:07,279 --> 02:48:12,079
really thought out you know crop

4545
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:13,920
rotations or something happening but um

4546
02:48:12,079 --> 02:48:17,680
we're having those discussions now

4547
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:19,600
really big time within our group as to

4548
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:21,840
you know people are saying oh you know

4549
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:24,000
is it scalable well it's really

4550
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:26,000
interesting because we utilize the term

4551
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:29,040
scalable and big ag

4552
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:31,840
and is is scalable the way that we've

4553
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:32,960
been doing it successful and the answer

4554
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:34,639
is no

4555
02:48:32,959 --> 02:48:37,039
so we need to

4556
02:48:34,639 --> 02:48:39,358
understand what is scalable for

4557
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:41,200
regenerative agriculture period not

4558
02:48:39,359 --> 02:48:44,239
necessarily what's scalable for

4559
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:47,359
regenerative hemp even but just what's

4560
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:49,920
scalable so you know what we see in

4561
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:51,359
saving the earth is you know a ton of

4562
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:53,920
small farms

4563
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:56,479
small farmers are what is going to save

4564
02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:58,960
the earth right now and that absolutely

4565
02:48:56,478 --> 02:49:00,719
goes and to have farming

4566
02:48:58,959 --> 02:49:02,478
if there's big corporate hemp that's

4567
02:49:00,719 --> 02:49:04,639
going to come in and they're going to be

4568
02:49:02,478 --> 02:49:06,159
you know producing 50 million acres of

4569
02:49:04,639 --> 02:49:07,439
hemp which is what's going on over in

4570
02:49:06,159 --> 02:49:09,760
china right now

4571
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:10,639
can they do that regeneratively

4572
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,920
you know

4573
02:49:10,639 --> 02:49:14,639
we don't really believe that that's

4574
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:16,000
possible we need to bring back the small

4575
02:49:14,639 --> 02:49:18,398
farmers

4576
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:20,719
but at the same time there's a lot of

4577
02:49:18,398 --> 02:49:23,278
hemp that's overtaking

4578
02:49:20,719 --> 02:49:25,599
other crops in the field which is a good

4579
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:26,880
thing so

4580
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:29,359
large-scale

4581
02:49:26,879 --> 02:49:30,799
hemp farmers might be um

4582
02:49:29,359 --> 02:49:32,479
taking out

4583
02:49:30,799 --> 02:49:35,039
a farmer might be growing that instead

4584
02:49:32,478 --> 02:49:38,079
of something else which they would spray

4585
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:40,880
so you know hemp could be you know

4586
02:49:38,079 --> 02:49:43,520
is going to be something that's going to

4587
02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:46,000
save you know agriculture i think in a

4588
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:46,000
lot of ways

4589
02:49:46,318 --> 02:49:49,439
very much so

4590
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:52,478
so

4591
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:53,840
this is related specifically to your

4592
02:49:52,478 --> 02:49:56,559
i'm going gonna have to clarify this and

4593
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:58,239
re-ask the question do you pronounce it

4594
02:49:56,559 --> 02:49:59,680
pagodas

4595
02:49:58,239 --> 02:50:01,520
well we have so many different

4596
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:02,960
structures on our property we actually

4597
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:06,000
have a couple of structures that look

4598
02:50:02,959 --> 02:50:09,358
like a pagoda and josh is an amazing

4599
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:12,079
builder and he uh always takes on a

4600
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:14,559
project with like amazing

4601
02:50:12,079 --> 02:50:16,799
creativity so every one of our

4602
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:19,278
greenhouses you know that's been hand

4603
02:50:16,799 --> 02:50:21,599
built by us is just really beautiful it

4604
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:24,239
has a style of its own

4605
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:26,079
because we want to remain creative and

4606
02:50:24,239 --> 02:50:28,000
keep the juices flowing for us too if

4607
02:50:26,079 --> 02:50:29,920
we're building you know

4608
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:32,159
10 of the same greenhouses it's sort of

4609
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,079
boring so we're always trying to keep

4610
02:50:32,159 --> 02:50:36,398
style and beauty

4611
02:50:34,079 --> 02:50:38,318
involved on our farm

4612
02:50:36,398 --> 02:50:40,959
of course of course i love that home

4613
02:50:38,318 --> 02:50:43,760
kind of feel they must all have and so

4614
02:50:40,959 --> 02:50:46,398
just in regards to the various types of

4615
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:49,439
structures you guys have how does it

4616
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:51,519
compare having one on say a hillside

4617
02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:54,479
versus on a flat surface like does the

4618
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:56,239
gradient change the dynamics of it and

4619
02:50:54,478 --> 02:50:58,318
specifically this person wanted to know

4620
02:50:56,239 --> 02:51:00,719
is airflow problematic when you're on

4621
02:50:58,318 --> 02:51:03,359
the side of the hill

4622
02:51:00,719 --> 02:51:04,559
well um for us we have a really

4623
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:07,840
beautiful

4624
02:51:04,559 --> 02:51:09,359
airflow that comes through off our leg

4625
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:11,600
and

4626
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:13,279
and our

4627
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:16,640
so

4628
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:18,640
a hill is really nice to have because

4629
02:51:16,639 --> 02:51:19,599
it creates natural airflow in the

4630
02:51:18,639 --> 02:51:21,599
morning

4631
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:23,840
the heat is rising

4632
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:25,200
in our valley and the air is always

4633
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:27,920
going up

4634
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:30,319
and in the evening it's going down

4635
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:32,398
because the air is cooling off so we get

4636
02:51:30,318 --> 02:51:35,278
a lot of really good

4637
02:51:32,398 --> 02:51:37,519
you know airflow and i i prefer to have

4638
02:51:35,279 --> 02:51:39,840
a slope to grow on really because if you

4639
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:42,000
have a water source above you then you

4640
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:43,359
can gravity feed everything down and

4641
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:45,439
it's kind of

4642
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:46,800
you know it's a natural way of

4643
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:49,120
collecting

4644
02:51:46,799 --> 02:51:51,039
you know you can create different zones

4645
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:53,760
and environments really easy by

4646
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:55,439
terracing so by going to asia you know

4647
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:58,079
all these years and even guatemala and

4648
02:51:55,439 --> 02:51:59,439
central america terracing you know is

4649
02:51:58,079 --> 02:52:00,799
something that really just caught our

4650
02:51:59,439 --> 02:52:03,120
eye and we're just like oh my god

4651
02:52:00,799 --> 02:52:05,039
terracing's so beautiful and so we've

4652
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:06,880
made really big terraces on our land and

4653
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:08,000
what it does is just naturally makes an

4654
02:52:06,879 --> 02:52:10,239
environment

4655
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:12,398
and then each environment can grow kind

4656
02:52:10,239 --> 02:52:16,159
of a different thing so

4657
02:52:12,398 --> 02:52:19,199
um a flat a flat surface is hard to work

4658
02:52:16,159 --> 02:52:22,719
with you know it's a lot more exposed

4659
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:26,000
um you have to you know really use trees

4660
02:52:22,719 --> 02:52:28,959
i think a lot more for flat surfaces to

4661
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:30,639
create environments and and food for us

4662
02:52:28,959 --> 02:52:33,679
and stuff like that so

4663
02:52:30,639 --> 02:52:36,079
our slope you know makes makes helps us

4664
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:37,439
out a lot

4665
02:52:36,079 --> 02:52:39,680
of course

4666
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:42,960
and we build our greenhouses

4667
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:45,920
to have a flow-through design for air so

4668
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:48,559
we don't have any um fans in any of our

4669
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:50,960
greenhouses and the way that we utilize

4670
02:52:48,559 --> 02:52:51,920
them is more of like a roof or an area

4671
02:52:50,959 --> 02:52:54,478
to where

4672
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:57,840
it's um there's a flow-through design so

4673
02:52:54,478 --> 02:52:59,519
there's no stagnant energy anywhere

4674
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:01,680
yep

4675
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:03,920
so we've kind of touched on this before

4676
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:05,600
but it's a bit of a specific question so

4677
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:07,600
i'll throw it out there maybe we'll get

4678
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:09,040
a specific answer to this specific

4679
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:11,520
question but

4680
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:13,840
if you were to get a plant from whatever

4681
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:16,159
source it may be a friend just maybe

4682
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:18,159
it's just had a bit of a unlucky run

4683
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:20,719
with things let's just say it's really

4684
02:53:18,159 --> 02:53:23,039
quite sick and it's not doing too well

4685
02:53:20,719 --> 02:53:25,679
what would be your protocol for getting

4686
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:29,520
this out of that heavy shocked state and

4687
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:31,600
back up and alive and boosted

4688
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:32,560
first of all separate it from the rest

4689
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:34,559
of your

4690
02:53:32,559 --> 02:53:36,478
your plants that's the first thing that

4691
02:53:34,559 --> 02:53:38,159
you want to do so many people feel like

4692
02:53:36,478 --> 02:53:40,318
oh well just bring it in with my other

4693
02:53:38,159 --> 02:53:42,398
plants and into my environment

4694
02:53:40,318 --> 02:53:45,199
where my other plants are healthy

4695
02:53:42,398 --> 02:53:46,719
because pathogens um you know are so

4696
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:48,720
prevalent right now

4697
02:53:46,719 --> 02:53:51,039
and a lot of them you can't see with a

4698
02:53:48,719 --> 02:53:53,438
naked eye like say a broad mite

4699
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:56,160
and arrested is even hard to see even

4700
02:53:53,439 --> 02:53:58,079
though you can but you know isolating it

4701
02:53:56,159 --> 02:54:01,200
and then just putting it in a really

4702
02:53:58,079 --> 02:54:02,879
beautiful soil immediately and just

4703
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:06,079
giving it teas

4704
02:54:02,879 --> 02:54:08,159
i always feel like earthworm casting tea

4705
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:10,000
is the same as chicken soup

4706
02:54:08,159 --> 02:54:13,119
if you want to bring a plant back to

4707
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:16,398
life just feed it earthworm casting tea

4708
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:18,399
because it's easy it's absorbable it has

4709
02:54:16,398 --> 02:54:21,199
all of the nutrients and it's really

4710
02:54:18,398 --> 02:54:24,159
basic and easy for a plant to uptake

4711
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:27,359
because just like when we get sick

4712
02:54:24,159 --> 02:54:29,520
it's difficult for us to uptake things

4713
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:31,680
because our immune response is low our

4714
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:34,399
microbiology is low

4715
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:35,920
you know things are not uh responding so

4716
02:54:34,398 --> 02:54:38,079
easily so

4717
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:39,920
that's a lot of biology and if you can

4718
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:41,039
have it outside and have it get rained

4719
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:43,120
on or

4720
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:44,720
you know if you can you know use the

4721
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:46,160
natural elements to your advantage

4722
02:54:44,719 --> 02:54:47,519
depending on the time of year and

4723
02:54:46,159 --> 02:54:48,398
everything like that you know you have

4724
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:50,239
to be

4725
02:54:48,398 --> 02:54:51,119
you know you have to be smart about it

4726
02:54:50,239 --> 02:54:53,359
but

4727
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:54,079
you know if you can bring it outside and

4728
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:56,000
and

4729
02:54:54,079 --> 02:54:58,559
you know have the natural elements on it

4730
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:00,959
that's really smart too

4731
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:02,559
so this is an odd one but hopefully

4732
02:55:00,959 --> 02:55:04,318
you're going to have some perspective on

4733
02:55:02,559 --> 02:55:06,478
it do you have any thoughts on how

4734
02:55:04,318 --> 02:55:09,199
vermont was the first state to legalize

4735
02:55:06,478 --> 02:55:11,119
cannabis via state legislation as

4736
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:14,159
opposed to a referendum and do you think

4737
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:15,600
it should have happened by a referendum

4738
02:55:14,159 --> 02:55:17,439
i think any way that it can become

4739
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:19,520
legalized is great and it just so

4740
02:55:17,439 --> 02:55:22,479
happened that in vermont it became

4741
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:25,040
legalized through um more political

4742
02:55:22,478 --> 02:55:25,840
power rather than people power which i

4743
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,760
think

4744
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:30,478
that's awesome that shows how it's

4745
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:33,760
matured too i mean oregon

4746
02:55:30,478 --> 02:55:35,358
also just um through state legislature

4747
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:35,850
just

4748
02:55:35,359 --> 02:55:37,040
um

4749
02:55:35,850 --> 02:55:40,239
[Music]

4750
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:42,960
is the export of cannabis to other

4751
02:55:40,239 --> 02:55:45,279
states so it's not legal to export to

4752
02:55:42,959 --> 02:55:48,239
other states but within the state of

4753
02:55:45,279 --> 02:55:50,319
oregon it's legal so

4754
02:55:48,239 --> 02:55:52,559
what they're saying is you know this is

4755
02:55:50,318 --> 02:55:54,879
we're ready for this law when it changes

4756
02:55:52,559 --> 02:55:56,478
so i i think that it's it's always gonna

4757
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:59,519
be better

4758
02:55:56,478 --> 02:56:01,519
you know for a long term you know to not

4759
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:04,239
have systems change and stuff like

4760
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:06,880
you're not if it's a vote by the people

4761
02:56:04,239 --> 02:56:08,719
then you're basically still against

4762
02:56:06,879 --> 02:56:10,719
the the legislature and if the

4763
02:56:08,719 --> 02:56:12,639
legislature makes the decision then you

4764
02:56:10,719 --> 02:56:14,000
may not like their decision but it's

4765
02:56:12,639 --> 02:56:16,318
going to be more

4766
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:17,600
stable i think for the states so that's

4767
02:56:16,318 --> 02:56:20,559
that's what we think

4768
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:22,479
yeah good answer good answer so

4769
02:56:20,559 --> 02:56:24,799
another specific one but probably going

4770
02:56:22,478 --> 02:56:28,000
to be more easier to answer this fan

4771
02:56:24,799 --> 02:56:31,278
wants to know do you view comfrey as

4772
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:33,359
better to use during a vegetative phase

4773
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:35,439
during a flowering phase or it's equally

4774
02:56:33,359 --> 02:56:37,760
good for both

4775
02:56:35,439 --> 02:56:40,960
i think it's equally good for both

4776
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:44,159
it can it contains a vast

4777
02:56:40,959 --> 02:56:45,919
amount of different minerals and if you

4778
02:56:44,159 --> 02:56:48,478
have a comfrey patch you know feed your

4779
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:50,799
comfrey patch with good teas and stuff

4780
02:56:48,478 --> 02:56:53,679
as well so it can uptake

4781
02:56:50,799 --> 02:56:55,679
good nutrients but it's so well balanced

4782
02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:58,159
that you can use it during you know from

4783
02:56:55,680 --> 02:57:00,720
the very beginning stages of a seedling

4784
02:56:58,159 --> 02:57:02,799
all the way up until your last day is a

4785
02:57:00,719 --> 02:57:06,000
flower almost

4786
02:57:02,799 --> 02:57:08,719
and the roots are good on winds

4787
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:10,799
so what would be your go-to source for

4788
02:57:08,719 --> 02:57:12,959
organic boron because it's a trace

4789
02:57:10,799 --> 02:57:15,119
element that's commonly mentioned as

4790
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:19,119
lacking in soils but it's also quite

4791
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:19,120
difficult for many people to come across

4792
02:57:20,079 --> 02:57:24,639
um

4793
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:26,479
i don't have an exact source of natural

4794
02:57:24,639 --> 02:57:28,959
boron other than just creating really

4795
02:57:26,478 --> 02:57:31,920
good compost you know from diverse

4796
02:57:28,959 --> 02:57:33,759
sources and you know getting your boron

4797
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:36,000
from naturally you know and if you're

4798
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:38,559
really concerned about any type of

4799
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:41,760
mineral deficiency within your plant or

4800
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:44,079
in your soil then it's always better to

4801
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:45,279
have it come from a plant source

4802
02:57:44,079 --> 02:57:46,959
rather than

4803
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:49,040
a whole mineral source it takes a

4804
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:51,919
tremendous amount of time for a mineral

4805
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:54,000
to break down but if you do have a go

4806
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:56,639
between plant

4807
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:58,398
like say that you know borage actually

4808
02:57:56,639 --> 02:58:00,478
is a good boron plant

4809
02:57:58,398 --> 02:58:03,278
you can add like a tremendous amount of

4810
02:58:00,478 --> 02:58:05,599
that to it and then use that plant in a

4811
02:58:03,279 --> 02:58:08,399
ferment or chop it up to put it into a

4812
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:11,359
soil because then that's going to become

4813
02:58:08,398 --> 02:58:12,719
in you know equal or very easily

4814
02:58:11,359 --> 02:58:15,600
absorbable

4815
02:58:12,719 --> 02:58:18,159
it's just plants understand plants

4816
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:20,399
and whenever you're utilizing a plant

4817
02:58:18,159 --> 02:58:22,559
source as your main mineral source it's

4818
02:58:20,398 --> 02:58:24,639
just easier for the plant to digest it

4819
02:58:22,559 --> 02:58:25,920
it's easier for the microbiology to

4820
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:27,760
break it down

4821
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:29,200
instantly and it becomes readily

4822
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:31,120
available

4823
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:34,720
yeah good answer

4824
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:36,880
so what kind of resources and approaches

4825
02:58:34,719 --> 02:58:39,358
would you recommend we look into using

4826
02:58:36,879 --> 02:58:42,000
to help educate our politicians and

4827
02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:44,720
should we be pushing for exclusively

4828
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:46,239
legislation that's designed to help care

4829
02:58:44,719 --> 02:58:48,639
for the earth at the same time as

4830
02:58:46,239 --> 02:58:50,559
allowing production or is simply a foot

4831
02:58:48,639 --> 02:58:52,318
in the door approach good enough

4832
02:58:50,559 --> 02:58:54,879
initially

4833
02:58:52,318 --> 02:58:57,278
well i mean i think ultimately we're you

4834
02:58:54,879 --> 02:58:59,759
know looking for a full package and

4835
02:58:57,279 --> 02:59:01,439
there really are a lot of really good

4836
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:03,520
examples of

4837
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:05,840
of companies that have been able to to

4838
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:07,120
provide that you know so um there

4839
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:08,960
there's

4840
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:10,640
i don't know of

4841
02:59:08,959 --> 02:59:13,438
of a piece of

4842
02:59:10,639 --> 02:59:15,519
literature that you could point you know

4843
02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:17,520
politicians too that would say you know

4844
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:19,279
this is a you know reason why you should

4845
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:20,319
legalize i just think that there is a

4846
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:22,319
lot of

4847
02:59:20,318 --> 02:59:23,199
activists out there and people that have

4848
02:59:22,318 --> 02:59:25,359
really

4849
02:59:23,200 --> 02:59:27,200
you know made differences in their local

4850
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:28,640
jurisdictions and they're you know

4851
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:29,920
they're moving around the country and

4852
02:59:28,639 --> 02:59:32,318
there's a lot of lawyers that have

4853
02:59:29,920 --> 02:59:33,200
become more and more savvy to what works

4854
02:59:32,318 --> 02:59:36,239
so

4855
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:39,279
i think it's just um

4856
02:59:36,239 --> 02:59:41,279
part of of the conferences are also you

4857
02:59:39,279 --> 02:59:43,760
know connecting people with lawmakers i

4858
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:45,760
think lawmakers are actually looking for

4859
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:47,200
people to communicate with in the

4860
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:49,120
community so i think if you make

4861
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:52,720
yourself a little bit more available

4862
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:54,079
then you will be able to to help change

4863
02:59:52,719 --> 02:59:56,000
and i think that anytime that we're

4864
02:59:54,079 --> 02:59:57,439
talking about agriculture we need to be

4865
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:00,000
talking about health and well-being of

4866
02:59:57,439 --> 03:00:02,159
the earth that's where we went wrong

4867
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:05,279
that's the reason why we have tremendous

4868
03:00:02,159 --> 03:00:08,000
illness on this planet is because those

4869
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:10,880
two conversations didn't go together we

4870
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:13,520
decided that plants and agriculture

4871
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:15,278
should be more involved in science

4872
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:16,560
rather than in nature

4873
03:00:15,279 --> 03:00:19,279
and

4874
03:00:16,559 --> 03:00:21,760
we really missed the mark there so hence

4875
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:24,640
we have tremendously sick waterways and

4876
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:27,279
soil systems and if we're not having

4877
03:00:24,639 --> 03:00:29,439
conversations as we move into the future

4878
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:32,159
when we're discussing agriculture about

4879
03:00:29,439 --> 03:00:33,920
ecology and about healthy

4880
03:00:32,159 --> 03:00:36,959
water and earth

4881
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:39,359
then we we're not doing our job and i

4882
03:00:36,959 --> 03:00:44,799
mean the whole entire cannabis industry

4883
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:44,800
as we know it started out as a medical

4884
03:00:44,879 --> 03:00:49,839
you know gift to to ailments you know

4885
03:00:48,239 --> 03:00:51,600
that whether it was aids in san

4886
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:54,719
francisco or you know that was the

4887
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:58,000
epicenter of legalization was

4888
03:00:54,719 --> 03:01:00,639
stemmed from that and and so it usually

4889
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:03,359
a place becomes medical first and then

4890
03:01:00,639 --> 03:01:04,398
it becomes recreational afterwards which

4891
03:01:03,359 --> 03:01:06,800
is

4892
03:01:04,398 --> 03:01:08,719
because then the whole medical

4893
03:01:06,799 --> 03:01:10,639
aspect it gets kind of thrown away

4894
03:01:08,719 --> 03:01:11,438
because recreational is kind of just a

4895
03:01:10,639 --> 03:01:12,799
big

4896
03:01:11,439 --> 03:01:14,639
tax

4897
03:01:12,799 --> 03:01:16,478
bracket thing where everyone can get

4898
03:01:14,639 --> 03:01:18,799
paid and then you kind of forgot that it

4899
03:01:16,478 --> 03:01:20,239
was a medicinal thing well it's the same

4900
03:01:18,799 --> 03:01:22,159
thing with cultivation i mean you'd

4901
03:01:20,239 --> 03:01:24,239
almost be missing out

4902
03:01:22,159 --> 03:01:25,920
to just say oh well let's just legalize

4903
03:01:24,239 --> 03:01:27,520
weed and just forget about how it grows

4904
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:29,840
it doesn't really matter

4905
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:32,720
you know i think that we should

4906
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:35,120
consider hey well this is a medicine and

4907
03:01:32,719 --> 03:01:37,599
it should be cultivated like a medicine

4908
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:38,880
which is medicinally good for the earth

4909
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:40,399
so for us

4910
03:01:38,879 --> 03:01:41,679
you know we're just going to go for the

4911
03:01:40,398 --> 03:01:43,439
full

4912
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:45,040
home run or the

4913
03:01:43,439 --> 03:01:46,800
you know whatever it is and we're just

4914
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:48,800
going to say i think we should have it

4915
03:01:46,799 --> 03:01:50,719
all i think the time is now where this

4916
03:01:48,799 --> 03:01:52,000
is no time to skimp i think we should

4917
03:01:50,719 --> 03:01:53,358
ask for

4918
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:55,600
everything

4919
03:01:53,359 --> 03:01:58,720
i think we should have all of it a

4920
03:01:55,600 --> 03:02:01,600
healthy environment and legalization all

4921
03:01:58,719 --> 03:02:04,000
of it but it's medical access

4922
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:05,200
you know in canada it's legal but we've

4923
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,639
lost

4924
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:09,439
access

4925
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:12,000
really i mean there's less products

4926
03:02:09,439 --> 03:02:14,318
available to the consumer now through

4927
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:18,398
legalization than there was before and

4928
03:02:14,318 --> 03:02:21,119
that's lame yeah definitely

4929
03:02:18,398 --> 03:02:22,879
so this one's a bit of an odd one when i

4930
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:25,279
first read it but i mean you know

4931
03:02:22,879 --> 03:02:28,000
there's a place for everything right how

4932
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:30,560
would you feel about sprinkling the

4933
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:32,318
ashes of a loved one into the soil and

4934
03:02:30,559 --> 03:02:34,000
growing a plant from it

4935
03:02:32,318 --> 03:02:35,439
well i mean i think that's a kind of a

4936
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,120
no-brainer

4937
03:02:35,439 --> 03:02:38,318
or maybe that's not a good term to use

4938
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:39,760
but um

4939
03:02:38,318 --> 03:02:42,079
i think that's uh

4940
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:43,680
my mother is in our greenhouse yeah i

4941
03:02:42,079 --> 03:02:47,120
mean i think that's just you know

4942
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:49,040
sanctifying the the ashes i mean for one

4943
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:50,640
ashes are good for soil

4944
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:53,359
so you're good there

4945
03:02:50,639 --> 03:02:55,199
and you're able to transform the energy

4946
03:02:53,359 --> 03:02:57,760
and put it into a plant i mean

4947
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:59,040
maybe you have a placenta too and you

4948
03:02:57,760 --> 03:03:00,478
put it underneath the tree you know what

4949
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:02,319
i mean it could you could go on and on

4950
03:03:00,478 --> 03:03:04,159
and on it's the cycle of life and we

4951
03:03:02,318 --> 03:03:05,840
think it's beautiful and all of our dogs

4952
03:03:04,159 --> 03:03:07,200
are underneath our cannabis plants too

4953
03:03:05,840 --> 03:03:09,600
we felt like that was just super

4954
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:13,040
respectful why not grow

4955
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:15,120
a beautiful medicine you know over some

4956
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:16,880
something that you loved you know that

4957
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:19,359
soul and spirit's not still there but

4958
03:03:16,879 --> 03:03:22,239
that body is and it's a wonderful way to

4959
03:03:19,359 --> 03:03:24,159
respect the body that walked this planet

4960
03:03:22,239 --> 03:03:25,119
most certainly

4961
03:03:24,159 --> 03:03:27,200
so

4962
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:29,439
someone wanted to know do you guys offer

4963
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:31,200
tours of your farm at all to the public

4964
03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:33,600
specifically those who are quite

4965
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:36,720
interested in joining the pure family

4966
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:39,120
you know we do not because we're really

4967
03:03:36,719 --> 03:03:41,039
far away and we just don't have the

4968
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:44,000
setup to be touring people around and

4969
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:46,080
then and and if we we the time to i mean

4970
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:48,398
as much as i would love to i think it

4971
03:03:46,079 --> 03:03:50,799
would be healing to you know people to

4972
03:03:48,398 --> 03:03:53,519
be able to come to our farm and i think

4973
03:03:50,799 --> 03:03:56,079
one day we would love to to do that but

4974
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:56,800
we're just not set up for it

4975
03:03:56,079 --> 03:04:00,079
but

4976
03:03:56,799 --> 03:04:02,398
i think that you know

4977
03:04:00,079 --> 03:04:04,799
in a way that's kind of cannabis tourism

4978
03:04:02,398 --> 03:04:07,199
or it's like ecotourism and i think that

4979
03:04:04,799 --> 03:04:09,199
is a thing that could be really

4980
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:10,159
beautiful for farms and i know a lot of

4981
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:12,960
farms

4982
03:04:10,159 --> 03:04:14,639
in california and different places are

4983
03:04:12,959 --> 03:04:15,519
embracing that bringing people to their

4984
03:04:14,639 --> 03:04:17,039
farm

4985
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:18,479
and they could be

4986
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:20,479
super smart

4987
03:04:18,478 --> 03:04:22,719
i think that we just don't do it right

4988
03:04:20,478 --> 03:04:24,478
now and we have lots of farmer friends

4989
03:04:22,719 --> 03:04:26,159
and people that are in the industry that

4990
03:04:24,478 --> 03:04:27,920
will come here to

4991
03:04:26,159 --> 03:04:29,200
get a little bit of education and then

4992
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:31,040
we know that they're going to pass that

4993
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:32,560
on or something so

4994
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:35,439
we've been open to it but really the

4995
03:04:32,559 --> 03:04:38,478
truth is we're we are so far away it's

4996
03:04:35,439 --> 03:04:40,960
nothing but like us out here and um it's

4997
03:04:38,478 --> 03:04:42,478
like our own spiritual temple retreat

4998
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:44,879
too so i think we just kind of get

4999
03:04:42,478 --> 03:04:45,599
rejuvenated by being on the on our land

5000
03:04:44,879 --> 03:04:47,679
and

5001
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:51,200
sometimes that's what we need because we

5002
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:53,279
have you know a lot going on so cannabis

5003
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:55,520
packaging and branding has become a

5004
03:04:53,279 --> 03:04:58,000
focal highlight of discussion in recent

5005
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:59,680
weeks most notably anyone who's ever

5006
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:01,279
shopped at a dispensary probably has a

5007
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:03,279
myriad of containers that are just

5008
03:05:01,279 --> 03:05:05,760
starting to accumulate after only ever

5009
03:05:03,279 --> 03:05:07,439
having a few grams in them what type of

5010
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:09,040
packaging do you want to see going

5011
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:10,800
forward

5012
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:13,920
well

5013
03:05:10,799 --> 03:05:15,599
that's a sad reality to you know there's

5014
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:17,120
so much there's millions of pounds of

5015
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:19,680
garbage you know

5016
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:22,640
based just on dube tubes you know which

5017
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:26,159
is kind of like amazing you know so

5018
03:05:22,639 --> 03:05:28,239
sauna packaging is one new company

5019
03:05:26,159 --> 03:05:30,159
that is making really conscious

5020
03:05:28,239 --> 03:05:31,760
packaging that is

5021
03:05:30,159 --> 03:05:36,398
hemp plastic

5022
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:38,478
and also they use recycled ocean plastic

5023
03:05:36,398 --> 03:05:40,559
and that's pretty cool and and that's

5024
03:05:38,478 --> 03:05:41,920
interesting it is still plastic in the

5025
03:05:40,559 --> 03:05:44,159
in a way but

5026
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:45,359
if it's hemp plastic then that's just

5027
03:05:44,159 --> 03:05:46,559
awesome

5028
03:05:45,359 --> 03:05:50,159
um

5029
03:05:46,559 --> 03:05:51,519
when it comes to biodegradable

5030
03:05:50,159 --> 03:05:53,600
material the only thing about

5031
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:55,200
biodegradable is it might be gmo

5032
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:57,520
biodegradable and you'd have to be

5033
03:05:55,200 --> 03:06:00,000
careful of that so

5034
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:03,200
i think that algae there's algae

5035
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:05,760
plastics that are coming out and that's

5036
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:08,240
also something that's of interest and

5037
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:11,680
well and also we package all of our

5038
03:06:08,239 --> 03:06:14,559
products in glass because we feel like

5039
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:16,639
it's important to also have a reusable

5040
03:06:14,559 --> 03:06:17,920
packaging so not just something that's

5041
03:06:16,639 --> 03:06:20,639
recyclable

5042
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:22,799
something that people can also reuse so

5043
03:06:20,639 --> 03:06:25,439
i think it's a thing

5044
03:06:22,799 --> 03:06:27,438
too because i don't i don't in canada i

5045
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:29,520
think for example i had

5046
03:06:27,439 --> 03:06:31,200
i think you can only use if you're a

5047
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:32,319
licensed producer i'm pretty sure it's

5048
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:35,120
like

5049
03:06:32,318 --> 03:06:37,600
you can only use their packaging and

5050
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:40,160
it's really weird black plasticking

5051
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:41,920
plastic that they just like did some

5052
03:06:40,159 --> 03:06:44,318
studies on a couple of months ago and

5053
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:46,239
they left it out into the sunshine and

5054
03:06:44,318 --> 03:06:48,799
realized that it off gas like a

5055
03:06:46,239 --> 03:06:50,079
tremendous amount of toxins so

5056
03:06:48,799 --> 03:06:52,559
you know

5057
03:06:50,079 --> 03:06:55,120
whoa that's not very creative nor

5058
03:06:52,559 --> 03:06:57,519
ecological and it's unfortunate because

5059
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:59,600
canadians are really upset about it as

5060
03:06:57,520 --> 03:07:01,600
well as a lot of producers are feeling

5061
03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:03,760
like wow i've grown this beautiful you

5062
03:07:01,600 --> 03:07:05,439
know flower and i got to put it into a

5063
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:07,760
weird plastic container that's going to

5064
03:07:05,439 --> 03:07:09,279
fill up all of the and and and the

5065
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:11,760
plastic that they're putting in it's not

5066
03:07:09,279 --> 03:07:13,760
even recyclable in canada so people

5067
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:15,279
could grow their own weed and then they

5068
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:16,800
wouldn't have to worry about packaging

5069
03:07:15,279 --> 03:07:19,279
that's one thing that would help there

5070
03:07:16,799 --> 03:07:21,358
you go grow your own

5071
03:07:19,279 --> 03:07:23,680
that's definitely it so do you think

5072
03:07:21,359 --> 03:07:25,840
that there has likewise become too much

5073
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:27,840
of a focus on the aesthetics of

5074
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:30,478
packaging like is having a fancy

5075
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:32,559
packaging like a legitimate reason or

5076
03:07:30,478 --> 03:07:34,639
claim to charge more for the exact same

5077
03:07:32,559 --> 03:07:35,840
product

5078
03:07:34,639 --> 03:07:38,478
well

5079
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:39,840
i mean i think it's kind of a bummer too

5080
03:07:38,478 --> 03:07:42,079
to make you

5081
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:43,840
bring your packaging into your pricing

5082
03:07:42,079 --> 03:07:46,879
it's kind of like

5083
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:47,840
how it's unavoidable i mean you can't

5084
03:07:46,879 --> 03:07:50,879
really

5085
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:54,799
do anything about it but i think that um

5086
03:07:50,879 --> 03:07:56,000
you know cannabis packaging oh god it's

5087
03:07:54,799 --> 03:07:58,159
just

5088
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:59,680
it's it's it's a thing that you can't

5089
03:07:58,159 --> 03:08:01,439
really i don't know i don't really know

5090
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:04,840
what to say about it it's it's an

5091
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:06,720
unneces it's a necessary

5092
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:09,760
evil

5093
03:08:06,719 --> 03:08:10,879
yeah no i agree it's like there's

5094
03:08:09,760 --> 03:08:13,279
there's always going to be people who

5095
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:15,519
want to package their product more fancy

5096
03:08:13,279 --> 03:08:16,720
and more shiny and flashy and that's one

5097
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:18,319
thing but then

5098
03:08:16,719 --> 03:08:20,959
you know yeah to have these rampant

5099
03:08:18,318 --> 03:08:23,600
markups is just a bit of a different

5100
03:08:20,959 --> 03:08:25,679
realm as far as i can see

5101
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:27,680
i think it's partly standing out you

5102
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:28,880
know i mean if you have

5103
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:31,040
your own

5104
03:08:28,879 --> 03:08:32,799
equipment or your own packaging that

5105
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:35,279
you've designed yourself

5106
03:08:32,799 --> 03:08:37,599
it can help you stand out and at the end

5107
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:39,040
of the day standing out matters and i

5108
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:41,359
mean if someone

5109
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:42,880
loves their packaging and it's awesome

5110
03:08:41,359 --> 03:08:44,079
and it's just sitting out on the counter

5111
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:46,159
all day and they're like oh check out

5112
03:08:44,079 --> 03:08:47,439
this product i mean it helps you know

5113
03:08:46,159 --> 03:08:49,600
what i mean so

5114
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:51,840
you know if you have to make sales

5115
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:54,318
you know you might as well be crafty

5116
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:54,870
about it and make something good but

5117
03:08:54,318 --> 03:08:56,239
you know

5118
03:08:54,870 --> 03:08:57,520
[Music]

5119
03:08:56,239 --> 03:08:59,520
don't go

5120
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:01,439
nutso you know what i mean and create

5121
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:04,239
something that's you know

5122
03:09:01,439 --> 03:09:07,279
a cost too too expensive everything is

5123
03:09:04,239 --> 03:09:09,920
already too expensive

5124
03:09:07,279 --> 03:09:13,439
alrighty so i think we are down to our

5125
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:15,200
last of the fan submitted questions so

5126
03:09:13,439 --> 03:09:17,840
it's a good one i left it to last for a

5127
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:19,040
reason how do you guys feel about

5128
03:09:17,840 --> 03:09:21,680
cookies

5129
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:21,680
in general

5130
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:25,840
um well i mean it has like the keebler

5131
03:09:24,799 --> 03:09:27,840
kind

5132
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:28,799
no

5133
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:31,680
but

5134
03:09:28,799 --> 03:09:34,398
um you know i it's it's

5135
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:36,639
it's all about the hype you know

5136
03:09:34,398 --> 03:09:38,559
i think it's it's a flavor

5137
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:41,599
you know i mean it's do you like the

5138
03:09:38,559 --> 03:09:43,760
flavors so i mean you know i i think

5139
03:09:41,600 --> 03:09:45,520
that a lot of people like the flavor and

5140
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:47,920
that's that's why it

5141
03:09:45,520 --> 03:09:49,439
that that's why it sells but i think

5142
03:09:47,920 --> 03:09:52,000
that people like

5143
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:53,120
wedding cake now too and you know now

5144
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:56,959
it's just

5145
03:09:53,120 --> 03:09:58,800
cakes and cobblers and cookies and

5146
03:09:56,959 --> 03:10:01,438

5147
03:09:58,799 --> 03:10:02,719

5150
03:10:04,318 --> 03:10:08,398

5152
03:10:08,398 --> 03:10:11,519
waiting for that one to come out because

5153
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:13,680
that that's probably gonna be

5154
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:14,640
pretty sweet you know

5155
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:16,318
um

5156
03:10:14,639 --> 03:10:18,959
but you know i

5157
03:10:16,318 --> 03:10:21,278
it's a flavor you know i i'm not gonna i

5158

i'm i'm personally not into that terpene

5161
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:32,720
profile of the cookies um

5162
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:35,840
as a midwife for a long time i can smell

5163
03:10:32,719 --> 03:10:37,920
like cookies from you know 100 other

5164
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:40,559
different bags because it reminds me of

5165
03:10:37,920 --> 03:10:41,840
breastfed baby poop is what it smells

5166
03:10:40,559 --> 03:10:44,639
like

5167
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:47,120
which is awesome it's really you know an

5168
03:10:44,639 --> 03:10:49,920
interesting smell but it's not really a

5169
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:52,720
terpene profile that um you know draws

5170
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:54,960
me i mean there's so many flavors

5171
03:10:52,719 --> 03:10:57,599
but of course tons of people love it and

5172
03:10:54,959 --> 03:10:59,919
and that's great

5173
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:02,079
yeah okay a lot a lot of good points in

5174
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:04,639
there just to quickly mention i think

5175
03:11:02,079 --> 03:11:08,000
that uh old calculator has made a mac

5176
03:11:04,639 --> 03:11:09,599
and cheese strain cross mac cheese well

5177
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:12,079
there you go see

5178
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:14,880
if i so if someone's thought about it

5179
03:11:12,079 --> 03:11:16,398
someone's already done it

5180
03:11:14,879 --> 03:11:19,119
that's it right it's one of the rules of

5181
03:11:16,398 --> 03:11:21,680
the internet i think so um

5182
03:11:19,120 --> 03:11:22,800
on to our final kind of little quickfire

5183
03:11:21,680 --> 03:11:24,960
questions

5184
03:11:22,799 --> 03:11:26,959
first one i wanted to quickly ask you

5185
03:11:24,959 --> 03:11:30,159

5188
03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:36,640
um

5189
03:11:35,439 --> 03:11:39,520
god

5190
03:11:36,639 --> 03:11:39,519
ones that are

5191
03:11:40,238 --> 03:11:46,799

5192
03:11:42,559 --> 03:11:49,600
say bring it back big time love that

5193
03:11:46,799 --> 03:11:52,159
just just you know as much as the

5194
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:53,439
original acapulco gold and there is like

5195
03:11:52,159 --> 03:11:55,200
different strains that people are

5196
03:11:53,439 --> 03:11:57,120
calling acapulco gold and it's not

5197
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:58,880
really same but

5198
03:11:57,120 --> 03:12:00,399
that was really awesome stuff when that

5199
03:11:58,879 --> 03:12:02,879
was going around

5200
03:12:00,398 --> 03:12:06,159
yeah i think that just um you know

5201
03:12:02,879 --> 03:12:08,159
non-feminized stable bread you know

5202
03:12:06,159 --> 03:12:09,760
smart strains you know that's what i

5203
03:12:08,159 --> 03:12:11,520
like to see

5204
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:14,159
great answer so

5205
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:16,640
if you could offer one or maybe even two

5206
03:12:14,159 --> 03:12:19,760
tips on selecting a mail to our

5207
03:12:16,639 --> 03:12:22,879
listeners what would they be

5208
03:12:19,760 --> 03:12:25,600
um well uh

5209
03:12:22,879 --> 03:12:28,559
it would be really nice to have a male

5210
03:12:25,600 --> 03:12:30,318
that is strong and comes up you know and

5211
03:12:28,559 --> 03:12:32,719
grows faster

5212
03:12:30,318 --> 03:12:34,799
i think is a good is a good trait

5213
03:12:32,719 --> 03:12:36,719
because it shows you know that it's

5214
03:12:34,799 --> 03:12:37,679
vigorous and

5215
03:12:36,719 --> 03:12:40,000
and

5216
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:43,200
of course you know smell rubbing the

5217
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:45,439
stem does help you get smells

5218
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:46,399
from the male and i think that you

5219
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:47,279
should

5220
03:12:46,398 --> 03:12:48,959
know

5221
03:12:47,279 --> 03:12:50,800
what you're looking for in a mail

5222
03:12:48,959 --> 03:12:53,679
because sometimes there's

5223
03:12:50,799 --> 03:12:54,959
colors in the leaf or in the stock that

5224
03:12:53,680 --> 03:12:56,800
show up

5225
03:12:54,959 --> 03:12:58,079
really early on in life and it can kind

5226
03:12:56,799 --> 03:12:59,119
of tell you a little bit about what's

5227
03:12:58,079 --> 03:13:00,398
happening

5228
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:01,520
later in life

5229
03:13:00,398 --> 03:13:03,760
um

5230
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:05,040
you'd you'd want to look at the the leaf

5231
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:06,639
structure

5232
03:13:05,040 --> 03:13:09,760
the um

5233
03:13:06,639 --> 03:13:11,920
if if you like the node height that that

5234
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:12,840
that it's growing maybe it's short maybe

5235
03:13:11,920 --> 03:13:15,840
it's

5236
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:18,960
reaching um mostly we choose our males

5237
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:22,079
like to be really manly

5238
03:13:18,959 --> 03:13:23,119
so we like our males to be really strong

5239
03:13:22,079 --> 03:13:25,359
and

5240
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:27,680
and maybe it it flat you know maybe it

5241
03:13:25,359 --> 03:13:29,760
came to its flowers early so it's an

5242
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:31,120
earth you know it's more it's not late

5243
03:13:29,760 --> 03:13:32,398
flowering

5244
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:33,520
you would want to look for something

5245
03:13:32,398 --> 03:13:35,599
that um

5246
03:13:33,520 --> 03:13:38,640
progressed faster

5247
03:13:35,600 --> 03:13:40,880
um and sometimes with disease resistant

5248
03:13:38,639 --> 03:13:42,959
you'll sometimes get trichomes on the

5249
03:13:40,879 --> 03:13:45,278
males and that can you know

5250
03:13:42,959 --> 03:13:46,159
signal that it's going to be you know

5251
03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:49,600
more

5252
03:13:46,159 --> 03:13:52,000
oil rich and oil productive

5253
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:54,640
and uh you know

5254
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:56,959
red stalks or red stems can be something

5255
03:13:54,639 --> 03:13:59,439
that you look for you know it's like

5256
03:13:56,959 --> 03:14:01,679
it's really it's depending on what you

5257
03:13:59,439 --> 03:14:04,238
it says hard to say

5258
03:14:01,680 --> 03:14:05,359
yeah of course it's a it's a varied one

5259
03:14:04,238 --> 03:14:06,959
right

5260
03:14:05,359 --> 03:14:08,960
kind of i mean it's really strange

5261
03:14:06,959 --> 03:14:10,879
specific i mean if you were

5262
03:14:08,959 --> 03:14:12,478
you know breeding land race you would

5263
03:14:10,879 --> 03:14:14,398
look for the thinnest leaf that you

5264
03:14:12,478 --> 03:14:15,278
could see you know something like that

5265
03:14:14,398 --> 03:14:18,639
or

5266
03:14:15,279 --> 03:14:21,120
you know with maybe a fat leafed hash

5267
03:14:18,639 --> 03:14:22,478
strain you know i mean there's a lot of

5268
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:26,000
it's i love that it's endless it's

5269
03:14:22,478 --> 03:14:28,000
fractal medicine yeah just keep doing

5270
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:30,478
so and next one

5271
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:32,398
what is one strain that you just never

5272
03:14:30,478 --> 03:14:33,059
particularly vibed with

5273
03:14:32,398 --> 03:14:34,639
um

5274
03:14:33,059 --> 03:14:37,359
[Music]

5275
03:14:34,639 --> 03:14:39,358
for me definitely kush

5276
03:14:37,359 --> 03:14:42,318
i don't i don't you know sort of that

5277
03:14:39,359 --> 03:14:44,559
like traditional like what people call

5278
03:14:42,318 --> 03:14:46,799
like a kush flavor which is like really

5279
03:14:44,559 --> 03:14:48,398
high in like a human

5280
03:14:46,799 --> 03:14:51,199
i don't know that's not something that i

5281
03:14:48,398 --> 03:14:54,000
necessarily vibe with and

5282
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:55,439
yeah i really never met a hundred plant

5283
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:57,120
that i didn't love but that's just a

5284
03:14:55,439 --> 03:14:59,520
terpene profile for me and i would agree

5285
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:01,200
with josh i like them all

5286
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:02,640
yeah that's good i remember i asked you

5287
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:04,000
that last interview and you gave a

5288
03:15:02,639 --> 03:15:05,680
similar answer you were saying you know

5289
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:07,359
i pretty much like them all so there you

5290
03:15:05,680 --> 03:15:10,238
go consistency

5291
03:15:07,359 --> 03:15:12,960
yeah for sure that's what we like

5292
03:15:10,238 --> 03:15:15,840
so what is one strain that maybe you

5293
03:15:12,959 --> 03:15:18,079
tried maybe you had the cutting but it's

5294
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:19,920
now gone it's now either out of

5295
03:15:18,079 --> 03:15:21,840
existence or simply just out of your

5296
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:23,760
hands that you would like to be able to

5297
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:26,719
get back if possible

5298
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:28,960
i do really like the jack herrera clone

5299
03:15:26,719 --> 03:15:31,119
that we had for a long time oh we had

5300
03:15:28,959 --> 03:15:32,719
such a beautiful cutting it was from

5301
03:15:31,120 --> 03:15:35,200
oregon and

5302
03:15:32,719 --> 03:15:37,599
oh just one of the original from the

5303
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:40,479
jack herrera family oh and um there was

5304
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:43,760
this uh the white witch which was uh

5305
03:15:40,478 --> 03:15:44,789
from the early 90s and the early trinity

5306
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:47,929
the trinity

5307
03:15:44,790 --> 03:15:47,929
[Music]

5308
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:54,559
like in 1989 and 90 that was really

5309
03:15:51,359 --> 03:15:57,520
awesome it was just super dank like

5310
03:15:54,559 --> 03:16:00,159
crazy crystals and just had amazing

5311
03:15:57,520 --> 03:16:03,359
flavor and you could ah it was so good

5312
03:16:00,159 --> 03:16:05,200
mm-hmm that one was good uh yeah i mean

5313
03:16:03,359 --> 03:16:07,600
you know and the list goes on and on

5314
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:09,439
because we grow a thousand plants on our

5315
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:11,600
property and

5316
03:16:09,439 --> 03:16:12,398
you know we don't really clone them

5317
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:15,600
so

5318
03:16:12,398 --> 03:16:19,119
they could have all been amazing

5319
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:21,439
we have a black a black or almost blue

5320
03:16:19,120 --> 03:16:23,760
grateful breath cherry puff that was a

5321
03:16:21,439 --> 03:16:26,159
really amazing and i really hope that we

5322
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:27,920
get a a good we have some seeds of it

5323
03:16:26,159 --> 03:16:31,359
and we're growing it again this year but

5324
03:16:27,920 --> 03:16:33,120
that had been an another good one

5325
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:34,569
yeah i think i remember even being able

5326
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:36,479
to sample that one um

5327
03:16:34,569 --> 03:16:38,000
[Music]

5328
03:16:36,478 --> 03:16:40,719
how did you like that that one was nice

5329
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:42,318
huh it was phenomenal and i think one of

5330
03:16:40,719 --> 03:16:44,238
the things which standed out in my

5331
03:16:42,318 --> 03:16:46,478
memory was that you would never have

5332
03:16:44,238 --> 03:16:48,398
been able to guess that that was outdoor

5333
03:16:46,478 --> 03:16:50,159
grown it looked just as good as anything

5334
03:16:48,398 --> 03:16:53,519
you'd ever seen indoor

5335
03:16:50,159 --> 03:16:55,119
give thanks exactly blessed be

5336
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:58,238
that's it so

5337
03:16:55,120 --> 03:17:01,120
on to our final question for this chat

5338
03:16:58,238 --> 03:17:03,199
what is your ultimate goal slash hope

5339
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:05,120
for the overall trajectory of our little

5340
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:09,200
community

5341
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:11,520
my overall hope is that

5342
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:14,159
all of the intentional

5343
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:16,880
amazing farmers

5344
03:17:14,159 --> 03:17:19,119
can continue to stay in business and

5345
03:17:16,879 --> 03:17:21,199
make amazing products

5346
03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:23,439
thrive in business i would like that to

5347
03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:24,840
thrive i

5348
03:17:23,439 --> 03:17:27,760
really

5349
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:29,600
want to not get

5350
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:31,600
it feels like you're getting penalized

5351
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:34,479
for making medicine and you know when

5352
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:36,399
you're getting all these crazy

5353
03:17:34,478 --> 03:17:38,318
prohibitive

5354
03:17:36,398 --> 03:17:39,599
licensing and all this stuff it just

5355
03:17:38,318 --> 03:17:41,359
feels like you're almost getting

5356
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:43,840
punished for like creating medicine and

5357
03:17:41,359 --> 03:17:47,040
i i would like to live in a world where

5358
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:48,960
it's not like can you get a licenses

5359
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:50,720
it's once you have a license it's how

5360
03:17:48,959 --> 03:17:52,879
good can your medicine be so i would

5361
03:17:50,719 --> 03:17:54,318
love to see small farms

5362
03:17:52,879 --> 03:17:56,159
being able to make really really

5363
03:17:54,318 --> 03:17:58,238
intentional products and being able to

5364
03:17:56,159 --> 03:17:59,920
sell it anywhere in the world i would

5365
03:17:58,238 --> 03:18:02,639
love to be able to sell

5366
03:17:59,920 --> 03:18:04,398
our products to any country in the world

5367
03:18:02,639 --> 03:18:07,039
and i think that anyone should be able

5368
03:18:04,398 --> 03:18:09,920
to have access to it and i think it

5369
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:11,680
should be really fun

5370
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:13,920
rather than

5371
03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:16,398
funky you know which is kind of what it

5372
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:17,200
is right now so i'd like to see a world

5373
03:18:16,398 --> 03:18:19,358
where

5374
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:23,840
we have these really beautiful diverse

5375
03:18:19,359 --> 03:18:25,680
gardens we're growing amazing plants and

5376
03:18:23,840 --> 03:18:27,680
it's just simply a matter of our

5377
03:18:25,680 --> 03:18:29,120
ingenuity to make really good products

5378
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:32,318
to be able to sell them that would be

5379
03:18:29,120 --> 03:18:35,040
nice and for me i mean just

5380
03:18:32,318 --> 03:18:37,119
one last you know statement on that is

5381
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:39,200
that i'd really like to see

5382
03:18:37,120 --> 03:18:42,319
all of the people that are incarcerated

5383
03:18:39,200 --> 03:18:46,239
for cannabis to be let out because it is

5384
03:18:42,318 --> 03:18:47,920
uh really not cool in so many ways and

5385
03:18:46,238 --> 03:18:49,359
that's really light language that i'm

5386
03:18:47,920 --> 03:18:52,159
using

5387
03:18:49,359 --> 03:18:54,880
that people who are in corporations are

5388
03:18:52,159 --> 03:18:56,799
doing it legally uh and people who are

5389
03:18:54,879 --> 03:18:59,039
incarcerated were doing the same thing

5390
03:18:56,799 --> 03:19:02,079
so i would like to see all cannabis

5391
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:05,040
incarcerated people let out and it would

5392
03:19:02,079 --> 03:19:07,680
be nice if they raised the hemp

5393
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:08,880
thc counts to make it delta nine instead

5394
03:19:07,680 --> 03:19:12,318
of total

5395
03:19:08,879 --> 03:19:14,398
thc counts and so we could have better

5396
03:19:12,318 --> 03:19:16,559
medicine availability the world that

5397
03:19:14,398 --> 03:19:18,799
would be nice too

5398
03:19:16,559 --> 03:19:21,920
and i hope that cannabis can change the

5399
03:19:18,799 --> 03:19:24,879
world uh through teaching us

5400
03:19:21,920 --> 03:19:26,318
so many things from seed to seed and i

5401
03:19:24,879 --> 03:19:28,000
think it's great that denver

5402
03:19:26,318 --> 03:19:29,840
decriminalized

5403
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:31,359
uh psychology yeah and i think that's

5404
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:34,639
really cool too

5405
03:19:31,359 --> 03:19:36,880
and and we really like nice people too

5406
03:19:34,639 --> 03:19:40,318
so hopefully our community can continue

5407
03:19:36,879 --> 03:19:41,920
to expand and we can create together and

5408
03:19:40,318 --> 03:19:44,079
we can be

5409
03:19:41,920 --> 03:19:46,238
um communicating and we can be

5410
03:19:44,079 --> 03:19:48,799
collaborative in our efforts in moving

5411
03:19:46,238 --> 03:19:50,799
forward we can protect our own seeds by

5412
03:19:48,799 --> 03:19:52,639
putting them into public domain to where

5413
03:19:50,799 --> 03:19:55,358
we all can use them

5414
03:19:52,639 --> 03:19:57,760
to where we can all actualize them

5415
03:19:55,359 --> 03:19:58,640
and we could go on and on

5416
03:19:57,760 --> 03:20:00,800

5417
03:19:58,639 --> 03:20:03,358
