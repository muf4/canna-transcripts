00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:24,359
so far well I feel honored to be on that

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,040
short list love it love it so I guess to

87
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,840
get things started today tell me what

88
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,878
have you been smoking on recently

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,620
wow well recently I'm usually doing

90
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,199
something fresh and I've really been

91
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,420
doing some outdoor that I just threw a

92
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,619
few Earth boxes out really late season I

93
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,658
like doing that

94
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,099
and the reason why is there's no effort

95
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:42,419
involved you know if you do a full

96
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,238
season Outdoors especially out here

97
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,559
certain times the the sun's intense in

98
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,360
the beginning and then the wind gets bad

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,799
later and you have to Trellis which you

100
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,180
should anyways

101
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,700
um but I just threw some Earth boxes out

102
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,840
really late and they just stacked in a

103
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,139
nice little bushes that I had to do

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,120
nothing to and I ran some moms and this

105
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,939
is right about the time

106
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,439
um my wife ended up going to hip surgery

107
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:06,719
elective one for some

108
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,859
um hip issues she she was born with and

109
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,939
so we had to leave town for about a

110
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,799
month and that's part of why I chose

111
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,959
this method the person watching my house

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,700
could just water the earth box

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,500
um but I pulled down three really great

114
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,120
plants and I've been smoking on those as

115
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,399
well as some of the last Harvest here

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,860
and those three are the halitosis by

117
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,399
covert well it's a chemd you know cross

118
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,080
and I really like it and then

119
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:31,799
marshmallow OG which had had that cut

120
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,719
for years and that one was really had a

121
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,400
lot of fuel on it I'd say a little tiny

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,620
hint of Menthol in there somewhere where

123
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,839
the halitosis is just straight

124
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,939
Fuel and then

125
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,560
um I also gruesomekam 91 that I got by

126
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,019
cutting via

127
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,579
a local that I know that has been

128
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,719
friends with a lot of the Breeders for a

129
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,579
while and I think got it from Tom Hill

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,740
and so I just really wanted to try it

131
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,418
and it was it was great

132
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,860
um I ended up liking the halitosis a

133
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,159
little bit more but I could see why the

134
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,900
chem 91 it had that same flavor profile

135
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,639
and odor um and that's what I've been

136
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,859
smoking on lately

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,040
what a great answer for anyone who's

138
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,720
been keeping up with your YouTube series

139
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,439
uh they would probably have seen that

140
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,060
those sort of um chemd halitosisy sort

141
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,639
of plants have popped up a few times

142
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,560
would you say that sort of the terpene

143
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,120
profile you gravitate towards or it's

144
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,160
just one that's been around

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,680
no that's my favorite I really do like

146
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,699
that fuel that it really imparts like

147
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,259
that mouth coat that fuel feel and taste

148
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,478
and

149
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,220
um it seems like

150
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,079
along with that you get a lot of potency

151
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,600
in those genetics and it just seems to

152
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,359
work really well I like that the greasy

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
just a lot of the things that I look for

154
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
um I also have been smoking on some of

155
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,579
these strawberry milk cookies from Daz

156
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,138
night owl and that's an Autoflower and

157
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,120
kind of surprised that I'd be actually

158
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,800
grabbing that jar still

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,538
um but it's it's pretty potent I

160
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,340
actually really like it and it's got

161
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,959
great bag appeal and so I kind of mix it

162
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,739
up because that one's got some fuel to

163
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,239
it but it's got a little bit of

164
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,918
fruitiness and so

165
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,720
uh being able to alternate you know

166
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,659
flavors is nice

167
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,160
that's amazing we uh have seen Daz put

168
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,320
out a lot of work over the past year

169
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,120
really solidifying his name in the the

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,079
auto Community I know that you've been

171
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,360
working with them on your YouTube

172
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,639
channel have you changed your point of

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,139
view like in terms of like do you think

174
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,939
we're going to get to a point pretty

175
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,180
soon where Autos are like sort of

176
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,560
indistinguishable in the quality

177
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,300
you know it's tough to say I think there

178
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
are pretty indistinguishable from what I

179
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,699
can determine but I don't feel every

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
breeder is probably in that same

181
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,960
category I don't know because I've not

182
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,939
grown a lot of them but if everyone was

183
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,060
the same results that I've gotten out of

184
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,680
the limited run that I've done

185
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,120
um it's hard to discern like if someone

186
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,500
brought me a bag I wouldn't be able to

187
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,180
tell that was an Autoflower I mean

188
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,459
they're just all the frost all the

189
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,720
flavor and potency and so I'm happy with

190
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,859
that but there's some things that I

191
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
don't think they're going to be able to

192
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,660
fully overcome

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,978
um and I think they're overcomeable in

194
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,780
different ways it's just not going to be

195
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,279
the same and so what I mean by that is

196
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,659
like commercially yeah someone could run

197
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,439
a whole bunch of Autoflower seeds but I

198
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,560
still think they're going to lack

199
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,699
uniformity as far as size

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,079
um there may be some that are more

201
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,939
uniform than others certain genetics

202
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,139
that they're able to do a really good

203
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,300
job with

204
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,160
um and certainly Dazzle seeds were a lot

205
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,500
more uniform than I expected

206
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,360
uh but I also learned which I already

207
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,379
knew and suspected but I learned more

208
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,000
and this last run was that any sort of

209
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,680
tampering with them at all or

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
transplanting instead of directly sewing

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,740
it seems to reduce the size a lot

212
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,259
because it triggers them into their

213
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,519
Autoflower nature much faster

214
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,419
um and then the other thing that I just

215
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,879
really

216
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,500
I really don't like which isn't going to

217
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,719
be solved is the fact that if you do

218
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,038
find something that you're really

219
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,139
attracted to and you would like to keep

220
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,120
it you can't and

221
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't know it doesn't kill it for me

222
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,000
because I I feel like Autoflower is fill

223
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,079
a niche that's very very needed and

224
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,639
everyone might use it a different way

225
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,318
it's a tool for a certain job and it

226
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,120
allows me to have great difference in

227
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,560
flavor variety and now that I know that

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,180
they're potent and taste good I'm happy

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,620
to have that

230
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,360
um and at home you know I have a bedroom

231
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,399
that I could just throw one in if I have

232
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,080
some space and get some extra

233
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,519
so there's a million reasons why I would

234
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,439
consider using them for people that are

235
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,779
brand new or someone that just really

236
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,120
not that into growing but wants to have

237
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,439
a plant in their backyard great way to

238
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,899
introduce them

239
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,779
so a lot of benefits there but man

240
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,719
almost kills it for me to know that no

241
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,598
matter how great the plant is that I

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,460
might select I can't keep it and so it

243
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,719
almost has me not even looking I just go

244
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,098
whatever happens happens and I'm not

245
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,300
trying to discern which one's the best

246
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,339
because

247
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,639
it's going to be a one-off regardless so

248
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,300
that's good that's almost got some like

249
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,458
um

250
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,379
some interesting like spiritual

251
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,958
metaphysical sort of underlying ideas

252
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,220
yeah like that's what I mean like not

253
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,139
that like the

254
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,700
there's this hunt so to speak that's

255
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,439
almost pointless but it's kind of like

256
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm looking for something I want to keep

257
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,720
and when you take that

258
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,939
now I'm not pursuing it the same way and

259
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,740
while it's totally fine it just it just

260
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,060
it scratches a different itch I guess

261
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,879
I'll say

262
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,739
yeah I like that it's like uh the

263
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,179
equivalent of being in the moment as a

264
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,759
grower

265
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,739
yeah yeah and you know there's some of

266
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,720
that needed I have more seeds than time

267
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,159
and

268
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,600
um so when you take apart the

269
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,579
responsibility of selecting the winner

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,659
out of these supposed trophies in your

271
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,339
seat vault

272
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,319
it's pretty easy just to pop seeds

273
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,300
because it's like well they're not going

274
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,399
to keep them anyways so I will say it

275
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,319
goes both ways for sure

276
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,958
yeah that's a great Point that's a great

277
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,660
Point look I would uh I would be remiss

278
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,338
with myself if I didn't do it some

279
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,740
Shameless self-promotion I I know you've

280
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,200
grown out in extremely reputable breeder

281
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,259
heavy days genetics licorice mama oh yes

282
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,899
what was your experiences with that one

283
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,338
uh really I liked it a lot and it's

284
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,778
funny I remember I recall back

285
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,339
specifically I can almost picture the

286
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:58,799
plant in my mind because of how colorful

287
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,440
and resin round it was

288
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,359
um but it's hard I I remember enjoying

289
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,820
it a lot it's been a while so I can't

290
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,379
remember with detail what the flavor

291
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,000
profile and notes were I just remember

292
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,480
going oh [ __ ] I better grow this again

293
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,899
and I still have a pack uh from you that

294
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,220
I'd love to pop at some point so might

295
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,299
have to get to that

296
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,278
but yeah I think God the Phantom cookie

297
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,799
what did I run that has raspberry mama

298
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,659
in it yeah and the Phantom crackers and

299
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,120
the Phantom crackers yeah yeah yeah okay

300
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,100
yes yeah I really like that one nice one

301
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,500
I'll uh I'll have to send you some more

302
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,240
it's an interesting connection from

303
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,759
across the world so to speak and I think

304
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
that's part of why I really like

305
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,338
yeah no that's really cool man I'm

306
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,700
stoked to grow it out that's that's

307
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,740
amazing so I noticed recently on the

308
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,600
YouTube series you were running

309
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,259
um a bunch of Duke's work I think it was

310
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,879
the the Beefcake D was it yeah I ran the

311
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,799
Beefcake D and I have other packs from

312
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,799
him and those I purchased

313
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,899
serendipitously before we decided to

314
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,659
work together a little bit and it's been

315
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,360
really slow uh to come to fruition but

316
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,879
we did discuss doing a sort of soil

317
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,440
recipe for him and instead of just

318
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,059
releasing it we decided to make it send

319
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,920
it to him have him do a full run in it

320
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,239
and give us some feedback and last I

321
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,039
heard he was pulling everything down and

322
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,259
was really excited about it very happy

323
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,299
with the results and so hopefully that

324
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,879
would lead to a release of a Duke

325
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,958
Diamond soil recipe this year

326
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,820
um and I was stoked that I bought those

327
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,939
beef cake D before that conversation

328
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,660
never happened so it wasn't like

329
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,120
um

330
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:37,500
wasn't motivated by that right it was

331
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,480
just here and before

332
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,458
he got locked up for a little while and

333
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,259
before that happened he was at an event

334
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,838
I think it was

335
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,700
oh I can't remember it was in Denver and

336
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,560
Kevin from root wise was talking to him

337
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,300
a lot he'd mentioned you know wanting to

338
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,859
trust him build a soil stuff and I

339
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,958
wanted to buy some packs and so that the

340
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,159
conversation kind of started

341
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,979
um but it wasn't until he reached out to

342
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,078
me you know a year or more later that we

343
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,820
ended up bringing it full circle and so

344
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,399
um that was fun I really enjoyed those

345
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,440
uh Beefcake D and I have more packs of

346
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,120
his that I really like pop but like I

347
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,940
said more seeds than time sometimes the

348
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,278
issue that's it and you you gave me the

349
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,500
perfect segue in the uh one of our

350
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,000
patreon listeners wanted to know that

351
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,740
they've seen you work with a few

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,480
different notable guys like obviously

353
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,159
you just mentioned Duke

354
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,259
um and I think on the website I even saw

355
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,039
that you guys have done up a kit for uh

356
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,899
gas of Swami Organics and I guess uh the

357
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,659
patreon supporters question is sort of

358
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,458
are there any major variances in these

359
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,319
mix in terms of like would you recommend

360
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,239
one for a specific situation or do you

361
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,560
think it's more about just like they're

362
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,079
comparable but you just sort of pick

363
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,838
which one appeals a little more to you

364
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,620
yeah I feel like the more I learn the

365
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,120
less I think that there's very you know

366
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,100
specific differences

367
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
what I mean by that is good and good out

368
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,019
this is like comparing two healthy

369
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,820
people's diets I think that if the

370
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,560
results are good from both people then

371
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,839
you'd be probably safe to copy either

372
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,659
and there may be some nuances that

373
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
operationally are slightly different but

374
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,939
um Afghanistan was part of the original

375
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:15,179
Los forums and he was

376
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,380
key and you know MGD and I and some

377
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,958
others

378
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,120
um we worked heavily behind the scenes

379
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,379
to just discuss all of these topics at

380
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
hand and they were so friendly and

381
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,320
answering so many questions

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,759
and also had like a vibe that was

383
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,139
trying to get all the people that were

384
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,059
going this direction kind of thinking

385
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,320
the same way and so then Coop was there

386
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,359
and

387
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,100
um we ended up after all of the drama on

388
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,720
the forums which always follows each

389
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,399
other around especially in the organic

390
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,899
form there was like arguing with Hydro

391
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,000
people and then like retreating back to

392
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,179
the organic section there was Private

393
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,039
threads behind the scenes and so um we

394
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,419
ended up as things got broken out people

395
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,278
were banned and all those you know

396
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,778
typical political things happened we

397
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,720
ended up creating a form together which

398
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:00,000
was that living organic soil form

399
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,519
and I helped do all the technical stuff

400
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,259
and set up the the bulletin you know the

401
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,120
the back end and

402
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,500
just I had time at that point and I was

403
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,578
very transparent I told him look and I'm

404
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,379
starting this company called build a

405
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:12,359
soil so if I'm going to work with you on

406
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,159
this Los form it's going to be towards

407
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,600
that end

408
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,299
um and I never try to be markety about

409
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,278
it but I was helping that because it was

410
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,479
my passion also knowing that my time was

411
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,939
probably going to be consumed by

412
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,100
business so I'm not sure how long into

413
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,480
it maybe a year year and a half

414
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
um it was consuming more time than I had

415
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,659
build a soil was taking off and so I

416
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,700
just said listen I would prefer that you

417
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:33,719
guys take this over fully and I

418
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,579
appreciate everything you've done this

419
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,660
far and then years later they reached

420
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,338
back out and said hey would you mind

421
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,139
making sort of a recipe do you have all

422
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,820
these ingredients together it would help

423
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,860
us with some of our you know friends and

424
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,420
customers and so we created that recipe

425
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,860
and that was really it was really cool

426
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,838
and over the years we've been able to

427
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,879
work with some great people I know

428
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,440
um many breeders have reached out Center

429
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,059
seeds or we've shared build as well

430
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,959
products behind the scenes just kind of

431
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,578
in a

432
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,198
in like a friendly manner where there's

433
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,000
no money exchanged just hanging out

434
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,559
sharing ideas with each other and I

435
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,440
think that's one of the really really

436
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,578
big benefits that I didn't understand

437
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
that I've come to enjoy when I started

438
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,120
build as well

439
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,860
yeah wow what a what an organic story I

440
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,899
didn't I didn't know that you had that

441
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,579
um that long history in in the back with

442
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,500
those guys that's really cool

443
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,000
yep I think the only reason why

444
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,259
everything's not more vocalized is there

445
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
was a lot of politics you know not

446
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,000
everybody got along so blue jay way had

447
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,259
a falling out with gastonistan and

448
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,299
um ended up become more Mountain

449
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,980
Organics and then when that fell apart

450
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,698
then coot tried to work with mountain

451
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,459
and that fell apart and cute has some

452
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:37,500
definite feelings about that and I

453
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,578
happen to know that coop is it all cute

454
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,720
it has some feelings about a lot of

455
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:44,698
things and so I try not to take on other

456
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,899
people's stories but I think that if

457
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,539
we're all in the same room not everybody

458
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,458
would be friends and build a soil one of

459
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,419
the things that I prided myself on is I

460
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,099
really try and keep genuine

461
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,439
relationships and I try not to judge

462
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,839
people we try and just you know keep

463
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,699
that integrity and so I think it's been

464
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,980
pretty cool everyone's allowed me to

465
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:03,479
work with all sides of like I've worked

466
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,639
with Mountain Organics before didn't

467
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,740
quite work out his soil recipe

468
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,139
wasn't exactly

469
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,399
the same as what we typically make and I

470
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,839
think that Logistics a million other

471
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,659
reasons right he's in California I'm in

472
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,000
Colorado worked with Afghanistan on that

473
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,159
small project and that you know mainly

474
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,559
moves to his customer base

475
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,000
um but I like the ingredients in it and

476
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,439
then our stuff with cute has been

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,860
phenomenal we worked at J plant speaker

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,380
and then now potentially Duke Diamond so

479
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,539
I just hope it continues it's really fun

480
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,240
that's beautiful I love that

481
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,860
so we got we got like sort of related to

482
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,480
this topic we got an interesting comment

483
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,800
from one of our patreon listeners they

484
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,500
sort of said something to the effect of

485
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,659
like oh amendments are like strains they

486
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,159
come in and out of fashion I wanted to

487
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,778
know are there any amendments that you

488
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,319
think are coming back into fashion at

489
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:53,639
the moment oh God that's so true

490
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,920
amendments are totally like fashion I

491
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,539
also think that the human diet's similar

492
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,000
right like certain

493
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,799
salads or certain soups or certain

494
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,558
styles of food will become very very

495
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,418
popular for a while

496
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,099
um

497
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,660
and at the end of the day right we all

498
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,219
just need to be able to put some fuel in

499
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,419
our body and

500
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,860
um hopefully if you're like me it's

501
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,140
organic and clean and you have these

502
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,178
preferences for health but

503
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,880
um it's similar comparison

504
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,400
and so as far as fad that I've seen come

505
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,679
and go although I love neem cake there's

506
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,660
definitely been some resistance for many

507
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,100
reasons people equating it to

508
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,960
some of the

509
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,240
um watered-down neem products on the

510
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,460
market also because of cannabis

511
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,538
hyperemesis I think was unfairly blamed

512
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,880
like there's been some weird politics

513
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,679
there kelp meal you know it's always

514
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,299
been very popular but recently with

515
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,980
heavy metal testing in the United States

516
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,019
and specific States being very very

517
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,579
proactive about it

518
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,379
um to the point where politically it

519
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,659
almost seems like they were trying to

520
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,000
force people to grow hydroponically by

521
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,279
reducing the level of metals allowed to

522
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,538
ridiculous levels

523
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,700
um and then also for instance like

524
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,440
cadmium when we first learned about it

525
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,819
uh I'm sorry arsenic we found out that

526
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,860
there was organic arsenic versus

527
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,720
inorganic Arsenic and we reach out to

528
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,178
the kelp supplier they're very aware of

529
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,100
that when it comes to animal feed but I

530
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,380
think Michigan even lists which one they

531
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:16,079
prefer but they only test for the total

532
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,580
and so I think kelp meals kind of gotten

533
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,740
taken out a little bit because it does

534
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,359
have some natural arsenic that

535
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,038
I mean [ __ ] the some of the longest

536
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,319
living populations eat seaweed all the

537
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,640
time so for me it's not a concern and

538
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,759
for the home grower it's not a concern

539
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,100
but I think those politics stimulate

540
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,240
some of the fad swings and I think kelp

541
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,859
Neil will probably come back with a

542
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,900
vengeance as people start to learn and

543
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:40,798
understand

544
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,059
um but yeah I would say fad wise right

545
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,500
now I don't know if there's anything

546
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,678
that's coming

547
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,058
and going anything in particular but

548
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,780
those are two that really stand out to

549
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:50,038
me

550
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,240
this year there's nothing that I'm

551
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,220
thinking oh this is going to be a big

552
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,500
you know fad

553
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,200
yeah no that's that's really interesting

554
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,240
I'd love to jump into the name a little

555
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,679
more but I always like to give this

556
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,099
caveat because

557
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,380
um I I agree I I'm I'm not sold at all

558
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:10,379
that name is neem oil specifically is

559
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,080
responsible for a cannabis hyperemesis

560
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,299
and there is there is a paper out there

561
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,519
it's a it's a case study of a guy who

562
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:20,940
rocked up to a hospital and he had

563
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,259
accidentally drunk 30 ml of neem oil I

564
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,058
think he said it was in a cup and he

565
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,220
thought it was something else anyway he

566
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:28,379
got very very sick and had cyclic

567
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,079
vomiting but then there was another case

568
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,580
of someone who ingested about 10 mil and

569
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,460
they didn't get as sick and so what it

570
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:38,579
basically suggested was that if if neem

571
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,919
was the responsible or agent you would

572
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:43,619
probably need to consume a lot more than

573
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,299
what could be residually on a plan

574
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,678
because that was the story I always got

575
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,740
told it's like oh this is from people's

576
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,840
brand name or using neem and I sort of

577
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,759
yeah I sort of um I don't think the

578
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,099
evidence really supports it that much

579
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,798
but to delve more into the name thing

580
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:00,058
one of our listeners did want to ask you

581
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,440
know I'd love to ask Jeremy if we could

582
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,480
hear more about his thoughts on neem

583
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,400
specifically around like any

584
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,140
controversies or misconceptions because

585
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,259
it seems like some people are reluctant

586
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,460
to use it While others swear by it yeah

587
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,038
it's interesting

588
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,279
um I swear by it I don't use it very

589
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,298
often but I know how well it works and I

590
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,759
think part of the reason I don't use it

591
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:23,160
is you know it's oily and it has an odor

592
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,079
to it and so depending on the use case I

593
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,700
think prevention is really ideal but

594
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,000
neem oil works

595
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,319
so well in certain instances and you

596
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,119
know when we started sourcing neem oil

597
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:37,200
we found there was a wildly different

598
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:40,019
amount of these limonoids that are in

599
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,340
there as it arachn A and B and member

600
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,519
and Saladin and all these others that I

601
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,558
learned about and from the neem textbook

602
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,058
part of what you know coot always taught

603
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,579
me and relied upon was that these were

604
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:53,879
thousands of years old as far as being

605
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:56,399
utilized as medicinal plants with humans

606
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,960
and so obviously anything medicinal you

607
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,660
can abuse it

608
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,100
um but I believe neem oil neem bark neem

609
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,419
Leaf all these things have been ingested

610
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,219
for a long time

611
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,419
and amounts that would be fairly normal

612
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,298
I don't think anybody wants to go just

613
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,559
drink olive oil but obviously neem has

614
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:12,179
some definite

615
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,079
um some things to do these limonoids

616
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,980
that are

617
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:19,199
of benefit but could also be of concern

618
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,819
where I believe the issue comes from is

619
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,620
when I'm purchasing neem oil the way

620
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,019
that it works out there is that it's all

621
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,639
wild harvested you're not having like a

622
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:30,538
40 acre neem

623
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,520
Tree Farm it may exist now but for the

624
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,859
most part the vast majority of all neem

625
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,960
was wild harvested in the villagers or

626
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,599
anybody that would be collecting these

627
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,980
seeds could then exchange them for money

628
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,599
and so during the season everybody

629
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,519
collect the best ones you bring them to

630
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:45,240
the the facility and they would pay you

631
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,798
out

632
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,179
and it could be a little more complex

633
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,339
than that but that's how I understand it

634
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,679
and so they would mix all that together

635
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,538
and some trees grown in certain areas a

636
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,460
mature tree and a certain type of soil

637
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,740
or climate may have a much higher

638
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,880
azadarachan nimbin Saladin content than

639
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,620
other ones

640
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,700
and so typically what you get left with

641
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,500
is

642
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,620
the average whatever's in the oil that

643
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,819
they produce and because of the way you

644
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,259
know these things work and people are

645
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,779
selling it for as a director and

646
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,879
purposes many of these manufacturers

647
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,500
would formulate neem oil so they

648
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,600
wouldn't just press it they would then

649
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,119
take extractive acid or actin and others

650
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,678
and they would mix it in there so that

651
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,819
you would have at least some minimum

652
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,259
quantity

653
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,700
and oftentimes I found that these

654
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,900
formulations were lower than even the

655
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,759
quantities we were finding of the

656
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,759
premium so when we were able to get the

657
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,200
best it was just wild harvested and it

658
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,480
was just fresh pressed and it had very

659
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,100
high amounts of these compounds

660
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,259
and so my suspicion is that some of

661
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,699
these extracts that are being used

662
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,558
um when they're being formulated back

663
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,759
into the oil you wouldn't know when

664
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:45,960
you're buying the oil and I think

665
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,759
there'd be a vast difference between a

666
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,798
formulated version versus an all-natural

667
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,658
version

668
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,460
and then to take it a step further many

669
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,799
of the people that are actually foliar

670
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,500
spraying at least the majority are not

671
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,359
using a natural you know neem oil

672
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,400
typically when you hear neem and it

673
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,379
comes to a commercial grow it's going to

674
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,960
be a product that's pre-emulsified and

675
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,460
as an extract of me and then is highly

676
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,120
concentrated

677
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,860
and so a lot of it is just understanding

678
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,538
that and knowing that many of these

679
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,339
potential health effects could be from

680
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,798
the fact that they're using neem

681
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,839
products that are different than a

682
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,980
naturally occurring neem oil and then

683
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,178
you take that a step further and you

684
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,279
find out that a number of these

685
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,840
manufacturers that were manufacturing a

686
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,480
neem extract product

687
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,819
and as a product as they call it were

688
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,259
pulled off the shelves for adding in a

689
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,579
number of other pesticides that were not

690
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,140
listed on the label

691
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:40,379
and so when you understand the Cannabis

692
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,000
industry and how products are sold and

693
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,720
how there's been so many suppliers taken

694
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
out

695
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,900
it models up the argument a lot going

696
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,360
well do you even know if this is a

697
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,038
contaminated multiple pesticide as a

698
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,599
product that was being used or whether

699
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,519
it was just something normal

700
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,599
and it's hard to say because you know

701
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,460
there's going to be some Growers that

702
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,459
said hey I used to grow with neem now I

703
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,960
don't I don't have cannabis hyperemesis

704
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,179
um but I think that

705
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,400
that's the least argument that I've

706
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,960
heard mostly it's like a friend I know

707
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,059
or something like that

708
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,419
and there's been tons of research on

709
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:14,279
both sides at least by wannabe sleuths I

710
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,140
don't have an exact answer my gut tells

711
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,519
me that it's not this neem oil and that

712
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,200
when you use a natural neem oil you

713
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,779
emulsify it properly that it's going to

714
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,220
work really well and that the challenge

715
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,019
I think with Organics is that none of

716
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,100
them eradicate everything completely it

717
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,679
takes some discipline some repeat

718
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,779
application and you know really um

719
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,120
preemptive getting it early

720
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,038
so I feel like a lot of people are

721
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,019
probably using it incorrectly saying it

722
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,519
doesn't work and then following up with

723
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,839
yeah there's also these health concerns

724
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,480
so now I don't have to think about it

725
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,279
but really if I was

726
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,079
tasked with doing I mean a lot of fruit

727
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,579
tree Growers there's so many people that

728
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,379
use neem oil and have really good

729
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,639
results with it

730
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,960
um I wouldn't hesitate to use it on my

731
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
cannabis now

732
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,700
I do know that you can test for acid or

733
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,500
actin and you'll show a little bit if

734
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,120
you're using it heavily so I would avoid

735
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,640
using it in flour it's an oil wouldn't

736
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:05,158
want to I would use it in veg

737
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,159
um so just some considerations

738
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,919
no some great thoughts there I had heard

739
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,380
people say something like uh it can

740
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,520
actually damage the microbial life in

741
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,740
the soil have you ever heard anything

742
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,019
along those lines yeah I've heard that

743
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,339
we've argued against that pretty

744
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,679
significantly

745
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,538
um because it was I think ill-founded

746
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,000
when you look at naturally occurring

747
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:28,440
amounts in the neem cake and you know

748
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,819
nobody's dumping oil in their soil and

749
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,620
if they are they shouldn't be

750
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,139
but the neem cake is typically what that

751
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,519
argument was against and shared all the

752
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,520
information because you know he

753
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,679
obviously cared because he shared people

754
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,418
um the benefits of neem early on

755
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,220
and what we found was a number of

756
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,419
studies in fact I think specifically

757
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,759
people were saying that it kills the

758
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,620
fungi the fungi and that it would be a

759
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,819
problem for that and there's a number of

760
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,678
studies where you can see people adding

761
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:56,639
neem cake as well as other medicinal

762
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,220
herbs to the pre-sterilized mushroom

763
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,259
growing bags and then fruiting fungi on

764
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,960
it and getting phenomenal yield in

765
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,819
results so Nature's complicated in that

766
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,278
way where it may have some adverse

767
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:11,038
effects but it's through a pathway that

768
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,659
has an ability to discern what its

769
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,058
targets are and what I mean by that is

770
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,900
people are amazed to find that neem oil

771
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,339
is

772
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,798
pretty harmless when it comes to

773
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,359
beneficials and soil life but pretty

774
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:24,480
harmful when it comes to some of these

775
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,979
pests you're like why does it make sense

776
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,200
um well how is that possible how can it

777
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,000
choose you're like well the bug that's

778
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,860
eating your plant ends up eating the oil

779
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,380
or the other ones that don't eat your

780
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,479
plant aren't eating the oil and so

781
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,640
as you take it a step deeper you tend to

782
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,980
see like oh that's why it works on this

783
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,900
but not the other as far as biology and

784
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,058
fungi I'd imagine anything you overdo

785
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,440
could cause a problem but I've seen you

786
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:48,778
just sprinkle neem cake on the soil

787
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,880
threats to proliferate your life some

788
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:53,159
people say that honey is totally

789
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,600
antibacterial and so someone might

790
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,400
suppose that adding honey would just

791
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,319
kill all the bacteria in your soil Until

792
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,460
you realize that putting a drop of water

793
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,379
in the honey will spoil the whole batch

794
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,720
pretty quickly

795
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,278
um it's it's when it's intact right as

796
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,960
soon as you dilute it now it's lost its

797
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,058
antimicrobial properties and it becomes

798
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,980
part of Nature and part of life in which

799
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:14,220
Decay is absolutely a big part of that

800
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,460
so I think it's the same

801
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,200
yo what a great answer I wanted to ask

802
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,360
you your thoughts on a sort of related

803
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,759
topic which is like over the few years

804
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,558
and I suspect it's in part due to the

805
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:30,480
proliferation of uh the Elaine Ingham

806
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:32,038
classes she teaches but I've seen a lot

807
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,500
more people

808
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,298
um trying to assess the quality of say

809
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,480
their compost or their medium through

810
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:42,179
the microscope my question is do you

811
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,220
think a view under the microscope gives

812
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,440
you a full picture or do you think that

813
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,179
like it's not necessarily going to tell

814
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,100
you like you know if it looks good under

815
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,360
the microscope it might not necessarily

816
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,639
be good or do you think there's a pretty

817
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,500
strong correlation I don't think there's

818
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,080
a very strong correlation I could be

819
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,298
overstepping here but I'd rather talk

820
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,439
about what my gut and my experience

821
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:03,359
really shares

822
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,919
and I did not incorporate a microscope

823
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,418
into my gardening methods and I don't

824
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,799
think others should feel like they have

825
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,538
to

826
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,158
um if you have one I certainly think

827
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:12,720
that you're going to find correlation to

828
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,100
seeing biological life in healthy

829
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,919
conditions but I'm hesitant to say that

830
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:22,740
you can take a microscope certainly an

831
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,440
average microscope at that and identify

832
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,000
if something is a specific name of

833
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,538
bacteria

834
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,640
and be positive that that specific

835
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:34,859
slide that you're viewing would indicate

836
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,380
that it's a quality compost I think that

837
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:40,439
biology can exist on a low quality

838
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,360
compost as far as how it's ideal to

839
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,298
integrating into a soil mix or how it's

840
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,699
ideal into using on your farm now the

841
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,440
way nature works is typically what makes

842
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,900
a good compost would also lead to Great

843
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,519
biological life

844
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,778
um and that's part of what confuses me

845
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,980
sometimes when people would say oh if

846
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:57,480
you have a sulfate and your soil is

847
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,099
going to kill the microbiology like

848
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,079
using

849
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,219
um some sort of Trace mineral and we've

850
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,019
since learned that that's really not

851
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,579
true and of course in nature there's

852
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,099
going to be some of these Trace elements

853
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,839
and there's an abundance of life so I

854
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,719
think it's about that balance and I've

855
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,939
seen a lot of compost that visually even

856
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
without a microscope are teeming with

857
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,778
life

858
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,679
and they are just awful for producing

859
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,419
soil

860
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,980
so that's where that comes from what I

861
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,240
mean by that is

862
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,419
um the percentage of sodium the

863
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,980
percentage of potassium that both of

864
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,240
those the percentage of magnesium I mean

865
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,399
when you have high magnesium high

866
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,679
potassium high sodium and plants will

867
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,599
still use it in very low dilution but

868
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,580
you add it at 30 in your soil recipe you

869
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,798
could just ruin your entire soil mix but

870
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,879
visual you could see fungi growing on it

871
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:43,918
and you could put it under your scope

872
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,140
and see biology and it doesn't have to

873
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,000
be anaerobic to have a nutrient profile

874
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,460
that wouldn't lend itself to the same

875
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,380
percentages we use in our compost

876
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,600
but when you're using when you're not

877
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,320
building a soil you're just brewing a

878
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,699
tea

879
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,099
the argument becomes it doesn't matter

880
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,399
you're just trying to brew the biology

881
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:03,839
and could really taught me early on I

882
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,158
mean behind the scenes he was basically

883
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,720
saying compost tea is your complete

884
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,659
[ __ ] there's no reason

885
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,460
and didn't really like the whole keep it

886
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,520
simple tea Brewer thing that was going

887
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,759
on even though he really respected

888
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,319
um Elon Hussey and Tad was on the forums

889
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,839
at the time and so there was all that

890
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,700
let's keep it all civil microorganics

891
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,839
was there and he worked with keep it

892
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,120
simple

893
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,439
um via I think Elon is his name you know

894
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,000
I I could be getting some of this wrong

895
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,740
but he's credited basically with

896
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,819
inventing compost tea and so you know

897
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,019
coot's not going to go on there and be

898
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,079
like you know compost tea is stupid

899
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,720
because microorganics and you had tad

900
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,418
and everybody there but

901
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,360
um Tad never grew plants so that I

902
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,278
always focused on Tad Wilson because he

903
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,558
was a grower I'm sorry Ted Wilson Tim

904
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,839
Wilson and Tim and I still exchange

905
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,038
emails every once in a while and I

906
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,558
really have

907
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,379
I really like him I have a special like

908
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,879
I just it warm warm feelings come up

909
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,520
when I think about him he's always been

910
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,820
very helpful behind the scenes

911
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,918
um very polite and discussion

912
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:10,859
and I believe a lot of what he said as

913
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,899
far as what compost tea can do and what

914
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:15,719
they can produce but behind the scenes

915
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:17,219
too people like man 2.38 Verma compost

916
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,600
like come on you know what are these

917
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,579
numbers

918
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,079
um but he had a scientific mind and so

919
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,819
when he found a number that worked for

920
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,519
him he's going to list very specifically

921
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:28,079
the data so I understand all of that but

922
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,819
cute was like man just put the castings

923
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,259
on the soil just top dress the meme cake

924
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:32,639
like why are you trying to put it in

925
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:34,919
water and move it around it makes no

926
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,899
sense he's all just from the bread

927
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,460
baking he's like you know I mean yeah

928
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,199
maybe you do an auto eyes like maybe

929
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,519
you'll mix the yeast in water for a

930
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,140
little bit but for the most part it's

931
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,579
going to proliferate like it's just

932
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,120
gonna grow and grow and grow and grow

933
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:52,500
and grow in its medium so

934
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:54,178
um I don't do as many compost teas as I

935
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,619
once tinkered with

936
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,620
but I think it all has its place

937
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,039
that's that's a really interesting

938
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:04,980
answer because I feel like over the past

939
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:09,298
say two years or so I've seen more and

940
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,159
more Growers who historically were sort

941
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:13,859
of like yourself and I where they're

942
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,299
just sort of not using many teas and

943
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:18,298
they're just sort of building the soil

944
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:22,259
and watering I've seen a move towards

945
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:23,700
people using more uh powdered products

946
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,859
in their regime

947
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,080
products these products are great things

948
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:30,898
like Organics are live

949
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,879
um some of these other the thriving you

950
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:34,439
sell some of these products are great I

951
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,600
guess the question becomes do you think

952
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,240
as we get more of these products and

953
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,819
tools in our arsenal we will begin to

954
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,980
utilize them more or do you think it

955
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,599
would like at the core of it all a lot

956
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,058
of people will just stay with like top

957
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,459
dressing watering only

958
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:52,019
I think there's two questions here and

959
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm trying to answer them in a way that

960
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,558
I feel like when I'm thinking about it

961
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,119
and

962
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,200
so as not to forget I'll address them

963
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,359
and then I'll try and answer them so you

964
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,919
can help remind me but one of them is is

965
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:03,119
there benefits using all these patterned

966
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,240
stuff

967
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,339
and I see them as tools to get the job

968
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,200
done easier

969
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,939
instead of you know you can't produce

970
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,100
more than 100 like if you take a genetic

971
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,179
and it's full potential these powders

972
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,980
will help you get there but you're never

973
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:19,380
going to surpass that and you can

974
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,940
achieve that without using them to say

975
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,039
that there's you know it's like

976
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,440
sometimes using a staple gun is easier

977
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,119
than using a stapler Sometimes using a

978
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,740
nail gun is better than a hammer but you

979
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,639
do need it no you can use the hammer all

980
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,399
day long

981
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,419
and so when it comes to soil that's one

982
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,979
of the arguments that's one of the

983
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,778
things I see and that's why I use some

984
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,240
of them and sometimes I don't depends on

985
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:42,240
the system but the other thing is the

986
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,919
psychology and I gotta tell you

987
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,099
we like

988
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,720
I know myself I like to Tinker

989
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,459
and so I don't think you're gonna get

990
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,140
everybody to just stop tinkering and

991
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,558
just do water only

992
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,940
because although it may work and work

993
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:58,678
very well

994
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,720
you're left with time then you're left

995
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,298
thinking well one I wonder and I want to

996
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,100
try this and I want to try that and it's

997
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:06,599
just it's gonna happen you know and so

998
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:07,918
that's at least me personally

999
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,418
um this is like saying hey can you just

1000
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,559
eat the same thing seven days a week in

1001
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,358
the kitchen you're like sure it's

1002
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,779
probably very healthy but I'll never do

1003
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,918
it because I enjoy tinkering you know

1004
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,560
it's different to a plant it's not like

1005
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,878
I'm forced to taste it but um I think

1006
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,320
that's part of what it is is just

1007
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,418
psychologically we'll always be wanting

1008
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,879
to try new things and

1009
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:29,158
you know I think in cannabis as well

1010
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,719
it's like we want to have that fire and

1011
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,220
you want to be able to share it

1012
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,779
and so anything that might help you get

1013
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,418
that more consistently I think is likely

1014
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,440
to be moving in and out of these fads

1015
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,019
and everything else there's always going

1016
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,300
to be people buying stuff and trying it

1017
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:45,000
but circling back to the benefit of them

1018
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,879
I definitely find myself where when I'm

1019
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,179
busy doing a lot more just water only

1020
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:54,598
but I do notice that like amino acids

1021
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,338
um man they they really do help things

1022
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:00,180
grow faster

1023
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:01,320
and so I noticed a lot of Health in that

1024
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:02,279
regard and so when it comes to living

1025
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,900
soil

1026
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,060
we're not adding a lot of quick release

1027
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,119
nitrogen which is good because I don't

1028
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,500
really think it's a huge benefit but

1029
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,180
um there's typically a lot that can slow

1030
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,920
release from the organic matter and the

1031
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,319
seed meals and the other things

1032
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,358
but tapping in at the speed of the

1033
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,579
biology under intense grow lights in a

1034
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,799
perfect environment sometimes depending

1035
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,420
on genetics is less than ideal and so

1036
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,099
while it can be done I think the way to

1037
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,539
do water only where you have the least

1038
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,760
amount of issue is to do the less is

1039
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,858
more everywhere don't have the the

1040
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,800
highest intensity of lighting have a

1041
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:35,759
good environment have things where

1042
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,380
they're likely to Just Produce

1043
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,359
phenomenal Health but when you start

1044
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,099
steering them or driving them slightly

1045
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,179
harder for commercial purposes or just

1046
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,380
for fun

1047
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,598
some of these products make a difference

1048
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,460
in the speed of delivery where you can

1049
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,900
outpace that biological you know the

1050
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,900
plant can kind of outpace the biology

1051
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,000
and especially when like you've overshot

1052
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,740
the container size and I know a lot of

1053
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,358
new Growers are like yeah five gallons

1054
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:59,639
huge that's bigger than I've ever done

1055
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,739
I'll stick with that and then I'm like

1056
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,719
why there's now a foot of empty space

1057
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:06,059
between one container and the next just

1058
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:08,039
fill it all with soil

1059
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,779
um but I noticed that and so if you

1060
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,820
overshoot a five gallon some of these

1061
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,980
water solubles will really help you keep

1062
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:18,359
that yield up

1063
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:21,599
um so they're tools but again you can

1064
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,098
get phenomenal Quality Water only and I

1065
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,740
think some of the desire to do that from

1066
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,619
the purists is that

1067
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:31,919
it is achieved the same result

1068
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,960
maybe arguably you know better but the

1069
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,480
same result okay because it's just

1070
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,320
finesse we're talking about or

1071
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,420
um

1072
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,920
and they did in a very pure way and I

1073
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,200
think there's something to achieving

1074
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,300
that but once you've done it

1075
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,858
I also feel like well it's okay I know

1076
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,660
this produces good results too and

1077
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:50,639
there's now more organic powders that

1078
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:52,440
actually are very clean ingredients and

1079
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,659
so it starts to give you some of that

1080
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,300
flexibility and

1081
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:59,098
um so that's those are my thoughts on it

1082
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,900
now that's brilliant there's so many

1083
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,599
like Little Gems in there I'd love to

1084
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,519
dig into and and I guess

1085
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,680
um first and foremost I totally agree

1086
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:10,858
with you my new mantra floor space is

1087
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,838
dead space and uh I encourage people to

1088
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:15,358
get a bigger pot or to Chuck another pot

1089
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:17,400
in there and I can certainly appreciate

1090
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,779
the point about those powdered products

1091
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,059
can help you to stay on top of things

1092
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,180
because I know myself I am that guy you

1093
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:27,119
referenced running five gallon pots and

1094
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:29,460
um I say to people look I sometimes I

1095
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,740
feel like Organics is like

1096
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,179
um it can be a bit disingenuous like

1097
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,618
some of the marketing in the sense that

1098
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:37,019
like there are some people who say yeah

1099
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,880
you can do water only in a five gal I

1100
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:40,619
try to talk about what you say which is

1101
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,300
like you're probably leaving stuff on

1102
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,880
the table in the sense that it might

1103
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,859
need that bit of extra help yeah it's

1104
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,539
unlikely they get it right

1105
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:50,639
like if they have a big stretcher and

1106
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:51,719
they don't flip like day one a lot of

1107
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,879
these newer Growers are like well I

1108
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:56,459
vegged 45 days I'm like fine a five

1109
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,260
gallon like what are you thinking so

1110
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,079
there's a caveat when someone says this

1111
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,420
is water only soil I say okay I'm gonna

1112
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,839
grow a 10 pounder is it still water only

1113
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,420
and that one gallon pot no

1114
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:10,980
it's not and so although it's easier for

1115
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,900
me to say yes water only that's the

1116
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,179
white belt answer the black belt answer

1117
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,559
is always well it depends and that's not

1118
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:19,919
as marketable right

1119
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:22,078
I love that Judo that's amazing so I

1120
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,880
wanted to run an idea by you that I've

1121
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,160
been trying to emphasize more a lot of

1122
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,780
the listeners uh to our show are coming

1123
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,098
more from the passion side there's a

1124
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,839
good number of them that work in the

1125
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,099
industry but a lot of them are like

1126
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,279
myself they're doing this because they

1127
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,900
they love growing and what I realized

1128
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,880
was is a lot of people in our community

1129
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,099
they do

1130
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,680
um really crunch the numbers on things

1131
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,359
and want to pick the most cost efficient

1132
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,679
option and things like that more

1133
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,420
recently

1134
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:49,799
um sort of in line with the Mantra you

1135
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,119
were talking about with the autos and

1136
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,339
like not thinking about it and sort of

1137
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,960
enjoying yourself a bit more I've tried

1138
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:57,539
to approach growing with this different

1139
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,519
mindset of like my brother he's a real

1140
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,139
Tech head he buys the newest PlayStation

1141
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,179
as soon as it comes out and he's got the

1142
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,379
newest gadgets and that's what makes him

1143
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,879
happy and that's where he spends his

1144
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,200
money on and I thought I should do the

1145
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,880
same thing with growing like I should

1146
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,199
stop trying to get the cheapest thing

1147
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,059
and approach it as like yeah it's a

1148
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,980
hobby I throw money at it and you know

1149
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,779
and I have a good time with it and I

1150
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,039
think since doing that I've sort of had

1151
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,540
a bit more fun

1152
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,460
um you know obviously I'm not spending

1153
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,079
my entire savings on growing but I'm

1154
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,820
just trying to get out of the mindset of

1155
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,859
like doing this as cheap as possible and

1156
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,119
thinking this is a hobby it's okay to

1157
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:28,799
spend a little bit of money on your

1158
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,358
hobby what's your thoughts on that

1159
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,099
mindset

1160
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:33,900
yeah I agree

1161
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,579
um I still think that if someone is

1162
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,740
trying to replace a cost in their life

1163
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,240
it's very worthwhile to do it in the

1164
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:41,039
most cost effective manner so that

1165
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:42,838
you're not lying to yourself about why

1166
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,820
you're doing it but eventually when you

1167
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,380
become a producer and you do eliminate

1168
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,300
that expense and

1169
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,400
you're happy with it I feel like it's

1170
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,900
only right to invest back into what has

1171
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
given you so much

1172
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,660
and when we look at some of these tools

1173
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,160
they make a big difference and I almost

1174
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,059
joke with friends and I'm sure you have

1175
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,940
too that

1176
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:01,739
uh these plants are making us do this

1177
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,960
they're like I want a better light go

1178
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:05,399
buy it for me you know it's like who's

1179
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,900
smarter the plants are us all of a

1180
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,338
sudden this one particular plant is

1181
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,079
overtake you know it's grown everywhere

1182
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:12,420
in the world it's given a very happy

1183
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,099
life it's able to reproduce and so from

1184
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,780
a pure survival of the fittest

1185
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,640
standpoint

1186
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,660
um that'll that old thing is are we

1187
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:20,279
growing the plants are the plants

1188
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:21,838
cultivating us so that when we all die

1189
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,180
they get to eat us you know what I mean

1190
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,578
like it's I think they'll be here longer

1191
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:27,779
and I'm not scared to invest in it as

1192
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,300
well and I've noticed big differences

1193
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,339
like quality of grow light and I call

1194
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,780
this dialing it in so when you first

1195
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:35,338
start

1196
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,740
um for me I was working at a nine to

1197
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:39,358
five and I knew that I'd need a flower

1198
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,679
tent instead of just my veg tint I was

1199
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,500
keeping genetic so I went to my grow

1200
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,618
shop and I said hey if you front me a

1201
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,539
flower tent I'll pay you and you know as

1202
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:50,280
I get over the next month but that would

1203
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:52,259
allow me to transition my plants before

1204
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,480
they were too big and miss my timeline

1205
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,040
to wait for budget and maybe not the

1206
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,599
best to do that but that worked with me

1207
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,519
and I was able to step up to the next

1208
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,800
and have a veg and a flower room and

1209
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,300
then paid them off and now I own two

1210
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
and then for me lighting was the same

1211
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,839
way I'd get a light that worked for my

1212
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,339
budget and then immediately as soon as I

1213
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:09,539
could get like a better light I'd put

1214
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:11,159
that in the flower room and then the

1215
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,659
budget budget one would go kind of to

1216
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,639
the veg area and then eventually you're

1217
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:16,019
like okay well it's really dry in

1218
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,879
Colorado maybe I should invest in

1219
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:19,199
humidity and you start tinkering with

1220
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,760
stuff that basically takes hours and

1221
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,078
it's never consistent and you go all

1222
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,060
right f it I'm gonna buy the best

1223
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,119
humidifier and you're like oh my God the

1224
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,920
plants grow so fast this is so fun so

1225
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,320
it's definitely worth it to invest some

1226
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,579
money have the funds see the results but

1227
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,440
I don't want people to hear that they're

1228
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,940
on a budget they can't do it you can

1229
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,940
crush it it's just that it is more fun

1230
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,619
to buy the latest tech and and throw it

1231
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,460
down I'm really having fun with the

1232
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:47,039
automation tools the niwa that we use

1233
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:49,139
niwa it's that power strip thing and

1234
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,460
it's really great how it automates the

1235
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,199
humidity and temperature and all these

1236
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,760
things by firing and actually

1237
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:56,098
controlling it like you're running a

1238
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,380
professional Greenhouse it's pretty cool

1239
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,579
that's awesome I love that a lot that's

1240
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,559
really cool

1241
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,660
um and yeah I would also Echo your

1242
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,659
sentiment that the reason why I get the

1243
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:08,338
most fun out of the new gear I buy is

1244
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,319
because I learned how to make good

1245
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,539
results while doing it pretty frugally

1246
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,000
and if you can do that when you get the

1247
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,699
new gear you'd just be crushing it so

1248
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,159
definitely get behind you there recently

1249
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:21,960
we had Jake and Marco of the no-till

1250
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,118
Kings come on the show they spoke very

1251
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,220
highly of you and your products I would

1252
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,539
love to hear like you know what what's

1253
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,980
your experience being working with

1254
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:30,719
facilities are you seeing any more

1255
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,940
facilities get on board it seems like

1256
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,819
they were one of the first to me can you

1257
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,639
give us a bit of a rundown on that

1258
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,280
yeah I'd say they were one of the first

1259
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,420
that that would endorse us publicly as

1260
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,740
far as like a lot of people in the

1261
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,420
beginning would never tell that they

1262
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:47,098
used any brand because they didn't want

1263
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,019
it was always like well we got to beat

1264
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,300
the we gotta have better than the people

1265
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:53,039
down the street and now that there's

1266
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,300
been a big shake up in the industry so

1267
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,880
to speak

1268
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,019
um I feel like soil Kings is always very

1269
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,940
transparent they're like yeah we use

1270
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,500
build a soul 3.0 this is what we do and

1271
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,760
they teach their whole process and they

1272
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,099
are above and beyond I mean they grind

1273
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,380
up their own stocks for mulch they

1274
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:09,059
they're really detail-oriented I'm super

1275
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,099
impressed by them

1276
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,480
um there's been hundreds of facilities

1277
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,559
that came before them and hundreds

1278
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,199
that'll come after

1279
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:18,059
but last year was definitely declined in

1280
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,578
commercial orders for us

1281
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,380
and we overcame that with

1282
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:24,180
um simultaneously we were already going

1283
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,640
to be going after the wholesale Market

1284
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:27,779
you know lawn and garden stores and we

1285
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,818
saw it as a way to provide an income

1286
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,280
stream to these garden and hydro stores

1287
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,960
that were all had the same catalog and a

1288
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,579
lot of these were just the race to the

1289
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,099
bottom as far as pricing and a lot of

1290
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,780
hydro stores closing and there's been a

1291
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,700
big shift you know during Corona people

1292
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,019
were buying a lot more Rec and medical

1293
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:45,419
herb and now that they're all back at

1294
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:47,099
work there's been a lot less sales on

1295
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,838
the commercial Side California had a

1296
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,240
huge shake up politically and the cost

1297
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:53,059
per pound and overproduction and so we

1298
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,838
saw a huge decline in commercial grows

1299
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:56,338
sometimes you'd send two three

1300
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:58,380
truckloads you'd get multiple hundred

1301
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:00,239
yard quotes and we'd be running them all

1302
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,440
over the country and not everyone fall

1303
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,118
through but a lot of people would step

1304
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,858
up and we'd be sending trucks everywhere

1305
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,260
and this year we've been sitting like

1306
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:09,598
full truckloads of cubic Footers and

1307
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,440
stuff to lawn and garden stores and a

1308
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,019
different

1309
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,059
just different right but we did the same

1310
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,440
amount of business last year's

1311
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,759
um sorry now it's two years ago as we

1312
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,000
did last year

1313
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,339
and so seeing that change

1314
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,079
um I think has me believe that there's

1315
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:26,940
probably less commercial grows as far as

1316
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,579
the numbers stepping up

1317
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,858
and even like New Mexico

1318
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:35,818
um in 2022

1319
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:37,259
really had maybe 2021 a lot of people

1320
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:39,239
just coming out of the Woodworks because

1321
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,700
some of the changes in the law and then

1322
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:43,078
all of a sudden 2022 over produced so a

1323
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:44,460
lot of people are talking tail and well

1324
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,980
how do I sell these hundreds of pounds

1325
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,539
even if they did a great job and so we

1326
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,260
always see that every state that opens

1327
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:51,239
up

1328
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:54,119
there's just a million quotes truck

1329
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,858
loads being sent out and then the tide

1330
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,960
goes out you see who's skinny-dipping

1331
00:44:55,858 --> 00:45:00,299
which in this business it's very hard

1332
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,559
not to your text to Hell your product's

1333
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,380
not getting better on the Shelf it's

1334
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,578
aging and so it's difficult and I think

1335
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,140
that while there's less commercial

1336
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,660
Growers we're still we're still selling

1337
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:11,759
a lot of commercials um soil

1338
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:13,618
uh in the beginning

1339
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,839
it was like who's gonna do it though

1340
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,240
because living soil wasn't a style

1341
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,559
now I think it's a total style and

1342
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,659
there's commercial Bros that want to do

1343
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,799
it it's a matter of how many new ones

1344
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:24,118
are opening under the current market

1345
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,680
conditions

1346
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,240
and how many new ones are opening under

1347
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,098
the current market conditions that are

1348
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,838
in love with living soil a lot of them

1349
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,059
are like spreadsheeters funded by

1350
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,400
Venture capitalists and they're just

1351
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:37,019
going to go with some hydroponic model

1352
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,880
um but in the beginning I know one of

1353
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:42,000
the first big rows that I saw do it well

1354
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,400
I'm sure you're aware of glp Nevada

1355
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,500
and so we worked with them originally

1356
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,740
and also someone from those same living

1357
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,900
organic soil forms Matt Davenport he was

1358
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,578
there with all of us on the Los forums

1359
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,318
and the whole deal had a ton of energy

1360
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,359
and I remember behind the scenes I don't

1361
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:59,279
know if he knows this or not but gas and

1362
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,779
MGD and I were like bro is this guy

1363
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,339
crazy because he was like we're gonna

1364
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,140
have facilities and it's going to be

1365
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,699
everywhere and well everything he said

1366
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:07,858
came true so he definitely wasn't crazy

1367
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,139
he was just passionate and he and I have

1368
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:12,179
a great relationship still

1369
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:13,739
um but he worked on that GOP Nevada one

1370
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:15,719
in the beginning as well and they have

1371
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,578
like 30 something Cycles going they've

1372
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,959
been able to manage the business side as

1373
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,800
well as the growing side which is very

1374
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,720
rare

1375
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,339
and then from what I can tell from

1376
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,219
outside of parents they're doing well so

1377
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:27,900
I think that the model has been proven

1378
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:29,699
um more of the grows that we work with I

1379
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,980
think are like one of them in New Mexico

1380
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:33,960
that we really love working with they

1381
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,059
got what was called a micro license and

1382
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,880
so it's really cool what they have going

1383
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,679
on they have like rolling beds that they

1384
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,619
custom built and have like four small

1385
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,940
Grow rooms with four beds in it and they

1386
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:46,500
harvest each room at a different time

1387
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,818
and they were allowed to be fully

1388
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,900
vertical in this micro license make

1389
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:50,338
their own extracts sell their own

1390
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,780
cannabis grow their own cannabis do it

1391
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,000
all Under One Roof

1392
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,040
and those types of facilities I just

1393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,380
love working with on living soil because

1394
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,179
it seems more like a Michelin star

1395
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,640
restaurant than a franchise McDonald's

1396
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:04,559
chain that's really where I think living

1397
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,259
soil shines so

1398
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,900
yeah what a what a brilliant answer I

1399
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,960
guess to to dive into some of the

1400
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,599
specifics of their style the thing that

1401
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,940
um I wouldn't say surprise me but I was

1402
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,500
intrigued to hear more about was

1403
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,358
um Jake and Mark of the soil Kings

1404
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,400
mentioned that everything they do is

1405
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,139
really based around soil tests they do

1406
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,059
it like sort of mid-cycling at the end

1407
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:29,699
of the cycle and when they top dress

1408
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,679
it's based on like a formulation to

1409
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:35,179
address that specific test they've got

1410
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:38,039
so my question is this is sort of um

1411
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:39,960
understandable on a commercial sense but

1412
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,480
it's quite in contrast to what you've

1413
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,460
taught us on your YouTube channel what

1414
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,318
would you do if you were gonna do say

1415
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,179
the micro license you just described

1416
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,039
would you want to do this really test

1417
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,559
heavy approach

1418
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,940
oh it's really tough to say what I mean

1419
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,139
by that is you can have an answer in

1420
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,460
your head and then have someone put a

1421
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,659
gun in your head and see do you still

1422
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,699
have the same answer

1423
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:00,899
and being in business is like having a

1424
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:02,699
gun to your head

1425
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,818
so I think that we do other things for

1426
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:07,259
insurance reasons to not only that but

1427
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:09,358
can you imagine having a problem in your

1428
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,359
groin not being able to tell

1429
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,679
your partner or investor why and then he

1430
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:15,239
goes well do you have any testing you're

1431
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,440
like well what the [ __ ] that for I

1432
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:18,479
just grow

1433
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,338
it it's easy to support when things are

1434
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,440
going well but it's it's hard to own

1435
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:23,940
that position when things aren't and so

1436
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,619
from a business perspective I think it's

1437
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,119
very very important to do some sort of

1438
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,858
testing

1439
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,838
um I'm not as familiar with the level of

1440
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,818
testing they do but I believe they do

1441
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:34,139
once or twice through flour which is

1442
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:35,279
significantly more than other people

1443
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:37,139
would do

1444
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,940
and there's a lot of there's a lot of

1445
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,440
things to consider there

1446
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,220
um I'd imagine I'd have to discuss it

1447
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,720
with them they're probably doing a

1448
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:45,480
saturated Pace test

1449
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:48,239
which is what's water soluble and to me

1450
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,858
that makes sense because when we do a

1451
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,719
soil test you gotta understand to take a

1452
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:53,159
thimble size scoop which might work for

1453
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,019
agricultural soil but it's very strange

1454
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,879
for potting soil we have chunky stuff in

1455
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:59,338
there and they'll either grind it or

1456
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,559
sift it and that can drastically change

1457
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:03,299
the results but the lab that we work

1458
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:07,199
with I trust their soil testing results

1459
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,760
but to test a regular soil test where

1460
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,039
they take an acid they dissolve the

1461
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,200
entire abundance of soil into when it's

1462
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,300
nutrient components would be if fully

1463
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,858
utilized over a year or 10 years or

1464
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,359
however long it took

1465
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:21,779
to me that doesn't make sense to test

1466
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:23,699
that way twice during flour because

1467
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,319
I mean it's not really exactly what the

1468
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,419
plant's tapping into it's more the soil

1469
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,219
profile but I I'd imagine what they're

1470
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,500
doing is a saturated paste test which is

1471
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:33,899
basically putting water on the soil and

1472
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,699
deciding okay if nutrients end up in the

1473
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,539
water then for sure the plant's going to

1474
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:42,179
be almost forced to take those up

1475
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:43,679
what I mean by that is typically the

1476
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,940
soil test is going to be based on cation

1477
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,679
Exchange

1478
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,019
which you could argue the plant is going

1479
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,940
to exchange with to pick up what it

1480
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:53,818
wants when it needs it so you need a

1481
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,800
balanced soil that's filling your Buffet

1482
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:57,599
but when you look at the saturated paste

1483
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,839
test it's a test in my opinion of what

1484
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,460
it's going to be forced to deal with now

1485
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:04,679
in an earth box you have clean water

1486
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,079
below and it can kind of bypass by

1487
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:07,980
taking clean water up but typical in

1488
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,920
soil

1489
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,119
especially in a smaller container those

1490
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,940
roots are going to have to drink the

1491
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,619
water for its moisture needs and that's

1492
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,960
going to come with what's water soluble

1493
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:20,220
regardless and so when you consider that

1494
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,720
it would make sense to test a couple of

1495
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:23,759
times during flower to say hey what's

1496
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,679
water soluble and you're almost looking

1497
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,180
for excesses that would cause a lack of

1498
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,980
yield because they're like too much

1499
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:31,318
sodium is being released or not enough

1500
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,599
calcium or whatever and I think that you

1501
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:34,980
could probably tailor a top dress if it

1502
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,140
was micronized enough or it had the key

1503
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,940
inputs that then you watered through and

1504
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:40,799
would stimulate a change to that but

1505
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,338
other times people are using

1506
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,260
I mean sap analysis of the leaf or

1507
00:50:44,338 --> 00:50:47,578
tissue testing and there's a lot of

1508
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,500
theories between which one's more

1509
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,240
important you know tissue is kind of a

1510
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,800
leading indicator where the sap is like

1511
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:54,479
instantaneous and it could be changing

1512
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,400
multiple times per day so who knows how

1513
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,380
accurate and then people actually custom

1514
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,940
formulate foliar sprays

1515
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,318
especially in large scale agriculture

1516
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,639
based on the parts per million in

1517
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:05,039
movement they want to see in the sap

1518
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,139
test and so I can't help but to be

1519
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,300
reminded of masinoba Fukuoka thinking

1520
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:11,219
that the smarter you get

1521
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,839
the less you know so to speak almost

1522
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,219
like going down a rabbit hole too

1523
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:16,380
narrowly minded

1524
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:18,299
I would never accuse soil Kings of doing

1525
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,400
that I bet you they're they're doing

1526
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,079
great and they're able to back up what

1527
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,400
their gut says by getting a soil test

1528
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,960
evaluation

1529
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,818
and then if you're going to be throwing

1530
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,280
an amendment at it and you have a soil

1531
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:31,019
test and something's lacking

1532
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,119
I think it'd be very hard not to want to

1533
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:34,858
add that right so the data is going to

1534
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,420
be helpful regardless

1535
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,799
um the home grower though

1536
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,940
I think if they're following basic

1537
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,339
principles

1538
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,358
they should be totally fine those basic

1539
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:44,818
principles were harder to understand

1540
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,619
until we did soil testing so build a

1541
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:48,358
soil when I first started we would just

1542
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,400
whip up Coots mix and send it to the lab

1543
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:51,719
and I'd read the soil test then it was

1544
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,400
relatively similar to what I was seeing

1545
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,019
as far as recommendations but then I'd

1546
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,059
have an expert say wow you can't grow

1547
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:58,559
that much sodium or wow this is way too

1548
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:00,839
much phosphorus or whatever the

1549
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,819
particular person would say and despite

1550
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:05,400
all of that plants grew up

1551
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:07,139
so I did kind of learn to take it with a

1552
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,119
grain of salt but we've been able to

1553
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:10,139
dramatically improve our soil to our

1554
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,940
soil

1555
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:14,338
based on the type of inputs you have to

1556
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,500
mix together by doing soil testing so

1557
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:18,838
it's a long answer and it's kind of that

1558
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,480
black belt answer of it depends I think

1559
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:23,338
commercially I would definitely do it at

1560
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,838
home it's almost like look at when you

1561
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:26,578
make dinner you know to add some protein

1562
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:28,920
some carbs veggies right like you know

1563
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:30,420
how to make a well-rounded meal if you

1564
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,920
have that basic level of understanding

1565
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,079
of soil you don't need testing you can

1566
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,220
just go at it but five percent

1567
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,260
difference

1568
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:39,358
could be a huge difference when it comes

1569
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,880
to the bottom line so soil testing would

1570
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,639
be more important on a commercial level

1571
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,559
yeah yeah hugely I can I can appreciate

1572
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,259
the the extra benefits going to bring on

1573
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,019
a commercial slash uh sort of job

1574
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,059
situation just to to round out the other

1575
00:52:52,019 --> 00:52:56,400
end of that question

1576
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,200
um one of our listeners I I suspect they

1577
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,880
may not have got around to watching your

1578
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:01,558
YouTube videos yet but they basically

1579
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,599
wanted to say could you give us a quick

1580
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,880
overview this is an Australian grower by

1581
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,280
the way if I'm not able to get a

1582
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,200
nutrient test or a soil test what's

1583
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,599
what's the general strategy for just

1584
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:15,299
reamending well this is great

1585
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,700
um so we have one YouTube episode that

1586
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,019
goes over specifically two methods I've

1587
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:21,779
done other episodes where we've done

1588
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:23,099
soil testing but I'll give you the high

1589
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,599
point and then on if you go to

1590
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,880
buildersville.com and you go to the blog

1591
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:28,619
the most recent one is like a blank blog

1592
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,880
when you click on it it's a form you put

1593
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:30,838
in your email and it gives you a free

1594
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,240
report

1595
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,578
that free report is how to make your own

1596
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,759
custom organic fertilizer

1597
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,920
that term cof custom or sorry complete

1598
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,140
organic fertilizer custom because you're

1599
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,460
making it but it's complete was taught

1600
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:46,500
by Steve Solomon the intelligent

1601
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,220
Gardener who's now out your way

1602
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,900
um

1603
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:52,318
and

1604
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:54,838
I think that that's interesting because

1605
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,880
when I reference how he teaches it it

1606
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,199
makes fundamental sense just like saying

1607
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,300
you should have some meat you know a

1608
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,159
protein you should have some greens like

1609
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,260
this is how you make a balanced meal and

1610
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,940
he said what the soil needs is your

1611
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,700
complete organic fertilizer and the way

1612
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,800
to make it is to follow these ratios

1613
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:12,598
and so you can get that report and it

1614
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,339
really does break down no matter where

1615
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:16,140
in the world you live how to make a

1616
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:18,900
complete organic fertilizer

1617
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:20,639
and so that's what we did in YouTube

1618
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,099
um this most recent series four in

1619
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:26,039
quadrant two in the three by three bed

1620
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:27,838
and the results are stunning and I'm

1621
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:29,400
happy because we just made up the top

1622
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,019
dress we didn't use craft blend we

1623
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,119
didn't use like an off-the-shelf that we

1624
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:35,159
have we made it from scratch in our

1625
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,260
YouTube video and that title is I think

1626
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:39,358
reamending two ways I think is the title

1627
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,380
of that YouTube video in season four uh

1628
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,838
more towards the beginning because it's

1629
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,700
before we planted and we grew cover crop

1630
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:46,619
on the bed and then I broke it all down

1631
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:48,000
and then I put my cus my complete

1632
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:50,099
organic fertilizer that we made on

1633
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,019
camera into the bed and I remember

1634
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:53,940
thinking man that's a lot of stuff but I

1635
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:55,440
showed how to do the math and man it's

1636
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,579
doing really really really well and

1637
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,800
we're getting a great fade on it it's

1638
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:00,660
not like we over did anything

1639
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,640
um and I'm confident we saw a soil test

1640
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:04,078
it would reveal what I'm seeing as far

1641
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,480
as plant health

1642
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,099
and part of the way we did that is also

1643
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,380
understanding that we're two feet deep

1644
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:11,818
and when it comes to soil on a farm you

1645
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,140
don't amend it two feet deep you amend

1646
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:15,358
the top six inches that's where the

1647
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:17,400
fertility is so I treat it the same way

1648
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,199
I took mine you know three by three bed

1649
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,000
which is nine cubic feet and it's two

1650
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,039
feet deep so there's 18 cubic feet in

1651
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,619
there and I only amended really the top

1652
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,440
six inches so I made my complete kit for

1653
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:30,358
four and a half cubic feet based on the

1654
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,818
you know one to two cups of nutrients

1655
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:35,039
and two to four cups of minerals and in

1656
00:55:32,818 --> 00:55:37,019
that video I break down all those ratios

1657
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,019
and in the complete report you can see

1658
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:42,179
Steve's version and then what we used to

1659
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:44,219
build a soil away to basically duplicate

1660
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:45,719
that and you don't have to go to build a

1661
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,699
soil you can just Google Steve Solomon

1662
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,139
complete organic fertilizer and you can

1663
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:51,179
find a million resources of people

1664
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:53,279
talking about him as well as his own

1665
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:55,919
website and I think he has a growing in

1666
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,359
Tasmania like a whole addition on you

1667
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,680
know how to grow in that climate so

1668
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,199
pretty cool

1669
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:02,940
yeah for sure everyone go go check out

1670
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,879
Steve Solomon

1671
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,159
um just as a cool little side note I I

1672
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,800
was doing a consultation for one of the

1673
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,480
legal medical cannabis facilities in

1674
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,859
Australia and they're in Tasmania and I

1675
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,179
was like oh you guys should hit up Steve

1676
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:18,659
Solomon and they're like we're already

1677
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:22,199
working with him I was just like yes yes

1678
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:23,818
that's so cool yeah I I will say that

1679
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,759
he's just a great guy

1680
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:28,079
um I just like zoomed them or escaped

1681
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,220
them or something and he answered and we

1682
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,780
started talking and he would answer

1683
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,578
emails and

1684
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,440
some of these unique relationships that

1685
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,119
I've developed out of my curiosity and

1686
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,980
it seems like other curious passionate

1687
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:39,720
people are when they really tell that

1688
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,639
someone's on the same path they want to

1689
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:42,358
talk to them and so Steve's been a big

1690
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,460
help

1691
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:45,719
um and he also encourages me to not take

1692
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,400
everything so seriously he mentions

1693
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,179
Organics will be the loudest but the

1694
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,280
least

1695
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:51,480
like you can put some trace minerals in

1696
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,500
some things you can work with some of

1697
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,579
these others right if you read his book

1698
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,920
you'll know what I'm saying some people

1699
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:58,440
are very pure about which amendments and

1700
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,720
he's he definitely discusses all of that

1701
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,818
but his takeaway from the Organics is of

1702
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:06,358
some is better more is great and just

1703
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:08,940
throw compost at everything and the

1704
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,578
balance of having his book while growing

1705
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,420
organically I think keeps it uh on track

1706
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,880
so

1707
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:17,039
yeah Steve's great beautiful stuff I

1708
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,960
love it I love it uh in one of the

1709
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,659
answers from one or two questions ago

1710
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,000
you mentioned a buzzword in the industry

1711
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:25,739
you said micronized one of our listeners

1712
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,800
I'm sure you've you've been dealing with

1713
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:30,779
this a lot uh our buddy slow nickel on

1714
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,000
Instagram has been causing quite a stir

1715
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,220
with his discussions around soluble

1716
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,719
calcium and micronized calcium are you

1717
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,480
able to weigh in on that first at all

1718
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,338
give us your thoughts got it love to

1719
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,260
I'd love to but

1720
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:45,179
um the guy hates me has blocked me won't

1721
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,740
talk to me and so I basically have no

1722
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:48,239
idea he exists because I can't see

1723
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:49,799
anything

1724
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,558
um but he's been talking calcium forever

1725
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,818
so it makes a ton of sense to me and I

1726
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,040
really don't know why he's blocked me

1727
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:57,659
he's told me that we had a gentleman

1728
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,219
here Zach Branson it's been here forever

1729
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:01,199
in customer service

1730
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:02,699
and he was doing some of our soil

1731
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:04,318
testing analysis using a lot of my

1732
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:06,179
methodology and during that time he

1733
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,679
picked up the soil test calculator

1734
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,000
online

1735
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,919
um that was talked about I think by

1736
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,960
Steve Solomon and others and he was

1737
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,599
using that as part of his analysis and

1738
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,519
basically slow nickel reached out and

1739
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,260
told me that we were ripping people off

1740
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,460
by using some online calculator to do

1741
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,040
his job

1742
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,599
and I I just can't imagine that he

1743
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:25,980
thinks that simply he has to know that I

1744
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,940
was super passionate about it he also

1745
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:32,519
worked the local grower out here and had

1746
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,139
that me make a soil mix for that grower

1747
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:35,880
and I suspect that he thinks we took

1748
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,078
some of that Tech into our building soil

1749
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,880
products

1750
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,559
but realistically I was learning from

1751
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,298
him since day one and the main thing

1752
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,859
that I take from him is that calcium is

1753
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:46,679
super [ __ ] important he just pounds

1754
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:48,900
it in your head and I cannot discount

1755
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:50,639
him for that at all and from an

1756
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,838
agricultural level foliar sprays make a

1757
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,058
lot of sense right because you can

1758
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,578
bypass soil issues so I think people

1759
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:58,619
would lean on that but from a you know

1760
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,298
ideal perspective where you can get a

1761
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,700
potting soil design with lots of calcium

1762
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:05,519
in it low gypsum like you would prefer

1763
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:07,739
and not put as much pressure on a crop

1764
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,539
by having an abundance of soil I haven't

1765
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:11,098
seen like a huge reason why you're going

1766
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:13,079
to need to hammer foliar sprays of

1767
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:16,318
micronized calcium but I've certainly

1768
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:19,200
tried some products I have not tried his

1769
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:21,298
um there are further organic mix a

1770
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,858
calcium carbonate micronized powder that

1771
00:59:21,298 --> 00:59:24,539
is suspendable and foliable it's been

1772
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,920
around for a while

1773
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:28,920
um I don't like the carbonates as much

1774
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,659
and I suspect you know a stereo would

1775
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,240
not as well

1776
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:34,920
um and also slow nickel sorry I was

1777
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:36,539
thinking um the ideal soil for a minute

1778
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,579
I get some of the agronomist

1779
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:40,798
interchanged in my mind but

1780
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:42,720
micronization makes sense to me in this

1781
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:44,880
like a protein shake does for a human

1782
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,379
right it takes effort to break down a

1783
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,818
stake in your stomach but it's pretty

1784
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,858
easy when it's ground down into

1785
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:51,119
basically powder that's so fine you

1786
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:52,500
drink it in liquid

1787
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,059
and that's part of what I mentioned

1788
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,219
before how you get a faster result from

1789
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:58,200
some of these powders so micronization

1790
00:59:56,219 --> 01:00:00,179
does make sense soil biology like if

1791
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:01,618
you're going to make compost you don't

1792
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,058
want to put a whole branch in there to

1793
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:04,980
make compost you want to chop it up into

1794
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:06,540
wood chips this is the same exact thing

1795
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,858
it creates more surface area for the

1796
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:09,179
biology to work on which means you're

1797
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:10,078
going to get a faster more duplicatable

1798
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:12,659
result

1799
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,818
so micronization is huge foliar sprays

1800
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:16,440
they make a lot of sense to me

1801
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:18,119
um and they certainly make sense under

1802
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,400
corrective conditions or when there's a

1803
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,559
soil issue if I've ever over watered

1804
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,119
I'll immediately bust out like aminos

1805
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,619
and a calcium foliar and make sure that

1806
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,858
I can try and get nutrition to the plant

1807
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:30,720
well maybe I can't drink on its own

1808
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,940
um but as far as his specific

1809
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,379
conversation I've got no clue I'd

1810
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,179
imagine it's a little bit the same that

1811
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,280
he's always been discussing

1812
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:41,279
yeah look I think you you covered the

1813
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,559
dot points really nicely just there I um

1814
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,680
I wanted to to change topics for a

1815
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:48,660
moment because you have inspired both me

1816
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,879
and a number of other people to sort of

1817
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:53,460
give uh growing their own vegetables a

1818
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,599
good whack and I like the uh the idea if

1819
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,639
you're growing cannabis you can

1820
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,200
definitely grow your own veggies so I

1821
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,358
think many people including myself over

1822
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:03,118
the past two years have been following

1823
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:05,460
your adventure with the family farms can

1824
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,619
you give us just some of the dot points

1825
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,539
of what you've learned and uh just any

1826
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,880
thoughts in terms of encouraging people

1827
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:12,960
to grow some of their own food yeah

1828
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,519
definitely

1829
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,559
um my wife runs the farm

1830
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,179
she knows a lot more and has learned all

1831
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,519
these lessons firsthand about how hard

1832
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:22,379
the work is how much planning's involved

1833
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:24,179
but I will tell you she's upped my

1834
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:26,519
belief in what we do because of the

1835
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:29,098
success that she's able to produce

1836
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,960
and she's always had just a knack like

1837
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,119
when we first met at our first dinner

1838
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,858
we're talking about growing plants it

1839
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,599
ended up you know visiting her and

1840
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:38,400
finding out that she had like it just

1841
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:39,900
cupboard full of jars from an outdoor

1842
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,940
that she'd pulled down and I was like I

1843
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,519
would love but it really took it a step

1844
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:47,099
further when I saw what looked like a

1845
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,858
hydroponic catalog magazine photo shoot

1846
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,920
of tomatoes growing on one Vine up to

1847
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:55,139
the ceiling with just a rainbow of rasta

1848
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,838
from red to Yellow to green and every

1849
01:01:55,139 --> 01:02:00,239
color of transition I just I really did

1850
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,380
think that these cocoa nutrient Growers

1851
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:02,519
were the only ones that could fill a

1852
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,200
greenhouse like that and I thought

1853
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:05,880
organic tomato production might look

1854
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,798
like just bushes

1855
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,140
and when she started doing what I found

1856
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:11,880
out was the training and obviously

1857
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:12,960
training is huge when it comes to indoor

1858
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,880
growing as well you can just grow

1859
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,280
naturally that's fine it's fun but when

1860
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,838
you manage a slightly more flat canopy

1861
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,798
that's even to our light you get more

1862
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:22,858
yield

1863
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:25,079
and so when I saw her start to manage

1864
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:27,058
the single lead on the tomato plant and

1865
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:29,818
tie them to the string and attach them

1866
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:31,980
and get them to grow and knowing that

1867
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:33,719
underneath was just worms and some of

1868
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,059
the Amendments we'd put in following the

1869
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:38,459
typical living soil Style

1870
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:40,319
it was unbelievable the production level

1871
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,599
and it spent every year and the

1872
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,219
cucumbers and then in that group it just

1873
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,880
really upped my level of belief I'm like

1874
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:49,379
oh my God this works phenomenally well

1875
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,380
and

1876
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:54,119
coupling that with the fact that

1877
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,858
um in the outdoor field you can get good

1878
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:57,838
results as well based on some limited

1879
01:02:55,858 --> 01:03:00,179
soil testing and some basic amendments

1880
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:01,380
and up my belief in that building soil

1881
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:04,019
is very very possible for the average

1882
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,519
person our alkaline soil and this

1883
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:07,440
basically parking lot we built the the

1884
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,838
front area in not parking lot it was

1885
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,980
just flat compacted dirt when we did a

1886
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:13,199
soil test and saw that there was like

1887
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,760
not excessive sodium or any problem we

1888
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,858
amended each bed with a little bit of

1889
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,540
compost tiny bit of peat just because

1890
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:21,058
it's acidic and adds organic matter and

1891
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:22,318
there's very low organic matter and we

1892
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:23,940
put some basic amendments in and were

1893
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:25,440
able to produce that year

1894
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,059
uh we could have waited and cover

1895
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,559
cropped and you know done the slower

1896
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:30,960
process but we wanted to produce results

1897
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,819
right away and when that worked I was

1898
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,019
thinking oh my goodness all this stuff

1899
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:36,119
works everything we've been learning

1900
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:38,579
about indoors it translates fully to

1901
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:40,619
outdoors and it allowed me to gain

1902
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:42,539
confidence from her activity all the

1903
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:43,740
hard work she put in

1904
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:45,239
um I will say some of the things that I

1905
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:47,818
didn't see coming was like

1906
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:49,019
you know to have perfect lettuce beds

1907
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:50,519
and to be able to harvest them well we

1908
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:52,679
can't use mulch in there because now you

1909
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,358
need us it's basically covered like the

1910
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:56,578
soil doesn't need mulch if it's covered

1911
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:58,619
by the living plants it's a living mulch

1912
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:00,359
but if you're using a greens Harvester

1913
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:03,119
for a restaurant and it starts cutting

1914
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:04,858
up straw in there like that's not ideal

1915
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,838
um or rocks you know you're trying to

1916
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:07,980
use a seating machine obviously plants

1917
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:09,179
grow through it in your backyard you

1918
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,159
don't need to pick all the rocks out you

1919
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,078
just plant the seeds but when you start

1920
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,539
running down a row perfectly straight

1921
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:17,700
with exact spacing on a seed machine

1922
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:19,380
that's gonna you know divot the soil and

1923
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:22,500
drop a couple seeds in and go on the

1924
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:25,140
next one rock you know I mean it's just

1925
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,119
it fumbles and so now you can see

1926
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:28,500
dialing it in instead of in an indoor

1927
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,358
tent where it's like what's the humidity

1928
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,338
what's the temperature you cannot

1929
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:34,019
control that Outdoors what you can

1930
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:37,078
control is the Tilt the texture the

1931
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:39,599
uniformity of seating the uh watering

1932
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:40,500
and every single lesson that she's

1933
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,599
learned over there and we've

1934
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,519
brainstormed together has been harder

1935
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,960
than anticipated so

1936
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:48,358
um for what it's worth I think it's

1937
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,579
really rewarding but it's also not in

1938
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:51,480
our on our own personal it's not in our

1939
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,039
house

1940
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,480
and the only thing that I think would be

1941
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,759
more rewarding is if it was like a true

1942
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,719
Farm where your house is there and your

1943
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,160
crops are there because you can give

1944
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,358
them so much more love in the evenings

1945
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:02,460
and spend time walking through the

1946
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,719
greenhouse and we live far enough away

1947
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,818
where we kind of miss out on some of

1948
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:07,858
that opportunity so just things that

1949
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:10,440
we've that I'm observing

1950
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:13,440
I love it brilliant message there and I

1951
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,539
guess I'd love to ask you I know that in

1952
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,400
myself I tried to grow my own fruit and

1953
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:19,019
veggies a few years ago and I think fun

1954
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,760
like when I was growing so I had the

1955
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:22,980
skills but I think the error I made was

1956
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,079
I selected all the wrong stuff you know

1957
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,639
stuff I don't stuff that doesn't produce

1958
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:28,619
lots of fruit or stuff that doesn't grow

1959
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,058
quick what are your recommendations for

1960
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,280
things that are gonna you know earn

1961
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,599
their spot in a little home Garden I

1962
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,740
think what's important in a home Garden

1963
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,780
is

1964
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:37,979
you know the way that we live it's

1965
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,079
unlikely that you're going to replace

1966
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:42,119
100 of your meals from your garden

1967
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,740
unless you really have this desire to do

1968
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:46,140
so and that's fine I encourage you to do

1969
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:47,899
that but I don't want that to take away

1970
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:50,400
from your desire to grow because

1971
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,960
sometimes it's all or nothing and if you

1972
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,160
throw that idea out the window and think

1973
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,318
okay as long as I get some production

1974
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:56,759
now it becomes which crops could I

1975
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:59,159
actually add to a lot of the meals that

1976
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,440
I already eat and in essence eat living

1977
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:03,298
vital food full of enzymes full of the

1978
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,940
beneficial bacteria that was on it no

1979
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:07,139
pesticides like this is the goods this

1980
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,940
is what you want to eat

1981
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:10,259
and since gut health is important I

1982
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,760
think even some is better than none

1983
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,380
because you're stimulating that biology

1984
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,599
you're adding all these natural foods

1985
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,220
and they're harvested minutes ago or

1986
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,140
hours ago instead of shipped all around

1987
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:21,480
and you know I think the food kind of

1988
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:23,460
dies it's like vital

1989
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,980
when you eat it fresh out of your own

1990
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:27,358
garden and so with that regard like I

1991
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:29,699
think every single person should grow

1992
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:31,440
some sort of mixed greens

1993
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:33,358
in a small space and you can come

1994
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,700
Harvest them and in fact they need to be

1995
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:38,338
harvested often if they're not they'll

1996
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:39,719
bolt and they grow unwieldy and so

1997
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:41,699
learning that I would just Harvest even

1998
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:43,858
if I didn't need it which would have me

1999
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:44,699
eating more but what you can do is you

2000
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:45,719
know you can add them on your

2001
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:47,038
cheeseburger you can add them in your

2002
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:48,899
tacos you can add them with your eggs

2003
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,880
you can add them at two meals that you

2004
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,619
may already be making instead of trying

2005
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,358
to change your entire life philosophy

2006
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:56,280
overnight to eat only vegetables from

2007
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:57,538
your garden the other thing I notice is

2008
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,920
a lot of us want to grow really cool

2009
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:00,480
plants that we've never heard of because

2010
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,260
that's really fun but then we end up not

2011
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,460
eating it because you're like I don't

2012
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,720
even know how to cook this I'm not sure

2013
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,519
when it's going to be ready for Harvest

2014
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,078
and

2015
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:08,579
um so I think that what's most important

2016
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,559
is stick to the basics of stuff that

2017
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:13,019
you're actually going to eat and grow

2018
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,059
that at a minimum so that you at least

2019
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:17,519
get that benefit and for me greens

2020
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:19,019
really stimulate a lot of what I eat and

2021
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:20,038
it's super quick

2022
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:21,239
um radishes are great because they're

2023
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:22,799
really fast but not everybody likes the

2024
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:24,298
flavor profile chopping them up and

2025
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,759
learning new ways to cook is part of

2026
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:30,179
that adding them to Tacos

2027
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,559
um and then Tomatoes while I love

2028
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:33,719
I feel like the stuff that produces

2029
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:35,099
consistently day in and day out can be a

2030
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:36,719
little bit more rewarding so that's why

2031
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:38,519
I mentioned the greens

2032
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,798
um having your own carrots delicious but

2033
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:42,059
it does take a long time and so you have

2034
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,099
to look at the number of sea you know

2035
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:45,059
days that it takes to produce and that

2036
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,559
can kind of take away from it because

2037
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,940
you wait all year then you get 10

2038
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,319
carrots and you eat them and it's done

2039
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,720
right so

2040
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:52,739
um they do last a while but

2041
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:55,919
um

2042
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:57,179
I just do think that I I focused on like

2043
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,980
tomatoes and peppers when I first

2044
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:01,558
started gardening and not the lettuce

2045
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:02,818
and now mainly I just plant like lettuce

2046
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,079
right away because it grows so quick and

2047
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:06,358
I can eat it without you know all the

2048
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,559
meals so I guess consider that grow

2049
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:09,779
stuff that you're actually going to eat

2050
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:12,119
and you'll be really well rewarded

2051
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,640
yeah nice nice that's that's exactly

2052
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,440
what I've gotten to I I wrote down all

2053
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:17,939
the the veggies I eat regularly and then

2054
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,579
figured which ones grow quickly and went

2055
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:22,619
from there and I guess my my one I pass

2056
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:24,479
on to people is Lebanese cucumbers God

2057
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:26,579
you get like a new cucumber every two

2058
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:29,159
days or so if if you like salad it's a

2059
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:30,359
good one and pickles you can make

2060
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:31,979
pickles out of all the Cucumbers you

2061
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:34,199
know I mean they're so good just quick

2062
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:35,639
ones too even in vinegar my lady just

2063
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:38,639
made the first jar of pickles yesterday

2064
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,039
you're a mind reader ah good okay that's

2065
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,319
cool so I wanted to ask you so I grew I

2066
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,819
grew these cucumbers outside and um it

2067
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,500
was all right you know it was in just

2068
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:48,120
like just some soil in the front of my

2069
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,880
house and it was you know it was all

2070
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:52,619
right but then I got a high quality soil

2071
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,319
um from organic gardening Solutions it's

2072
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:57,420
essentially the same as your 3.0 blend I

2073
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:59,640
got so much more cucumbers from it it

2074
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,759
was insane and so I wanted to ask you

2075
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,319
have you ever done like a basic analysis

2076
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:06,479
and figured out like do you get a return

2077
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,100
big enough to Merit buying a high

2078
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,379
quality soil or do you think you should

2079
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,600
just use what you got keep it cheap

2080
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:14,039
because it's for food and you know like

2081
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,179
you just just plant more plants or

2082
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:17,399
whatever

2083
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,899
I don't know um no I've never done a you

2084
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,420
know in a mathematical analysis to

2085
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:23,338
determine because I just want the best

2086
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,600
um and I want to produce the best and I

2087
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:26,219
really enjoy that knowing that

2088
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,279
everything in there that's going into it

2089
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:31,500
I agree with but someone hypocritical

2090
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,880
um on our vegetable farm the Cucumbers

2091
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,560
were in just that native soil that we

2092
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,600
amended and they are gangbuster the

2093
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,279
production level it's unbelievable but

2094
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,259
we did put premium compost and

2095
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:41,520
amendments in there

2096
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,079
um I think at the end of the day you got

2097
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,819
to do what makes you happy and if you're

2098
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,979
growing for food purposes I at least

2099
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:48,298
want it to not be lacking in key you

2100
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:50,278
know elements that would either lead to

2101
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:51,539
an unhealthy plant or something that's

2102
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:52,920
not going to last as long in the shelf

2103
01:09:51,539 --> 01:09:54,960
and I'll tell you from the vegetable

2104
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,460
farm when my wife produces it the

2105
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,380
lettuce lasts for weeks in the fridge

2106
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:00,779
the cucumbers are unbelievably good

2107
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,340
texture and last much longer so there's

2108
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:04,139
certainly benefit to having a nutrient

2109
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,760
dense food

2110
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,500
um I think what happens is in these

2111
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,060
cheaper soils it's not like you're

2112
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,880
getting just less you're getting

2113
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,620
imbalance and excesses

2114
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,600
um excesses and sodium other things that

2115
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:18,899
just cause a lack in production flowers

2116
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,000
to fall off disease to set in and so on

2117
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:22,379
on one hand it's almost like if you buy

2118
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,020
a tool that doesn't completely do the

2119
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,340
job you've come wasted all of your money

2120
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,080
but if you spend a little more on a

2121
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,520
premium tool and at least does the job

2122
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:30,840
and does it well I don't think you can

2123
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,900
call that wasting

2124
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:36,300
and so I always consider it like that

2125
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:37,979
um but man when it comes to production I

2126
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,659
really feel like you can get away with

2127
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:41,218
some very cost effective things you can

2128
01:10:39,658 --> 01:10:42,479
make your own compost you can make your

2129
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:43,859
own amendments it takes more effort

2130
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,718
there's an exchange there right there's

2131
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:48,420
always some opportunity cost

2132
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:51,359
but um I do get much better results too

2133
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:53,340
and using our more premium soil

2134
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,658
yeah there you go proof's in the pudding

2135
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:56,579
I love that

2136
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:59,579
um just the last sort of question on

2137
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:01,619
this General topic uh both the listeners

2138
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:04,559
and myself had sort of had this common

2139
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:07,380
observation that Builder soil is moving

2140
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,320
very much in this more uh education

2141
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,579
orientated Direction Where not just are

2142
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,439
you selling the products but you really

2143
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:16,079
want to try to educate people on how to

2144
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,279
use them and all the the nuts and bolts

2145
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:19,500
behind the scene

2146
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:21,779
was this the end goal for you or did it

2147
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:23,399
just sort of come about like that

2148
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:25,738
I think it's always been the goal but

2149
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:27,479
it's also out of necessity and that

2150
01:11:25,738 --> 01:11:28,799
you know you sell a lot of products

2151
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:30,419
people buy them and use them but you

2152
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,400
sell gardening products and people have

2153
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,279
some very strange questions and they

2154
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,000
want to know exactly what to do and

2155
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:37,800
um

2156
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,238
you know it's hard to have all of our

2157
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,560
customer service even though they are

2158
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:44,759
Growers

2159
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:47,280
they have different styles and so to put

2160
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,320
the Builder soil away instead of in

2161
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,300
place was to allow

2162
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,579
freedom for our customers to understand

2163
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:56,100
how I might answer their question and

2164
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:57,658
help them along the way but since the

2165
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,400
beginning Builders Falls really our goal

2166
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:01,979
was to help Empower organic minded

2167
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:04,439
Growers with the best quality products

2168
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:06,238
and free education

2169
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:07,738
um in the beginning it was more every

2170
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,419
single person I talked to I'd educate

2171
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:10,919
but when there's hundreds of thousands

2172
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,980
it makes a lot more sense to document

2173
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,359
and start to build on that so it's a

2174
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:17,459
Natural Evolution I don't know if it was

2175
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,839
our plan from the beginning but Dean

2176
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,060
helped with YouTube and we were already

2177
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,560
building some other education content so

2178
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,600
we're just going to keep going down that

2179
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,739
path and see how it works for us I think

2180
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,900
that making things more accessible

2181
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:29,459
really really helps

2182
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:31,559
um a lot of people might want to try to

2183
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,000
grow the organic way but when they go to

2184
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,640
the hydro store and they're given a part

2185
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,560
A and Part B with exact directions from

2186
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,760
start to finish it can give them that

2187
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,780
confidence looking three months in the

2188
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,100
future how they're going to make it all

2189
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,500
the way to the end they have an exact

2190
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:45,120
method to follow and when it came to the

2191
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,460
organic style I was like well good luck

2192
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,719
you have to be a weirdo and read all

2193
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:51,420
this stuff and understand this versus

2194
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,219
that and so I think that kept a lot of

2195
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,779
people out of it which

2196
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:56,880
kind of is why I was cool not everybody

2197
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:59,039
could do it but at the end of the day I

2198
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,179
would rather that 80 of people that

2199
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:01,439
would avoid that because of all the

2200
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:03,719
effort I want them to experience the

2201
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,279
benefits as well and so the education I

2202
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:06,300
think really brings it down to a level

2203
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,679
where

2204
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,840
you know a lot of people out there make

2205
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,859
these scientific posts about calcium and

2206
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,319
phosphorus and all these different

2207
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:16,079
things I was taught a long time ago that

2208
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:17,639
what we're after is the results not I

2209
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:19,079
mean don't get me wrong I can geek out

2210
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,820
on the science all day I really like it

2211
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:21,960
but the average customer they just want

2212
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:24,899
to know will this work and how do I do

2213
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:27,658
it not the science behind every single

2214
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:29,460
detail now as you get success

2215
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:31,319
it allows you that freedom to start to

2216
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,060
be very curious but I remember my first

2217
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:35,399
grow it was like how do I get herb now

2218
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,780
like you know I just I want to justify

2219
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:38,039
this light and those seeds I just bought

2220
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,139
and I need production

2221
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:41,279
and then after that when you realize you

2222
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,659
could be growing all the time and you

2223
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,300
have more than enough I think you start

2224
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:48,539
to really ask a lot deeper questions so

2225
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:50,699
yeah definitely I um I can relate to

2226
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:53,340
that hugely

2227
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:55,678
um I wanted to touch on this topic

2228
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,719
because it seems like amendments and

2229
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,179
strains and fashion it comes back

2230
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:02,640
periodically we've seen a lot of focal

2231
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:06,060
discussion more recently around the

2232
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,679
age-old White Ash debate

2233
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,179
what's your thoughts on this has it

2234
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,859
changed at all do you think if you're

2235
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:13,199
growing organically does it does it

2236
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:15,960
matter like because my I've actually

2237
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:18,059
never seen properly Organic Grown Bud

2238
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,100
that doesn't go to White Ash so maybe it

2239
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,420
just doesn't apply to us but like what's

2240
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,579
your thoughts

2241
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:25,699
I don't know this one's hard

2242
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:25,698
um

2243
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:30,718
I feel like it doesn't matter but I also

2244
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,579
even when I say it I feel like it kind

2245
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,140
of does

2246
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:35,760
um I've definitely seen some organic

2247
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,079
that won't burn all the way down to a

2248
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,600
white ash and part of that is the method

2249
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:41,460
in what it's smoked a lot of times you

2250
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,679
know you just put a lighter to a bowl

2251
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:45,719
and you kind of just burn the good stuff

2252
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,279
off it may not incinerate all the way

2253
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:48,600
down to its white ash by really

2254
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:50,639
exhausting it like you would if you put

2255
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,620
it in a joint where it burns all the way

2256
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,900
through

2257
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:56,340
um and certain time certain herbs I've

2258
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:57,960
just rolled up and they don't burn as

2259
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,880
white as others and I think that's some

2260
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,679
of that's genetic

2261
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,960
um and I do know that if I smoke some

2262
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,579
hydro and it's burning solid white like

2263
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,399
just white white and it seems light on

2264
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:09,779
the inhale I almost feel like it's like

2265
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:11,460
like a light cigarette or something like

2266
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:12,899
it's just like a light like I'm gonna

2267
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,219
explain that like yes there is like a

2268
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:16,198
cleanly feel to that maybe that's what

2269
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:18,840
they're getting at but it's seriously

2270
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:20,819
greasy potent terpy herb kind of has a

2271
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,719
tingle to it you know even if it burns

2272
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:24,000
White

2273
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:25,619
and so it's hard to relate one thing you

2274
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
can say oh it's easier on your lungs and

2275
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:28,559
it's clean because that's how you know

2276
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm like well some of the most potent

2277
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,679
herb makes me I mean it makes me want to

2278
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
take my jacket off and cough and

2279
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,859
everything else just because it was

2280
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,079
strong and it depends on the time of day

2281
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:39,539
all these things

2282
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:40,679
um so I can't pin it down exactly I do

2283
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:42,600
think that some of the arguments like

2284
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:44,039
tobacco it's the leaf so nitrogen

2285
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,140
content may make some difference there

2286
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:48,840
we're smoking the flour and there's

2287
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:51,840
resin and all these different things

2288
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,640
um also when you do like a tissue test

2289
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,840
you know there's not it's not like you

2290
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,920
see all these elements in there that

2291
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,340
you're going to reduce down to some

2292
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,679
ridiculous level and flushing oftentimes

2293
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:03,239
just cause mobilization of the nutrients

2294
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,340
that are in the leaf to move into the

2295
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:07,439
flower and it's still consuming it

2296
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:09,000
so at the end of the day I will say that

2297
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,779
when I have a good harvest and I let it

2298
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,760
go

2299
01:16:09,779 --> 01:16:13,559
all the way to senescence I let it

2300
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,800
complete its life cycle it seems like I

2301
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,699
always burn white it's enjoyable

2302
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,079
um and there's other people that are

2303
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,339
like one Speck of black in there it

2304
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,260
means it doesn't burn white and I'm just

2305
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,179
like whatever is the herb good you know

2306
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,520
like does it taste good does it get you

2307
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:29,158
high do you enjoy it

2308
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,080
um so that's really my answer it's very

2309
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:32,759
vague just because I don't have a

2310
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,260
one-sided opinion there I've smoked so

2311
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,400
much herb that didn't follow every one

2312
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,400
of these rules

2313
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:40,379
and my opinion is is it good and do you

2314
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:43,559
like it and that's what's most important

2315
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:45,300
I love that you uh you took me back to

2316
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,280
that famous story of like I think it was

2317
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,800
like the 2015 Emerald cup or something

2318
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:51,840
where like the winning sample was found

2319
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,699
to have mold in it and the judges were

2320
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,380
like I just picked little bits of Bud

2321
01:16:53,698 --> 01:16:57,658
around the side of the mold you know

2322
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:58,920
still great smoke like obviously not the

2323
01:16:57,658 --> 01:17:00,899
exact same but it goes to prove the

2324
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,340
point like is it good that's the

2325
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:04,799
question you know like there's all these

2326
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,800
other variables but um interesting stuff

2327
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:10,199
there so I had a bit of a technical run

2328
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,659
for you in Australia it's it's notably

2329
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:14,879
hard to find certain types of bone meal

2330
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:16,799
fish bone meal what you find is a few

2331
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,300
companies um I don't know whether it's

2332
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,520
just a mistake or whether it's like

2333
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:23,520
purposely misadvertising it but they'll

2334
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:26,100
sell fish meal so just the whole fish so

2335
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,980
there's like a lot of nitrogen in it and

2336
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:32,039
relatively a small amount of bone in it

2337
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:33,599
my question is if if bone meal is a

2338
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:36,060
little harder to find and someone's

2339
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:39,120
looking to get a nice organic source of

2340
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,460
phosphorus in their mixture I

2341
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:42,719
historically have recommended wheat bran

2342
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,060
because there's certain varieties that

2343
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,140
have nice phosphorus in it what's your

2344
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,300
thoughts on that do you have something

2345
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:50,699
you might opt for instead

2346
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,100
yeah we use an organic rice bran that

2347
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:54,359
was six percent available phosphorus and

2348
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,860
I mean you gotta understand when you're

2349
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,719
talking available that's a high number

2350
01:17:55,859 --> 01:17:58,859
because you buy like calcium phosphate

2351
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:01,679
mineral and it'll be three percent

2352
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:03,839
available 20 total so getting double

2353
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,119
that out of an organic brand I thought

2354
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,679
wow that's pretty cool so I've recently

2355
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:08,880
keyed into the brand thing and that's

2356
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,199
what we use

2357
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,000
part of that is because some of the

2358
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:13,738
phosphorus sources can have heavy metals

2359
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,859
in them and we want to avoid that at all

2360
01:18:13,738 --> 01:18:18,359
costs calcium phosphate has some cadmium

2361
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,639
in it depending on the source can go up

2362
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:22,139
and down and at the same mind can

2363
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,340
fluctuate a little bit so we've stayed

2364
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,600
away from that in our soil recipes

2365
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,060
although

2366
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,920
calcium phosphate has a very high

2367
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:31,020
reputation when it comes to soil testing

2368
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,158
books and building soil and the energy

2369
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,800
and

2370
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:36,539
so part of me wants to to stick with

2371
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,520
that that mineral colloidal that clay

2372
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:40,619
based version but I also want to be as

2373
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,900
clean as possible so those are where

2374
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:44,760
some of those nuances come from bone

2375
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:46,920
meal I think provides really good

2376
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,659
calcium and phosphorus but I know I

2377
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,279
could be wrong but I think Down Under

2378
01:18:48,658 --> 01:18:52,738
the phosphorus

2379
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:53,880
it's a bigger deal like there's it's not

2380
01:18:52,738 --> 01:18:55,500
as naturally high in phosphorus

2381
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,880
ecosystem it could affect the water more

2382
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,158
like there's problems I think even

2383
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,420
fertilizer companies are restricted on

2384
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:04,319
the level of phosphorus that they can

2385
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:05,819
offer on even like hydroponic nutrients

2386
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,979
um so

2387
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:09,479
maybe that's partly why some of the bone

2388
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:11,339
meal is not as popular right because

2389
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:12,779
spreading copious levels of phosphorus

2390
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:14,340
across the farm may not have produced an

2391
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:17,158
industry where it's available

2392
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:18,960
but I will notice when I test a fishbone

2393
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:20,579
meal that I purchase here versus fish

2394
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,600
meal sometimes I'll see very similar

2395
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:23,219
numbers

2396
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,719
and one appears to be a lot more bone

2397
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:25,980
but sometimes you know it's not perfect

2398
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,300
and so

2399
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:28,738
it is interesting you will see some

2400
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,600
nitrogen sometimes even in the bone meal

2401
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:32,339
here so it's not perfect across the

2402
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,260
board but they seem to always have the

2403
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,119
phosphorus they promise because they're

2404
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,960
going towards a minimum guarantee on the

2405
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:39,000
label

2406
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,319
but when it comes to minimum guarantee

2407
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,300
they can be a lot higher without any

2408
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:47,698
penalty so someone could tell you this

2409
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:49,679
is a one a 10-2 well it could have a 10

2410
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:51,479
10 too and it's not a problem they only

2411
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,920
guaranteed at least it have one they

2412
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:54,658
didn't tell you that nine percent more

2413
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,520
than they promised that could be a

2414
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:57,960
problem if you're calculating and buying

2415
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,760
it you'd have wished to known what the

2416
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,579
extra was in there so testing on your

2417
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,840
own on big farms is advisable but

2418
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:05,519
um heavy metals are the inverse

2419
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,600
depending on which state

2420
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,920
um

2421
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,260
in fact I was just having a conversation

2422
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,179
about this but Washington manages you to

2423
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,920
tell tell them the maximum that it could

2424
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:15,658
be and if you ever go over it that's a

2425
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,460
problem so that led to a lot of people

2426
01:20:15,658 --> 01:20:19,079
saying well okay the max is here I'm

2427
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,100
testing here but if it ever fluctuates

2428
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:22,019
I'm safe

2429
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,219
where on the NPK it's the opposite you

2430
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,260
say well I'll pick the lowest number

2431
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:27,420
because if it ever goes over I'm fine I

2432
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:30,060
always must be over so understanding

2433
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:31,440
that might be helpful but um phosphorus

2434
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:33,360
so

2435
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,279
there was some companies trying to make

2436
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:38,698
organic phosphorus sources out of like

2437
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:40,679
seeds and maybe some capacity there but

2438
01:20:38,698 --> 01:20:42,359
the seed meals that we've tested seem to

2439
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:43,679
not be very high in it

2440
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:45,719
um one material that seemed to come back

2441
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:48,119
pretty well was the insect fresh

2442
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:50,399
not as much as the brand but it did have

2443
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:52,800
more diversity there and I feel like the

2444
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,719
brand it makes our soul heat up

2445
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:59,279
probably because the carbon

2446
01:20:54,719 --> 01:21:01,198
and so that's not you know terrible but

2447
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,399
um that's one thing that the bone meal

2448
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:04,198
doesn't quite do the same right it

2449
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:05,399
doesn't come as much carbon it's just

2450
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:06,779
bone meal

2451
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:08,879
so that's something to consider and I

2452
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,198
would carry steamed bone meal but I

2453
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,760
can't find any it's not like there's any

2454
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,799
farms that are saying this is just from

2455
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,360
cattle that have been fed organically no

2456
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,920
it's like Pig and cattle and everything

2457
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:19,019
fed everything and it's just some big

2458
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:22,140
facility so that's part of why I've

2459
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:24,000
stayed away with fish bone meal the

2460
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,860
sodium can be a little bit an issue but

2461
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,420
most companies that produce a good

2462
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:28,859
product it's not really a problem it's

2463
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,300
just more against the soil test if

2464
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:31,799
you're already high sodium there could

2465
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:35,039
be other advantages

2466
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:38,279
and then like foliar spray

2467
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:40,198
yeah really soil I guess

2468
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:41,399
like Organics alive has some powders and

2469
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:43,079
stuff but that's very different than

2470
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:44,519
asking about amendments so it's funny

2471
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:45,840
you mentioned bran

2472
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,780
um because that's where we've added into

2473
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,100
3.0 and all these others to keep P High

2474
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:51,300
while we pulled some of the other

2475
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,699
materials that could fluctuate with

2476
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:55,619
heavy metals yeah nice now I'm really

2477
01:21:53,698 --> 01:21:57,238
glad to hear that because I I was

2478
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,500
worried for the past few years I might

2479
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:01,500
have been uh giving out the wrong

2480
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:04,380
recommendation well in some brand uh

2481
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,060
doesn't have as high of p and so I know

2482
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,699
that terrorganics is the company that

2483
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:11,400
makes distributes Emerald's EM1 here and

2484
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:12,960
used to be owned by a guy that I've come

2485
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:15,599
to know and that's a whole nother story

2486
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,179
that I'm not really happy about how that

2487
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,579
all process worked but anyways

2488
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:22,500
um they were using a brand and they

2489
01:22:20,579 --> 01:22:25,559
claimed an mpk level on like a brand

2490
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,238
compost mixture or something for bokashi

2491
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,280
and they ended up having to start to add

2492
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:31,319
other inputs because the p dropped on a

2493
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:34,079
batch of brand wheat brand that they're

2494
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:36,299
buying or rice brand that they're buying

2495
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,500
um and so you know fluctuations can

2496
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,820
definitely occur in natural products

2497
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,439
based on the farm that it was growing on

2498
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:41,579
and how it was done so I will say

2499
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:43,319
fishbone meal is always going to have

2500
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:45,899
phosphorus brand you want to be able to

2501
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:47,639
maybe inspect somehow if they have a

2502
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:49,259
test and a lot of these companies will

2503
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,940
share their tests with you so they may

2504
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:52,500
have a label that says one one you can

2505
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:53,939
go like hey do you have an actual NPK

2506
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,260
test like on your brand and it might

2507
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:56,639
come back five percent they're like yeah

2508
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:59,640
that's the stuff that's what I want to

2509
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:01,619
buy so that might be helpful I love that

2510
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,239
I love that sort of relating to that and

2511
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:04,559
uh one of our Lisa was also Charmed in

2512
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:06,359
with a similar thing so I was sort of

2513
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,699
just Amalgamated two questions together

2514
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:11,579
in this one but I've noticed when I do

2515
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:14,339
top dress with something like a wheat

2516
01:23:11,579 --> 01:23:16,859
bran or um just even some of the general

2517
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:19,440
amendments I use I get this massive

2518
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:22,198
explosion in beneficial population like

2519
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:25,738
notably hypoapsis and um what are they

2520
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:28,259
Rove beetles roly-polies and sometimes I

2521
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:30,299
feel like the population maybe explodes

2522
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,340
a little too much do you think this is

2523
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,260
just a reflection of me needing to top

2524
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,460
dress a little less organic matter or

2525
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,440
like what's your thoughts on that one

2526
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,380
yes and no

2527
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:41,819
um these are the stuff that you know

2528
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,020
everybody that grows living soil knows

2529
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:44,939
but it's not as commonly talked about

2530
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:47,460
Rogue beetles are a nightmare like

2531
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:49,139
they're great but they get in your herb

2532
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,939
too they end up growing wings and flying

2533
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:52,260
around if they'll climb up on there and

2534
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:54,238
so it's kind of like well you get rid of

2535
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,320
the fungus now but now you have like you

2536
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,099
know it's like training one for the

2537
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:58,439
other

2538
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:00,179
and to this day if I grab some nugs I'll

2539
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:01,319
make sure that I just take a quick peek

2540
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:03,539
and make sure I'm not smoking a rose

2541
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:04,979
beetle or something but it's really more

2542
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,719
of a minor nuisance especially when

2543
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:08,639
you're keeping things in Balance

2544
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,279
um I did notice the same thing

2545
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,260
um I've even had some customers you see

2546
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,880
every end of the spectrum here when

2547
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:18,000
you're going working with thousands of

2548
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,199
people and I've had some customers that

2549
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,359
have reached out and said you know I

2550
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:23,759
have these little tiny slow moving

2551
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,139
bulb mites or orb mites depending on

2552
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,300
what you want to call it

2553
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:30,119
very slow moving round bulbous looking

2554
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:32,699
ones and you'll see them on the on the

2555
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:34,920
woodier material on seed meals and

2556
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:37,198
they'll just be decomposing it and so

2557
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:39,600
much so you can have like hundreds of

2558
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:41,099
thousands of them and I've noticed it

2559
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,900
that if the humidity is really high and

2560
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,600
you have tons of fresh Chopped Leaf

2561
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:47,399
Mulch and lots of amendments in there it

2562
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,480
just stays in ideal conditions form to

2563
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:50,219
the to the part where you can actually

2564
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,259
see them climbing up the plant

2565
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:54,300
and while most people do a defoliation

2566
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:55,679
and a cleanup and by the time flower

2567
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,179
comes you're not going to see any of

2568
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,440
them I've actually had some customers

2569
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:00,000
they had to point out to me that they

2570
01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:01,139
were having a major issue and I didn't

2571
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,819
believe them and then send me photos and

2572
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:05,940
I'm like oh my God they're in your butt

2573
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:07,380
that's terrible holy [ __ ] and it would

2574
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:09,299
lead you know inevitably would find out

2575
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:11,159
they just had cover crop going wild and

2576
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:13,739
a million things top dressed and it was

2577
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:15,119
just conducive to that so while nature

2578
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:17,339
is good

2579
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:18,779
um it's all about balance and one of the

2580
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:20,940
things that I was fascinated with early

2581
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:22,019
on with starting living soil systems is

2582
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:24,059
that early on you'd see population

2583
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:26,219
explosions and then they would die back

2584
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,900
and you see something else come in and

2585
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:29,239
eventually it's kind of like you create

2586
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:31,439
this

2587
01:25:29,238 --> 01:25:32,819
homeostasis of different activities

2588
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,579
going on and it seems like they're not

2589
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:36,719
all going out of control but we're in a

2590
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:38,399
perfect environment

2591
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,140
and I've had roly-polies like you

2592
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,539
mentioned go crazy it's only happened

2593
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,980
once but it was to the point where they

2594
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:46,140
were starting to eat my plants and strip

2595
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:48,000
my stocks and so I had to deal with that

2596
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:50,400
and I think in that particular time I

2597
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,260
was using like a lot of Woody Mulch and

2598
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,059
they just weren't proliferating and it

2599
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,039
was from their compost that I had gotten

2600
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:57,539
at the time

2601
01:25:56,039 --> 01:25:59,460
um and other times it's you know the

2602
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:01,198
road beetles or mites but for the most

2603
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,100
part when you're top dressing every once

2604
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,198
in a while

2605
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:06,420
and you're following like cleaning up

2606
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:07,678
the actual airflow by defaulting a

2607
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:09,480
little bit we're indoors we don't have

2608
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,279
all the environment to work with

2609
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:13,259
I see that things stand pretty much in

2610
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,539
Balance so maybe what you peed on is top

2611
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:17,579
dress slightly less

2612
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:20,219
um I do think less is more you know I

2613
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:22,079
really do I've been able to do more with

2614
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:23,340
less than I anticipated but when I'm

2615
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:24,779
reamending like I did that three by

2616
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:26,219
three bed we broke down all the cover

2617
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:28,319
crop in there and then we mixed all

2618
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:30,060
those amendments in

2619
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:31,859
um it broke down into something great

2620
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:33,780
but it's it's it's different when you

2621
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:36,119
have the whole decay in worms and and

2622
01:26:33,779 --> 01:26:38,099
the plants are growing you see those

2623
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:40,019
weird population explosions away from

2624
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,280
the light in the shade hidden under the

2625
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,960
mulch and so it's something to be aware

2626
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:44,519
of

2627
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,139
um I don't know if you have any specific

2628
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,000
instance that was like problematic but

2629
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:50,039
for most of mine I just kind of like no

2630
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,420
see what happens and kind of avoid being

2631
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:54,359
overly concerned

2632
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:57,000
and typically it takes care of itself

2633
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:58,738
um I may strip out a mulch layer and

2634
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,939
reapply some straw or something if I'm

2635
01:26:58,738 --> 01:27:01,500
really concerned that something was

2636
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:03,960
getting too wild just because I can

2637
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,520
throw out the compost bin or something

2638
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,319
um but a lot of problems in Organics I

2639
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,300
think are caused by like chasing your

2640
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:12,119
own tail a little too hard trying to

2641
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,380
cheat like treat a couple of excessive

2642
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:15,539
population in the soil and almost

2643
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:18,060
hurting your plants to do so so just

2644
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:21,000
remember that as well

2645
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:23,460
yeah totally I um was the exact

2646
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,679
situation you described and for anyone

2647
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:27,179
listening you you can remedy it exactly

2648
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,859
as Jeremy said you know like just just

2649
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:31,260
take some of the top dressing off and

2650
01:27:28,859 --> 01:27:32,519
start fresh and I I had a similar

2651
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:34,440
predicament to one of your customers

2652
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,719
where I dead set had these beneficials

2653
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:38,698
crawling up towards the buds and that

2654
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,439
was sort of what instigated me to um

2655
01:27:38,698 --> 01:27:42,479
remove the top dress but another thing I

2656
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:45,059
did which a lot of people say is helpful

2657
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,738
to hear is you you can sort of you

2658
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,300
remove the top dress but you can also

2659
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:50,399
just get some tape and just put it

2660
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,960
reverse around the stem and then if

2661
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,299
anything starts to crawl up it'll just

2662
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,100
get stuck there on that bit of tape and

2663
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,779
then over the next day or two it'll as

2664
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,639
you've taken the mulch out it'll settle

2665
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:00,840
down and as you said it'll it'll come

2666
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:02,159
back to normal

2667
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,719
yeah we've had people like with

2668
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:05,638
roly-polies for instance you could put

2669
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:07,560
some tangle foot gel on there some tape

2670
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:08,940
but they climb up die on the tape and

2671
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,620
then the other bodies just crawl over

2672
01:28:08,939 --> 01:28:12,899
the dead ones on the tape and bypass it

2673
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:14,698
so it's really bad Nature's gonna find a

2674
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:16,679
way it's uncanny

2675
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:18,000
um however airflow is good so a lot of

2676
01:28:16,679 --> 01:28:20,100
times we don't have any airflow

2677
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,319
underneath the canopy and so you can

2678
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:25,139
defoliate and clean it up and we always

2679
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:26,579
recommend below our like scrog screen or

2680
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,500
the level at which we're going to flip

2681
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:30,179
the flower from everything below be

2682
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,979
stripped off caught stripping the legs

2683
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:33,719
make sure you defoliate underneath

2684
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:35,039
because it's not like the sun where

2685
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:37,198
there's space between plants and it's

2686
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,519
going around it in like an arch it's

2687
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,500
flat and you're going to completely grow

2688
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,600
the canopy and so everything below it is

2689
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,639
devoid of light it is in a different

2690
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,320
environment a much different environment

2691
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,119
and that's part of the benefit it

2692
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,679
creates this micro climate but I'm

2693
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:51,719
adding a little fan to have some airflow

2694
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,639
underneath that canopy discourages it I

2695
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:56,279
think from being proliferated with such

2696
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:58,859
an abundance of life and it encourages

2697
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:00,840
that life to stay underneath the soil

2698
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:03,839
what I mean by that is we're not killing

2699
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,760
anything but we're self-limiting like

2700
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,319
worms aren't going to produce a billion

2701
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,880
worms with no food they're going to

2702
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:10,198
self-limit according to the container

2703
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,940
that they're in the size and the feed

2704
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:14,158
intake because they just can't they're

2705
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:15,899
going to run out just like humans

2706
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,779
so when you provide an environment that

2707
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:21,658
is unlimited Buffet

2708
01:29:18,779 --> 01:29:23,399
and no airflow all the humidity and the

2709
01:29:21,658 --> 01:29:25,259
cover crop goes up to your plants and

2710
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:26,339
they can climb up the stock and they're

2711
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,600
just going to do that and as they

2712
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,619
overpopulate they're going to run out of

2713
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,840
room and food and they're going to start

2714
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:32,939
to migrate and it'll become a problem

2715
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:34,500
and so knowing that I think that if you

2716
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:35,939
see our grows we never like by the time

2717
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,279
flour comes the cover crops kind of die

2718
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:40,019
down we've muzzled it a little bit and

2719
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:41,939
we're not top dressing like when it

2720
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,920
comes to during a grow we don't pile it

2721
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:46,500
on like we do if we're reinvending I'm

2722
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,880
very light and I do think that helps

2723
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,979
adding some airflow makes a big

2724
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,600
difference also

2725
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:53,339
um because biology is dependent on

2726
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,860
moisture and we even preached this

2727
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:57,600
keeping things moist in that mulch layer

2728
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:59,039
once you have the mulch it's moist

2729
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,079
underneath it a lot of people come and

2730
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:02,519
they wet the top like every single day

2731
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:04,019
just to make sure it's moist Under The

2732
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,219
Mulch and I'm like well I think you

2733
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:07,020
might be proliferating some of those

2734
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:10,139
issues so

2735
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:12,480
um our desire to over care and over Love

2736
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:15,539
sometimes can lead to these situations

2737
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:17,759
yeah hugely we uh we end up killing it

2738
01:30:15,539 --> 01:30:20,279
with kindness I can I can relate to that

2739
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,960
so just before you mention you know

2740
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:23,880
having things perfectly dialed in I

2741
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,380
wanted to ask you because I think you've

2742
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,619
gonna have a good personal experience

2743
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:31,800
with this more more notably within the

2744
01:30:28,619 --> 01:30:33,359
soil list Growers so Coco rock wool that

2745
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,279
sort of stuff there's sort of a robust

2746
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:37,979
discussion going on about at the moment

2747
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:40,139
about whether new LEDs are actually as

2748
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:42,119
good as the old HIDs and you see some

2749
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:44,159
big name figures being like I'm

2750
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:47,279
switching back to double ends blah blah

2751
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:49,379
blah I think the LEDs are better and you

2752
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,658
just got to dial in your room to fit

2753
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:53,039
that what's your thoughts on this one

2754
01:30:51,658 --> 01:30:54,359
I agree it took me a while to get there

2755
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,639
we were burned by some of these early

2756
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:59,039
LED companies that were blurple or not

2757
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,659
the good quality and

2758
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:02,399
um I feel like nowadays when you're

2759
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:03,719
looking at it there's differences in

2760
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:05,219
there they are different the way that

2761
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:06,060
they operate and without understanding

2762
01:31:05,219 --> 01:31:07,500
that you're definitely going to get

2763
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:09,179
different results

2764
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,520
I also do feel like some of the older

2765
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:13,440
heads are experiencing a certain profile

2766
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,760
from their certain cut

2767
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:16,979
they're going to get when they grow it

2768
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,079
their way you know I mean some guys are

2769
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:20,759
charcoal some guys are wood pellet some

2770
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:22,800
guys are only you know propane or

2771
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,840
whatever and yeah they can all cook cook

2772
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,039
the same meal but it might be a slightly

2773
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,880
different profile that they're looking

2774
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:29,279
for

2775
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,600
and HIDs May contribute to that but when

2776
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:32,039
it comes to a newer grower we're trying

2777
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,480
to get the best out of their plants the

2778
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:36,420
best for their environment the best

2779
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:39,238
yield the best taste I feel like there's

2780
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:42,000
no one right way but led fits the most

2781
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:43,799
opportunity there across the board and

2782
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,600
it used to not the yield wasn't as good

2783
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,179
the quality was arguably different

2784
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,460
because it would they would focus on

2785
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:51,600
their lack of potency out of the LED and

2786
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:54,300
I think the marketing in the beginning

2787
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,579
was uh get 100 watt light and it

2788
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,320
replaces a thousand and I'd say it's

2789
01:31:56,579 --> 01:32:00,539
because they are using like that

2790
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:03,179
specific Spectrum to highlight on the

2791
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,800
areas and eliminate all the rest

2792
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:06,239
and that quickly went out the window and

2793
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,400
now we can tell with LED it's full

2794
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,019
spectrum just like the sun and that's

2795
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:12,119
what we're after none of it's waste the

2796
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,860
plant needs all of it and so once I

2797
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:15,059
returned to that I feel like then ldd

2798
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:16,679
was on the right path

2799
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,880
and then they said you know what if a

2800
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:19,079
thousand watts is good then a thousand

2801
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,520
watts is good and they started making

2802
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:22,079
big LEDs

2803
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,020
and there is a difference in how that

2804
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:27,238
energy is used but a watt is a watt and

2805
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:28,800
I really do feel like it was misleading

2806
01:32:27,238 --> 01:32:30,359
to tell people hey you can use a 500

2807
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,560
watt LED and produce the same as a

2808
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:33,839
thousand

2809
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:35,880
Now you kind of can and here's what I

2810
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,920
mean by that a thousand Watts with a

2811
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:41,039
glass hood that gets dirty

2812
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:43,319
that's overdoing the potency right near

2813
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:45,359
your plant but not as good you know

2814
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:47,698
there's all those things it reduces from

2815
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:49,738
the actual light output the LEDs it's

2816
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:51,178
raw right there and it can be close it

2817
01:32:49,738 --> 01:32:53,638
can be far depending on if it's the

2818
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:55,619
little strip surface the big cobs so now

2819
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:57,119
there's a tool for every capacity but

2820
01:32:55,619 --> 01:32:58,920
the main difference I've noticed you've

2821
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:00,719
probably experienced this too

2822
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,940
one thing I will say that I like about

2823
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:05,579
hid is this it's more of a single Source

2824
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:07,138
like the sun it's like a bulb and it

2825
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:09,059
feels warm like when you're on the beach

2826
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:11,340
and I feel like the plants probably

2827
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:12,900
react well to that

2828
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:15,420
and so what I've learned is if you're

2829
01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:17,339
going to use this this term the BPD the

2830
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,539
vapor pressure deficit what they

2831
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,560
encourage you to do is take your

2832
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:22,139
temperature

2833
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:24,360
and have it relative to your humidity in

2834
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:26,279
in a way that the plant likes

2835
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:28,979
but what we forget is that's the plants

2836
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:30,300
Leaf temperature that's important and

2837
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:32,519
when you're using a double-ended hid

2838
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:34,139
you're going to have a 70 degree grow

2839
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,580
room with like an 80 degree Leaf

2840
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:37,079
temperature or higher depending on how

2841
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:39,539
close to the light it is

2842
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:42,059
but in an LED you could have a 75 degree

2843
01:33:39,539 --> 01:33:44,100
grow room in a 68 degree leaf it's

2844
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,600
almost like the heat is dissipating off

2845
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:47,520
the back of the LED off the heatsink

2846
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,320
it's not being projected down in a way

2847
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,139
that feels warm on your skin the same

2848
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:53,158
way there's warmth in the room and so I

2849
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:54,239
know some people are like oh you don't

2850
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:55,559
have to use an air conditioner if you

2851
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:57,658
use LED I'm like well if it's 100

2852
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:59,039
degrees out and you have an LED it's not

2853
01:33:57,658 --> 01:34:01,319
going to be 80 degrees in your tail like

2854
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:03,600
it's just it doesn't invert

2855
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:05,579
um because energy is energy but that is

2856
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:08,639
a difference how it projects onto the

2857
01:34:05,579 --> 01:34:10,019
canopy and so what I've learned is that

2858
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,060
um managing

2859
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,139
I mean they are some unbelievable

2860
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:16,080
horsepower

2861
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:18,719
in these LEDs the hid with all that

2862
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,760
horsepower I will say when people went

2863
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,859
from single ended and then went to

2864
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,480
double ended the same learning curve

2865
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:25,859
happened a lot of guys would fry their

2866
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:27,899
whole grow because these double ended

2867
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:30,599
they needed a lot more space you need

2868
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:32,779
more ceiling height because they blast

2869
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:35,639
LEDs people think oh this little LED

2870
01:34:32,779 --> 01:34:38,158
they are potent and if you take an LED

2871
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:39,900
that's the new technology and you put it

2872
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:42,179
six inches for your plant you could be

2873
01:34:39,899 --> 01:34:43,920
blasting them with like 1500 par

2874
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:45,960
just like you could with a double ended

2875
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,060
LED that got too close to the light and

2876
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,340
so some of that learning curve is hey

2877
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:52,020
you can back these things way off and

2878
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:54,719
get phenomenal growth but you probably

2879
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:56,760
want to have a warmer grow room because

2880
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,739
now at 80 85 degrees in your grow room

2881
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:00,360
now your Leaf surface temperature is

2882
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:03,419
closer to what it would have been under

2883
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:05,039
a 70 degree grow room with hid then what

2884
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,380
happens is because of the leaf surface

2885
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,479
temperature is proper then it starts

2886
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:11,520
drinking water at a faster rate and

2887
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:12,839
transpiring slightly faster then it's

2888
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,280
using its nutrients which means it's

2889
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,020
going to be yielding

2890
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:17,579
and so I did see a number of people are

2891
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:19,920
like you need more cow mag under an LED

2892
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:22,079
or whatever the supposition was I do

2893
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,300
think it was more related to what I call

2894
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:26,039
um or what the industry calls DLI or

2895
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:28,380
daily lighting integral

2896
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:30,238
that relates to the potency of the light

2897
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:32,219
and I think you couple that with the

2898
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,319
fact that most people think you just

2899
01:35:32,219 --> 01:35:36,600
can't overdo light and they get this new

2900
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:38,880
LED and you can overdo it especially

2901
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,320
when you're growing 20 hours on like in

2902
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,840
veg

2903
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:45,238
um I believe that Nuance is what

2904
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:47,039
eliminated a lot of people and you know

2905
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:48,599
if I'm a snowboarder and someone tells

2906
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:49,500
me skiing is all the rage and I try and

2907
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,539
don't like it just go back to

2908
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,800
snowboarding right I'm not gonna like

2909
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:54,658
stick to it for two years and figure

2910
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,300
that out and change everything I do so I

2911
01:35:54,658 --> 01:35:59,759
get why people would stay but I think um

2912
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:01,320
man I think soil Kings did this I think

2913
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,600
they switched over to LED recently after

2914
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:06,599
doing you know a little bit of both and

2915
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,520
they probably had some very good reasons

2916
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,960
Based on data and probably their

2917
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:12,480
customers opinion

2918
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,000
um but man I'm really impressed we use

2919
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:17,218
all LED in all of our new setups prior

2920
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,899
to that CMH ceramic metal halide

2921
01:36:17,219 --> 01:36:20,939
although not as big as the I mean they

2922
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:23,279
make Double Image now God that was my

2923
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:25,859
favorite light for veg really just

2924
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,899
healthy plants out of those cmhs and I

2925
01:36:25,859 --> 01:36:30,359
think I retrib attributed to is

2926
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:32,460
the 315 is the most popular and guess

2927
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:34,198
what that's way weaker which means I was

2928
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:35,939
growing very healthy plants by following

2929
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:37,738
the DLI rule of not overdoing the light

2930
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:39,419
Without Really knowing it

2931
01:36:37,738 --> 01:36:40,919
and I was told it was just a healthier

2932
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:44,039
full spectrum light but I think it was

2933
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:45,779
the warmth from the CMH the fact that it

2934
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:48,179
wasn't too intense when you were like a

2935
01:36:45,779 --> 01:36:49,979
foot away became totally palatable and

2936
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:51,899
it was full spectrum and so it wasn't

2937
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:53,399
the light it was the full spectrum the

2938
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:55,679
distance like all those things combined

2939
01:36:53,399 --> 01:36:58,979
and so once you understand that LEDs

2940
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:01,619
just Crush I think they work really well

2941
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:03,359
yeah totally I'm with you I love them

2942
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:05,039
and yeah once you get used to it it

2943
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:09,899
works really well

2944
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:13,738
I wanted to ask you about the use of uh

2945
01:37:09,899 --> 01:37:16,079
the Q extract or saffenins in general do

2946
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:18,779
you feel that there's any issues using

2947
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:21,600
them say every watering or would you

2948
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:23,519
recommend to space it out a bit

2949
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,260
I don't do anything every time but I

2950
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,179
will say wedding agents are one of those

2951
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:30,179
that I feel more comfortable with adding

2952
01:37:27,179 --> 01:37:31,980
in almost every time I mean let's say

2953
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:33,480
you take a shower and every single time

2954
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,819
you soap

2955
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:36,779
oh no problem May dry your skin out just

2956
01:37:35,819 --> 01:37:38,340
slightly or something it's different

2957
01:37:36,779 --> 01:37:39,658
than what we're talking about but you

2958
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:40,619
also don't have to like if you didn't go

2959
01:37:39,658 --> 01:37:42,179
hard that day you're just taking a

2960
01:37:40,619 --> 01:37:45,420
shower to warm up like it's not you know

2961
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:46,800
it's similar in that yes you can add the

2962
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:48,000
queue every time but if your soil is

2963
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,920
decently moist

2964
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,840
are we really adding a benefit as far as

2965
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,819
Distributing the moisture evenly

2966
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,460
a lot of times once it's nice and wet

2967
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:58,319
it's nice and wet but I then saw Jay

2968
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:01,319
plant speaker when we kind of collab

2969
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:03,359
collabed on this product together

2970
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:05,579
um he was experiencing larger trichome

2971
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:07,319
head size from using what he thought was

2972
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:12,000
the cue and was able to correlate that

2973
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:14,399
to the bag size in washing his hash into

2974
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,319
the accumulation from the same plant

2975
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:19,439
putting all of its resin heads in a

2976
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:21,420
larger bag than before

2977
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:23,759
so you're like oh okay so we're getting

2978
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:26,039
a higher percentage of this trichome

2979
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,480
head size versus the smaller and either

2980
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:28,920
it was more uniformly large or whatever

2981
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:32,339
it was and he correlated a lot of that

2982
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,060
back to the saponin use and

2983
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:35,100
um

2984
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:36,780
I while I do believe that I don't have

2985
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,219
all the evidence to share that so I

2986
01:38:36,779 --> 01:38:39,539
wouldn't tell someone that guarantee

2987
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:41,100
they're going to increase their trichome

2988
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:42,539
size or something but that seems to be a

2989
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,100
lot of the correlation

2990
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:45,719
and then the other thing is could

2991
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:47,579
encouraged me to look at saponins as a

2992
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:51,420
plant growth promote not just a wedding

2993
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:54,479
agent and as a secondary plant compound

2994
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:56,520
it seems to have some benefits to soil

2995
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,738
biology and other things that make sense

2996
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:00,060
um not only that just for motility like

2997
01:38:58,738 --> 01:39:01,500
if you ever looked under a microscope

2998
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,300
and you see stuff moving that isn't

2999
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:05,639
really moving it's like moving in the

3000
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:07,440
water under the slide it's not actively

3001
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:09,239
going against the current

3002
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,379
and when you're talking about biology a

3003
01:39:09,238 --> 01:39:12,359
lot of times it's limited to as little

3004
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:14,279
range and you put this slippery Q in

3005
01:39:12,359 --> 01:39:16,679
there and I think it can allow things to

3006
01:39:14,279 --> 01:39:18,000
move around slightly more but some of

3007
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:19,139
that may be just my imagination going

3008
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,380
wild

3009
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:25,260
and so of all the products

3010
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:27,300
um the wedding agents are the ones that

3011
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:28,920
have added the most to the water but

3012
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:30,420
even still I don't do it every single

3013
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,800
time almost appears to me it was like I

3014
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:33,719
gotta get some straight water in here

3015
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,400
you know

3016
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:36,658
um but even on Commercial grows like man

3017
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:38,039
just add in that wedding agent whether

3018
01:39:36,658 --> 01:39:40,319
it be for Foley or just watering the

3019
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:41,939
seedlings like it just made the job

3020
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:43,619
easier the water wouldn't just run out

3021
01:39:41,939 --> 01:39:45,359
the bottom as quickly you knew that it

3022
01:39:43,619 --> 01:39:46,800
was going to go wall-to-wall and I've

3023
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:48,000
never seen someone overdo it when

3024
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,820
they're adding these tiny bits of

3025
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,219
wetting agents so it seems like there's

3026
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:55,079
not a negative but if there isn't a huge

3027
01:39:53,219 --> 01:39:56,698
upside to doing it every time then it's

3028
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:58,198
going to affect the budget and so I feel

3029
01:39:56,698 --> 01:40:00,299
like the less is more is probably the

3030
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:01,859
way to go when it comes to foliar sprays

3031
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:04,440
I pretty much add it to everyone though

3032
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:06,059
like I want it to my like

3033
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:08,519
it's almost like waxing your car like

3034
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:10,020
you want that to beat up and micronize

3035
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,460
beads on there and have an effect you

3036
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:13,739
don't want big drops just rolling off

3037
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:15,179
the plant and when you look at jidam

3038
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:17,279
that's where I learned some of that from

3039
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:19,319
as far as every single spread that they

3040
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:23,519
make has that Jadon wedding agent

3041
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:25,500
and to me using the extract of a bark is

3042
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,739
a slightly more natural than making a

3043
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:30,600
potassium hydroxide liquid soap and so I

3044
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:32,339
steal from Jadon what I like and I love

3045
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,719
the John wedding agent but it's better

3046
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:36,659
for foliar spray if you want something

3047
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:38,039
for the soil the soap bark the Q yaha or

3048
01:40:36,658 --> 01:40:39,658
the Yucca or all these other ones it

3049
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:42,119
makes a ton of sense to me

3050
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:43,979
so um hopefully that helps you know

3051
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:46,319
answer the question

3052
01:40:43,979 --> 01:40:49,019
that's brilliant and just as a follow-up

3053
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:51,119
one the the tap water where I live at

3054
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:54,840
the moment it's it's shocking it's like

3055
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:57,359
pH eight and a half I've been using um

3056
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,460
just like some lactobacillus just as an

3057
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:01,019
organic PH down being fine I've been

3058
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,520
getting good results with it I wanted to

3059
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:04,679
know do you think there's any issue

3060
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:06,540
doing that long term

3061
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:08,399
no I think it's great

3062
01:41:06,539 --> 01:41:10,800
um so out here we have pretty alkaline

3063
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,138
water it just depends uh there's a

3064
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,000
difference when you're water testing

3065
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:16,920
um high pH is different than alkalinity

3066
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,260
and I know that we're talking the same

3067
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,859
thing as far as alkaline is above seven

3068
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:25,260
but alkalinity can actually be like

3069
01:41:21,859 --> 01:41:28,079
bicarbonate and things that

3070
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:30,480
add alkaline to the water instead of

3071
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,158
just a high pH

3072
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,779
um and obviously the pH has to come from

3073
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:36,479
somewhere but when it comes from

3074
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:39,059
problems with alkalinity

3075
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:40,559
treating with an acid is the way to go

3076
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:41,460
and it's weird to hear me say that

3077
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,840
because a lot of people like well why

3078
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,880
would you use ph up or PH down or

3079
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:47,520
anything like that well it's

3080
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:49,560
when you're building soil the pH is the

3081
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,840
culmination of what the soil is made out

3082
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,520
of the calcium all these building blocks

3083
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,739
make that pH

3084
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,540
and when you add water you're not going

3085
01:41:55,738 --> 01:41:59,158
to change the entire structure of your

3086
01:41:57,539 --> 01:42:01,618
soil which means you're not changing the

3087
01:41:59,158 --> 01:42:03,839
pH which means it's kind of a waste

3088
01:42:01,618 --> 01:42:05,399
but in Hydro if you change the pH all

3089
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,380
the nutrients are dictated upon that

3090
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:08,519
water having the right pH so it changes

3091
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:11,039
everything

3092
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:11,760
now in farming it's different if you

3093
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:13,859
have

3094
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,780
like we first learned this with our loss

3095
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:17,099
all your Malibu we add a lot of oyster

3096
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:18,059
shell flour based on food's

3097
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,440
recommendations

3098
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:21,539
well when you have a lot of oyster shell

3099
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:23,039
flour in your soil and then your ditch

3100
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:25,380
water that you're using instead of

3101
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:28,380
filtered water has a lot of alkalinity

3102
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:29,940
in it all the biology can go to work on

3103
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,500
this oyster shell flower and separate

3104
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:32,819
the calcium from the carbonate and

3105
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,738
release the calcium and then you put

3106
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:36,899
water in it that immediately binds it

3107
01:42:34,738 --> 01:42:38,638
back into calcium carbonate and so

3108
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:40,500
Nature has this way of like it's

3109
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,460
attractive to like combining things

3110
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:44,158
together

3111
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:45,960
and that can be a problem because you

3112
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:47,339
never your plant can't get access to it

3113
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,539
and so if you're always adding an acid

3114
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,560
like the Fruit Growers around here we

3115
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:51,359
have alkaline soil and if they're

3116
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:53,219
growing peaches a lot of them will

3117
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:54,599
inject um it's like a Sweet Water System

3118
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:56,340
they'll actually

3119
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,079
create sulfur from the pellets and

3120
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,460
inject it right into the water and what

3121
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:01,559
it does is it's not like they're trying

3122
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:03,840
to lower the ph they're trying to cure

3123
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,340
this calcium availability issue that's

3124
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,500
constantly being bound up by the

3125
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:09,420
alkaline water so once I understood that

3126
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:12,118
I'm like oh I get it okay so even a

3127
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:13,079
living soil if the water is dirty and

3128
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:15,658
you don't have filtered water it's

3129
01:43:13,079 --> 01:43:17,039
causing lots of problems phing it could

3130
01:43:15,658 --> 01:43:19,799
actually do more than pH you could

3131
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:21,539
eliminate by acidifying that alkaline

3132
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:24,000
Bond

3133
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:25,380
um and so that I mean people just put

3134
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,698
vinegar in their ditch out here on the

3135
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:27,779
farms that make a huge difference by the

3136
01:43:26,698 --> 01:43:29,399
time I would dilute and go out in the

3137
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:32,579
field so I do believe that's a benefit

3138
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:34,979
and these Labs absolutely are very very

3139
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:36,359
low PH so it makes sense and in fact um

3140
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:39,238
EM1

3141
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:40,979
uh that was used and sold into many

3142
01:43:39,238 --> 01:43:42,539
other Industries besides farming and one

3143
01:43:40,979 --> 01:43:44,638
of them that Eric Lancaster was always

3144
01:43:42,539 --> 01:43:47,279
telling me about was descaling

3145
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:50,219
the build up on like these industrial

3146
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:51,658
complexes and so to me descaling the

3147
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:53,520
Water by acidifying it's kind of a

3148
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:56,339
similar thought process there

3149
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,840
I don't see why not I mean lactobacillus

3150
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:59,520
is ubiquitous there's a reason why

3151
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,739
sauerkraut works you just chop it up put

3152
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,540
some salt you're good to go

3153
01:44:01,738 --> 01:44:05,339
um so I don't I can't see a problem with

3154
01:44:03,539 --> 01:44:07,139
it like at all and in fact one of my

3155
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:08,159
favorite new products I'm not sure if

3156
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:10,380
you've heard of it there's an employee

3157
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:13,618
here in Mexico it's called Yahweh thrive

3158
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:16,560
not to thrive in uh Thrive is a word

3159
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:18,839
that he really liked but um it is a Labs

3160
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,420
but what he does is he takes raw organic

3161
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,219
local grass-fed milk which you can't buy

3162
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,658
you can I mean like buying raw milk is a

3163
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:27,118
nightmare it's like you have to own a

3164
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:28,799
share of the cow it's a big deal so of

3165
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:31,019
course labs are great but using raw milk

3166
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,760
is really cool and then instead of just

3167
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:35,699
doing like a rice washed water to make

3168
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:37,320
his own Labs he uses expensive kefir

3169
01:44:35,698 --> 01:44:39,779
grains that he's cultivated as pets to

3170
01:44:37,319 --> 01:44:42,118
grow into a large population so he can

3171
01:44:39,779 --> 01:44:44,099
make Labs out of a kefir that separates

3172
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:46,198
that raw milk into a liquid way and then

3173
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,699
he bottles the liquid away stabilizes it

3174
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:50,279
and I gotta tell you

3175
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:51,899
I told him to do it because I like I

3176
01:44:50,279 --> 01:44:53,340
used kefir at my house and when it would

3177
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:55,079
separate too far because I'd wait a day

3178
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:56,699
I'd pour that as my labs and I always

3179
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:58,679
had good results but I always had little

3180
01:44:56,698 --> 01:45:00,779
bits so I could never like do a whole

3181
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:02,399
grill with it and when I first got that

3182
01:45:00,779 --> 01:45:04,019
product I'm like okay I'll try it for

3183
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,719
him and just because I want to be a good

3184
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:09,600
guy and I used it the plants were like

3185
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:11,158
the next day and I'm like okay what do

3186
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:13,679
we have here and so it's been one of our

3187
01:45:11,158 --> 01:45:15,118
best selling products as of recent and

3188
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:16,739
in fact in the most recent YouTube

3189
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:18,179
series we've been adding that at one

3190
01:45:16,738 --> 01:45:20,099
ounce per gallon to the reservoir in

3191
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:21,658
this autopot system that sub irrigates

3192
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:23,760
and I think part of the reason we were

3193
01:45:21,658 --> 01:45:25,399
able to get it to work is because that

3194
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,539
lapse was constantly in there like

3195
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:28,859
creating this environment where it may

3196
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:30,658
have been anaerobic in the bottom of

3197
01:45:28,859 --> 01:45:32,698
those containers but it allowed it to

3198
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,319
work because that's how Labs works so

3199
01:45:32,698 --> 01:45:35,279
man I would keep doing it I think it's

3200
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:37,920
great

3201
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:40,079
brilliant brilliant love to hear it got

3202
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:42,118
one more question for you before we jump

3203
01:45:40,079 --> 01:45:44,819
on to a few fan submitted ones before

3204
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:47,579
the end I noticed on the website you

3205
01:45:44,819 --> 01:45:50,158
guys have a killer new product mustard

3206
01:45:47,579 --> 01:45:53,460
seed meal I was like oh I've thought of

3207
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:55,559
this I've used mustard the plant as a

3208
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:57,420
cover crop and had reasonable success

3209
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:59,639
for the IPM I wanted to ask you

3210
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:01,739
specifically what's the IPM properties

3211
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:04,199
like on the mustard meal

3212
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:06,479
I love the mustard not only does it

3213
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:07,859
smell so good when it hits the soil like

3214
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:10,379
when we have a fresh batch it goes in

3215
01:46:07,859 --> 01:46:11,880
it's like Wasabi or something it's

3216
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:14,100
amazing

3217
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:16,199
um but the reason why we didn't is we

3218
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:17,280
really are after good clean sources of

3219
01:46:16,198 --> 01:46:19,138
seed meal

3220
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:21,479
um from karanja and neem cake and

3221
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:23,219
camelina which is a wild flax and that's

3222
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:24,959
part of Steve Solomon saying hey in a

3223
01:46:23,219 --> 01:46:26,819
complete organic fertilizer a seed meal

3224
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,198
is a very important part and you think

3225
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:29,639
of people that eat vegan or vegetarian

3226
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:30,599
it's like you don't have seeds and beans

3227
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:32,579
and stuff you're not gonna have any

3228
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,900
protein it's gonna be a problem and so

3229
01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:35,340
that's like the peak of nutrition the

3230
01:46:33,899 --> 01:46:37,379
plant's putting all its effort into the

3231
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:39,420
seed but what I found interesting is

3232
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:41,118
that um these producers we get them from

3233
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:43,679
out of California they would help

3234
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:45,299
organic strawberry producers and the

3235
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,118
strawberries are very prone to getting

3236
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:50,219
these fungal problems and you know ruins

3237
01:46:48,118 --> 01:46:51,779
all your your crop expensive it's a huge

3238
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:52,920
loss and so what they would do is they

3239
01:46:51,779 --> 01:46:54,059
treat the soil with these awful

3240
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,500
chemicals and then they'd plant the

3241
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:57,840
strawberries and that would fumigate the

3242
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:59,760
soil of any of the pathogens well these

3243
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,739
producers now produce a mustard seed

3244
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,020
they press for oil run their tractors

3245
01:47:01,738 --> 01:47:06,359
off of and when the mustard is grown on

3246
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:08,219
the land it organically all naturally

3247
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:10,198
biofumigates the soil and prevents all

3248
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:12,239
that disease so they're able to either

3249
01:47:10,198 --> 01:47:13,738
use the meal or grow the cover crop and

3250
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:16,319
then immediately terminate it and plant

3251
01:47:13,738 --> 01:47:18,118
strawberries and get very good results

3252
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:19,859
and so I started thinking you know a big

3253
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:21,420
part one of our issues that I wish I

3254
01:47:19,859 --> 01:47:24,658
could solve because I'd be a millionaire

3255
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,739
is fungus gnats and while I can't go out

3256
01:47:24,658 --> 01:47:26,819
there and say hey use this and it's

3257
01:47:25,738 --> 01:47:28,138
going to kill your fungus gnats because

3258
01:47:26,819 --> 01:47:29,939
you and I both know nature is very

3259
01:47:28,139 --> 01:47:31,739
fickle when it comes to guarantees on

3260
01:47:29,939 --> 01:47:33,238
killing things

3261
01:47:31,738 --> 01:47:34,079
um but the way that I've been able to

3262
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:35,759
use it

3263
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:37,319
God it made a big difference

3264
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,000
um like our build a flower

3265
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:40,738
would have fungus gnats in it from the

3266
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,819
only mountain fish compost and from worm

3267
01:47:40,738 --> 01:47:44,638
castings

3268
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:46,079
and I hated that like I just never want

3269
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,400
someone to be like finally I'm gonna go

3270
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:48,899
organic and then they get a nap and

3271
01:47:47,399 --> 01:47:50,939
they're like [ __ ] this I can't have this

3272
01:47:48,899 --> 01:47:52,379
in my house you know and a lot of us are

3273
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:53,819
like well it's kind of the sea it's like

3274
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,139
people that work out you're like well

3275
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:57,420
you're gonna be sore we just don't talk

3276
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:58,800
about it that much well I'm living soil

3277
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:00,658
it's well there's gonna be some gnats

3278
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,000
sometimes and when we started mixing

3279
01:48:00,658 --> 01:48:04,618
that into the line what happens is when

3280
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,179
it hits the soil there's an enzymatic

3281
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:08,279
reaction it releases this mirinase

3282
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:09,480
enzyme and that's for a limited period

3283
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:11,158
of time for like five minutes or

3284
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:13,019
something and it might have a lingering

3285
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:14,279
effect but that's how act how long it

3286
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,920
takes to build up these enzymes and

3287
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:20,099
release and that's what releases that

3288
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:21,719
that wasabi-like odor that basically

3289
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,400
kills all the larva at least for my

3290
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:25,739
observations and there's been white

3291
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:28,079
paper studies on this the challenge is

3292
01:48:25,738 --> 01:48:29,519
that these compounds are phytotoxic and

3293
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:30,600
they can hurt and stunt the growth of

3294
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:32,760
your plant

3295
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:34,320
but not once it's gone so I've

3296
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,520
experienced the best results mixing in

3297
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:37,439
the build of Bloom or I'm sorry the

3298
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,060
build a flower now there's no nuts that

3299
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:40,198
come out of the bag I mean I can't

3300
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,920
guarantee that right nature is

3301
01:48:40,198 --> 01:48:46,138
unbelievable but like 99.99 less to the

3302
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,179
point where I'm so grateful that I found

3303
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:50,039
this material when I mix it into our

3304
01:48:48,179 --> 01:48:52,199
soil it pillows with white growth

3305
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:54,179
because what I see happen is it like

3306
01:48:52,198 --> 01:48:56,039
biofumigates the soil and then all

3307
01:48:54,179 --> 01:48:58,079
that's left is the beneficial bacteria

3308
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:00,719
and almost like once the forest fire

3309
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,519
burns everything teams with life the

3310
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:04,500
soil just pops off in my in white

3311
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,580
Santa's beard growth and just more than

3312
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,100
I've ever seen almost more than the

3313
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:09,899
Kashi I feel like because it fumigates

3314
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:13,020
and cleans the soil all of the

3315
01:49:09,899 --> 01:49:15,118
beneficial proliferates afterwards and

3316
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:17,699
so when we mix it we see less fungus not

3317
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:19,259
issues we see an abundance of life and

3318
01:49:17,698 --> 01:49:21,419
it's a great seed meal so it's a

3319
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:22,980
trifecta for me but

3320
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:25,319
we've made very little inference about

3321
01:49:22,979 --> 01:49:27,419
how to use it on actively growing plants

3322
01:49:25,319 --> 01:49:29,460
I had an earth box where I sprinkled it

3323
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:31,560
in there it took out every gnat white

3324
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:32,340
Thea Roots growing through their healthy

3325
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,960
plant

3326
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,699
I've had other plants where I top dress

3327
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:37,020
a little maybe heavy in a water and it

3328
01:49:35,698 --> 01:49:38,879
burns the edges and they feel like

3329
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:40,739
they're stunted first slight bit

3330
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,760
and it may be that just a little bit of

3331
01:49:40,738 --> 01:49:44,638
stunting it's not the end of the world

3332
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,780
but I pride myself I love I think a lot

3333
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,940
of our customers love having those

3334
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:49,259
perfect leaves and knowing that organic

3335
01:49:47,939 --> 01:49:50,579
produce that and when they start to get

3336
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:52,400
burned they're like why am I doing this

3337
01:49:50,579 --> 01:49:55,079
that's what hydros for like

3338
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:56,879
so I am hesitant to make recommendations

3339
01:49:55,079 --> 01:49:58,738
on how to use it I've made water

3340
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,719
extracts from it I've tried top dressing

3341
01:49:58,738 --> 01:50:02,638
different ways

3342
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,960
um but one of the challenges is let's

3343
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:07,560
say you go in a grow room and you have

3344
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:09,300
like two beds of soil if you don't get

3345
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,800
every nap meaning like you can spread

3346
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:13,139
this the mustard seed meal out there and

3347
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:15,239
it'll kill the larva but if there's one

3348
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:17,400
freaking gnat left

3349
01:50:15,238 --> 01:50:19,319
that enzyme is now gone the soil is

3350
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:21,059
teeming with life and then that will

3351
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:22,799
come back and then you'll have the

3352
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:25,260
beginning of the process of Life start

3353
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,980
again and they'll multiply so

3354
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,300
um

3355
01:50:25,979 --> 01:50:29,279
it's good that it doesn't make it

3356
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:31,500
inhospitable for life and it's a

3357
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:33,420
short-term period but it makes it so

3358
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:35,340
that it's not an end-all be-all

3359
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:38,100
um but mixing it in for us has been Game

3360
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:40,139
Changer I love the material

3361
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:43,380
brilliant I love that I'm gonna have to

3362
01:50:40,139 --> 01:50:45,659
try to track down some myself so

3363
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:48,840
on the tail end of things just got a few

3364
01:50:45,658 --> 01:50:51,839
viewers submitted questions here and um

3365
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:54,119
the first one I wanted to ask you was uh

3366
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:57,060
have you ever considered offering your

3367
01:50:54,118 --> 01:51:00,380
services or establishing any sort of

3368
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:00,380
presence in the European market

3369
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:06,360
but there's other people that have come

3370
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,739
and done that and you know shipping

3371
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:09,960
across the United States hard enough let

3372
01:51:07,738 --> 01:51:12,718
alone across the world

3373
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:14,819
maybe from a Consulting standpoint but I

3374
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,198
sent I tend to focus all of my energy on

3375
01:51:14,819 --> 01:51:17,579
my own business and it's hard enough as

3376
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:20,039
it is you know making a profit this

3377
01:51:17,579 --> 01:51:21,420
industry is very difficult sometimes I

3378
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:22,738
feel like we're just on top of the world

3379
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:24,060
and other times I feel like we're never

3380
01:51:22,738 --> 01:51:25,379
going to make it

3381
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:26,699
and I feel like every entrepreneur

3382
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:28,739
probably feels like that right that's

3383
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:30,599
part of the fun

3384
01:51:28,738 --> 01:51:33,118
um but expanding that overseas when I

3385
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:35,219
haven't mastered like I haven't

3386
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:38,279
solved the riddle so to speak here it

3387
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:40,380
feels a little foolhardy so um that's

3388
01:51:38,279 --> 01:51:41,639
part of what goes on in my mind other

3389
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:42,840
than that I also don't want to ship

3390
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:44,039
stuff from over here over there I feel

3391
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,900
like it'd be better to help someone find

3392
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:48,000
something locally that worked well

3393
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:48,960
but certain products like the Q and aloe

3394
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,100
and coconut and stuff like that it's

3395
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,480
already shipped around halfway the World

3396
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,500
by the time it gets here it'd be fun to

3397
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:54,779
share some of those lighter weight

3398
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:56,819
products and we've definitely considered

3399
01:51:54,779 --> 01:51:58,618
expanding Canada and Mexico are really

3400
01:51:56,819 --> 01:52:00,059
high on our list and we're going to be

3401
01:51:58,618 --> 01:52:01,979
going into that market this year as far

3402
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:03,659
as working with the labeling tariff

3403
01:52:01,979 --> 01:52:04,439
codes and what you can import what you

3404
01:52:03,658 --> 01:52:06,299
can't

3405
01:52:04,439 --> 01:52:07,738
we've tried to do it and we just have

3406
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,420
been going through growth challenges of

3407
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:10,799
business so I decided to focus effort on

3408
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:13,440
what's more important than trying to

3409
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,820
focus tens of hours away from other

3410
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:16,500
problems we could be solving on going

3411
01:52:14,819 --> 01:52:18,658
International but God it would be a

3412
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:21,060
dream to have some products all over the

3413
01:52:18,658 --> 01:52:22,259
world we've seen our products show up

3414
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:23,760
everywhere in the world by somebody that

3415
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:25,500
flies here and Nails it to their buddy

3416
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,940
or whatever but

3417
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,100
um nothing you know as far as like an

3418
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:31,559
actual e-commerce thing so

3419
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:33,960
yeah nice I can I can appreciate that I

3420
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:36,659
think expanding internationally is a big

3421
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:38,819
step for sure a really good question we

3422
01:52:36,658 --> 01:52:41,698
got from one of our listeners was how

3423
01:52:38,819 --> 01:52:43,259
often did you uh top feed the autopot

3424
01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:45,539
system before the roots were able to

3425
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:48,659
reach the bottom and just access this up

3426
01:52:45,539 --> 01:52:51,840
oh so top watering yes so what they

3427
01:52:48,658 --> 01:52:54,420
recommended me to do is to wait I I have

3428
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,639
to go look but I believe they said 10 to

3429
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:58,679
14 days and that size container to

3430
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,940
establish it and I thought well they're

3431
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:00,960
going to err on the side of caution

3432
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:03,479
because they really want to make sure

3433
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,279
because they know what I know if you

3434
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:07,019
sub-irrigate too early your plant's

3435
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:08,880
gonna die

3436
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:10,440
um you could rot it out completely and I

3437
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,118
it's the only system I've ever had where

3438
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:14,519
you kill a plant not the autopod but a

3439
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:16,559
sub-irrigated when I thought man these

3440
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:18,420
Earth boxes are pretty cool if that's

3441
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,820
good bigger is better and I found these

3442
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:22,440
round black tall sub irrigating

3443
01:53:20,819 --> 01:53:23,579
containers with like 40 gallons of soil

3444
01:53:22,439 --> 01:53:25,319
that would fit in 30 gallons or

3445
01:53:23,579 --> 01:53:26,760
something and I've filled it up put a

3446
01:53:25,319 --> 01:53:29,579
plant in bottom water and killed the

3447
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:31,199
whole plant and I was like oh [ __ ] wow

3448
01:53:29,579 --> 01:53:33,539
that is funky down there it wasn't

3449
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:34,799
breathing it got anaerobic but as long

3450
01:53:33,539 --> 01:53:36,420
as the root system isn't there digging

3451
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,460
and it would go dry eventually it worked

3452
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:40,199
but it never would go dry when it was so

3453
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:42,420
much soil and so a little plant

3454
01:53:40,198 --> 01:53:43,738
so I believe what I did is I followed I

3455
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,420
have to look back at the video because I

3456
01:53:43,738 --> 01:53:48,059
remember discussing it but I waited

3457
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:50,399
about 10 days and to me in the earth box

3458
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:51,960
once I saw a few branches growing I know

3459
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:53,279
from what I know studying Roots the

3460
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,020
first thing plant roots do is they go

3461
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:56,939
wham to the edges and down to the bottom

3462
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:59,219
they don't like grow in the middle for a

3463
01:53:56,939 --> 01:54:00,479
while they immediately search out like

3464
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:02,219
if you release a whole bunch of cattle

3465
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:04,198
out of a truck in a new field first

3466
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:06,239
thing they do is walk the entire fence

3467
01:54:04,198 --> 01:54:08,219
line once they understand that they go

3468
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:09,658
hang out I feel like roots are similar

3469
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:10,920
they go bam search their checking

3470
01:54:09,658 --> 01:54:12,179
account their savings account see where

3471
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:14,399
the water the food's at they get

3472
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:16,199
established set up their home

3473
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:17,638
um and that typically in my opinion if

3474
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:19,259
the environment's right takes less than

3475
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:20,639
10 days so I aired on the side of

3476
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:22,679
caution I think I went closer to their

3477
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,819
14-day recommendation

3478
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:26,760
um but I didn't have any issues after

3479
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:28,618
that I do feel like early on it felt

3480
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:30,780
slightly wet down there and I was

3481
01:54:28,618 --> 01:54:33,179
worried about it that's why I ended up

3482
01:54:30,779 --> 01:54:34,738
adding the labs and because I didn't do

3483
01:54:33,179 --> 01:54:35,819
like a side by side I don't know if it

3484
01:54:34,738 --> 01:54:36,539
made the difference that I was looking

3485
01:54:35,819 --> 01:54:38,880
for

3486
01:54:36,539 --> 01:54:40,319
um it seemed to have

3487
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,480
um but that answers the question it was

3488
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:44,399
like 10 12 days that I top watered and

3489
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:47,279
then after that I turned the system on

3490
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:48,719
beautiful I love that I love that an

3491
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:50,639
interesting question here that I had

3492
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,100
noticed myself on the side is is there

3493
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:56,039
any notable differences between the Q

3494
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:58,800
extract 1.0 versus 2.0

3495
01:54:56,039 --> 01:55:00,179
yeah so we have the q20 and Q60 and that

3496
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,100
is based on a number of the minimum

3497
01:55:00,179 --> 01:55:03,359
guarantee of the saponin percentage um

3498
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:05,159
they're both higher than that but we

3499
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:08,519
want to guarantee a minimum level

3500
01:55:05,158 --> 01:55:10,079
the 60 is been impossible for us to

3501
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:12,719
purchase and that's part of what went

3502
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:14,039
into our desire to make the 20.

3503
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,779
um but it was also because we wanted to

3504
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:17,460
be transparent we never told people that

3505
01:55:15,779 --> 01:55:18,899
Q60 was 60. we could have just kind of

3506
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:20,698
changed the ingredients without saying

3507
01:55:18,899 --> 01:55:22,198
anything however

3508
01:55:20,698 --> 01:55:23,638
um we wanted to be very transparent and

3509
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:25,439
there are some differences so the 60

3510
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:27,118
when they make like an animal vaccine

3511
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,579
they're after these happenings in very

3512
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:31,439
pure compounds that's part of why we

3513
01:55:29,579 --> 01:55:32,698
can't buy it is they can sell it to the

3514
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:35,399
highest and best used to these medical

3515
01:55:32,698 --> 01:55:36,539
companies and they forecast like two

3516
01:55:35,399 --> 01:55:39,000
years ahead of time with the production

3517
01:55:36,539 --> 01:55:41,760
level and that Taps out the plant's

3518
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,260
capacity and they're like well every day

3519
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,060
we've got work so why would they care

3520
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:47,520
about us and our companies try and

3521
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,480
involve us and get us more material

3522
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,940
um but that's part of why we haven't

3523
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:53,039
seen as much Q60 what they do to get the

3524
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:55,859
60 is they take the natural extract from

3525
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:57,840
the bark from the tree and they just

3526
01:55:55,859 --> 01:55:59,698
make like an awkward like they boil it I

3527
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,440
believe and then they get basically the

3528
01:55:59,698 --> 01:56:03,479
natural saponin level which is closer to

3529
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:05,339
20 then what they do is they pump it

3530
01:56:03,479 --> 01:56:07,799
through like a vacuum filter and that

3531
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:08,819
gets it up to 60 or even higher in some

3532
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:12,539
instances

3533
01:56:08,819 --> 01:56:13,979
um a lot higher 75 things like that

3534
01:56:12,539 --> 01:56:15,899
um and so it is a little bit more pure

3535
01:56:13,979 --> 01:56:17,698
saponin but build as well has always

3536
01:56:15,899 --> 01:56:19,138
been more about the natural like the

3537
01:56:17,698 --> 01:56:20,638
natural press neem oil we talked about

3538
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:22,980
the seed meal is not doing these

3539
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,440
extractions so to speak I even like

3540
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:27,899
smoking flour rather than you know full

3541
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:31,019
extreme dabs but that's just preference

3542
01:56:27,899 --> 01:56:33,299
so when it comes to the q20 that is as

3543
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:34,980
natural as it gets that's right off of

3544
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:36,779
the finished product that's about the

3545
01:56:34,979 --> 01:56:39,359
natural 20 that it comes in at it's a

3546
01:56:36,779 --> 01:56:41,340
little slightly higher on a good bark

3547
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:43,618
um and that's it it's not filtered and

3548
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:46,020
so what you get is some sugars and some

3549
01:56:43,618 --> 01:56:48,658
polyphenols and so I think it's probably

3550
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,800
better for the soil but it leaves it's a

3551
01:56:48,658 --> 01:56:52,319
little sticky around the edges of the

3552
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:54,539
bag because it's got the sugars in there

3553
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:55,920
um and so it pours and mixes slightly

3554
01:56:54,539 --> 01:56:57,420
different we've had some feedback that

3555
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:59,460
is a mixed quite as well as the Q60

3556
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:01,618
which makes sense it's filtered down to

3557
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:04,139
just this happening practically

3558
01:57:01,618 --> 01:57:05,158
um but I actually prefer the q20

3559
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:06,779
um I think if someone was trying to make

3560
01:57:05,158 --> 01:57:08,099
like a pesticide spray or something and

3561
01:57:06,779 --> 01:57:09,658
they're really trying to go hard on the

3562
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:10,920
level maybe the Q60 would make a lot of

3563
01:57:09,658 --> 01:57:13,259
sense

3564
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:15,020
um I like them both but for the cost I

3565
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:17,579
feel like the q20 is great

3566
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:19,139
brilliant our final technical question

3567
01:57:17,579 --> 01:57:20,760
for this one and I think it's a good one

3568
01:57:19,139 --> 01:57:22,679
submitted by one of our listeners they

3569
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:24,659
said I'd love to know Jeremy's views on

3570
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:27,118
the lift the pot watering method and

3571
01:57:24,658 --> 01:57:29,939
checking the weight versus just a 10 to

3572
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:32,939
15 volume method

3573
01:57:29,939 --> 01:57:34,559
oh the lifting's better the 10 to 15 is

3574
01:57:32,939 --> 01:57:36,899
kind of like a shoot from the hip way to

3575
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,820
tell you hey don't go more than 15 are

3576
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:40,679
you for sure over watering you're gonna

3577
01:57:38,819 --> 01:57:42,420
get runoff everywhere and if you're

3578
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:43,920
going way below

3579
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:45,539
um you better doing it more often right

3580
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:47,699
if you're gonna do like a percent or two

3581
01:57:45,539 --> 01:57:49,979
you should be doing it you know more

3582
01:57:47,698 --> 01:57:51,178
often and so that was just a way to

3583
01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:52,859
share with people who've never done this

3584
01:57:51,179 --> 01:57:54,539
like hey it's 10 gallons 100 gallons

3585
01:57:52,859 --> 01:57:56,279
like what does this plant need

3586
01:57:54,539 --> 01:57:58,260
and so you could take a 10 gallon pot

3587
01:57:56,279 --> 01:58:00,300
and say well Jeremy says do it at most

3588
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:01,860
one gallon and it could be a fast

3589
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:03,659
growing plant needs a little more but

3590
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:06,238
one's enough and you can always give it

3591
01:58:03,658 --> 01:58:08,279
more the next day so that worked but

3592
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:09,359
when you from the beginning feel the

3593
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:10,859
moisture when you're building up the pot

3594
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:13,019
plant it you can get a good weight

3595
01:58:10,859 --> 01:58:14,399
calibrate that in your mind and then if

3596
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:16,260
you're ever wondering because over and

3597
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:18,359
under watering can appear somewhat

3598
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:20,460
similar you can grab it and if it's bone

3599
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:22,799
if it's light you go oh well now I know

3600
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:24,899
the issue and if it's super heavy no the

3601
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,760
issue so lifting it is huge but in a 100

3602
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:27,960
gallon pot you're like kicking it trying

3603
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,400
to lift the edge you're not really sure

3604
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,118
what you're doing because you can't lift

3605
01:58:29,399 --> 01:58:31,859
it

3606
01:58:30,118 --> 01:58:34,380
so we've been using these eco-wit

3607
01:58:31,859 --> 01:58:36,779
moisture meters I love them

3608
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:39,000
um that feeds to my phone I can see the

3609
01:58:36,779 --> 01:58:40,679
percentage and over me doing it for a

3610
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,819
while I'm able to share the percentage

3611
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:43,380
that I see on there and then other

3612
01:58:41,819 --> 01:58:45,420
people can try and match it and that

3613
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:47,639
allows them on a big pot to not have to

3614
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:48,960
know like how heavy is yours versus mine

3615
01:58:47,639 --> 01:58:50,940
and I'm big on things that allow

3616
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:54,300
communication from a distance over a

3617
01:58:50,939 --> 01:58:58,019
subject but at home I mean lifting it

3618
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:59,699
works really really well I agree final

3619
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:02,340
one before we wrap up today a bit more

3620
01:58:59,698 --> 01:59:04,859
light-hearted uh it's a two-parter

3621
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:06,179
first of all surfboarding or snowing if

3622
01:59:04,859 --> 01:59:08,759
you could only pick one and then

3623
01:59:06,179 --> 01:59:10,500
secondly how's your wife doing after her

3624
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:12,300
surgery I know a lot of people are you

3625
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:14,460
know sending good vibes

3626
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:16,500
yeah so right away she's doing really

3627
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:18,060
well um recovers heart it's a long

3628
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,500
process learning basically walk again

3629
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:21,719
you know they're cut it's like a hip

3630
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:22,920
replacement this is an osteotomy and so

3631
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:25,198
what they do is they like cut your bone

3632
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:27,118
they rotate it to change the angle of

3633
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:28,678
how it interfaces then they kind of

3634
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:30,299
piece off and they allow your hip to

3635
01:59:28,679 --> 01:59:33,359
encapsulate it and put it all back

3636
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:34,860
together with bolts so it's been hard

3637
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:37,618
um really hard but I'm always impressed

3638
01:59:34,859 --> 01:59:38,819
by her tenacity and she's back up at

3639
01:59:37,618 --> 01:59:40,738
three o'clock in the morning these days

3640
01:59:38,819 --> 01:59:41,880
going to the gym again doing physical

3641
01:59:40,738 --> 01:59:45,178
therapy

3642
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:46,859
she crushes it so she's doing great

3643
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:48,719
um and then sorry I just keyed on that

3644
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:51,238
what was the other question surfboarding

3645
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:53,279
or snowing uh snowboarding oh God

3646
01:59:51,238 --> 01:59:55,859
surfboarding or snowboarding that one is

3647
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:57,238
really tough I would say surfing only

3648
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:58,799
because I see these old guys out there

3649
01:59:57,238 --> 02:00:00,000
85 years old something still paddling

3650
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:02,039
out and catching good waves on a

3651
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,479
longboard so I feel like I love the

3652
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:05,819
ocean I would like to end up there one

3653
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:07,799
day and while snowboarding has a special

3654
02:00:05,819 --> 02:00:09,118
place in my heart I definitely feel a

3655
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,219
drive up into the mountains in a

3656
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:12,899
snowstorm for a long session is a little

3657
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:14,939
bit you know you can't just do it right

3658
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:17,098
before work like you can't surfing so um

3659
02:00:14,939 --> 02:00:19,559
surfing is a special place in my heart

3660
02:00:17,099 --> 02:00:21,360
brilliant I love that and uh you know it

3661
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:23,520
goes without saying we're we're sending

3662
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:24,899
all the uh healing and positive vibes to

3663
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,719
your wife though it sounds like she's

3664
02:00:24,899 --> 02:00:29,519
just a monster and doesn't need them

3665
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:30,899
um so I think that just about brings us

3666
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,460
to the end of it for this one were there

3667
02:00:30,899 --> 02:00:34,500
any general comments or shout outs you

3668
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:36,060
wanted to make no I think I want to wrap

3669
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,399
it up um partially because you know

3670
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:39,780
we've gone a long time well I could be

3671
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:41,519
here for hours longer with you but I

3672
02:00:39,779 --> 02:00:42,719
feel the pull of work from behind the

3673
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:44,699
office door and I want to make sure I

3674
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:47,760
get back there and generally I just want

3675
02:00:44,698 --> 02:00:49,559
to encourage people to not sacrifice in

3676
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:51,060
life for one versus the other to have

3677
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:52,980
both you can have living soil which

3678
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:55,080
means you can have good quality and you

3679
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:56,819
can have good yield and I think a lot of

3680
02:00:55,079 --> 02:00:58,439
times people are considering these

3681
02:00:56,819 --> 02:01:01,319
things like what's the trade on trade

3682
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:03,118
them trade-off for going to organic and

3683
02:01:01,319 --> 02:01:05,819
for me it was more of a decision about

3684
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:07,859
lifestyle and there's been proven to be

3685
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:09,719
so many ways to get this to work it'll

3686
02:01:07,859 --> 02:01:11,039
fit really every model every methodology

3687
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:12,899
as you can see you're tinkering with the

3688
02:01:11,039 --> 02:01:14,880
latest tech smaller containers I'm doing

3689
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:15,479
bigger containers

3690
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:18,118
um

3691
02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:19,439
just just keep learning just keep having

3692
02:01:18,118 --> 02:01:22,139
fun

3693
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,879
incredible sentiment so once again The
