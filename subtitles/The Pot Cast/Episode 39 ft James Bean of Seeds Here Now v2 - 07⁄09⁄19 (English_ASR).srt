amen to that let's start off with our

54
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,078
normal first question these days what

55
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,078
are you currently smoking on

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,680
well uh earlier i was smoking i'll admit

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,679
it i was smoking some of the kaka kush

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
the brown frown as it were i found some

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,280
brown frown but i ran myself out of out

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,280
of cannabis and so i've been smoking on

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,360
some some dry sift i got from exotic the

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
strawberries and cream f2 dry sift

63
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,878
wow and you just dabbing that one or

64
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,799
putting it on top of a cone

65
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,560
oh no i don't have anything i ran myself

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,920
out i was i did put so i didn't want to

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,519
put it on the cocker kush because i

68
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,839
wouldn't even help it but uh i just been

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,400
dabbing it haha yeah okay so you can't

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
even elevate the trash with the gold

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
i don't think so i think it tarnishes

72
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,318
the gold

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
yeah right why would you want to ruin it

74
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,199
yeah so

75
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,199
cool that i've seen that one pop up a

76
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,799
fair bit what's it what's it taste like

77
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,479
what's the high like

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,680
what is strawberries and cream or kaka

79
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,679
kush oh god

80
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,719
you say baka kush gives you a [ __ ]

81
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,199
headache

82
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,400
you know you miss a seed or something uh

83
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,479
strawberry strawberries and cream

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,719
strawberries and cream uh it's really

85
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,000
nice it's it is tasty like you can

86
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,318
definitely taste the sweetness of the

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,400
strawberries in it which is pretty odd

88
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,439
but uh exotic's been working on it for a

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,719
minute so

90
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,840
i know he's real proud of it and he's

91
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,359
been he's just been bonkers over it so

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,719
um i was nice enough he gifted me a

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
couple of sips that's nice thing about

94
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,400
mike is that uh before his line will

95
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,798
drop

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
he will mike from exotic genetics but he

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,719
will give like when i when i meet up

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
with him a month beforehand or whatever

99
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,280
i'll get like flowers i don't get dry

100
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,919
sift

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
of the product that he drops in a month

102
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,399
which means to me that she tells me

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,158
right off the bat boom this guy's

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
already already grown all this out he's

105
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,359
already happy with it he's already seen

106
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,639
it at all flour and this is you know

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
he's giving me the flour as he's

108
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,479
releasing the seeds

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
and so um you know that's that's a

110
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,639
credit to his part he definitely tests

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
all this stuff for regression

112
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,559
yeah of course and mike's also one of

113
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,119
those guys i've noticed who

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
is always continually pushing forward

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
with projects and that's something i

116
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,039
like a lot you know like he doesn't let

117
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,798
things get stagnant and start to just

118
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,438
sit there and redo the same releases

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,519
again and again

120
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,759
no he he goes he's always moving now

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,280
he's moving a couple ahead

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
wait a minute all right

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,599
check pause

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,840
definitely leaving this in

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
sorry i love that no that's good so i

126
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,599
was just saying yeah like mike's always

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
moving forward um do you feel like

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
that's a trait like a lot of successful

129
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,799
breeders in body or is it possible to

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,160
just kind of make your releases a bit

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,560
more slow and spaced out

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
i just i it really depends on the

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,879
breeder to be honest because i mean

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
we're

135
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,519
you could

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
there's there's mike who definitely

137
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,799
works on this stuff for a while and um

138
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,560
the nice thing is i was part of the

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,319
interlude was 360 when i was in

140
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,439
washington and i would get their their

141
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,599
tests and i would

142
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,199
chilly everybody was running um and i'd

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
be like man why are you running a citrus

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,800
thing you know and six months later it

145
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,159
comes out with satrik but he was just

146
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
sitting in samples trying to get you

147
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,400
know terps and profiles and whatnot so

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,918
he was on top of it but

149
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,439
um but then at the same time there's

150
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,439
there's like uh there's od diesel from

151
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,680
homegrown natural wonders who doesn't

152
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
have a lot of releases but when he does

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,918
it's it's tried and true like odie will

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,439
walk around with 10 jars with him trying

155
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,639
to figure out which one is his best is

156
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,120
his best one and he'll sample it with

157
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
everybody that he knows and then we've

158
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,759
you know he figured out which one he

159
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,839
likes boom that's the keeper and then

160
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
that's the one release but

161
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,918
um so i think that's a credit to both of

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,919
their those those guys when i talk to

163
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,680
people that work with mike or work with

164
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,279
mike in the past and always one thing

165
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
that comes up with him is he he's he's

166
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,239
got the eye like he can in a room full

167
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
of full of room full of [ __ ] and a

168
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
room full of girls uh he can pick out

169
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
the fiery one

170
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
so

171
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,199
yeah that is a skill in itself right

172
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,559
either that or or in a room full of

173
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
dicks you can figure out the best one

174
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,160
too so either way

175
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,360
another very admirable breeder trait

176
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
so

177
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
just in general what's new in the world

178
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,280

00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,799
retail show

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
yeah what what's the florida scene like

197
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,399
oh canada and back back when they had a

198
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,918
couple years ago when they were then

199
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,679
passed laws in florida just because

200
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,918
cannabis didn't pass because it has this

201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
this crazy percentage that it needs in

202
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,240
order to pass i think it's two-thirds

203
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
majority

204
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
but just because canada didn't pass cbd

205
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
did pass and so they've been growing it

206
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,840
but they their first restrictions were

207
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,439
very weird like you had to

208
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,918
the place that your facility had to have

209
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,598
been in operation for like 40 years and

210
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,598
it had to have shown that it would you

211
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,439
know it could produce at least 400 000

212
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,879
plants or something and they had to have

213
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,240
been owned by the same person for the

214
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,959
past 40 years

215
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,598
and so that that kind of you know

216
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,120
that's the bias and horrible movement is

217
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,839
i mean that gives a certain amount of

218
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,120
people a certain shot at it

219
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,799
yeah it seems very limiting i mean yeah

220
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
do you feel like there will be a more

221
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
full scale roll out of legalization

222
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,918
eventually down there

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,759
i think there has to be like that that

224
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,079
that weird law is just too weird and too

225
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,879
selective of a very short minority of

226
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,439
people and so it's not it's it's not

227
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,120
right um so there has to be that when

228
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,800
you go down to like key west uh two

229
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,478
years ago i went from coast to coast i

230
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,079
drove from coast to coast i started in

231
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,758
key west but when you go down there

232
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,120
there's there's pot t-shirts everywhere

233
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
and all the on all the vendors or

234
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
selling you know get high get this there

235
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
was one smoke shop

236
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
but uh but just t-shirts everywhere and

237
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,079
the culture was there so

238
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
i don't think i don't see why not they

239
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,959
have the also the tourism boom in

240
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,959
florida and everybody that gets it on

241
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,598
and off those cruise ships

242
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,038
uh it's a customer suicide

243
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,360
yeah of course

244
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,038
and i mean on that same train of thought

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
what state do you think will be the next

246
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,680
to fall and to kind of open the

247
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,680
floodgates for it all

248
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,399
uh i i don't really know there's so many

249
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,598
that are just that are there um and now

250
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,519
that the sessions are out they're not

251
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,718
really um they're not really passing

252
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,639
anything but i

253
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
because you know i think um a couple

254
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,158
months ago one state just went and did

255
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
their own bill and acted their own stuff

256
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,838
and got got with the times and so i'm

257
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,399
not really sure i know it's not going to

258
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
be idaho

259
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,879
so

260
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,239
sadly no

261
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,159
i think idaho has some of the best

262
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,799
climate to grow that uh our canada

263
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,679
cannabis end but

264
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,679
just

265
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,439
just not the right people

266
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,519
not the right people at all like they

267
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
made a law against ever making a law

268
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,000
positive about cannabis

269
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
yeah right that's how backwards they are

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
we are surrounded by legal states so

271
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,600
okay

272
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
i mean

273
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,120
when utah passes ahead of them

274
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,919
yeah that's a bit weird isn't it but i

275
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
mean

276
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,399
they do their own thing so just to kind

277
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,080
of jump back on track

278
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,679
let's dig back into the past for a

279
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,278
minute i'm not sure i asked you this in

280
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,278
our first interview so i want to bring

281
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,799
it up now what was your first experience

282
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,958
with cannabis

283
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,799
yeah i thought i thought we did um

284
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,799
so i was basically uh

285
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,039
hustling qps a shake

286
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,199
and the joints they bring this uh maybe

287
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,519
the a place of education

288
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,879
daily so i would just sell them off and

289
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,320
i was actually hustling them off before

290
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,559
i even started smoking i didn't smoke

291
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,278
until like my senior year high school

292
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,199
so but it was just uh with some friends

293
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,720
i'm sure in the back of a blazer

294
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
didn't have any bong water she used iced

295
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,240
tea you know that kind of thing

296
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,000
well it was fun we did it at lunch time

297
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,759
and we got we got really stoned of

298
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,240
course we were we had beasters which i

299
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,720
come to now know as m39

300
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,159
but to that back then it was beasters

301
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,040
all smelled like hay i was like oh they

302
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,719
must grow this in a hay field

303
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,439
as i got educated i was like oh no

304
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,040
that's just mold you're smelling

305
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
and what was the experience like did you

306
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,039
get high on your first time

307
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
uh

308
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,719
you shaved they say

309
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,679
they say the short term memory goes and

310
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,680
so i don't really remember

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,078
there you go

312
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
must have been pretty good right now

313
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,000
yeah yeah i i continued down the path so

314
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,319
that was good

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,559
very good very good and so what was the

316
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
progression next from just you know

317
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,000
getting some stuff to some mates at

318
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
school how did you then progress to

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,320
become the giant of the seed world we

320
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,958
know you to be now

321
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,879
and so let's let's let's pause on that

322
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:57,278
on that note pause but but keep rolling

323
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,320
if you will uh who is james bean so um i

324
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,360
am

325
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,200
uh a nobody if you will like i i'm

326
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,039
flattered that that you even uh you had

327
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,360
me on your show twice now i'm a sponsor

328
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,719
so i guess that helps but uh to have me

329
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,839
on your show that and care of my

330
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,240
opinions are and things i think that's

331
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,320
awesome um i was lucky enough to get to

332
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,879
find you early uh the questions i

333
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
thought you asked are on point uh i was

334
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,679
like the way i explained people i was

335
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,360
like he either doesn't know things or

336
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,000
he's [ __ ] got huge balls but he just

337
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,399
he asks questions that you shouldn't ask

338
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,360
and so you know and so i appreciate that

339
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,559
about you because you were getting you

340
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
know let's get to the bottom of [ __ ]

341
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,879
here um when you were concise about it

342
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
but um

343
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,320
uh i lost my train of thought we were

344
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
going with that oh who am i who am i so

345
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,800
i'm a nobody man i'm i'm a broker i mean

346
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
it's nice to have uh to hear all this

347
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,919
and see all this but um i think what

348
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,518
people sometimes

349
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,278
misinterpret is that i have anything to

350
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,000
do with the seed production i don't i

351
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,240
don't at all i'm i'm a broker who helps

352
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,958
uh breeders get there get their genetics

353
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,639

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,759
got like i said outstanding customer

371
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,519
service but i never want anybody to go

372
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,799
to facebook and start ratting or say

373
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,000
anything or say that this we did them

374
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,919
wrong or i never want anybody to have

375
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,519
the ability to say that i didn't i

376
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,439
didn't do them right or i didn't take

377
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
care of them so and then on behalf of

378
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,399
the breeders it's always it's never it's

379
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,480
never

380
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,919
a good question to ask a customer you

381
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,639
know how did you how did you germinate

382
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,439
those

383
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,360
and as it is um we sell souvenir packs

384
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,519
and so we don't speak to germination

385
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
anyways so if you're unsatisfied with

386
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,360
your packs get a hold of us we'll make

387
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,839
sure you're happy

388
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,159
yeah really really solid sentiment and i

389
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
mean who on earth would go to facebook

390
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,078
and start trashing you before they

391
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,240
contact you

392
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,519
it never ceases to exist it's like they

393
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,039
think they're going to get more that way

394
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
or if they think their squeaky wheel and

395
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,639
i don't i'm sure where they what they

396
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
think but um they shouldn't know by now

397
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
i mean

398
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,200
i think any company you don't just

399
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
when you're pissed off at sears and

400
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,560
roebuck or you go buy a bow system if

401
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,800
it's sears and it doesn't work you bring

402
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,119
it back you don't go start trashing

403
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,479
sears you know what i mean yeah

404
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
but in this industry it's a little

405
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,959
different uh

406
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,519
yeah

407
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,879
tell them that i i i sold impacts they

408
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,039
heard me down they're upset about it

409
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,879
it's like no no i i didn't i didn't make

410
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,078
[ __ ] of those i said i'll fix it i'll

411
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,480
replace it make sure you're happy maybe

412
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,159
put you in with a different breeder but

413
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,440
it's not my fault i don't i mean you can

414
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,439
yell at me all you want you can yell my

415
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,279
customer service but we didn't we didn't

416
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
breed them we're simply gonna just stand

417
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,000
by them

418
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,159
yeah solid ethos solid ethos so i mean

419
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,360
to jump back to that question what was

420
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,039
the progression from uh mr wonka to

421
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
where you are now

422
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,480
oh yeah so they go back back on back on

423
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,439
course so i was a dj for 15 years 95

424
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,120
through 2010. um i played records and

425
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
final kind of back in the day when it

426
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,519
was cool it was kind of an underground

427
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,559
thing

428
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,720
and i was known for notorious for for

429
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,159
for weed and so when i flew around i

430
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,079
always had to have like you know a

431
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,759
quarter and eighth waiting for me at the

432
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,879
where i was flying or whoever picked me

433
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,319
up from the airport i needed to make

434
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,278
sure there was trap with weed when i got

435
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
there

436
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,120
um

437
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,839
i just came you know i'd smoke on stage

438
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,320
a real world wrecker uh so that was all

439
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
fun and dandy um in 2010

440
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,600
i uh

441
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,000
the scene kind of changed and it went to

442
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
mr rags if you will um

443
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you could buy your little rave gear in

444
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,359
the stores you could you know the thing

445
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
that was underground and kind of cool

446
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
kind of got blown out of proportion and

447
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,759
everybody in their [ __ ] brother was

448
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
in it now

449
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,159
and so it wasn't cool anymore um one of

450
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,399
my friends that i had gone had you know

hoffa uh pushing me to get a website

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,079
uh it's best to have a team

491
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,958
uh to do these things that way when you

492
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,879
call

493
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,559

us

505
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
in there with us because these last four

506
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,000
months we've gone through four different

507
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,759
websites being shut down targeted

508
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
so i went with the firm

509
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,600
forked over a lot of dough

510
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,759
the new website will

511
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
uh i'm not gonna jinx myself but by

512
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,199
september 1st should be up and

513
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
functioning

514
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,879
since the last time i talked to you i

515
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,440
might have mentioned a forum well that

516
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,439
that little dream of mine came true yes

517
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
uh i got my form up

518
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
and so it's got uh it's got chat room on

519
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,880
the top where you guys can chat back and

520
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,558
forth on the bottom it's got

521
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,640
uh breeder pages where you can go into

522
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,318
each breeder's page each reader is to

523
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
add their own facts section their own

524
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,159

there you go and i mean you guys have

535
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,798
gone through an unfortunate amount of

536
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,160
kind of attacks on the site why do you

537
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,240
think that is you know why do you think

538
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
you because i don't hear other c banks

539
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,200
complaining about their websites being

540
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
taken down and stuff like that do you

541
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
think it's just like uh you're an easy

542
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
target because you guys are so far the

543
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
biggest

544
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,879
i don't know you know i never wanted to

545
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,599
be the big guy um kind of just you know

546
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
with uh i don't know dope go pure

547
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,639
terminology or thinking he kind of you

548
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,319
know you never want to be the bright

549
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,759
shiny guy on the corner he kind of just

550
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,960
keeps yourself and don't show you guys a

551
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,759
lot of [ __ ] and then you won't be having

552
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,120
a problem um and so when people's

553
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,960
reference s is one of the biggest it

554
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,199
kind of still shocks me and you know

555
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,600
wonders me but i'm not sure all i know

556
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,720
is that uh we've been attacked a couple

557
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,759
times and

558
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,038
this you know one time on 420 we got 17

559
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,359
000 comments per hour or something

560
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,279
that said [ __ ] you 420 [ __ ] you i told

561
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,359
you i'd [ __ ] with me [ __ ] you told you

562

564
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,200
and so

565
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,879
uh you know that two years ago we were

566
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,558
we were ready we were prepared for the

567
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
420 attack this time and we had people

568
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,798
on standby we had 420 cyber on standby

569
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,319
to watch everything and we got attacked

570
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,918
again they're attacking us from of

571
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,119
course russian sites

572
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,440
using tor

573
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,798
an onion and so there's not you know i'm

574
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,798
told there's nothing you can do besides

575
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,079
defend against it yada yada

576
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,240
but it's been a pain in the ass

577
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,519
yeah wow do you think that this type of

578
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
practice is going to become more and

579
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,960
more

580
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,919
i common know because i don't know

581
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,798
that's the thing i don't know who's

582
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,640
doing it

583
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,960
our customers you know obviously don't

584
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,160
have an issue to be uh upset with me if

585
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480

586
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
care of it um some ex-breeders i don't

587
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000

588
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,359

589
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,279
uh

590
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,038

um along with 40 breeders that i

595
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,840
represent and so it's uh

596
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,519
when people attack my website because

597
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,519
they just like me it's like hey you know

598

600
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,279
uh if you've got an issue with me just

601
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,879
take it up with me but

602
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,678
i'm not really sure like i said what it

603
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,080
is or or why i um

604
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,559
i wish i wish i knew

605
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,159
yeah understandably frustrating well why

606
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,480
don't we move on to some more kind of

607
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,200
brighter pastures

608
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,000
let's chat about the newest breeder on

609
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,960
the block i've seen about two days ago a

610
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,480
very big name brand joined the seeds

611
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,558
here in our roster you want to tell us a

612
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,599
little bit more about that

613
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:06,079
yeah yeah my guy jackson zentner aka

614
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,519
meme gene aka freeborn selections

615
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,599
the guy is uh

616
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,200
as uh i think i've said in the past pops

617
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,480
more beans i think anybody else does i

618
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
think he probably pops a five gallon

619
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,480
bucket full of beans looking for finos

620
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,719
um

621
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,400
he really works as plants his lines i've

622
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
been working with him for about two and

623
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
a half three years now trying to get him

624
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
on board i remember him calling me and

625
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,880
asking we talked about an hour about his

626
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,319
real his launch his release and i've

627
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
been wanting his root beer for about two

628
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,158
years

629
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,759
uh

630
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
but yeah we got sky cutler kush and we

631
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,200
got pina colada

632
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,119
so we're happy to start with those two

633
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,519
um of course we'll get more as time goes

634
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,759
but yeah jackson was a big pickup he's a

635
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,679
really solid guy i like i really like

636
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,359
working with those type of people so

637
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,600
i'm definitely a guy who knows about the

638
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,038
plant loves the plant

639
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,319
hundred percent you know he's one of

640
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,200
those names that frequently gets

641
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,200
mentioned alongside the likes of duke

642
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,319
diamond and many other in that tier one

643
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,240
category

644
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,678
i guess my first question is how quickly

645
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,279
do you expect that drop to sell out

646
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,840
because i can only imagine you've got

647
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,000
what seconds when it goes live

648
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,678
yeah it uh should hopefully go pretty

649
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,960
fast uh we're in the middle of summer

650
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,798
and so a lot of people have already got

651
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
their their strains in the ground or

652
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,400
whatnot

653
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,640
that we only had a two day two day

654
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
advertisement on it but it should go it

655
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240
should go pretty quick i should i could

656
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,759
pull up the numbers on it but

657
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,960
yeah should go like i said jackson's an

658
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,240
outstanding guy we're just we're happy

659
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480

i'm uh we're excited to get true on he's

711
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,038
a really good dude and uh you know the

712
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,639
guys the guy's cool yeah he's got

713
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,558
something i think he'd be great for your

714
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,720
show but

715
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,720
yeah

716
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,000
definitely he's he's got a lot of

717
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,000
history doesn't he because he he

718
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,240
messaged me just having a chat about res

719
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,400
one day and as you kind of reference i

720
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
was very surprised by how i think he

721
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
even mentioned he used to work with res

722
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,960
so like i mean how's that for inside

723
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,639
knowledge

724
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
right now he's uh we're just to work

725
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,759
with him knows him very very well he

726
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,759
used to work for connoisseur he used to

727
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,839
be connoisseur that guy you know i'll

728
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,158
let him tell the stories but you know

729
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,639
yeah he's he got he got busted once for

730
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,559
uh exporting marijuana because he was

731
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
going to a high times cup

732
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,839
and so he just thinks that he thinks the

733
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,000
people that he asked how to smuggle it

734
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,399
out with ratted on him so his entry got

735
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,919
flagged and so he he did jail time for

736
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
i was like damn

737
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,400
wow

738
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,919
yeah

739
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,440
but uh but cool very cool guy i'm

740
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,960
excited to get him on

741
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,038
yeah there you go that's something cool

742
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,640
to look forward to i guess we should

743
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,720
maybe do something a little

744
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,799
controversial so on the opposite end of

745
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,960
the new breeders you're considering

746
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,200
who's a breeder who you think's fallen

747
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,200
off

748
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,918
what the hell kind of question is that

749
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,240
you can choose to deny i don't mind uh

750
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,340
all the banks that i no longer carry

751
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,880

yeah it's been interesting to see the uh

769
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
the slow down in the number of offerings

770
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,079
from brothers grim since duke's

771
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,839
departure

772
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,240
dude duke was the the heart and soul

773
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,319
that oh oh damn shots fired again the

774
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,159
heart is still that thing but but duke's

775
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,599
just a [ __ ] yeah

776
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,960
but duke's an animal dude i mean that

777
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,038
guy's just uh

778
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,038
i'm really glad to call that i can call

779
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,319
him a friend and uh he's mentioned

780
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:33,519
before if he's having an earthquake out

781
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,879
here he's gonna

782
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,918
get his truck and come out here and save

783
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,799
us all

784
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
so

785
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:42,879
and i believe that he'd [ __ ] try

786
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,359
so he's just he's a good dude just him

787
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,320
and that massive uh swiss army knife

788
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,359
just comes and saves everything

789
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,960
that i can't i can't tell stories but uh

790
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,558
yeah uh don't ever play paintball with

791
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,079
him put it that way don't ever play

792
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,240
paintball with a [ __ ] [ __ ] because

793
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,240
yeah he will he will clear the field of

794
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,919
like 10 people to get the guys out

795
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,278
outstanding

796
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,240
yeah i can imagine right that's

797
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,038
brilliant

798
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,120
it was a shock i was like what the [ __ ]

799
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,798
well i mean you know just continuing on

800
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,959
from that topic how we were just kind of

801
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,278
discussing brothers grimm how how do you

802
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
think a breeder can continue to stay

803
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,200
relevant in what is essentially an

804
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,399
ever-changing market

805
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,558
i think

806
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,200
maybe on this one the swamp boys get

807
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,519
undervalued or get get uh

808
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
when i say number number one or or do it

809
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,480
a lot but they just like chrome said

810
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
they just do what the [ __ ] they're doing

811
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,798
like they don't care anybody else is

812
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,798
doing they don't want to do what anybody

813
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,879
else is doing like leave them alone

814
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,400
stay away from my [ __ ] and so they just

815
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,679
do they just do their own [ __ ] thing

816
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,038
and they just care about their own [ __ ]

817
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,798
and the lie i mean of this year i've

818
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,240
seen that lemon royale man

819
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,558
that thing really killed it for me last

820
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,359
year in boston um and just about every

821
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,038
other

822
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,199
every other time i've seen it or had the

823
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,359
chance to to be around it it's it's

824
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,960
something phenomenal it's it's massive

825
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,879
and stinky

826
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,000
um but i really like those guys those

827
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
guys are back in florida now uh

828
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,640
um i think they you know they they say

829
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,159
the best in order for you to stay

830
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,679
current you just have to you have to do

831
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,360
what you do like don't try to copy

832
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
people because by the time you time you

833
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,359
get to where they're at it's gone and

834
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,119
they're already the next thing

835
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,879
yeah right i've actually noticed that

836
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,678
about them they're they're very much you

837
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,960
know like the uh the silent grinders

838
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,960
just every so often you see a new

839
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,720
release and the genetics are always like

840
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,240
you know make your pupils dilate like

841
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,919
whoa like

842
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,359
and uh yeah sometimes they don't get

843
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
enough credit but thankfully they do

844
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:36,158
have a you know really really passionate

845
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,079
fan base behind them yep for sure

846
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,520
well i mean let's talk about it because

847
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,038
what's interesting is when you mention

848
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,519
the lemon royale the first thing that

849
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,919
jumped to mind was i had seen um

850
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,599
our buddy at tk origins posting about

851
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,080
who he was growing it out and he was

852
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,398
very impressed by it

853
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,079
tk origins so so i guess i could get

854
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,519
some knowledge here from you so we

855
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,359
decided that's the guy who did the the

856
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,599
cushions because i s

857
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,359
in my instagram swipings i had seen

858
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,199
somebody asked on a josh d og pick what

859
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,519
who did the real thing and josh did it

860
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,840
and first of all i'd seen josh post

861
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,440
no at tk origins did or something like

862
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,879
that to that effect

863
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,519
which surprised me because i've never

864
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,000
seen that from josh before

865
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,918
um but i know josh and so

866
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,919
have have they come back to decide

867
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,240
that's that's the guy

868
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,559
yeah like from what from what i can

869
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,679
gather the the central people in the

870
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,759
story seem to be reasonably happy that

871
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,519
it's probably the case everyone has

872
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,038
expressed a small amount of like well

873
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,200
you know it's hard to say a hundred

874
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,759
percent for sure type thing

875
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,558
but on the whole it seems as though like

876
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,640
the main players are able to trace the

877
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,519
connections back and from what i've been

878
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,759
told

879
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,359
he grew the weed and you know the seeds

880
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,038
were formed in his room but he wasn't

881
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,959
really aware of them as far as i know

882
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,720
and just the pounds went out got sold

883
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,840
people found the seeds

884
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
and he was really none the

885
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,119
wiser and you have this on a show that

886
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,038
can go back and listen to it on or is

887
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:06,158
this just from your basic knowledge

888
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,879
um i think uh we briefly touched on it

889
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,120
in the matt ride episode and i'm hoping

890
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,799
to have cornbread on next episode in

891
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,639
fact so i'm hoping to be able to iron it

892
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,240
out but i did talk to josh in real life

893
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,799
at the emerald cup and and he just

894
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
basically said everything i said

895
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:24,000
awesome so uh is this guy is that the

896
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
dreadlock guy or no no relation

897
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,278
see that's what i'm trying to figure out

898
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,199
i i don't think the tk origins guy is

899
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,240
the dreadlock guy but he is like a super

900
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,960
surfy dude from florida but i feel like

901
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,640
maybe they someone got sold the bud from

902
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,319
the dreadlock guy maybe

903
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
right

904
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,798
yep that's that's the story

905
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,399
um and on that uh one of the guys we've

906
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,519
added in the last two years is katsu

907
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,959
bluebird

908
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,679
ooh

909
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
okay

910
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,600
so catchy bluebird is known for

911
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,159
uh his um

912
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,879
the of the of the katsu bubba cut if you

913
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,240
will

914
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,240
which um so he he bought it and as as as

915
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
you get on the show he can tell stories

916
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,480
better than i do but he bought it in

917
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,200
2001 where he said he had more dollars

918
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,798
than he had since

919
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,880
and so he bought it off the off the

920
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,918
forums from some guy green crack man or

921
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
something

922
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,880
and uh he paid you know a couple hundred

923
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,639
bucks for it and got it it was like a

924
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,399
half a half a tree he said he got a real

925
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,919
healthy thing and then like the day

926
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:22,959
later the guy called him and said hey oh

927
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,278
by the way

928
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,720
you can't sell it you can't you can't uh

929
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,398
give it away

930
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,000
don't do anything with it

931
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,278
and catch you is like that's kind of

932

933

936
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,640

who's handled he agrees to send you this

948
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,839
cut and the only restriction is you have

949
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,038
to give it to five other people

950
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,839
well you're now the [ __ ] king of

951
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,759
nebraska you know like you've got the

952
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,038
best [ __ ] chronic in there you've

953
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,240
even if you're a shitty grower you start

954
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,720
with good genetics you're going to have

955
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,919
a good output and so you're now growing

956
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,440
the best thing in town everybody's

957
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,480
calling you you're making money all

958
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,798
because this guy you've been on the

959
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,319
forums has just sent you this cut

960
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,079
and since then

961
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,678
all these people that he sent cuts to

962
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,879
have returned the favor and sent cuts

963
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,880
back to him

964
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,240
and so he has this reverse genetic

965
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,120
library that's

966
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,519
quite extensive um east coast saradiso

967
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,879
the chacos that came from him

968
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,359
um

969
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,840
he's uh he you can tell the story on the

970
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,678
bubbles but uh it was the same cut and

971
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,519
and i believe that the whole pre-98

972
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,600
story was that's the only one that

973
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,240
oregon kid knew that he could that for

974
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,519
sure was before 98 that he had the

975
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,278
longest

976
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,759
um and the other ones were most likely

977
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,359
but that that that one cat was the most

978
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,599
likely the one he's had since 90 they

979
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,918
knew he had longer than 98

980
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,918
um but that's what that's what cats who

981
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,200
got it was fun to when i got a tattoo on

982
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,559
the phone i said i said can i get bubba

983
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,480
on the phone let's let's talk that's

984
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,759
three-way the [ __ ] he's like yeah he's

985
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,079
like that'd be awesome so i got bubba on

986
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,158

yeah yeah matt you know and i definitely

1017
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,759
respect what matt i was just saying uh

1018
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,439
when you interviewed him i thought he

1019
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,720
had a great interview i called him up

1020
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
and i was like dude great [ __ ] show

1021
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,919
you came across like an [ __ ] but a

1022
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
guy that i like and the guy that you

1023
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,799
know we work with but um you know

1024
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,080
sometimes your point of views are a

1025
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,960
little [ __ ] dickish on how you say

1026
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,798
him but

1027
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,079
but he's uh he's a he's a purveyor of

1028
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,119
the plant you know and he wants the

1029
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,319
truth and

1030
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,918
i think one of the best things he said

1031
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,200
was you know people tell lies plants

1032
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,759
don't

1033
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,798
yeah that's some wise words i was like

1034
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,879
oh snap

1035
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,879

1036
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,679
katsu bluebird and how they're now part

1037
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,840
of the catalogue it it begs the question

1038
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,440
have you ever considered having cookie

1039
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,839
fam on the ct net catalogue i'm just

1040
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,840
kidding but seriously

1041
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
so i had the opportunity to have cookie

1042
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,639
fam last year uh

1043
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,759
fortune oh yeah oh yeah i turned them i

1044
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,360
i turned them down i i dodged i dodged

1045
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,278
three bullets last year

1046
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,719
so cookie fan was one of them

1047
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,918
um and that offer might have came

1048
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,239
through

1049
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,838
uh bz or those guys that bg could have

1050
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,439
come up with them but they had a really

1051
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,199
weird setup they were there you know

1052
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
they they wanted a

1053
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,078
they had a really weird setup they

1054
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,800
wanted to charge 400 and sell it for 500

1055
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,720
and let everybody steal them off you and

1056
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,200
auction off for 800.

1057
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,519
they were like a 30-something pack and

1058
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,118
my deal was that i couldn't you know

1059
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,559
just tell me you didn't do cookies

1060
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,240
because i know you didn't

1061
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,559
and just tell me who's doing this

1062
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,719
because if you did it i don't want it

1063
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,440
but tell me who's doing the k don't stop

1064
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,439
the candy rain

1065
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,759
because people are crying and they're

1066
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,000
crying and they're upset so yeah i

1067
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,879
dodged that bullet but no i can't uh

1068
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,079
uh and so and so i'll eat my words but

1069
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,838
um

1070
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,320
cookie fam as i know it has gone out and

1071
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,719
done good things as far as i know uh

1072
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,680
maybe public maybe not but jbz is gonna

1073
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,838

1074
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,799

1075
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,799
of the company goes jbz gets you know uh

1078
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,399
they get to push their media and use

1079
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,879
their you know their social plug-ins if

1080
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,720
you will to push the strains

1081
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,000

excellent breeder

1083
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,679
uh i think that guy is really cool like

1084
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,358
he went through he went through and took

1085
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,960
care of all the candy rainbow [ __ ] just

1086
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,719
because he didn't want people to get

1087
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
feel like they got ripped off so he paid

1088
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,000
his assistant to like go through their

1089
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,838

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,760
just uh so they weren't upset

1093
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,280
because i guess it all came down i guess

1094
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,920
[ __ ]

1095
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,920

because i [ __ ] pay them i mean i get

1118
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,039
that part but bg's a really nice guy

1119
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,760

1122
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,440
we're going to i'm going to take that

1123
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,358
old man out

1124
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,639
uh

1125
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,440
he's

1126
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:39,440
a really cool guy

1127
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,838
and so there's you know there was

1128
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,279
yeah there's just dramas oh everybody's

1129
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,719
everybody's got their egos in the [ __ ]

1130
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
that's the problem there's drama with

1131
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,039
everything and it's hard to stay it's

1132
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,440
hard to stay [ __ ] sweden you know

1133
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,800
yeah it's so it's so interesting you

1134
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,119
phrase it like that because what i've

1135
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,839
noticed is that everyone i know who has

1136
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,358
interacted with jb's he says he's lovely

1137
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,039
and yet he does seem to get quite a bit

1138
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,598
of hype and the only reason i can kind

1139
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,199
of attribute it to is because he is

1140
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,200
quite quiet you know what i mean like he

1141
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,719
doesn't he doesn't like project a lot of

1142
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,960
stuff out there just kind of does his

1143
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,838
thing and i think because there isn't

1144
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,079
exactly this huge vocal presence around

1145
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,679
him people are just happy to hate on him

1146
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,200

just block it because he doesn't give a

1159
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,279

they were a gangster

1163
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,760

1164
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,920
to you know say look at me do my [ __ ]

1165
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,160
he's let his work speak for him and how

1166
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
he got started going is uh he was

1167
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,199
picking up packs from from those from

1168
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,118
his guys there in l.a and they were they

1169
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,799
were charging him more like taking a

1170
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,079
percentage of all of his packs and he

1171
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,480
was like that's [ __ ] up they couldn't

1172
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,839
get they wouldn't sell him any cuts and

1173
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,079
so he got pissed off and flew to

1174
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:09,759
amsterdam get back some beans

1175
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,519
uh started growing his own stuff breed

1176
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,200
his own stuff and he started he reversed

1177
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,039
it he started charging his homeboys

1178
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,480
started taking a tax on their [ __ ]

1179
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,599
started selling it to them wouldn't sell

1180
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,519
them cuts

1181
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,800
and so uh that's how he came out but

1182
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,440
he's been in the he's been breeding for

1183
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,119
a minute since let's see 2003.

1184
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,960
well he's been in it longer than i'd

1185
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,440
given him credit for and a catalog you

1186
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,039
know he's a he's a super east la gas

1187
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,480
type dude so he's got the gassy

1188
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,719
nastiness

1189
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,880
um but people are into the the cushman's

1190
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,559
and stuff right now but yeah nice guy

1191
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,599
and you've got his wedding cake force

1192
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,400
coming on the line and

1193
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,079
yeah

1194
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,639
i think what's interesting about his

1195
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,800
work is i've always noticed that he was

1196
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,480
working on that high octane cube in the

1197
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,960
background and no one ever really seemed

1198
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,800
to pay too much attention to it and now

1199
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,119
that he's got it all solid and i think

1200
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,200
it's at the bx3 or maybe even further

1201
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,280
and he's now using that male in other

1202
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,279
strains and that's really like you said

1203
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,240
adding that gassiness to now the cush

1204
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,640
mints and the various other crosses

1205
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,239
yeah no but and it goes and it goes back

1206
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,639
to be like i said

1207
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,519
keep your secret secret or circle small

1208
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,279
you know uh he's not that guy that

1209
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,039
caught you know get caught in any drama

1210
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,800
or talking that bad about anybody like

1211
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,800
he's like i said he's not the guy to

1212
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,960
talk bad or talk do anything he's he's

1213
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,480
he's about it you know so

1214
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,920
um but he's gotta you know work have it

1215
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,480
the numbers that some of these guys are

1216
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,079
now able to run you know if you if if

1217
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,440
these guys were talented if they were

1218
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,880
you know say they were if they were

1219
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,920
smaller they were using you know back in

1220
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,920
the day when they started they're using

1221
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,240
a tent or that garage or something

1222
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,639
now the ability for them to run female

1223
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,919
hunts of the thousands is [ __ ]

1224
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,719
phenomenal

1225
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,159
like just just that that sheer ability

1226
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,078
and then to be able to go and select

1227
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,440
through them seeing the true structure

1228
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,480
of the planet like to be able to go walk

1229
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,720
through a room like walk through

1230
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,800
exotic's room and like see when he's

1231
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,319
running out because he see pops

1232
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,760
everything so

1233
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,079
to run through the phoenix and see it

1234
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,040
all you know being of the same or alike

1235
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,318
is is pretty quite cool

1236
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,279
but back in the day you know these guys

1237
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,039
with limited numbers they didn't have

1238
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,960
that ability to run so many strains and

1239
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,400
kill so many strains you know like it

1240
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,480
just didn't happen

1241
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
yeah and i that's really up in the

1242
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,920
floodgates hasn't it

1243
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,279
and yeah and i think it's made the guys

1244
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,400
that are really good even better because

1245
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,519
you know if they were good like i said

1246
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,960
that's what i was getting if they were

1247
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,239
good with one tent [ __ ] give them a

1248
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,920
whole room and now look at what they

1249
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,919
look what they can do

1250
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,119
and so and and it goes back to you know

1251
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,400
mike having that eye like we talked

1252
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,920
about earlier you know all the guys that

1253
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,039
work with exotic he could pick a [ __ ]

1254
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,000
out of a room

1255
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,000
um or a

1256
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:43,199
party but uh

1257
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,599
but uh that that that ability is just to

1258
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,358
notice those traits i think is uh

1259
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,280
is really quite phenomenal and then you

1260
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,719
know on the large scale

1261
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,079
it makes it better and

1262
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,159
because they can i mean they can test

1263
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,599
their gear more like exotics say you

1264
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,639
know he pops i think two packs or three

1265
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,760
packs of each of his gear uh to run it

1266
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,879
before he sells it make sure it's good

1267
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,560
but just to be able to walk through

1268
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,318
those rooms and see them and to know

1269
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,279
that they're all solid is pretty cool

1270
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,039
and back in the day you just said now

1271
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,839
that ability

1272
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,480
yeah

1273
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,400

1306
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,240
whenever that guy wants to release it

1307
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,279
he's going to own it but he doesn't you

1308
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,559
know he's sitting on it doesn't want to

1309
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,160
release it and like

1310
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,559
like some of the stuff he's got is

1311
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:32,719
phenomenal um

1312
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,400
his is uh uh uh schmucker's is quite

1313
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,078
phenomenal

1314
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,079
when are we gonna see more schmuckers

1315
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,839
you know because sometimes you you do

1316
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,000
see it pop its head up here and there

1317
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,199
and i just think maybe the problem is

1318
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,440
people don't know what they're missing

1319
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,679
out on

1320
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,880
yeah i don't know um whenever people

1321
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,960
want to be out in the market i don't

1322
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,318
know i i know like i said duke's got it

1323
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,000
to me a couple times and he's got

1324
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,400
something else called sally's beauty

1325
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
salon

1326
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,760
which he tries to just make me guess the

1327
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,560
strain he'll just [ __ ] send me street

1328
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,359
but

1329
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,639
uh

1330
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:03,838
he's definitely sitting on some [ __ ] but

1331
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,279
i think you know there's some people

1332
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,719
that are they're sitting on stuff too

1333
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,480
you know like not everybody believes

1334
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,318
that this is a cool and fair market so

1335
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,079
they're not not everybody's coming off

1336
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,519
their [ __ ] so to say i know that people

1337
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,720
have stuff that i've tested and tried

1338
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:16,800
it's like oh when's that gonna see the

1339
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,519
light of day and they're like it's not

1340
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,839
i'm not i'm not giving this [ __ ] out

1341
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,400
but you know i still uh the thing that

1342
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,799
was that's that sits in my nose the most

1343
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,000
is probably from indo expo this year

1344
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,280

1347
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,838
guy came up and he had [ __ ] uh

1348
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,119
like he was two giant it was two people

1349
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,279
away from me as soon as he popped the

1350
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,720
jar it was [ __ ] maple syrup

1351

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,318
just something he made

1366
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,440
yep i know how to get a hold of him but

1367
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,119
it wasn't even something he made he was

1368
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,079
popping beans for a guy

1369
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,079

his logos on him so we got that done i'm

1388
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,280
glad to see him come back out in the

1389
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,598
game and uh get back on the on the dm's

1390
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,960
or get back on instagram um hopefully

1391
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,400
he's not answering his [ __ ] dm so

1392
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,280
guys don't dm

1393
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
but

1394
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
you know that's what i see a lot of my

1395
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,318
breeders a lot of my breeders like the

1396
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,680
they're there for their public but at

1397
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,199
the same time

1398
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:12,639
sometimes the public can drive them

1399
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,719
[ __ ] crazy

1400
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,639
like i know duke told me that he was he

1401
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,799
spins you know duke will answer every

1402
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,559
[ __ ] dm he gets and sometimes he says

1403
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,920
it takes three hours

1404
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,519
and sometimes people just ask the same

1405
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
thing over and over again

1406
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,800
and so

1407
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,919
uh you know maybe just a food for

1408
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,839
thought if you're talking to breeders

1409
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,800
and they get short chambered with you do

1410
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,119
you know

1411
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,640
read maybe sometimes but i know that's

1412
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,800
what that's what drove obsolete into

1413
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,559
being obsolete was two years ago he was

1414
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,160
just like academy's like [ __ ] [ __ ]

1415
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,358
facebook [ __ ] instagram i'm done

1416
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:45,039
spending six hours my dm and dms mower

1417
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,799
and he just got off of it

1418
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,639
uh and

1419
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,720
unfortunately his sales declined he

1420
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:54,239
became you know uh obsolete if you will

1421
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,000
and so which was which was which is

1422
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,199
weird to see it was weird for him to be

1423
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,599
like the

1424
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,279
the tester if you will but yeah he was

1425
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,200
he's guaranteed from solid gold to just

1426
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,319
being stagnant because there wasn't

1427
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,318
anything it was anything pushing it

1428
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,519
people don't see pictures it wasn't out

1429
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,119
there in the current runs and people

1430
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:10,480
were using this stuff

1431
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,760
like uh

1432
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,240
um

1433
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,160
i don't know i want to believe that part

1434
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,759
of the mac is

1435
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,598
there's an obsolete in there maybe his

1436
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,839
orange congolese

1437
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,599
or his orange cookies

1438
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,119
yeah

1439
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,720
so

1440
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,720
interesting it's not the first time

1441
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,000
we've heard that sentiment and it's it's

1442
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,719
even more fitting that you bring up the

1443
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,880
orange cookies because i have noticed

1444
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,799
and i'm sure many others have that our

1445
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,400
buddies over at jungle boys are gonna

1446
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,359
start to be breeding soon is that

1447
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,318
something you've been keeping an eye on

1448
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:47,199
no not at all no way that's not that's

1449
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,358
not see uh i don't know buyer beware

1450
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,358
just

1451
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,480
oh

1452
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,639
you want to explain

1453
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,119
uh i

1454
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,239
you sell weed so just because you sell

1455
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,640
weed and all of a sudden you're a

1456
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,159
breeder like you know what

1457
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:03,759
what to look for and you know how to

1458
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,838
breed you know about recessive [ __ ] in

1459
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,839
your mind i mean i don't know i like i

1460
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,920
like people to stay in their own lanes

1461
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,358
and i i think that uh like like i've

1462
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,440
always told my guys if they ever see me

1463
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,358
[ __ ] making seeds or become a breeder

1464
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,838
take your [ __ ] and run like i should i

1465
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,279
think that just adds cd to a cd business

1466
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,719
um and some of these guys that are

1467
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,559
starting to breed that used to run seed

1468
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,598
banks i think is [ __ ] i'm like i

1469
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,519
can't make this [ __ ] up you guys are

1470
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,760
perfect thank you you're just driving

1471
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,119
traffic to me because i think it's just

1472
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,800
shady when people make their own you

1473
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,000
know their seed bank and they make seeds

1474
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,039
but

1475
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,079
uh

1476
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,079
for them to be

1477
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,279
so that's facts are facts they got

1478
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,599
famous off through other people's weed

1479
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,839
colorado's we threw obsolete tweed

1480
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,680
through other people's [ __ ] and so

1481
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,039
they should just keep getting famous off

1482
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,719
other people's weed

1483
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,000
uh try to take all the credit like

1484
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,279
there's enough food on the table for

1485
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
everybody to eat

1486
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,359
why can't we all just drive the same

1487
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,240
[ __ ] cars how we used to

1488
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,318
yeah

1489
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,519
understandable understandable

1490
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:02,880
and it's kind of like it's kind of like

1491
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,119
you know cookie fam like all the people

1492
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,318
that bought into the candy range [ __ ]

1493
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,920
sorry but if you didn't know that they

1494
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,759
didn't make the cookies then you haven't

1495
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,960
been doing your research they can claim

1496
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,200
it but they didn't do it because if you

1497
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,800
did it you can do it again or more so

1498
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,558
you have a male

1499
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,400
and that's not that's not to say that

1500
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,400
that [ __ ]

1501
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
love childs are bad because you know six

1502
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,039
of the top ten were loved childs they

1503
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,719
were never meant to be they were

1504
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,119
accidents that happened

1505
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,279
but for you to claim it or start a

1506
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,880
company behind that rep when it was just

1507
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,920
mother nature [ __ ] taking care of the

1508
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,079
job

1509
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,119
um is something you shouldn't do like

1510
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,880
you shouldn't you should leave that up

1511
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,838
to breeders who go for things for a

1512
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,599
reason

1513
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,519
so like i always say you know what what

1514
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,760
proves it in my eyes or at least for my

1515
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,159
bank is that um when people claim

1516
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,160
strains is if you did it you can do it

1517
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,838
again you have the pieces to make it or

1518
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,879
you have the mail

1519
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,838
and if you don't then it was a luck

1520
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,318
yeah

1521
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:59,199
i can i can get down with that idea

1522
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:02,318
so our so our so that's like of of the

1523
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:04,558
45 or 50 banks i now represent on on the

1524
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,800
site there um not one of them uses the

1525
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:10,000
same mail

1526
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,000
all different males

1527
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,000
yeah right because they used to be a

1528
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,519
common thing in the amsterdam days right

1529
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,559
like they'd share mails between each

1530
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,759
other

1531
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,040
right and that's and that's the thing we

1532
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,880
all share [ __ ] we all share our

1533
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,279
clones around unfortunately sadly as it

1534
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,800
may sound as harsh as it may be you know

1535
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,319
we all pass the girls around but nobody

1536
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,680
shows dick

1537
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:29,599
and so nobody wants to hold on to your

1538
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,199
mail for you in case it might go into

1539
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,480
flower and [ __ ] up his room just because

1540
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,519
you want to have your backup mail

1541
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,679
somewhere that's why you always hear

1542
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,960
people losing their mails

1543
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,558
but uh

1544
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,920
yeah that's that's the only way for me

1545
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,359
to separate it because nobody passes

1546
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,200
around there's not people passing around

1547
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,039
males it's people that pass around that

1548
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,960
you know the past around clone only or

1549
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,159
female plants or they're using female

1550
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,240
plants and that's fine but it's the

1551
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,799
males that are unique to me

1552
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,639
and so like if you take we've been using

1553
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,079
exotic a lot just because he's got you

1554
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,480
know he just just cleaned up at one of

1555
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,000
the last cups he got four cups there are

1556
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,280
six cups and four of them he didn't even

1557
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,119
go for but

1558
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,960
um he could come to me and use one of

1559
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,720
his males like i'm not gonna want to

1560
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,000
represent that because that would be

1561
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,598
taking

1562
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,119
you know a selection of his library or

1563
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,720
food off his plate you know so i

1564
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,039
wouldn't want to represent that that

1565
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,959
that stock if he came to me and he took

1566
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,358
exotics mail and crossed it with uh with

1567
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,240
crockett's tangy and he came up with you

1568
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,119
know exotic tangy then that's something

1569
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:24,959
different because now you've done

1570
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,119
homework and you've you've you know done

1571
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,800
some work um you found a male that was

1572
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,920
uniquely yours and now you want to breed

1573
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,240
with it and so

1574
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,880
that i can support and i will rap

1575
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,039
but uh stuff that you know you didn't do

1576
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,640
or using other people's stock basically

1577
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,400
his stuff and his stuff just to breed

1578
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,558
and make something

1579
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,920
right now we're not we're not uh

1580
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,119
i'm not representing and that's not to

1581
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,720
say that those people that are doing

1582
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,000
that are bad you know like if you start

1583
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:49,679
with good and cross it with good you're

1584
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,880
going to come out with pretty good i

1585
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,000
mean

1586
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,440
me and x were talking to one of the

1587
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,239
shows and um about how you know people

1588
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,240
will come up to his booth and they have

1589
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,879
better phenos or have found better

1590
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,799
phenos than what he currently has

1591
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,240
and as we discussed i was like that's

1592
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,800
that's part of the game

1593
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:11,039
like if you or you're breeding to

1594
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,720
enhance the strength to

1595
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:13,920
make it better and so you don't want

1596
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,439
people to come up to you there you know

1597
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,960
saying that they can't get your [ __ ] or

1598
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,639
make it you know that you're your

1599
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,679
strain's the best or your fino is the

1600
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,078
best because that means you're just

1601
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,399
[ __ ] putting the string out the same

1602
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,318
if you're if you're making the strain

1603
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,838
better if you're strengthening

1604
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,440
it then you're sending out better

1605
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,480
genetics than what you started with and

1606
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,838
that's what you want people to come back

1607
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,199
with this [ __ ] that you have that's

1608
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,119
better than what you have

1609
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,799
so that's just a testament to you know

1610
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,000
breeders when people come up their booth

1611
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,160
and bringing [ __ ] that they grew is

1612
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,318
better than they started with

1613
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,799
yeah of course right me to exceed the

1614
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:47,199
parents a bit of a common idea we hear

1615
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,960
but i would love to quickly ask just to

1616
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,399
wrap up our last point about the cookies

1617
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,400
in the jungle boys quickly

1618
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,920
do do you have a little guilty pleasure

1619
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,680
strain that comes from one of those

1620
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,680
crews i have a feeling everyone does

1621
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,079
um

1622
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,359
no i can't juggle like i said jungle

1623
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,519
boys didn't really they haven't done

1624
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:06,960
anything they they grow good flour

1625
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:08,880
that's nice but the genetics still

1626
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,639
belong to the individual breeders that

1627
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,880
they used and so i don't know that they

1628

00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,679
bunch of those but um everybody likes

1640

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,359

1650
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,480
i don't know man um

1651
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:55,598
he's one of those like we're talking

1652
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,719
about earlier there's stuff that's out

1653
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,838
there that's real that people are i

1654
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,799
think they're sit on because they're

1655
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:00,078
still

1656
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,519
you know they don't they don't believe

1657
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,960
in the legal market or believe that you

1658
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,358
know they want to see what plays out and

1659
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,720
how people you know let's say that

1660
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,558
philos does get away with what they're

1661
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,239
doing or let's say that philos comes out

1662
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,480
next week and has this crazy breeding

1663
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,919
project where they are able to you know

1664
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,199
a plant replicator gun pearl powell

1665
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,880
well well now they're [ __ ] they're

1666
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,960
putting out your [ __ ] that you had just

1667
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,559
because other people you know submitted

1668
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,679
it so if it never got submitted in the

1669
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,559
first place then they would never know

1670
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,639
about it they would never be able to

1671
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,079
[ __ ] point the plant ray gun

1672
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:29,759
and so there's people out there that are

1673
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,519
sitting on things that never want them

1674
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,200
in the plant ray gun that way they're

1675
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,960
never able to

1676
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,199
uh have pieces to remake it or put it

1677
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,880
back together again if you will

1678
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,480
yeah

1679
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,119
okay so

1680
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,318
the next thing i wanted to chat about is

1681
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,838
kind of something i've been thinking

1682
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,719
about myself

1683
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:51,039
when will seeds here now be shipping to

1684
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,959
australia and or other ban countries if

1685
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:56,400
at all

1686
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,400
where you gotta go there dog like [ __ ]

1687
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,598
we may have attempted your wonderful

1688
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,598
country and they may have stopped it in

1689
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,760
customs couple times send it back

1690
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,559
um i'm not sure where we were with our

1691
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,359
last

1692
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,720
uh

1693
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:16,639
our last game that we played we'll have

1694
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,000
to talk and see off the air over that

1695
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,759
that went with but

1696
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
it's really frustrating and this can get

1697
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,319
us into a different a whole another path

1698
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,039
of

1699
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,800
of talks but it's really [ __ ]

1700
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,759
frustrating right now with that with the

1701
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,880
fact that the farm bill passed in 12 of

1702
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,400
18

1703
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,640
which came out and said that you know

1704
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,318
anything any any material any matter

1705
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,039
anything anything

1706
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,318
with less than point three percent ghc

1707
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,880
as

1708
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,798
as hemp anything above

1709
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,440
is cannabis

1710
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,440
ghc and so

1711
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,200
banking should be [ __ ] legal

1712
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,679
um

1713
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,118
to australia so the fact that it's so

1714
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:56,798
there's nothing illegal with shipping

1715
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,640
seeds if i was to smash up a hundred or

1716
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,079
school [ __ ] smash up a thousand but

1717
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:01,838
let's say they were to you know as far

1718
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,240
as shipping goes there's they won't come

1719
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,960
back and test i believe at the thc mark

1720
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:09,118
these are still you know ungerminated

1721
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,720
items and so i don't know why when the

1722
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,559
governments are all going to snap up to

1723
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:13,919
it or get through with it and decide

1724
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,920
that this is a

1725
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,440
miracle plan and and furthermore i mean

1726
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,480
i can't just get in my soap box here and

1727
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,838
build it

1728
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,838
i'll come back down off of here in a

1729
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:23,199
minute but uh furthermore i think that

1730
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,358
the [ __ ] citizens of the united

1731
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,439
states should be pissed off like i want

1732
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:28,639
to start seeing some like aren't we

1733
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,079
upset they're the government that

1734
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,920
they're just now allowing this [ __ ] to

1735
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,318
be legalized and we're [ __ ] thankful

1736
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,798
for them to legalize again [ __ ] you like

1737
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,558
you guys have known this [ __ ] since 37

1738
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,639
you guys have done this you [ __ ] you

1739
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,798
may have had the cure for cancer you may

1740
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,118
have had the cure for autism or at least

1741
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,880
made life

1742
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,400
more pleasurable or enjoyable for those

1743
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,160
with those ailments through the use of

1744
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,318
this product but you [ __ ] banned it

1745
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,199
in 37 and [ __ ] you get out get out of

1746
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:55,440
there

1747
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:56,159
and i don't know why you know i i wish

1748
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,519
the

1749
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,118
people the states would be because

1750
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,559
because we pushed that on everybody

1751
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,640
else's [ __ ] like we were the ones

1752
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,079
that drove the drove the warhammer

1753
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,318
hardest the hardest as far as we will as

1754
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,240
far as the other nations that it goes um

1755
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,880
and and banned what is now coming to

1756
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,719
fruition to be a very helpful plant

1757
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,960
um that a lot of us you know grew up

1758
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,959
with got shunned for or

1759
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,639
you know got familiar dramatized or

1760
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,519
[ __ ] over with because we were you

1761
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:23,920
know smoking or self-medicating with

1762
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,000
with our uh alternative medicine it's

1763
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,519
like no no [ __ ] you like this is the

1764
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,599
original that's the alternative your

1765
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:32,079
little chemical pill [ __ ] is alternative

1766
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,680
alternative like this is the this is the

1767
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,119
original medicine

1768
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,798
and so i think that you know people the

1769
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,119
states here you know are getting pissed

1770
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,960
off they're just now allowing us to to

1771
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,200
use this stuff but

1772
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,720
it's it's funny that that's

1773
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,199
that's what i've seen too is i started

1774
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:50,239
to see i start to see him spinning it as

1775
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:53,199
far as cbd is now coming from hemp

1776
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:55,759
um and media and so it's not like oh

1777
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,679
this is this is weed pot marijuana no

1778
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,319
this cbd comes from hemp

1779
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:03,598
it's like no [ __ ] it's the same thing

1780
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:05,119
like it's not yeah you don't nobody went

1781
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,880
back and [ __ ] told mother nature that

1782
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,480
we decided in 37 one was hemp and one

1783
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,640
was cbd

1784
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,838
and one was cannabis like we did we

1785
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,759
didn't tell mother nature the [ __ ]

1786
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,519
terms were planned it comes back as

1787
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,559
cannabis sativa elf i'm on if i'm not

1788
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,679
mistaken

1789
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,640
yeah

1790
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:19,838
and so

1791
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,679
uh

1792
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,519
it's but i start to see the media like

1793
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,598
trying to cover their [ __ ] asses by

1794
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,199
saying that this is you know from

1795
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,798
derived from hemp plants and only from

1796
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,118
implants you know or

1797
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:34,480
uh and not giving not getting the full

1798
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:37,200
plant the full attentions do so

1799
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,599
yeah no i i agree and i often wonder for

1800
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,838
example if people will look back in the

1801
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,519
future and think this was like a

1802
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,119
almost a hundred year version of like

1803
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:46,480
alcohol prohibition where like looking

1804
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,358
back they're like what like why did they

1805
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,960
ban it that's such a stupid move like

1806
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:52,798
yeah i think for sure like i said it was

1807
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,880
so you know america the only country

1808
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,239
that [ __ ] banned the cure for cancer

1809
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,838
so you know

1810
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,439
uh and i definitely think we'll look

1811
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,279
back and especially when i mean we're

1812
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,519
still just at the at the forefront of

1813
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,680
this [ __ ] we talk about medical uh

1814
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,000
medical ailments and different uh the

1815
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,519
ability to use isolates distillates and

1816
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
separate things and put things together

1817
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,400
and you know dial in exact combos for

1818
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,920
people um which i think will all

1819
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,960
fortunately and unfortunately be part of

1820
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,159
the future

1821
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,400
like in the future like i've seen it

1822
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:21,759
happen too in some of these places now i

1823
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
don't think i feel very good about it

1824
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,799
but

1825
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,480
they'll they'll have uh pens they're

1826
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,880
just like relaxed

1827
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,240
and calm

1828
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,000
sleep i think we've all seen those focus

1829
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:35,919
like [ __ ] you you can't i mean like i

1830
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,760
get it or put them all together but i

1831
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,760
don't know i want this

1832
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,520
[ __ ] i want alien orange cookies like

1833
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,880
give me that i want shirtless give me

1834
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,000
that

1835
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,680
so

1836
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,679
yeah okay well i mean on to a bit of a

1837
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,440
different topic but one i did wanted to

1838
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,639
bring up with you again we spoke which

1839
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,039
we did speak about in our first

1840
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,318
conversation do you think you might ever

1841
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:57,358
get around to i know there's a lot of

1842
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,440
other things going on but do you think

1843
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,759
you ever might get around to working on

1844
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:05,318
that breeder catalog or is logistically

1845
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,319
it's just a bit hard

1846
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,239
um i was looking at uh some print on

1847
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:11,440
demand services the other day uh because

1848
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:12,639
i wasn't going back to listen to our

1849
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,240
last show but

1850
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,558
yeah i think i think i would like to

1851
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,159
because i can at least do it with the

1852
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,559
brands that we have that are solid and

1853
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,480
have the you know the basic the building

1854
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,000
blocks and that's what i think a lot of

1855
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,199
the breeders have been doing is they

1856
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,960
they get the

1857
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,480
basic building blocks the strains that

1858
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,079
they're notorious for and then they kind

1859
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,199
of build off those

1860
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,039
um

1861
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,558
and so we could definitely do a probably

1862
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,480
a catalog uh

1863
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,240
okay maybe i always want to do like a

1864
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,920
calendar like a

1865
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,558
one-year calendar with different strains

1866
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,960
of the month as of the pictures

1867
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,280
and it's just all cookies right

1868
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,000
oh cookies cookie fam and uh

1869
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,640
jungle boys yeah just just

1870
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,079
doing like a slab squat on like 10 of

1871
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:55,150
the 12 months

1872
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,880
yo yo yo yo

1873
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:00,960
[Laughter]

1874
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,318
the last two months we'll get our mendo

1875
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,519
dope in

1876
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:07,119
drive-by drive-by oh yeah no those guys

1877
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,519
oh well you've heard you i'm sure you've

1878
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,440
oh so that's another ad addition so we

1879
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:14,719
had uh also voted miss jill since last

1880
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,960
time we talked yeah tell me about it

1881
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,318
well the same reason that i wouldn't

1882
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,079
take other people i was like when she

1883
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:22,480
came to me i was like no no no

1884
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,519
uh and she came in in an odd fashion so

1885
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,440
let's say that like odie and sonny chiba

1886
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:29,440
were first like hey you should have jill

1887
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,639
i was like from youtube like

1888
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,400
you guys would be the first ones to

1889
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:33,920
[ __ ] hate her like you guys you know

1890
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,920
i've heard very many things come out of

1891
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,760
your mouth about her but as they tell it

1892
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,960
she's a much different person she's

1893
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,240
different than she was when she was

1894
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,240
recepcal

1895
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:43,838
and so but i said i told her i said well

1896
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:45,358
that still doesn't change the fact that

1897
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,199
you probably learned everything from

1898
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,480
subcool and i don't you know i don't

1899
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:51,039
know that i want that kind of breeding

1900
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,599
practices i want to support that

1901
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,880
and so and she let me know that you know

1902
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,720
one of the things about her strengths

1903
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,039
her releases is that they're not being

1904
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,959
bred by her she's uh she's in collab

1905
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,440
with a breeder uh forgetting his name

1906
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,440
off top of my head i think it's moses

1907
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,440
miles right but uh

1908
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,720
he's taking so it's not her it's during

1909
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,159
the breeding and she's you know quick to

1910
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,838
say that but it's her strains that

1911
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,039
you're you know picking them and what

1912
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:14,960
not working through and so i think

1913
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,159
that's so that's why i was i said okay

1914
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,079
you know that that i can represent

1915
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,679
because i don't want to play off the you

1916
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,200
know you're this breeder now because

1917
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,558
that's not what's going on and if you

1918
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:24,399
are i don't want to represent it because

1919
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,798
you'd suck at it because you learned

1920
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,680
from from suck sucker and suck and say

1921
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:29,280
no

1922
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,318
uh but she said you know she's working

1923
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,839
with another guy i was like well cool

1924
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:32,960
that that i think is that i can work

1925
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,599
with

1926
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,199
so yeah we added her and she's got a

1927
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,200
whole jelly line she's coming up with

1928
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,118
chili jelly beans and

1929
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,719
whatnot oranges and

1930
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,798
flavors

1931
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,118
yeah i'm glad things worked out for her

1932
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,519
and you know and i know people are quick

1933
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,358
to hate on sub but i i think it's kind

1934
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,199
of sad to see what's happened to him you

1935
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,960
know like i think

1936
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,279
subs in a bit of a bad place at the

1937
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,280
moment

1938
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,760
yeah um

1939
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,399
i think that

1940
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,640
we put ourselves in certain positions by

1941
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,599
our certain actions and whatnot but

1942
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,440
uh

1943
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,960
i hear 7-7 is different from what i'm

1944
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,519
told now you know i've never been a fan

1945
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,679
of the guy uh who will put back on

1946
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,199
exotic again but if somebody watched the

1947
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:18,879
way he talked to people [ __ ] exotic

1948
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,879
would have been breeding for him

1949
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,798
like that's you exotic well those are

1950
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,358
the videos that that guy that he watched

1951
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:26,400
and for as much as i dislike subcool for

1952
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:27,598
you know

1953
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,880
i

1954
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,680
i get what he's saying but he tries to

1955
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,680
take

1956
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,399
he tries to do what i don't want to do

1957
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:35,279
like

1958
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,240
take

1959
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,280
credit for their strengths or for them

1960
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:41,038
being

1961
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,359
in positions to win things or to get

1962
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:46,079
notoriety because he was the broker for

1963
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:48,318
everything he wants credit for

1964
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,480
doing it and i i get it from being from

1965
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:53,038
broker side where we're distribution and

1966
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,119
we we we push certain strains we can you

1967
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,400
know we can do these and do those

1968
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,440
um

1969
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,599
but

1970
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,960
the credit still lies in the breeder

1971
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,640
like i don't i don't have nothing to do

1972
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,240
with it besides

1973
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,239
you know get into the customer or making

1974
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,558
a suggestion to the customer relaying

1975
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,759
the information you give me to them

1976
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,680
but and that's where me and some you

1977
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,440
know differ on thoughts opinions he

1978
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:14,318
wants he wants credit for distribution

1979
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,039
and

1980
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:18,239
you know i think that that it is it's

1981
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,680
not a hard pill to swallow but i think

1982
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:21,759
our credit comes from when i get paid

1983
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,399
like that's my i'm a broker i move i

1984
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,839
move gear um if i don't have uh i don't

1985
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,160
have feminized trains whether i like

1986
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,759
them or not my customers want them um if

1987
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,759
i need them i'll find them and i'll find

1988
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,799
breeders there that have them and again

1989
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,520
good ones

1990
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:35,358
um

1991
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,559
if i want autos i'm not a fan autos but

1992
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:37,920
if you need autos because of where

1993
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,039
you're at you're [ __ ] in washington

1994
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,079
and so you're going to get an outdoor

1995
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,599
crop

1996
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,200
that are here and i mean excuse me here

1997
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,039
in alaska and that's the only way to get

1998
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,798
an outdoor crop and who might just say

1999
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,400
that that you know i don't want you in

2000
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:49,679
my competition and buying shitty seats

2001
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,519
so let me see let me sign and find some

2002
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:52,239
good ones and see who we could go with

2003
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:55,440
and

2004
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:59,078
uh i i called it two years ago as far as

2005
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,079
my festo goes

2006
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,160
those guys [ __ ] continue to hit out

2007
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:03,440
of the park they've had some situations

2008
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:04,399
as of late i was talking to mitch

2009
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,720
recently

2010
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,720
but uh their gear is still that's still

2011
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,879
top of my charts i don't know that have

2012
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,118
you found many other auto autofilm guys

2013
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,318
that are working lines like they did or

2014
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,318
they do

2015
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,759
i don't want to sell anyone short but

2016
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,960
not they're in a league of their own

2017
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,920
mephisto

2018
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,798
yeah

2019
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,880
so

2020
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,079
just wish they could scale but yeah

2021
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,640
they're

2022
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,160
yeah they put in the work right yeah

2023
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:29,118
lots of they do lots of works on those

2024
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,038
things that's the thing you don't just

2025
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,720
take a plant and flip it over overnight

2026
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,920
and make it an autofilm

2027
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:35,759
like

2028
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,760
there's some breeding and some some [ __ ]

2029
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,960
that's got to go on with inbreeding of

2030
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,880
photos and non-photos in your breeding

2031
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,679
habits like four times three times each

2032
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,039
way

2033
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,798
so yeah they

2034
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,880
when they realized how much work they do

2035
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:50,960
as opposed to other people don't do they

2036
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,000
were a little perturbed

2037
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,119
yeah

2038
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,199
yeah i can imagine right so it's been a

2039
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,640
minute since we last spoke and we

2040
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,000
haven't i haven't really touched on it

2041
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,000
much on the show because a lot of other

2042
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,159
people such as sun grown meds have done

2043
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,318
a really good job about it but um

2044
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,000
the filos controversy you know like i

2045
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,480
wanted to ask how can anyone feel

2046
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,639
confident about getting any form of

2047
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,079
genetic mapping done nowadays like do

2048
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:16,000
you just have to accept if you want to

2049
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,440
get some genetic mapping done if that

2050
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,440
shit's going to get sold one day

2051
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,558
i think that's what that's where people

2052
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,079
have come you know

2053
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,359
uh

2054
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,400
we we called it a long time ago uh

2055
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,639
we

2056
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,000
um we were with them for uh for a minute

2057
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,598
until they couldn't explain their their

2058
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,559
business model to me or talked to ralph

2059
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:39,200
the guys today you know uh

2060
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,720
you don't have this this uh

2061
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,960
facility these machines these

2062
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,879
technicians for [ __ ] seven dollars a

2063
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,039
test like that's that's not gonna meet

2064
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,160
your overhead what's like what's the

2065
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,520
endgame what are you doing with the rest

2066
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,798
of that [ __ ]

2067
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:52,159
of that uh

2068
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,159
that sequence

2069
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,078
um and they and they didn't have an

2070
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,358
answer and so

2071
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,119
uh

2072
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,639
they came out and told leblanc during

2073
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,000
the block on his show that they would

2074
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:03,759
never do breeding nishan came out and

2075
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,880
said that jerry has it has it on tape

2076
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,920
you know nisha and said they'd never do

2077
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,160
breeding

2078
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,599
so that's kind of it's just

2079
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,480
it's really bad it's what everybody

2080
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,559
thought was going on was going on like

2081
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,559
we all thought that that was the the the

2082
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,400
ability or you know at least to give

2083
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,760
them a further heads up and start on a

2084
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,400
project and

2085
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,960
kind of that's what happened um

2086
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,960
dunn had him on the day after that or

2087
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,639
two days after that story broke

2088
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,880
done had him on the show so they could

2089
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,879
uh damage control

2090
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,920
damage control and it was [ __ ] worse

2091
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,480
like i don't know if you listen or not

2092
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,920
but they didn't do themselves any favors

2093
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,960
like if i was a pr guy out there i'd be

2094
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,720
calling finalists right now i'd be like

2095
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,480
hey you guys need a pr guy

2096
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,919
because they were like he was just

2097
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,838
lighting himself up left and right he

2098
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,240
was like we never never you know planned

2099
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,838
to be breeders but we're just like

2100
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:51,759
we kind of had to be

2101
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,358
like oh no

2102
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,559
and then they just kept saying like

2103
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,558
we'll never sell you information we'll

2104
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,160
never sell it and i just thought like

2105
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,599
we'll never will but we never will but

2106
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,078
the company we sell our ass to [ __ ]

2107
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,359
jewel you know like yeah they won't tell

2108
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,200
you information but whatever they sell

2109
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,318
out to they will and i've heard and i

2110
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,439
don't know if it's true or not but i've

2111
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:09,679
heard that

2112
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,920
they've uh they've been offered money or

2113
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:13,358
they've tried to sell but they only have

2114
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,358
the short code read they didn't do the

2115
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:19,279
long code that's why they can't tell the

2116
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:21,038
difference between cookies and okay gb

2117
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,798
yeah that's an interesting one how

2118
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,720
things that are clearly different

2119
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,318
sometimes show up as the exact same

2120
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:28,000
thing and of course you could argue

2121
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,759
there's some close relation but that

2122
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,280
does seem like a short sighting in the

2123
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,720
technology right

2124
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,079
right that's just and i believe that

2125
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:35,598
comes from reading just the short code

2126
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,880
on the sequence if they pulled the long

2127
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,880
code which is more expensive and more

2128
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,000
extensive process when they were doing

2129
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,079
these tests then they would have had

2130
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,079
valuable data so say because that's what

2131
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,720
it all comes down to is data

2132
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,079
um and they don't have that or the data

2133
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:49,838
they have is incomplete so they can't

2134
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,280
tell the difference right now between

2135
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,119
you know on the filos chart as far as

2136
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,440
you know cookies and okgb because

2137
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,358
they're so the short code shows you know

2138
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,559
same same same

2139
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:00,078
but the long code would read them

2140
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,880
different

2141
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,160
so

2142
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,200
well i don't know what truth like i said

2143
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,078
there is that that's just what i've

2144
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,759
heard

2145
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,760
of course everything i say no it's true

2146
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,640
on here i'm just a [ __ ] liar and you

2147
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,599
know just it's all hearsay yeah this is

2148
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:13,920
all just

2149
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,319
for entertainment purposes yeah always

2150
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,920
always

2151
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,520
so the next thing i wanted to bring up

2152
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,679
much more lighthearted point than the

2153
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,080
past little bit of discussion but what

2154
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,880
is with breeders and their obsession

2155
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:30,479
with breeding pit bulls we've got you

2156
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,920
elena bob hemphill and jj that that's

2157
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,479
just off the top of my head you know

2158
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,520
there's a trend here what's going on

2159
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:39,759
uh i don't know and and jj's pit bulls

2160
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,480
this and i'm not a breeder uh i've i

2161
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,560
just recently got a mail that uh elena

2162
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,519
has bread from green fire

2163
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,400
um

2164
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,319
and he's just a little awesome stud boy

2165
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:54,639
and he's just already set for a couple

2166
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:57,039
shows but uh i i think it's so so so but

2167
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,199
nonetheless uh elena's still a breeder

2168
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:03,359
of dogs jj still with with with with

2169
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:04,960
pitts um micotech also does dogs um

2170
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,120
but i think it's just breeders and

2171
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,279
breeding

2172
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,559
so uh i hate to bring up zonic again

2173
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,920
because he's kind of like [ __ ] i

2174
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,839
don't know just [ __ ] be his biggest

2175
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,079
fan boy this time but i talked to him i

2176
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:17,359
know him he's my guy uh he's breeding

2177
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,719
chickens

2178
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,880
okay so

2179
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,679
okay he's got he's got [ __ ] he wants

2180
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,279
black chickens that like green eggs

2181
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,199
all right now for if we think about

2182
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,199
exotic and the extents he goes to and is

2183
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,879
in his cannabis breeding well what does

2184
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,798
that mean he's going to what extents is

2185
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,560
he going to and his chicken breeding

2186
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,319
well that means he's [ __ ] sourcing

2187
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,400
eggs from canada

2188
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,640
bringing him through customs hatching

2189
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,639
them incubating them and then so he has

2190
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,880
different [ __ ] ones because they're

2191
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,480
because chickens like [ __ ] cannabis

2192
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,159
are all gonna be different and so he

2193
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,838
hatches them from [ __ ] eggs they get

2194
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,599
different ones and then when everyone's

2195
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:52,798
don't make the cut he stitch he's saying

2196
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,239
he says oh

2197
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:55,920
because there's one that was like oh

2198
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,198
dude that's the winner for sure he was

2199
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,480
like nope that one's ended up in the

2200
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:03,599
[ __ ] frying pan i was like no

2201
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,198
so but he he made like the [ __ ] w of

2202
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,480
chicken huts uh if you look on his

2203
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,639
instagram it's like these chicken hats

2204
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,718
are all [ __ ] piped and plumbed and

2205
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,640
all [ __ ] marbled i'm like god damn

2206
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,079
like it was it was a there's a tangent

2207
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,159
he went off on but i think it's just

2208
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:19,198
breeders breeding i mean we looked at

2209
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:21,920
archive he was started with orchids

2210
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:25,039
um so my guy amuerta who i'm bringing on

2211
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,800
he [ __ ] does pythons

2212
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,880
huh

2213
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,440
so can i do one

2214
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,119
yeah it's a very unusual one and big

2215
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:33,839
pythons and he's [ __ ] smart about it

2216
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:34,800
too

2217
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,679
um

2218
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,679
but the same uh the same things or

2219
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,480
characteristics for color he you can use

2220
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,000
it and as same as canvas but once you

2221
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,919
gotta let him explain all that because

2222
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,679
it was it blew my mind but i don't like

2223
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,880
snakes they are [ __ ] nonetheless big

2224
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,840
ones that want to [ __ ] squeeze you to

2225
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,440
death

2226
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,250
but uh i mean i like i don't even like

2227
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:56,289
hugs

2228
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:56,289
[Laughter]

2229
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,080
but yeah uh yeah snakes man uh but he

2230
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:03,519
just breeds snakes now he's in the he's

2231
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:05,679
doing cannabis

2232
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,159
there you go what a crossover and you

2233
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:11,760
brought up a good little talking point

2234
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:14,479
microtech just released that gg4 ibl

2235
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,800
tell me a little bit about that

2236
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,718
so my pr uh

2237
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,079
i'm not allowed to mention that strain

2238
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,640
by its name

2239
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:25,119
oh oh yeah because of that lawsuit

2240
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,119
[ __ ]

2241
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,519
i don't know but we just try to

2242
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,520
avoid the drama but yeah somebody else

2243
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,920
put one out now who

2244
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,880
i guess you know it wasn't necessarily

2245
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,319
josie just she approved but uh

2246
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,719
did his own [ __ ] work and he's smart

2247
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,799
and got it back to an ibl and has you

2248
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,960
know documentation of the [ __ ] thing

2249
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,480
and so jose he's even said josie pack

2250
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,399
but he's cool with it so yeah michael

2251
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,959
tech put it out they flew they who were

2252
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:52,799
gone day one um glad to have tech back

2253
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,399
that guy is uh

2254
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,480
once again a breeders breeder if you

2255
01:11:54,399 --> 01:12:00,319
follow him online you see

2256
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:00,319
he controls the penis envy if you will

2257
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:06,079

2259
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:11,519
i like him um and it's rough that gets

2260
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,480
us into a different subject but uh

2261
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,719
in my mind but um

2266
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,039
seeds is [ __ ] you know it's just

2267
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,559
[ __ ]

2268
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,000

this is a knife

2277
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,439
you'll lose track of how many times

2278
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:48,399
people call you a [ __ ] in an endearing

2279
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:50,238
way

2280
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:51,839
all right i'll come back calling people

2281
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:53,919

dude yeah you i when i come to the

2283

states i have to like watch myself

2284
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,559
because people just use it as like a

2285
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:02,079
substitute for friend

2286
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,400
oh yeah that's not what they call here

2287
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:06,239
like girls don't see i don't know most

2288
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:09,519
women do not appreciate the c word

2289
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:12,158
[Laughter]

2290
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,600
no i got it i got a female friend and we

2291
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:14,399
probably call each other that word every

2292
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,400
day

2293
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,479
oh well yeah i've just come to know that

2294
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,399
no not a lot of females enjoy that word

2295
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,079
if you want you want slapping time

2296
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,000
that's when you bring out that word

2297
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,079
yeah right that's the difference we

2298
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,439
traded we traded guns for the use of the

2299
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,000
word [ __ ]

2300
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,519
yeah legally well fair enough yeah you

2301
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,880
know it wasn't all right trade you know

2302
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,760
retrospectively

2303
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,719
um

2304
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,760
anyway

2305
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,279
let's let's get back into this yeah

2306
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,640
i thought we're ready though back in

2307
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,639
this [ __ ]

2308
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,760
oh yeah we would i'll cut that bit out

2309
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,440
we're good

2310
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,039
so yeah just i mean going on that last

2311
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:48,879
point right it seems like there's a lot

2312
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:50,479
of people in the community who really

2313
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,560
kind of only see things in black and

2314
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:55,198
white no shades of grey type thing and

2315
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,280
as a businessman you seem well aware

2316
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,198
that you can't allow yourself to fall

2317
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:01,519
into this pit for yourself and we can

2318
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:03,839
see the proof of that by virtue of the

2319
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,679
fact that there are breeders who you

2320
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,360
yourself admit you didn't once get along

2321
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,158
with are now part of the seats here in

2322
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:11,439
our lineup so what would your advice be

2323
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,439
to people

2324
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:15,519
out there who have these long-standing

2325
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,198
grudges and like won't go near a certain

2326
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,880
person because of like something which

2327
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:19,919
may even not be related to them like

2328
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,079
maybe it happened to a friend or

2329
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,520
whatever and it just happened ages ago

2330
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,800
what would be your advice you know like

2331
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,400
do you feel like people need to take a

2332
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:30,000
step back and trust people a bit more so

2333
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:31,759
you [ __ ] i see you wrote that one

2334
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,880
sitting on the toilet huh that was a

2335
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,800
good one look at that one good lordy

2336
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,679
uh

2337
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,039
i think

2338
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:42,880
i think everybody does in general like

2339
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,359
a lot of people just because our general

2340
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,960
mentality i think some of us have maybe

2341
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,279
seen this as a

2342
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,880
as a as a green rush unfortunately and

2343
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,319
it looked short-term and been like hey

2344
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,239
you know let's let's get what i can get

2345
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:57,119
while i'm getting it and that because

2346
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:58,559
that's good enough no you're missing out

2347
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:00,319
on the picture like look at the long

2348
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,400
term of this this is an actual industry

2349
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:04,079
in a business now and you can't

2350
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:05,920
you can't treat [ __ ] like you used to be

2351
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,679
able to like if you

2352
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,880
for instance you had a situation with

2353
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,359
somebody in the past you didn't like

2354
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,600
somebody you could relatively meet them

2355
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,359
at the airport and duke it out and then

2356
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,280
one person would win and one person

2357
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:19,920
would get their ass kicked and no matter

2358
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,599
whose side were one uh it would be over

2359
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,440
and it wouldn't continue to [ __ ]

2360
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,280
haunt the channels of facebook or

2361
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:26,719
instagram or any of that [ __ ] it'll be

2362
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,840
over and two guys would [ __ ] figure

2363
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,600
it out

2364
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,640
but now with everybody in everybody's

2365
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,440
business

2366
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,079
um

2367
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:35,279
[ __ ] just gets it's overblown and

2368
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:36,238
quickly

2369
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,479
and

2370
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:39,919
uh i think before we overblow things you

2371
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,919
know um

2372
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,000
try to reach out that person and

2373
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,440
ask themselves and i i don't know i

2374
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,198
think i think i was

2375
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,639
of course i think i was on the right

2376
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,238
side of things because i

2377
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,039
judge myself well but

2378
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:52,639
um

2379
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,279
recently

2380
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,960
somebody posted that

2381
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:58,079
they had a difference with our company

2382
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,960
they didn't like they didn't like my

2383
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,479
company

2384
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,520
and somebody else posted another content

2385
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:03,279
down there

2386
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,440
and went back to the original two people

2387
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:06,880
i said hey i said before i say anything

2388
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:09,279
online or before i ask you about

2389
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,800
anything about youtube um is there

2390
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,840
something i didn't do or wrong or

2391
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,199
something in a certain way that i

2392
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,319
[ __ ] wronged you for you to say this

2393
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:15,759
thing

2394
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:16,960
because you know those screenshots

2395
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,039
showed me with it like hey do you know

2396
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,719
about this so i reached out to them and

2397
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:22,399
direct messages instead of just about

2398
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,840
putting them up a blast

2399
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,519
but the one guy came back to me and said

2400
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,360
he said he said i don't know i said i

2401
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,800
didn't post that he said my web guy went

2402
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:29,920
through this stuff he doesn't post he's

2403
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,440
like i can't get into my instagram

2404
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,359
account i can't give him this other

2405
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:34,879
thing but he's like i'm sorry i didn't

2406
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,119
post that

2407
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,960
i said well it's

2408
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:40,000
not a lot of the [ __ ] adds up you know

2409
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,119
it's kind of hard to believe that [ __ ]

2410
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,479
but if you're telling me you didn't post

2411
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,000
it everything i know about you is that

2412
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:45,919
we don't have a [ __ ] issue then yeah

2413
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,359
just do me a favor say something that

2414
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,960
you didn't mean to post it or you just

2415
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:50,158
take it down and say you didn't post it

2416
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,840
we're cool but

2417
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:53,920
you know even you know

2418
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,679
each breeder has their say 10 fanboys

2419
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,719
and they'll [ __ ] take a bullet for

2420
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,960
them if you will you know what i mean

2421
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,000
and so you know their opinion matters

2422
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,079
and when

2423
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,198
they say something negative about me or

2424
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,319
the company

2425
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:06,319
not only does it hurt the rest of

2426
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,759
breeders but it's it's it's not good and

2427
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:08,880
those guys are going to take us to heart

2428
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,400
their fans

2429
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,560
and so i asked him to just trust you

2430
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:14,799
know do a favorite from attraction he

2431
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,400
was like he said cool no problem and he

2432
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,719
took care of that and that was said and

2433
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,319
done with um which i thought was you

2434
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,239
know was kind of the way it

2435
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:24,158
could have should have been um but

2436
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,000
that's that's weird you know if you look

2437
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,000
at that more in depth because then

2438
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,760
which i seem to do but

2439
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,960
like so that means somebody had to hack

2440
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,039
his account

2441
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,840
to say [ __ ] about me

2442
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:37,279
to make it look like i was mad at him

2443
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,880
and that'll make them too [ __ ] pissed

2444
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,960
off each other

2445
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,520
like what kind of weird [ __ ] is that

2446
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,800
in this world like that

2447
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,159
like there's a guy who hacks somebody

2448
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,600
else's account just to talk [ __ ] about

2449
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:49,839
me to make me

2450
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,840
not happy with that guy

2451
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,239
yeah well why

2452
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,440
but that in fact is what allegedly

2453
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:57,039
happened because i have no reason not to

2454
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:58,799
believe this other guy

2455
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,158
but so i didn't you know i didn't let it

2456
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,440
blow out to me i just said reach out to

2457
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:02,719
the guy i said hey do you ever take it

2458
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,639
down and say you didn't say it and we're

2459
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,039
cool and he did it and it was awesome

2460
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,400
and you know i was a nice guy i didn't

2461
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:09,760
have an issue with him to start with him

2462
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:11,359
i haven't issued him now

2463
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,679
but um

2464
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,359
yeah it's it's uh it's a weird it's a

2465
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,960
weird gray area because we're not like i

2466
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:17,839
said we're not in the time of day we

2467
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,198
could just

2468
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,360
kick somebody's door in or don't meet

2469
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,000
with the airport and and we're not still

2470
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:24,000
at

2471
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,079
a day where

2472
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,520
where we can file contracts and [ __ ]

2473
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,119
sue people yet because then you know

2474
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,800
that's still frowned upon because it's

2475
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,880
legal whatsoever how can you sue

2476
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,840
somebody for violating a contract well

2477
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,199
it's either that or kick in their

2478
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,079
[ __ ] front door and i can't do that

2479
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:37,439
because you guys are calling me an

2480
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:39,119
[ __ ] my lawyer says i'd never win

2481
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:41,919
that case

2482
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:44,319
and so it's a real conundrum of

2483
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,679
of what to do and and

2484
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,799
and

2485
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,158
i don't know that kicking in anybody's

2486
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,679
[ __ ] front door is the right answer

2487
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,759
to anything you know if we could sit

2488
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,679
down and smoke a bowl with them um and

2489
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,039
finish it out it'd probably be a lot a

2490
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,199
lot better world but that'd be too

2491
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:00,079
[ __ ] easy and that would be drama and

2492
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:02,158
we need drama to sell [ __ ] and so

2493
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:03,519
let's stir the pot a little bit

2494
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:04,559
um

2495
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,159
i don't know how that got me on to

2496
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,239
thinking about this but one of the

2497
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,279
coolest moments i had this past year was

2498
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:12,959
uh

2499
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,639
being able to go see the grateful dead

2500
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,000
with kim dog

2501
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,880
at

2502
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,479
um foxborough the same place that he saw

2503
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,400
his first show

2504
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:23,839
i i went and saw i've never seen

2505
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:24,960
grateful dead before i've never i never

2506
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,400
got it

2507
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,560
i was there one of the dead heads didn't

2508
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,158
really knew their acid knew their

2509
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,199
parking lot knew of course the kim's

2510
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:33,679
story but

2511
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,519
um mickey hart one of the drummers

2512
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,719
for grateful dead i'd say one of the

2513
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,719
drummers if you're not familiar with the

2514
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,560
grapefruit bed if you are as a band like

2515
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,158
i was cool well here's the thing about

2516
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,920
them they're real estates i didn't know

2517
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:46,399
they have two [ __ ] drum kits up there

2518
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,319
there's two guys playing the drums

2519
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:50,000
and they're each as i put it to kim dog

2520
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:51,519
and he said i said it correctly he said

2521
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,479
he's like yeah that's how you think of

2522
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,920
it but

2523
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:55,678
one drummer will finish the other

2524
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,199
drummer's sentence

2525
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,960
like when they're like if they're like

2526
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:00,879
if they were there to be speech or the

2527
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,000
drums are really talking like one

2528
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,199
gentleman would finish the other guy

2529
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,399
since but the other guy would do other

2530
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,359
things in the middle of the other guy's

2531
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,119
sentence

2532
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:09,198
and so it's pretty [ __ ] cool to see

2533
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,039
both guys going off on all the songs

2534
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,960
just playing together

2535
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,479
i just know bands that have one drum kit

2536
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,079
or one drummer so you see a pair of them

2537
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:17,359
was pretty awesome

2538
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:18,960
um

2539
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,119
so he so we met with mickey heart mickey

10 or 12 provists rvs out there which

2547
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,120

2548
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:37,759
but they're just starting their tour and

2549
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:40,158

2553
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,520
mindful mindset

2554

2558
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,199
um

2559

tenths of a gram

2569
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,279
it's not a loss

2570
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:24,238
it's like a [ __ ] pinner right it's

2571

01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,519
which is [ __ ] phenomenal um and i'll

2592
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,560
relay it to you as much as best as i can

2593
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,840
but

2594
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,440
the you know he says in 64 65 66 like

2595
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,639
they'd have the bricks so they would you

2596
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:08,158
know they call them bricks because they

2597
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,840
came to these little bricks you know

2598
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:11,679
they were hard and square you know like

2599
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,679
bricks we'd throw the money down and

2600
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,760
they'd throw the weed up and you know

2601
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,119
we'd keep smoking you know lots of seeds

2602
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,400
and stems you know lots of seeds

2603
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:21,198
incentives to say

2604
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:23,039
and then he's like and then i remember

2605
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:25,039
i remember the the other stuff coming

2606
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,479
around the 70s that had less less seeds

2607
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:28,238
and stems

2608
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:30,718
so that was good then he was like i can

2609
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:33,119
remember like i think it was

2610
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,279
73 maybe

2611
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:37,279
first time we experienced the indica

2612
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:38,800
it was like these guys came up and said

2613
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,800
that man we got some way that will

2614
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,239
really knock you on your ass and he said

2615
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,679
oh we're the [ __ ] dead man what do

2616
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:45,439
you think you got

2617
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,480
as you said he's like so we smoked this

2618
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:47,839
stuff and

2619
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:48,959
like an hour later he's like we're just

2620
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,159
looking at each other on the couch like

2621
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,520
hey you want to play he's like no you

2622
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:52,719
want to go play he's like no we didn't

2623
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,679
want to get up man we just didn't want

2624
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,039
to play

2625
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:56,560
and the people he's like they're yelling

2626
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:58,399
out there they get all pissed off at us

2627
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,920
because we don't want to [ __ ] move

2628
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,319
he's like and that's that was that was

2629
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,920
the first time we experienced the indica

2630
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:05,920
you know and then and then he went

2631
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,760
through how he was growing stuff and you

2632
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,158
know how he was had some couple crows

2633
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,400
that were unsuccessful but he tried and

2634
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,920
you know just like the the history of

2635
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:15,839
cannabis and that band have definitely

2636
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,840
got a [ __ ] tie together but it was

2637
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,440
really cool just to see him and

2638
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,639
kim dog kind of talk about the the

2639
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,638
history of themselves together

2640
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,600
but even even mickey where he's at

2641
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,079
mickey didn't realize that there was

2642
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,199
more than one c91 he's like there's i

2643
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:30,559
was like you know you can do different

2644
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:32,079
releases of different brands because you

2645
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,440
know me the marketing guy like you know

2646
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:36,000
you can do it kim says you can do a

2647
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,279
[ __ ] you know uh kim d and he's like

2648
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,719
what do you mean i was like there's

2649
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:40,479
different phenos like what do you mean

2650
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,000
i'm like okay

2651
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:43,919
yeah wow

2652
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,639
that's incredible story yeah i remember

2653
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,560
you posted that up and i was a bit uh

2654
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,480
intrigued as to what actually went down

2655
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,159
but cool never never would i have

2656
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,759
thought he had such interesting stories

2657
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:55,279
but i mean i guess also it should be

2658
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,280
expected

2659
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:59,119
yeah and and and definitely [ __ ]

2660
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:01,119
bucket list type of [ __ ] like i couldn't

2661
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:04,079
be more humble that that kim dog asked

2662
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:06,639
me to go um that he's you know i i

2663
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:09,279
consider that guy a friend um he blew me

2664
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:11,359
up a wonka pipe that he made for me um

2665

yeah certainly i can attest to that i

2670
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,079

yeah she's great so for them to ask me

2673
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,920
and and then to have like not just the

2674
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,079
experience of it like four tickets but

2675
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,399
uh mickey heart to his credit his his

2676
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:37,439
[ __ ] uh production manager was

2677
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:40,000
the most [ __ ] on the ball guy [ __ ]

2678
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:41,919
man ever like this guy had [ __ ]

2679
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,359
15 irons to the fire and he's just fired

2680
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,440
in all directions boom boom boom boom

2681
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:48,399

2682
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:49,839
just a really excellent road guy but he

2683
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:51,519
was in his mickey's personal answer but

2684
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,840
the guy was [ __ ] on the on the ball

2685
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,800
but he uh he got us hooked up with a

2686
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,639
sweet

2687
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,159
and so it was stocked it wasn't you know

2688
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,159
it wasn't it was stock of popcorn and

2689
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:02,319
water drinks and stuff and then he

2690
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:04,559
hooked us up with uh backstage tickets

2691
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,238
so we got uh we got backstage and we're

2692
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,600
like you know pretty much like the only

2693
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,519
pair that we're back there

2694
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,039
while mickey i'm a free family with a

2695
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,239
show but i guess they call it drums in

2696
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:16,880
space that's like a break for the for

2697
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,319
the for the band and then mickey and uh

2698
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,600
the other drummer and the almond brother

2699
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:21,759
come up and they do

2700
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,159
like this [ __ ] awesome thing of drums

2701
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,159
and bells and [ __ ]

2702
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:28,000
and it was really just really cool to

2703
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:29,759
see it from firsthand because i'm used

2704
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,079
to you know making music production on

2705
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,600
the dance music side which is you know

2706
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:35,840
if you want a [ __ ] symbol or if you

2707
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,440
want a hi-hat you just add a new bar and

2708
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:40,319
just cut and paste a little hi-hat right

2709
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:42,158
there and then you're cool um in the 60s

2710
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,840
if you needed a [ __ ] cowbell every 12

2711
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:45,279
beats well you need a guy to [ __ ] hit

2712
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,639
the cowbell every 12 minutes you know

2713
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:48,559
what i mean like you couldn't just

2714
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,159
[ __ ] cut and paste that guy in you

2715
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,600
needed to do to over there just be you

2716
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:52,638
know knock on this other you know this

2717
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,239
opposite

2718
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:57,440
rhythm that you're doing and hitting the

2719
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,879
cowbell weirdly and so uh just to

2720
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:00,719
witness that [ __ ] then he played like i

2721
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,119
said this beam thing which

2722
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,279
earlier he had talked to us about man

2723
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:05,279
just

2724
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,359
oh

2725
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:11,678
i don't know yeah

2726
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:14,559
sitting sonically sending images through

2727
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,920
your mind to you by the use of of of

2728
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,360
scanning

2729
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,039
through drones

2730
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:20,799
like suddenly sending your drones into

2731
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,560
your mind and getting you to like

2732
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,440

like what if he can sonically send me

2750
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,319
[ __ ] in my mind like images that make me

2751
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,079
recall a [ __ ] flavor

2752
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:01,679
like [ __ ]

2753
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:02,800
so when he was playing it like i got him

2754
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,399
on camera he's looking at me i'm like

2755
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,279
dude you're beaming people on here he's

2756
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:06,479
like i asked him i said you're gonna

2757
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:08,079
play the beam tonight you gotta send

2758
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,638
some drones she's like we'll take it out

2759
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:12,000
for a spin

2760
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,440
oh [ __ ]

2761
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,039
that's interesting you're like like so

2762
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:19,678
talented in so many different ways for

2763
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:20,800
just one particular really weird kook

2764
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,399
yeah but

2765
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,000
i don't know i i don't

2766
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:25,439
i don't think it's parkour i think it's

2767
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,319
you might be able to send people sonic

2768
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:30,238
messages through the [ __ ] sound waves

2769
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:31,439
and make them recall a strain

2770
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,079
like that's basically what it was is

2771
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:36,479
that i can by scanning your barcode i

2772
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:39,039
can send you sound drones that make you

2773
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:42,718
trigger that thought

2774
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:43,519
yeah it's pretty wild stuff well

2775
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:45,039
yeah

2776
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,480
it's it's out there but as accomplished

2777
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,039
as he is you know you look at all this

2778
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:50,718
[ __ ] cratchit like well

2779
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:52,479
maybe he's onto something here you know

2780
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:53,760
it's weird it's weird until it's [ __ ]

2781
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:54,879
not you know

2782
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,760
yeah

2783
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,319
well

2784
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,760
maybe we should depart back to the realm

2785
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:04,000
of regular cannabis all right sorry

2786
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,960
i took it i took it down detour that was

2787
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,639
that was a good little detour let's um

2788
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,319
something i i didn't ask you when i

2789
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,159
should have um how do you feel about

2790
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,639
last year's emerald cup you know it was

2791
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:15,679
a little different wasn't it

2792
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,719
oh

2793
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,600
man

2794
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:23,039
so last year in world cup was uh there's

2795
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,719
a few situations that we uh

2796
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,238
had to overcome that made the show a

2797
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,439
little more difficult than average than

2798
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,959
usual

2799
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:32,479
we played by the book um i i thought

2800
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,000
this is a little early for california

2801
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,678
have seen the sale but we played by the

2802
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,719
book anyways

2803
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,319
um

2804
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,319
and uh

2805
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:43,319
paid out an enormous amount of taxes

2806
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,319
28.13

2807
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,400
which uh made me

2808
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:50,719
take a huge loss on [ __ ] because i only

2809
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:53,839
we didn't do the math right and so

2810
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,639
yeah we paid a total dollars 28.13 taxes

2811
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,520
to

2812
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:59,039
uh all of the this the city's taxes in

2813
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,639
the state taxes

2814
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,800
so that was a chunk

2815
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,719
of money um

2816
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,920
they just it didn't it didn't go as

2817
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:07,840
smoothly last year as we would have

2818
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,359
liked at all we appreciate

2819
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,800
all the customers that did wait in line

2820
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:12,399
but you know after i heard what had

2821
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,000
happened on saturday i was little it was

2822
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:15,759
a little rough and we weren't

2823
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,198
we weren't able to basically that he was

2824
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,560
almost so mobbed with people and i'd

2825
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,079
even come to him

2826
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,760
the night before the day you know two

2827
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:23,519
days before i said okay so what kind of

2828
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,840
um you know i'm thinking like you know

2829
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,000
aircraft aircraft lines like the zigzag

2830
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,319
zs kind of stack people in like what do

2831
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,439
you have planned for crowd control and

2832
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:33,359
you know

2833
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:34,719
she had i had found out earlier that

2834
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:36,960
week that we were right next to [ __ ]

2835
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:38,719
calculator and mike in exotic

2836
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,000
and i'm like you know we're [ __ ] like

2837
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:45,679
i've got 10 banks here in my five booths

2838
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:49,359
and those guys overflow weren't [ __ ]

2839
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:52,800
um and sure enough uh we were [ __ ]

2840
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:54,319
so it was a big [ __ ] show uh the lines

2841
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,159
didn't get made properly people were

2842
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,359
getting in line just to get in line i

2843
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,039
was told

2844
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:59,839
um

2845
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:01,119
so

2846
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,880
uh

2847
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:04,158
once again i didn't see any of the music

2848
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,760
none of the bands i didn't get to talk

2849
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:06,960
to other people it was it wasn't this it

2850
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,960
wasn't as good as it was to be

2851
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,639
recreation recreational [ __ ] it up and

2852
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,239
i'll always say that i'm not i'm not a

2853
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,039
fan of recreational people say oh my god

2854
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:15,678
how can you not be a fan of

2855
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:17,840
recreationally the devil no i'm a fan of

2856
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:19,920
of decriminalization

2857
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,239
not recreation because that recreation

2858
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,600
allows [ __ ] big farmer man

2859
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:25,839
decriminalization would have kept it

2860
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,880
[ __ ] mama pop

2861
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,180
but

2862
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,199
too late now [ __ ]

2863
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:32,960
[Laughter]

2864
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:34,879
oregon's sitting on six years of [ __ ]

2865
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,560
weed right now like

2866
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,639
we haven't even [ __ ] come to crop yet

2867
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,639
and they're sitting on six years supply

2868
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,600
what do you do with a six year supply

2869
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,039
because you don't leave it on the

2870
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,000
[ __ ] shelves that's for sure you

2871
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:47,359
gotta blast that [ __ ] in oil

2872
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,520
because six years from now that weed's

2873
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:52,639
gonna be brown frowned

2874
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,560
oh man it'll make some uh very top shelf

2875
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,840
cuts i'm sure

2876
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,520
yeah

2877
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,840
exactly and then that's right you know

2878
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,920
and and to that you know kooky oregon

2879
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,000
but they also passed legislation to try

2880
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,079
to export weed

2881
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,639
and what did it pass

2882
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,000
no they've written they're trying okay

2883
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,359
so it says they can export to different

2884
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,238
states

2885
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:14,238
well

2886
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:16,718
that's what the brokers are

2887
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,599
they're probably bad for them so yeah do

2888
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,279
that

2889
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,600
yeah because because oregon is you know

2890
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,479
they have the demand of of 300 000 in

2891
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,639
the supply for 3 million like la has the

2892
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,238
supply for 300 000 the demand of 3

2893
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,560
million

2894
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:33,198
and so logistics are reversed

2895
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,880
jesus yeah it sounds like if you knew

2896
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:37,839
what you were doing and you set up an op

2897
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:40,239
in la like it you know like why would it

2898
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,239
not work

2899
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:43,919
pretty much what i've come to see here

2900
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,560
what i've come to hear is that uh it

2901
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,760
seems to you know

2902
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,360
it's just anywhere you can buy wheat

2903
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,719
easiest is pretty much where it's where

2904
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,799
it's been i don't know like the

2905
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:55,039
california market came and went very

2906
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,679
[ __ ] quick like it just

2907
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:59,600
you knew it would i think um i think

2908
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,600
it'd go this quick but it it came and

2909
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,400
went and i i avoided it like the [ __ ]

2910
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,360
plague so

2911
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:07,679
cool

2912
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:09,679
it's it's a it's a mess like a lot of

2913
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,359
you know it saddens me because a lot a

2914
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,279
lot of good people are gonna lose good

2915
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:15,679
money because they're going to get

2916
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:17,198
[ __ ] swallowed or because the price

2917
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,760
is going to get too too low or they

2918
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,638
can't afford like it just doesn't make

2919
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,679
money

2920
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,840
to

2921
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:26,319
continue to produce at like

2922
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,560
600 a pound you know [ __ ] they can't

2923
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:30,238
do that you know about 50 grams and i

2924
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,679
could be able to take that [ __ ] off the

2925
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:32,718
ground

2926
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,960
so

2927
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,480
uh so a lot a lot a lot of good people

2928
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,079
are gonna lose money on farms because i

2929
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,559
think that you know because the guys are

2930
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:42,238
doing it big are doing 100 million style

2931
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,840
you know you're talking 10 greenhouses

2932
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:45,759
all [ __ ] online with custom controls

2933
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,800
and virtual integration and they're just

2934
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,800
going to be able to slaughter through

2935
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,760
weed to where mom and pop who thought

2936
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,279
they had the money to do it they're

2937
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,280
going to try their [ __ ] dampest but

2938
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:55,279
the price gets too low to produce it

2939
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:56,639
you're not

2940
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:58,238
yeah

2941
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,000
that's a bummer

2942
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:02,638
definitely definitely

2943
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,880
i'm a [ __ ] bummer today damn it no no

2944
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,400
no it's all interesting and i mean it

2945
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,600
kind of plays into the next question in

2946
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:09,359
the way that like you know the mum and

2947
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,520
pops are being forced out in a sense but

2948
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:13,359
like recently we saw and you almost

2949
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,040
referenced it earlier like seth rogen

2950
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,599
has brought out that whole houseplant

2951
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:19,439
line and it kind of seems inevitable

2952
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,440
that more and more celebrities will

2953
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:23,119
embrace cannabis and try to carve their

2954
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:24,479
own little spot in the industry do you

2955
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:26,960
think there'll come a time when they

2956
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,399
kind of get it right or do you feel like

2957
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,000
kind of like a lot of parts of the

2958
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:32,079
cannabis community you've got to kind of

2959
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,079
have paid your dues before you can do

2960
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:35,600
that type of thing

2961
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:37,039
well i'd never think they'll get it

2962
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,199
right unless they're doing it for the

2963
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:40,880
right reasons at least i've never i

2964
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:42,079
never hope people get it right unless

2965
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,079
you're doing it for the right reasons

2966
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:46,079
but i don't think that

2967
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:48,000
you know joe blow off the street who's

2968
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:50,960
been not to say joe blow because his

2969
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,119
name is joe rogan um not to say that

2970
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,920
that the guy doesn't know is cannabis

2971
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:57,679
but um he may not be as as schooled in

2972
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,960
the knowledge of [ __ ] cannabis as

2973
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,639
somebody else's who's been in the

2974
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,158
industry a little bit longer you know as

2975
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:04,560
i'm sure that person's not as [ __ ]

2976
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:05,439
schooled as schooled in in

2977
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,360
uh

2978
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:09,519
fight technique or as and and talking

2979
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,639
about stuff or and interviewing people

2980
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,639
um

2981
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,880
and so once again stay in your own

2982
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,639
[ __ ] lane

2983
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,480
i think if you want to get behind a

2984
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,400
product and brand it

2985
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:21,919
or you know uh do something for that

2986
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:23,679
then you know you got to pay the person

2987
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,279
to play the game but

2988
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,800
if it's if you're just going to get into

2989
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:30,559
something just make money off of it then

2990
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,560
you kind of i don't know i don't

2991
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,560
you want to yes things have to be made

2992
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:35,840
for a profit but

2993
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,039
people did this [ __ ] when it wasn't

2994
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,719
profitable and that's what we have to

2995
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:39,840
remember

2996
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:42,158
is that there will come a time when the

2997
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,760
shit's so low we kind of forget

2998
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,679
what people went through to [ __ ] get

2999
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,440
us where we are today

3000
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,960
and that goes to kind of i don't know

3001
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,000
talking about people you don't want to

3002
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,279
make sure customers buy that you know so

3003
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,039
with the new website launch we're going

3004
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:56,719
to put up a lot of photos which include

3005
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:58,719
me and all the breeders something that

3006
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,719
stands out between me and just about

3007
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,399
every other bank is that i personally

3008
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,840
know every single breeder on my bank

3009
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:05,679
i've talked with them i have their cell

3010
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,679
phone numbers i can call them on sunday

3011
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,679
they'd [ __ ] answer the phone um they

3012
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:11,279
called me on sunday i'd answer the phone

3013
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,560
um i have a good relationship with all

3014
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:13,679
my guys that's [ __ ] hard to do when

3015
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,400
you look at you say all of them i see

3016
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:16,239
yeah

3017
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,679
all of them i've met

3018
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:19,359
all my guys

3019
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,679
uh i have to and i have to look and

3020
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:23,198
reset that statement since i've added um

3021
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,118
where if i haven't met him yet and i

3022
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:26,638
haven't met pioneer valley

3023
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:29,359
but other than that i've met just all my

3024
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:31,440
guys which um

3025
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:33,679
gets me the back to the none of my 40

3026
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,198
guys use the same mail and so it's

3027
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,600
important to support

3028
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:39,118
and and fund the guys who did it when

3029
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,039
they shouldn't have been doing it if you

3030
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:42,880
know what i mean like who took the risks

3031
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:44,800
and who risked [ __ ] jail time and

3032
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,719
their families and their you know their

3033
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,320
freedom basically to you know yes to

3034
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:50,158
profit but as well to [ __ ] you know

3035
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:52,479
to push the plan and to breed and

3036
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:53,920
continue doing it

3037
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,158
yeah of course you know you need to

3038
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,760
reward the people who took the risk in

3039
01:35:56,158 --> 01:35:59,359
the old days

3040
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,880
but a lot of it's easy though right now

3041
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,479
like you can just go and buy anybody's

3042
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,560
crosstalk thing and i think you know

3043
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:06,079
especially you know hopefully all the

3044
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,080
breeders will pick up licensing deals

3045
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:11,118
and they'll be with branded cannabis but

3046
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,319
you know i with all the states coming

3047
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:13,599
off weird if you don't you're going to

3048
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:14,960
go to you know missouri and you're going

3049
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,079
to get cookies and cream off the shelf

3050
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,079
and it's not going to be the same that

3051
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:19,039
it tasted like in [ __ ] washington or

3052
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:21,279
it's not going to be the same as it

3053
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,399
tasted like in california and that's

3054
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,039
unfortunate but they're going to be able

3055
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,559
to to say it's curious and cream because

3056
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:27,679
they got a tent back and they popped it

3057
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,760
but it's not really the true

3058
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:31,840
representation of what you know exotic

3059
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,679
may want them to [ __ ] you know

3060
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,679
use as cookies and creamer or say that

3061
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:37,840
is this is cookies and cream because by

3062
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:39,840
giving something bad a good name doesn't

3063
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,440
change the fact that it's bad you know

3064
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,520
this just means more people are going to

3065
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:44,319
say yeah i had that it was bad

3066
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,840
so

3067
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:47,840
uh

3068
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,319
uh that's that's that's rough that's the

3069
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,840
features talk kind of stuff but um you

3070
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:53,359
know i see that being a thing like when

3071
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,480
you want to go to a different state you

3072
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,079
want to have the same thing that you

3073
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,000
smoke or that you're you're used to

3074
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:59,760
you're not you're not smoking is

3075
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,118
something that this goes back to crap

3076
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,119
kings which i'll just beat on him some

3077
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:05,198
more like we did last year or last time

3078
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,359
but uh when you buy [ __ ] blueberry

3079
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:09,519
you want to be dj shorts blueberry like

3080
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:11,599
i i just i'm gonna i'm not a mind reader

3081
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,040
but once people ask me for blueberry i'm

3082
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,480
nine tenths out of the

3083
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:16,880
time pretty sure that they don't want

3084
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:18,638
[ __ ] crap kings blueberry they want

3085
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,719
the blueberry that came from dj short

3086
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:21,920
that tastes like blueberries

3087
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,359
not just the one that comes in a

3088
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,399
different package that says blueberry on

3089
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:25,759
it

3090
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:27,039
yeah so

3091
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,280
so it's it's

3092
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:31,519
kind of marketing you know like

3093
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:33,118
all of our stuff generally

3094
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,960
what says on the package is what it is

3095
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:38,079
like that's you know you can't can't

3096
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:39,679
thank the funk as was told to me once

3097
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:41,039
so i think it's important that people

3098
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,639
when they buy their and they buy product

3099
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:45,679
or buy flower that they support you know

3100
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,679
breeders and brands and licensing deals

3101
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,279
yep 100

3102
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:52,079
something i wanted to

3103
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,880
run by you though we've seen it happen

3104
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:58,079
you know sporadically but do you think

3105
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,600
that we will see pollen being sold going

3106
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:01,118
forward and

3107
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:04,719
how do you think that'll change the

3108
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:04,719
landscape of things if it happens

3109
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:10,800
um i so like uh i still do a guy now

3110
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,800
james kerr who's in canada and he does

3111
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,360
pollen already

3112
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,880
he sends out pollen crosses stuff

3113
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:19,439
and

3114
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,800
you know i for the

3115
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:22,158
your your interview with breeder steve

3116
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,320
was really good i like i like breeder

3117
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:25,839
steve that i love his his premise we're

3118
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:27,519
just says you know just [ __ ] plant a

3119
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,560
seed just as long as it's a c just

3120
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,080
[ __ ] plant it i don't care where you

3121
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,920
got it just plant it in the ground get

3122
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:33,118
it wet [ __ ] make it explode like get

3123
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,440
a seed

3124
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:37,759
and so i think that that is is really

3125
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:39,839
good and so um so for the home breeder

3126
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,520
who wants to do stuff great you know buy

3127
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,319
some pollen and [ __ ] breed with it

3128
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,760
but um you know you get your own male

3129
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:48,559
make your own [ __ ] pollen i mean it's

3130
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:51,440
not that big of a deal as far as

3131
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:53,199
people selling their pollen like

3132
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:54,559
i know that

3133
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:56,319
when collabs certain columns have

3134
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,960
happened that there's the amount of

3135
01:38:56,319 --> 01:39:00,799
pollen that has been given is is very is

3136
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,399
weighed you know it's very

3137
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,239
scrutinized because with pollen you can

3138
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:05,759
do anything with it

3139
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:06,799
so when people are giving it up their

3140
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,760
pollen

3141
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,760
to make a collab

3142
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,440
let's you know like there's not a lot

3143
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,719
going there and because the breeder

3144
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:16,158
doesn't because once again the only

3145
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:18,000
thing that separates all 40 guys is

3146
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:19,759
they're males so if you have my pollen

3147
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,880
then you can you can do what i did

3148
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,360
you don't need my [ __ ] anymore if you

3149
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,359
got my mail

3150
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,079
so

3151
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,440
so i don't know i don't think i don't

3152
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:29,840
see the breeders giving out pauline to

3153
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:32,079
their [ __ ]

3154
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,600
i know dj shorts talked about it

3155
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,960
i know dunn's talked about put him in

3156
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,079
different packages

3157
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,198
but

3158
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:39,039
as as

3159
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:41,039
as highly guarded as the males are that

3160
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:42,560
i mean as as that's the only thing that

3161
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:44,560
makes people unique because we all start

3162
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,080
with the same gorilla glue four cut the

3163
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,159
cut you have is most likely the cut i

3164
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:49,359
have if they're legit cuts because it's

3165
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:50,399
all just a branch of a branch of a

3166
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:51,839
branch

3167
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:53,439
they always have a [ __ ] unique seed

3168
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,400
or different pheno it's the same [ __ ]

3169
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:56,799
thing

3170
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,799
just cloned

3171
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,639
and and so what makes it different is

3172
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,480
the male that we use with it and even

3173
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:04,880
though i may have the same male that's

3174
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:07,279
the same strain it's genetically not the

3175
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:09,440
same male

3176
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:12,079
like if my wife and me had a kid and i

3177
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:14,319
died i got hit by a bus my wife and my

3178
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:16,079
brother couldn't make another kid that

3179
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:17,359
was as good looking as my current kids

3180
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:19,118
you know what i mean

3181
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:21,279
like it's just it's just genetically not

3182
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:23,118
possible it's you'll get close to kind

3183
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:24,719
of like most likely of

3184
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:26,399
but it's not genetically possible to

3185
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:27,279
duplicate without this the same male and

3186
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:28,638
so

3187
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:29,679
well that was what makes people

3188
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,039
different

3189
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,520
um i

3190
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:35,198
don't see it happening on at least by

3191
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,639
you know

3192
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:38,000
breeders

3193
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,199
i'm not i'm not telling you the thing

3194
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,198
that i'm doing because then you can

3195
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:42,319
[ __ ] do it yourself you don't need me

3196
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:43,439
i think you just take it across with

3197
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:44,960
everything

3198
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:46,319
no

3199
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,039
yeah

3200
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:51,359
well just to jump back to a point you

3201
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:53,519
spoke about earlier in regards to the

3202
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:56,399
forums you've got going we've seen a few

3203
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,639
forums pop up recently calculator having

3204
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:01,039
copied my [ __ ] yeah i have the idea they

3205
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:02,880
[ __ ] copy it within a day that's it

3206
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,960
so like why do you think we're seeing

3207
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,800
these forums pop up what do you think it

3208
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,359
is about the forum that people are

3209
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,760
missing and why don't you see it taking

3210
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,920
off more quickly

3211
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,000
i think the forums will probably back up

3212
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:17,359
because mark zuckerberg [ __ ] hates

3213
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,760
cannabis

3214
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:21,759
and uh we're going through the genocide

3215
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,199
right now of cannabis and so if

3216
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,159
instagram and

3217
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:28,399
facebook can delete all these videos and

3218
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:31,279
take down all these pictures and

3219
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:33,118
accounts then we'll basically delete the

3220
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:34,559
history of

3221
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:36,559
the people who did it to get where we

3222
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,639
are today and in 10 years from now

3223
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:39,679
you're going to google a chrome video or

3224
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,279
you won't be able to find out any of

3225
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:43,279
this information because youtube [ __ ]

3226
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,519
took down the channel or blocked the

3227
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:47,359
account or erased all the [ __ ] because

3228
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,560
mine most of us don't print out our

3229
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:49,920
pictures on instagram we don't have

3230
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,119
[ __ ] copies

3231
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,560
and so when instagram deletes the

3232
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:54,880
account that's that's everybody's

3233
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:57,600
history and on it goes

3234
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:00,319
but uh and so i think that they're just

3235
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,320
because we've been shut down 17 times

3236
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,679
jesus all right our instagram sucks

3237
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:06,319
right now i mean

3238
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:08,239
shout out twice it's my instagram guy

3239
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:10,158
love everybody but uh it sucks because

3240
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:12,479
we have [ __ ] handcuffs on us like we

3241
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:13,679
can't do nothing we get told if

3242
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:15,439
there's a price anywhere in the picture

3243
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:17,359
we get [ __ ] we'll get flagged if we

3244
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:18,960
do any type of video we get flagged like

3245
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:20,319
i put up videos now and they're [ __ ]

3246
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,600
seriously flagged within like five

3247
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:23,599
seconds

3248
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,760
it's up and it's it's automatically boom

3249
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,400
through the community standards

3250
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,639
like how did you even already so my

3251
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:32,559
accountants must be being watched

3252
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:34,159
but yeah our current instagram account

3253
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,360
has like six items on it because we

3254
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:36,719
don't keep anything on it that way they

3255
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:38,238
can't go back for history and shut us

3256
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:40,000
down

3257
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:41,439
and so you know there's no way to like

3258
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,279
document your online presence if you're

3259
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:45,359
not using like an instagram account to

3260
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:47,439
[ __ ] save your history

3261
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:48,559
and so i think that on the forums that

3262
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:51,118
people like

3263
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,440
myself from cap have that you know

3264
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:55,920
i own the hard the servers that they're

3265
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:57,678
on i have the servers backed up and so

3266
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,560
where i always have that history i'm not

3267
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:01,359
going to delete accounts

3268
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,760
yeah

3269
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:05,519
okay so it's it's like a

3270
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:07,199
like a preservation thing so you don't

3271
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,400
just lose everything

3272
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,559
kind of i think that's what people are

3273
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:11,839
looking at you know um kind of get back

3274
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,000
to the forums and the days where they

3275
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:16,639
can they could grow you know and also

3276
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,238
maybe the novelty of you know yeah yeah

3277
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,239
i can it's california i can grow weed

3278
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:21,279
now but i don't know how to [ __ ] grow

3279
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:22,319
weed

3280
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:24,880
you know

3281
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:26,880
like how do i grow lead and so

3282
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,400
um i think people are also looking to

3283
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,679
reach out and find that and not get the

3284
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:31,839
trolls that are on instagram or the

3285
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:34,079
drama that's on instagram but still seek

3286
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,199
the knowledge of how do i grow this out

3287
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:37,359
and and

3288
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:39,039
from a grower's perspective and from

3289
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:40,880
british perspective how do i put my

3290
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,319
information out there and make sure that

3291
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,920
it's not going to get taken down or make

3292
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:45,279
sure that it's not you know all these

3293
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,158
conversations and all these grow tips

3294
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:47,279
i've been giving people aren't just

3295
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:50,960
going to be [ __ ] deleted one day

3296
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:52,399
because somebody was pissed off at me

3297
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,920
yeah well i mean

3298
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,759
i think we're going to see more of the

3299
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,760
forum rise anyway because it's you can't

3300
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,280
track a story on instagram over a long

3301
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,880
period of time

3302
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:03,039
like that's that's what a thread does

3303
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,480
perfectly on a forum yeah i think we

3304
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:06,479
just have to get them so you know it's

3305
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:07,839
gonna have a good web app and i think

3306
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:08,879
forums could definitely work but people

3307
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,920
have to be able to scroll from their

3308
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,600
phone

3309
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,359
yeah it has to be more accessible

3310
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,639
because forums were so cumbersome on a

3311
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:15,439
phone

3312
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,159
yeah

3313
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,359
yeah interesting okay well

3314
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:22,719
have you

3315
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:25,118

3316
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,198
truly kind of unique and just truly

3317
01:44:25,118 --> 01:44:28,639
coming out of left to field you know

3318
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:31,919

01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:33,199

01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:53,039
so you're so popular like if i don't if

3358
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,400
i miss you on the show a lot of my guys

3359
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:55,840
you give me a [ __ ] last year they were

3360
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:58,479
like oh you didn't say anything about me

3361
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,960
i was like i was thinking about you

3362
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,959
so yeah so now i set them all so look

3363
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,800
this is the equivalent of like mom

3364
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,399
saying i love all my children equally

3365
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,760
follow my children equally because i do

3366
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:09,679
that's the thing about us when you go to

3367
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,280
another breeder at his booth he's gonna

3368
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,960
want to sell you his stuff if he's any

3369
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:14,079
good you know he can't blame that's what

3370
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,520
he's there to do you gotta pay for his

3371
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,600
[ __ ] booth he's gonna sell you his

3372
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,880
seats if you come to me at a booth and i

3373
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,000
don't have all my guns because i don't

3374
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,159
sell like

3375
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,719
so one of my things is if i i won't sell

3376
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:26,079
c to the same show that my breeders do

3377
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,840
and so if my brother's taking money out

3378
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:30,000
of his pocket he's there at a booth i'll

3379
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,119
pull his genetics off my table and refer

3380
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,479
people to him

3381
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:34,079
and so like at the emerald cup if you

3382
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:36,399
come up to me and say you want the best

3383
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:37,679
land race [ __ ] sativa that i have

3384
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:39,359
well i know that i'd love to say

3385
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,118
something that i have on the table but

3386
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:43,599
actually if i if i point out to you to

3387
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:45,920
go to walk down the snow high's [ __ ]

3388
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,039

3389
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,639

3392
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,560
weeks to waste then you know there you

3393
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,159
go uh

3394
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,840
and and so i'm not biased on any

3395
01:46:56,158 --> 01:46:59,920
particular one like clear

3396
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,520
see situ now is here to make sure you

3397
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,118
find the strain that works for you like

3398
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:05,199
i'm not here to push one brand or the

3399
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:06,319
other um if you want that's that's nice

3400
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:08,399
thing about it if you want something

3401
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:10,479
gassy i got [ __ ] 40 brands to pick

3402
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:13,439
from let's find the gassy thing i'm not

3403
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:15,839
just we're not just focused on one

3404
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:17,279
one specific goal or one one type of

3405
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,159
thought thinking you know

3406
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:19,439
like

3407
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:20,799
the nice thing about all these all these

3408
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:22,158
breeders is y'all they'll breed for

3409
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,679
different reasons they're all breeders

3410
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:25,359
because they're [ __ ] crazy but they

3411
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,880
all look for different things when they

3412
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:29,039
breed you know maybe it's maybe it's

3413
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,118
short as a flower or maybe it's you know

3414
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,439
trypton production or maybe it's [ __ ]

3415
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:34,960
squash sauce you know who the [ __ ] knows

3416
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:36,399
but they'll breed for different reasons

3417
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,279
that's what makes it all unique

3418
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:38,799
um

3419
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:40,719
and and and

3420
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:42,079
especially in their own unique way

3421
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,399
so

3422
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:45,760
that's that's really cool uh

3423
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:47,439
got a [ __ ] stone together i forgot

3424
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,199
what we were talking about but yeah

3425
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,439
uh all the all the different brands are

3426
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:52,799
cool and it's and i think it's fun to

3427
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:54,238
you know i used to get orders and i'd

3428
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,760
see like a pack of exotic and then a

3429
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:57,678
pack of snow hi

3430
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,039
i'm like man that's

3431
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,960
that's different like the guy who's

3432
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,359
buying an exotic which is

3433
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,760
pretty much you know

3434
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:09,279
dense snugs frosty [ __ ] you know

3435
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,800
sunshine uh order and and grabs a pack

3436
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:13,118
of snow high which will be like a land

3437
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:14,639
race alchemical gold

3438
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:15,679
i'm like man that's that's different

3439
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,400
like

3440
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,000
that's you know very opposites opposite

3441
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:21,679
into the spectrum but at the same time

3442
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,399
there was that alcohol gold is fun to

3443
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,399
run

3444
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:26,399
like some bodies gear some of that stuff

3445
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:29,439
it may not be good on a

3446
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:31,439
giant scale or on a on a big scale but

3447
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:33,198
if you like growing plants and are

3448
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:34,719
excited just to see different things and

3449
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:36,000
what mother nature can do and just love

3450
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:37,439
the [ __ ] plant

3451
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,319
different breeders

3452
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:42,638
have different plants and so you know if

3453
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:43,599
you use land races those grow distinctly

3454
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:45,199
different than something that's been

3455
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,119
seriously worked and by growing them out

3456
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:49,198
you'd be like oh yeah i can see where

3457
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:50,319
that would need to be worked like that's

3458
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:51,919
why you cross it with that because it's

3459
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:53,920
a [ __ ] that's i don't like it by itself

3460
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:55,600
you know you'd want to cross it to make

3461
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,800
this or i see why that person bred with

3462
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,679
it because he wanted to make it you know

3463
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,679
this

3464
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,359
and so i think it's fun to grow if you

3465
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:03,199
like genetics you just like growing grow

3466
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,599
different people's seeds like don't get

3467
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:08,158
just stuck on one breeder

3468
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,199
yeah i 100 agree that's a great great

3469
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,000
message

3470
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:13,359
i think that we are basically onto the

3471
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,039
tail end of things now so we're going to

3472
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,839
start to do some of our more quick fire

3473
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:18,800
answers before we get to the last final

3474
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,760
but

3475
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:23,360
how can a new breeder go about trying to

3476
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,880
get your attention what are some of the

3477
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:28,000
things they should be doing to be

3478
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,840
ticking the boxes

3479
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,760
um they should be

3480
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,360
uh and and

3481
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:35,840
for first of all foremost once again i'm

3482
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:37,519
a nobody i just run a bank and i had an

3483
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,960
idea like in 2010 where i could help my

3484
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,119
friend and have taken

3485
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:42,719
certain steps and certain risks and

3486
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:44,719
rewards and they've done certain things

3487
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,239
to to

3488
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:47,920
be a broker for certain cannabis

3489
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:50,638
breeders and so i do nothing more than

3490
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,679
i'm just a broker but uh so

3491
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,039
um

3492
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,840
i do try to keep things in line though

3493
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:56,960
so

3494
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:58,480
to add the to our phone to our our seed

3495
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,239
bank of course first and foremost

3496
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:02,238
generally we need it's nice if you have

3497
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:04,079
good customer service if you're a dick

3498
01:50:02,238 --> 01:50:05,279
then people won't like you that's that's

3499
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:07,359
that's you know we don't want to bring

3500
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:08,639
on those customers that said

3501
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:09,920
some guys you may have had on the show

3502
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,920
are a dick and they're not the best

3503
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:13,840
customer service guys but we still

3504
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,118
support them so but you want to

3505
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,960
generally you want your customer base to

3506
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:18,719
like you because that's who that's you

3507
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,880
at the end of the day buys your packs

3508
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:23,198
these guys that you work with

3509
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,039
you want to be using your own mail

3510
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:27,039
like even if so-and-so gave you

3511
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:28,319
permission to use his [ __ ]

3512
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:29,840
well now you're just giving credit to

3513
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:31,759
two different guys and if they wanted to

3514
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,440
make that cross in my eyes they could

3515
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,280
have made that cross

3516
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,879
but they didn't want to

3517
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:40,639
and if they do then let them make money

3518
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:42,719
off of it so find your own mail as as as

3519
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,639
minimal or as weird as it may seem

3520
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,920
that's at least showed the industry the

3521
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,760
people that are buying that you have

3522
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,118
something that's unique to you and that

3523
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,960
you've done something on the on the

3524
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:52,559
breeding side of it you've looked into

3525
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,439
it some somewhat

3526
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,400
um

3527
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:58,158
so that's that's first and foremost uh

3528
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:00,079
and you know i don't think it's good to

3529
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:01,839
copy other people's [ __ ] i don't think

3530
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:03,359
it's cool to you know

3531
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,560
copy this with that and just call it

3532
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:06,799
this you know i think you should have

3533
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,920
the genetic thing and have a

3534
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:11,360
as as as well as much as you know

3535
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,960
at the time

3536
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:15,198
that this was real that you agreed with

3537
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,000
it and make it make it so but i think to

3538
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:18,879
mislead people is wrong

3539
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,560
yeah

3540
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,480
definitely

3541
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,400
so so pretty much that you just gotta be

3542
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:25,439
uh you know most likely i don't know if

3543
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:27,839
you're trying to get my attention it's

3544
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:27,839
too late

3545
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:33,439
no um but i i i i'm not really i mean

3546
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:35,279
but that being said when i when i went

3547
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:37,039
looking for new banks i got you know

3548
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:38,238
five that were suggested to us that were

3549
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:40,079
you know really good guys that i'd just

3550
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:42,399
been sleeping on so i don't i don't know

3551
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,158
everybody and it's not it's not the

3552
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:45,439
it's not the golden ticket to be on the

3553
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:46,638
bank you know i mean you still all my

3554
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:48,479
guys in the bank still promote their

3555
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:50,400
gear you still have to have to promote

3556
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:51,759
your seat your stuff and build your

3557
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,118
clientele base and interact with your

3558
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:55,280
clients i mean that's

3559
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:56,880
that's a big thing i think if you know

3560
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:58,319
people buy gear they want to interact

3561
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,480
with the breeder they want to talk to

3562
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:03,198
the guy who did the thing or get his

3563
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:05,359
his insight onto it um and i think if

3564
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:07,759
breeders would interact with their

3565
01:52:05,359 --> 01:52:09,118
clientele base more they'd uh maybe have

3566
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,320
more sales and be

3567
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:11,519
you know more successful in certain

3568
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:14,238
areas

3569
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,000
yeah definitely definitely a bit of good

3570
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:18,319
uh

3571
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,238
pr doesn't doesn't hurt at all so i

3572
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:21,599
think now we're on to our super quick

3573
01:52:20,238 --> 01:52:23,198
last one so

3574
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,039
let's bang out these ones yeah what's

3575
01:52:23,198 --> 01:52:27,439
the most memorable strain you've ever

3576
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:27,439
smoked

3577
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,360
so you say that one again sherballs

3578
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:35,439

3579
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:37,439
sherbet and fruity pebbles

01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:38,879

3581
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:40,399
yeah yeah

3582
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,760
yep there's a green pheno there's a

3583
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,000
purple pheno

3584
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,599
and it's still alive and yeah it was

3585
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,439
[ __ ] amazing it really was because

3586
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:49,039

3587
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:50,079

3588
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:51,118

3589
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:51,920
mean he was just the guy at the gas

3590
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:53,839
store

3591
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,000
but he would he he'd always hit me up

3592
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,199
for herb um so i just like popped the

3593

3598
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,760
something when you tell when they tell

3599
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:11,359
you what it's what it's called before

3600
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,800
you even have to tell them

3601
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:15,198
like fruity pebbles are like yep that's

3602
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,520
[ __ ] it so

3603
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:20,079
lovely so on the opposite end of the

3604
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,639
spectrum what is the worst strain you've

3605
01:53:20,079 --> 01:53:22,639
ever smoked

3606
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:26,399
since we're on a [ __ ] hate project

3607
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,599
candy rain

3608
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:29,598
oh

3609
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,960
you smoked it we got some in

3610
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,639
massachusetts some people brought some

3611
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,960
to mike's booth

3612
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,480
and it was it was like i took photos of

3613
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,439
it next to everything else it was just

3614
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:39,439
sad

3615
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:40,879
and it was i don't think it was you know

3616
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:42,879
it wasn't the grower because grower had

3617
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,719
brought other things in with him as well

3618
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,760
but it was just

3619
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:48,319
sad

3620
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:49,760
yeah obama all right sorry

3621
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:51,118
i was like dude i'm even impressed you

3622
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:53,520
got one to go like i heard there's two

3623
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:56,639
out of 35 so

3624
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,880
yeah the numbers don't lie so if you're

3625
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:01,520
on a desert island and you can only take

3626
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,520
three strains with you what three

3627
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,360
uh

3628
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:06,639
three strains

3629
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:07,759
we've played this game before i think i

3630
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,840
have to be all witty and i should have

3631
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,679
said like you know i'm a breeder so i'm

3632
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,440
supposed to be like uh i'm not i'm a

3633
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:16,239
broker guys so it's supposed to be like

3634
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:17,678
land race and [ __ ] like northern lights

3635
01:54:16,238 --> 01:54:19,519
and haze

3636
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:20,960
and because i can make everything else

3637
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,199
from it but i can't because i'm not a

3638
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:24,239
breeder so like i'd say that i'd say the

3639
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:25,839
witty thing the way i could make

3640
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:27,359
everything else from it but i don't know

3641
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:30,560
the witty thing uh i'd probably take

3642
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:31,519
shirls with me i'd probably say uh

3643
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,360
uh

3644
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:36,960
morning

3645
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:39,759
steve sativa star

3646
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,599
the uh star plant um

3647
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,800
i probably do

3648
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:46,319
i don't know

3649
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,320
uh i know for a third one

3650
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:52,799
thin mint

3651
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:54,719
no no never never never never

3652
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:57,760
never probably probably can be just

3653
01:54:54,719 --> 01:55:00,000
because uh it's it's very potent

3654
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,960
she does hit the spot

3655
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,960
knocks me the [ __ ] out yeah all right

3656
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,960
all alrighty now i know that you used to

3657
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,599
be a grower as you revealed in our last

3658
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:12,800
discussion so i want to know what is the

3659
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:14,239
one clone that you used to grow out and

3660
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,679
you just miss not having that weed

3661
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:17,439
around anymore

3662
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:18,960
so miss um

3663
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:20,319
i'm just not having my my weed around

3664
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,760
anymore period

3665
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:24,158
like while you when you're growing you

3666
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:25,599
[ __ ] like when trim trim gel happens

3667
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:27,519
and you guys do trimming and you hate

3668
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,119
life you're like god why

3669
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:30,320
but and you say like i'll never miss

3670
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:32,719
this but like

3671
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:34,079
there's times i miss trim jail and i

3672
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:37,118
miss just going out in the plants just

3673
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:38,960
sitting out there with the fans on and

3674
01:55:37,118 --> 01:55:40,399
with the tables going and just sitting

3675
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,920
out there and just thinking like i

3676
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:43,519
missed i really really do miss that

3677
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,960
people people probably take that for

3678
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,719
granted like oh yeah i'll [ __ ] want

3679
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,079
my plants but i think there's really

3680
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:49,520
something between

3681
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:50,880
you know plants and humans i think every

3682
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,800
kid like in school i think they should

3683
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,800
[ __ ] grow plants just to get that

3684
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,400
responsibility and that knowledge that

3685
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,440
if you don't come home and it's not if

3686
01:55:56,399 --> 01:55:58,719
you don't water this thing it's gonna

3687
01:55:57,439 --> 01:56:00,799
[ __ ] die

3688
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,399
and so um i think there's that that kind

3689
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,320
of synopsis is really cool between

3690
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:07,279
plants and humans but so i missed that

3691
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:09,198
uh clone would be

3692
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:12,719
probably the romulan i had a raw million

3693
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:14,399
way back when um when i was djing i had

3694
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:16,880
it and deep water culture and then i

3695
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:18,319
flew out to do a gig over new year's

3696
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,000
and i had to put chains on to get out of

3697
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:22,319
tahoe when i came back the tree had

3698
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,840
fallen over my front yard and shut the

3699
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:26,079
power off of course if you're in deep

3700
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,440
water culture even [ __ ] tahoe and the

3701
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:28,399
tree fell over because it was covered in

3702
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:31,759
snow

3703
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:31,759
while all your [ __ ] water froze

3704
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:38,239
so all those plants died cold cold death

3705
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,800
um i was able to salvage nothing pumps

3706
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:42,079
turned off plants died it was ugly

3707
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,840
that's when i decided okay you're gonna

3708
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:45,599
be a dj are you gonna be a [ __ ] weed

3709
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,960
grower or what are you doing

3710
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:51,279
and i was gonna go to seattle and open

3711
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:52,639
up at uh a weed uh or a uh

3712
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:54,479
grow store

3713

3725
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,840

3726
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,960
gossip at the end but we have

3727
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,440
a strain that we're going to release

3728

3736
01:57:38,479 --> 01:57:44,000
[ __ ] it was so strong in 32 that's why

3737
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:45,598
they made it illegal in 37.

3738
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,800
and that shit's been gone like off the

3739
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:48,560
face of the map now all we have is this

3740

3742
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:54,238
before they made it illegal oh man and

3743

people give me more credit than i have

3791

and maybe i just need to give myself

3792
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:33,439
more credit but uh i just started this

3793
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:35,039
to help a buddy in 2010 and just

3794
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:37,279
proceeded to do it and i was thinking

3795
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:39,198
about it earlier this morning too

3796
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:41,679
as much as i dislike this other person i

3797
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,919
started for and and i will not

3798
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:46,079
give him any name mentioned therefore

3799
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,920
not giving him anything but

3800
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:50,960
i learned things from him that i

3801
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:53,440
continue to use this day as far as

3802
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:55,439

learn things i used to this day that um

3819
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:26,880
that helped me and my my ethics as far

3820
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:27,759
as business goes as far as

3821
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,279
you know

3822
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,920
can't use other people's stuff and you

3823
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:33,118
can't rename things there's not you know

3824
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,639
he taught me a lot of those things that

3825
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:36,799
i still use that i still you know

3826
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:40,239
consider holy if you will although he

3827
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:41,039
turned out to be unholy and a dick um

3828
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:42,319
his

3829
02:00:41,039 --> 02:00:44,639
his methods

3830
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,000
once again like all breeders his methods

3831
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:47,118
and trying to relay his message were not

3832
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,520
the greatest

3833
02:00:47,118 --> 02:00:50,880
but is he meant right

3834
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,480
and

3835
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:54,000
so you know he can take something from

3836
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:55,759
any from everybody even people you don't

3837
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,520
like and people you years down the road

3838
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,880
that you hate but you can still learn

3839
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:02,080
something from everybody

3840
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,319
most definitely i agree wholeheartedly

3841
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:06,079
