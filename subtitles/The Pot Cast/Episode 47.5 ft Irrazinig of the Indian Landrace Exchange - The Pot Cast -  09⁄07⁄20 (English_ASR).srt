00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,478
it with your boy erasing lock in for

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,360
another two hours

34
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,359
let's get into it

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,839
so yeah what a fantastic explanation of

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
all the different areas if we kind of

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,640
just keep on that same topic i noticed

38
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,000
in one of your posts you're in one of

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,478
the valleys looking at one of the

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
different farms in the kaiba pass around

41
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,118
the pakistani area and you mentioned how

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,960
some of the farmers like to import the

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,560
high altitude varieties and they'd

44
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,719
hybridize it with their stock and it

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,519
would give a kind of quicker flowering

46
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,039
more squat more resinous plant

47
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,798
this was like

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
you mentioned this as though it was done

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
very intentionally and methodically do

50
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,719
you feel like this type of breeding has

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,118
always occurred because i think people

52
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,920
often talk about land race breeding as

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,319
though

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
there wasn't a ton of

55
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,758
kind of shall we say intelligent

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
breeding done but this very much points

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,840
to the opposite

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,879
exactly that's a very good point by the

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,639
way i mean

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,719
the way you

61
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,800
[Music]

62
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,318
intend to like put it across

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,239
so i mean there are a few different

64
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,238
things happening of course here like

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,920
everywhere else so first of all we have

66
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,719
to understand you know the cultural

67
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,479
basis of that practice now this is not

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,560
something that has been happening for

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,399
the longest period of time like this has

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
not definitely not been happening for

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
thousands of years

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,479
in pakistan okay

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
now

74
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,119
some of the regions

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,518
of pakistan i i mean even before we get

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
to that i mean let me just uh build a

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
little more you know cultural context

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,759
here because see pakistan is

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,159
predominantly it's a muslim country that

80
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,759
people over there at least 95 percent of

81
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,759
the people are muslim

82
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,000
by religion and the country that is next

83
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,799
to them is afghanistan and that is also

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
uh predominantly you know muslim family

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,040
i'm sorry a muslim country i'm so sorry

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
about that it's a muslim country right

87
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,598
so now

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,759
uh you you tend to have a great deal of

89
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,238
interaction between these two countries

90
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,199
because of this common theme which is

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,959
the islamic religion right so

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,799
now what is happening is

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,680
there are certain areas of pakistan

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,840
where this happens and those areas are

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
situated around thira valley that is

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,000
like 32

97
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:30,079
31 and 33 degree north okay now those

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
regions while they are significantly

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,959
higher

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,439
are still not you know high enough on

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,598
latitude that they would induce

102
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,158
a quintessential

103
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,439
uh expression that people you know

104
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,239
usually refer to as of ghanica okay

105
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,158
so

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,000
what happened was that some of the

107
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,079
people from pakistan must have been

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
traveling to you know afghanistan and

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
they must be seeing these varieties over

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,639
there that

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
tend to have

112
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,199
you know better resin content better

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
effects and just they're just better

114
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,158
overall i mean

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
in in terms of production i mean that's

116
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,239
one of the reasons why you know

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,039
everybody wants to breed with them

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,519
so it was a very natural progression for

119
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,280
them to only get those seeds in pakistan

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,120
but here is the interesting part now

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,959
they're not intelligently thinking at

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,798
this point in history

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,319
okay we're gonna get these seeds to our

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,879
country and then we're gonna mix them

125
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,399
with our uh you know indigenous

126
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,319
varieties or you know the regional

127
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,478
varieties that we have they're not

128
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,399
thinking in those terms that is

129
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,959
something that is going to happen as a

130
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,719
result of they getting those seats into

131
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,478
their country because they think that

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
you know of course these these are so

133
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,360
much better i mean the highest if not

134
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,199
better i mean it's so much different so

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,240
i mean such is

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
you know

137
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
our

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
human species i mean you know that our

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
nature is just we're curious and we want

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
to have everything and we want to have

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,360
things which are different we want to

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,839
know why they're different

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,759
so they must have you know gotten those

144
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,758
varieties and started cultivating them

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
not not knowing that

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
uh eventually they will get

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
cross-pollinated to your regional

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,600
varieties

149
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,319
so

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,280
in the end uh you know what you re what

151
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,478
you really end up with uh in in a way

152
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,478
that

153
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,918
people are not selecting

154
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,519
after you know after they're getting

155
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,519
cross-pollinated because they're not

156
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,279
really thinking about that they're just

157
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,439
then picking up seeds and they're

158
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,679
growing them and eventually what you see

159
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,000
is you see an intermediate type of plant

160
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
emerge from this interaction

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
because of course there are going to be

162
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
still very short plants like afghani

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
varieties which would still stay intact

164
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,719
and you would always see them pop up in

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,560
larger populations you would also see on

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,639
the other hand you know

167
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
the thinly variety the regional

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,199
varieties from pakistan within the

169
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
larger populations of that mixed crop

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,280
they will pop up but what you would see

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,600
in maturities majority you would see

172
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,239
a plant you know which is a perfect

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
amalgamation of both of those words

174
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,280
and which also seem to have certain you

175
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,240
know qualities which not only make it

176
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,318
better uh in terms of effects or in

177
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
terms of production that is yield it

178
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,720
also you know

179
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,239
uh makes it better in survival and you

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
know in mitigating the environmental

181
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
risk so for example i'll i'll just go

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,360
this small example and that would really

183
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,360
uh you know

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,319
make things more comprehensive

185
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,038
in afghanistan uh if you go to uh

186
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
bulk if you go to bulk province it's

187
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,038
really dry arid

188
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,159
there is hardly any rain uh you know

189
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,918
year-round

190
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
and most people rely on the glacial

191
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,959
waters so the varieties which are

192
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,959
growing there i mean they're not

193
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,799
accustomed to you know rain falling on

194
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,560
them especially not during the flowering

195
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,759
time even if a little bit does fall in

196
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
the spring

197
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,439
so when you take those varieties to a

198
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,120
place like thira valley where you have

199
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,839
an n1 anvil rainfall of close to 900 mm

200
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,079
ah

201
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,679
right so then you're

202
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,918
what you're really doing is that you're

203
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
really pushing that variety

204
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,198
uh you know in a way

205
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,319
that the phenotypes or let's say the

206
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,840
genotypes you know which are uh

207
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,080
what you should say which is resistance

208
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,959
to mold mildew or you know mitigating

209
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,439
these

210
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,758
uh you know moisture related risk would

211
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,680
then you know excel and eventually

212
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,919
what's going to happen is that the

213
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,918
plants which are not able to mitigate

214
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,198
those moisture related risk would die

215
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,120
out because

216
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
they will not be able to you know they

217
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,399
will have bud rot and because of that

218
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,478
their seeds

219
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,560
uh will be less viable

220
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,719
or viable in less numbers of what i mean

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
to say and eventually every year their

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,599
population would decrease because of

223
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
that

224
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,759
and you know we we understand i mean how

225
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
population works and you know

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
natural settings and eventually what

227
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,119
you're going to see is that only a

228
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,720
marginal amount of you know the original

229
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
variety that was brought from

230
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
afghanistan survives intact

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
of course with a little bit of change

232
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,800
and then a little bit of you know

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,960
pakistani would remain but

234
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
what would really overtake and what

235
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,478
would really become of

236
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,400
you know the whole process or what would

237
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,598
really emerge as the one champion in

238
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,719
that you know

239
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,079
a whole

240
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
breeding thing is the intermediate plan

241
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,038
that is not only better than both

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,199
parents it also has the capabilities to

243
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,038
mitigate all the risk and still bring

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
all the properties from the afghani

245
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,279
varieties

246
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,959
which

247
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,719
which is why they actually you know in

248
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,598
the first place got those seats to

249
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,000
pakistan so most of the farmers tend to

250
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,679
work with those and

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,158
the interesting part is now there are

252
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,199
some farmers which have gone a step

253
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,599
beyond

254
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
who have understood that you know what i

255
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
could actually separate these two

256
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,639
varieties and i could not only grow them

257
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,959
separately i could have them interact or

258
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,120
cross pollinate at my will

259
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,079
so that i choose you know which plants

260
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,919
get to make the seeds and then i would

261
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
have like a test field kind of a thing

262
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,240
which which in modern world we call you

263
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
know testing for

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,600
uh the seeds that we make and they would

265
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
grow them and

266
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,720
then they would select plants you know

267
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
which seem to show the best uh you know

268
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
the best features what they're looking

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,159
for regionally whatever makes their hash

270
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,759
sell more

271
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,879
so it could be yield it could be resin

272
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,480
content so each one to their own but yes

273
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,639
there are people who are now

274
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
meticulously looking into these little

275
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,360
aspects and you know

276
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
uh it just became becoming

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,560
apparent to these people that you know

278
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,560
if they go on selecting for better plans

279
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,119
they they eventually end up at you know

280
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,838
better places yield wise production wise

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
and quality wise

282
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
yeah of course

283
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,040
do you think that the modern breeders so

284
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
to speak

285
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,439
could learn anything from the older

286
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,240
school farmers have you ever stumbled

287
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,920
upon a little patch and kind of been

288
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,919
impressed by a little trick or something

289
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,639
you've seen by the farmer and i guess as

290
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,639
a follow-up as these more traditional

291
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,399
farmers learn the more modern breeding

292
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,559
techniques do you think there's a risk

293
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,720
of us maybe losing a little something

294
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,639
about their maybe slightly more

295
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,000
primitive methods but maybe there's

296
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,078
something to it which might be lost

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,078
um i mean if if

298
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,000
i mean if some somebody's do i mean

299
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,919
answer this question in a very emotional

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
political way then of course he's going

301
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,639
to say yes there are a lot of things i

302
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,120
mean you go back to roots and blah blah

303
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,639
blah but if we just break it down in a

304
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,959
very practical manner and look at it

305
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,399
objectively then what do you understand

306
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,359
is that

307
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,278
there's not much that can be uh adopted

308
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
by the modern people because

309
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,159
see the

310
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
it's not modern people it's not like

311
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,679
modern people is a different species

312
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,560
it's just that

313
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,759
we what we are is that we have at our

314
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,439
disposal

315
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,000
the collective consciousness the

316
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,640
collective intelligence of the entire

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,839
community and that includes even those

318
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,679
people who have no idea that you know

319
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
what they have been doing has been

320
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,879
incorporated

321
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,679
into the larger understanding of how to

322
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,200
grow plants but what we have understood

323
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,639
that you know there are better ways to

324
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,680
do that

325
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,838
you know at the same time i mean

326
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,838
there are communities in india you know

327
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,000
which have been using you know

328
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,839
lactobacillus bacteria and many other

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,039
forms for

330
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,760
you know growing the plants and even for

331
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,319
they spray like 50 50 solution of water

332
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,120
and milk to for the best

333
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,839
so it's not like these things have been

334
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,240
uh invented or like uh you know brought

335
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,040
by the modern cultivators

336
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,839
these were all like simple indigenous uh

337
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,319
techniques but at the same time they had

338
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,640
refined them to a level and not only

339
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
refine them i think the what modern

340
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,480
society or rather the modern

341
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,638
community of the breeders have done or

342
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
the cultivators have done that they have

343
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,079
uh you know

344
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,000
they have scratched the surface beyond

345
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,838
indigenous communities are capable of

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,679
and that is on the scientific grounds

347
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,480
because a lot of cultivator and breeders

348
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,879
nowadays are like scientists basically

349
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,399
so they can they not only breed with

350
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,639
those varieties grow those varieties

351
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,480
they they tend to i mean you know

352
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,320
scratch the surface that

353
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
uh you know what makes a certain

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
technique work or what makes a certain

355
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,800
technique not work like there's a lot of

356
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,799
debate that goes around no-till and

357
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,479
tilling the soil i mean

358
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,399
i know there are a lot of people who get

359
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,600
really you know edgy about this kind of

360
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
discussions

361
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
and

362
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,278
it is just a amazing thing that you

363
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,120
don't see in indigenous communities you

364
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
don't see this kind of discussions

365
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
usually they know something you know

366
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
that has been told to them

367
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
by their families by their elders and

368
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,759
they just

369
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
blind you blindly kind of follow that

370
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,039
i'm not trying to say those are wrong

371
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,439
things but what i'm trying to say here

372
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,759
is that because we're not having

373
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
continued informed discussion the thing

374
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,078
is only getting passed down it's not

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,039
evolving any further it's not evolving

376
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,759
into

377
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,599
something better every year but

378
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,838
that is what has happened in the modern

379
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,480
society when we take up those concepts

380
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,279
we don't just sit on them you know we

381
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,720
we kind of expand them and we scratch

382
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,958
the surface and

383
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
you know try to understand why this

384
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,039
works in this way and why not in that

385
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,399
way and because we have the tools and

386
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,159
resources

387
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
and you know the scientific

388
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,159
understanding of uh you know the

389
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,159
cannabis has increased so much in the

390
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,559
last few years thanks to you know all of

391
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,719
these countries investing in

392
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,799
uh you know the information of

393
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,200
dissemination of information of cannabis

394
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,120
i'm really grateful but at the same time

395
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,199
i mean there's a big problem because you

396
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,240
know even in if you look at times like

397
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,838
70s 80s 90s in the modern society i mean

398
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,919
there wasn't much of that happening okay

399
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,800
that only started happening like

400
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,599
after 2000 i would say and

401
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,599
because during 70s and 80s the people

402
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
who were growing cannabis were not

403
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
scientists and the people who were

404
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,759
scientists they would not have grown

405
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,919
cannabis at that point in time so that

406
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,078
really kept cannabis away from you know

407
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,479
scientific exposure for a very long time

408
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,399
but uh as we know later on people like

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
you know rob clark and a lot of other

410
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
people you know got into it and they

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,879
started really you know fixing a few

412
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
things explaining a few things and i i

413
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,278
think they have what they have done is

414
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,959
that they've really paved the path for

415
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,838
other people you know

416
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,159
uh to like not think about the stigma

417
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,839
related to this plan but just go ahead

418
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,198
and use your scientific expertise and

419
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,279
you know help the community you know

420
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,399
bring out more and more information

421
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,559
and in 2020 the situation is that you

422
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,198
could go on google and there are just

423
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,958
endless array of you know scholarly

424
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,000
articles you can go through about

425
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,759
cannabis

426
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,159
and it's almost like you know it was

427
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,879
never illegal

428
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,879
yeah exactly right and we certainly all

429
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,720
stand on the shoulders of giants like

430
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,198
rob clark and people who did early

431
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,278
contributions and it makes me wonder

432
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,599
were there any people in india who you

433
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,919
looked up to as a bit of a role model or

434
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,839
who was doing work kind of when you were

435
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,360
in your kind of more junior stages of

436
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,160
things

437
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,079
um

438
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,519
i would say in the early life

439
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,359
there were some but it was not related

440
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,480
to cannabis especially

441
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,919
specifically

442
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
so uh

443
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,319
my mother belongs to the chamoli

444
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
district and chamoli district is

445
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
actually the place where the chipko

446
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,719
movement started now i'm going to talk a

447
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,480
little about chipko movement what is

448
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,120
chipko movement was

449
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,680
uh it was like a

450
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
environment and feminism kind of a mix

451
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,479
kind of a movement

452
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
so they were cutting down trees in

453
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,959
northwestern himalayas so all of these

454
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,440
tribes and that includes uh you know the

455
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,278
one my mother hails from they would go

456
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,199
and they would stick to the

457
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,958
trees they would hug them now chipko

458
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,599
means to like stick to something or to

459
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,518
hug something okay in hindi so that was

460
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,120
the chipko movement so they would go and

461
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
they would stick to the trees and hug

462
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,278
them and like ultimately that would you

463
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
know enable

464
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,120
make it you know impossible for the

465
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,359
people to cut it down

466
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
so i mean i've heard i mean i was not

467
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,278
around in 70s but i definitely heard

468
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,320
great stories of you know

469
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,759
our ancestors you know helping in that

470
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
moment on the other hand from my

471
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,919
father's side you know one of my uncles

472
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,599
and you know he's he's pretty famous and

473
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,838
he has been you know presented aboard by

474
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
the government as well for his work

475
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,800
around the environment his name is jagat

476
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
singh jangli

477
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,719
jangli basically means the guy who comes

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,680
from the jungle guy right in hindi so he

479
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,560
has been given this uh

480
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,399
salutation in a way jungli his name was

481
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,958
jagat singh and you know we call him

482
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,559
jungli that because this guy

483
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,638
alone himself planted an entire forest

484
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,000
one day after the other by bringing

485
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,600
plants one

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,399
uh he would sometimes take ten plants

487
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,120
sometimes take 20 plants and in a barren

488
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,039
place he was able to make a full-fledged

489
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,198
forest which is now inhabited by a

490
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,439
variety of you know

491
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,679
animal and you know birds and inspect

492
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,240
insect species and you know he was

493
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,399
ultimately awarded a great honor for

494
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,480
doing such work around the environment

495
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,600
and preserving these plant varieties

496
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,000
which grew there so that has always

497
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,038
been you know a driving force for me

498
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,038
that has kept me around the plant it it

499
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,400
always told something inside always told

500
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,160
me that if

501
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,319
it is something around

502
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
related to the plan that is you know

503
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,759
that that's going to be what i'm going

504
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,679
to do so

505
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,839
i think that has been a great great

506
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,240
motivation i mean not that i want to

507
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,240
like you know bring that up to you know

508
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,400
really legitimize anything but i mean

509
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,679
that just something that is attached to

510
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,519
my history and you know i'm proud of it

511
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,840
yeah totally understandable that's

512
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,400
that's a really amazing story and you

513
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,720
bring up a really relevant point about

514
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,519
the the destruction kind of of the

515
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,720
natural habitats of these cultivars do

516
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,639
you think people are really paying

517
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,279
enough attention to this and are aware

518
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,640
of the repercussions of that

519
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,119
in america i mean certainly i think uh

520
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
almost everybody understands and when i

521
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,558
say america because the community that

522
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
i'm in by and large i mean there are

523
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,319
people from america and canada so

524
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,798
basically i just considered that all

525
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,599
americans and even south americans right

526
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,839
and some europeans so uh i think in

527
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,439
europe it's even larger i'm sorry i

528
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,279
think because of the greenhouse seed

529
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,120
company and you know some of the work

530
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,678
they have done around the land race

531
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,678
um the awareness has been a little more

532
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,240
on the european side

533
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,559
but because uh you know all the uh you

534
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,798
know indian and you know the pakistani

535
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,200
and the afghani people who are now you

536
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,519
know coming on to these platforms

537
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
uh with their land race varieties they

538
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,639
they are more connected i feel with the

539
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,880
the american part of the community

540
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,038
so i think the larger wave of

541
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,039
understanding is coming from the

542
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,200
american side of the community but

543
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,798
i think for the longest time the

544
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,519
information has

545
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,519
uh been been residing in the european

546
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,240
community and people people have been

547
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,000
aware that you know this is something

548
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,079
i mean this preservation work is

549
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,160
important and it needs to be done the

550
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,599
only thing that sort of bothers me about

551
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
that is that there are some people are

552
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,639
not going to really name anyone here

553
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,959
because that really doesn't serve any

554
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,799
purpose but some people you know who

555
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,558
have been to india and you know they

556
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,918
have collected seeds and all they have

557
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,599
ever done is they just sold those

558
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,520
varieties you know to people and made

559
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,038
money they've never sent anything back

560
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,639
to these people they've never spoken

561
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,000
about them they've never spoken about

562
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
their problems

563
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,079
and they never even came back or are

564
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,558
even in contact with these people apart

565
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,639
from when they really need the seeds so

566
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,879
although these people have been around

567
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,520
and you know sometimes these people even

568
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,799
you know feel the need uh to assert the

569
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,359
fact that you know they've been around

570
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,879
for much longer but you know then

571
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,279
but i don't

572
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,280
i i feel that you know just being around

573
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,038
is not enough i mean you have to do

574
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,119
something i mean you know you have to do

575
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,640
something that makes a difference even

576
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,879
if even if you've been doing for a month

577
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
i don't care if you're if you've done

578
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
more if you contributed more then you

579
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
deserve

580
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,279
uh you know to be at the forefront of

581
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,519
the movement and you know especially the

582
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,879
people who are whose intentions are

583
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,839
inclined

584
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,679
in in the right way because you know

585
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,599
this thing is this thing is very

586
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,600
delicate you know it can go wrong in so

587
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,719
many ways i mean it's just not very hard

588
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,759
to imagine

589
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
right

590
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,480
so

591
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
uh you know we're very very of the

592
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,079
people you know we connect with them and

593
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,159
there were instances you know i i got in

594
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,678
contact with some people you know

595
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,360
we're not exactly the kind of people i

596
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,880
would have worked with but well that

597
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,959
happens i mean you know you you really

598
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,400
understand you know the human factor is

599
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,519
going to play out you know sooner or

600
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
later

601
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,839
so

602
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,599
eventually we're trying to figure out

603
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,359
more ways to you know keep our rigor

604
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,439
around preservation of the varieties so

605
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,038
not only that we have been you know able

606
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,440
to sending these varieties out to people

607
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,359
we're also preserving them ourselves

608
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,558
which i feel that at least the people

609
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,319
who are you know

610
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,839
uh you know selling them or what they're

611
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,918
doing whatever they're sharing them they

612
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,918
should they have a responsibility that

613
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,159
if you're in a situation in a place

614
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,840
where you can grow it you should grow it

615
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,200
or if you can't then you can at least

616
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,038
you know collaborate with someone

617
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,798
outside you know who is in a legal state

618
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,240
and is able to grow them and have them

619
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,960
grow it

620
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,440
because keeping them shows that either

621
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
you want to uh really hoard it and you

622
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,558
know

623
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
create some kind of pressure in the

624
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,359
market or some weird thing or maybe

625
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,879
you're just not bothered you you just

626
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,558
say preservation and you don't really

627
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
understand you know that the

628
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,879
preservation just like the charity

629
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,879
begins from home

630
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
yeah of course and i can understand why

631
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,038
you would be concerned about that

632
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
i guess it raises an interesting

633
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,919
question and we had a few of our viewers

634
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
ask you know varying forms of the same

635
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,880
question where they wanted to basically

636
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,038
know

637
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,320
as someone let's just say for example in

638
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,720
the western world you know kind of the

639
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,399
countries you mentioned canadia usa

640
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,319
europe stuff like that

641
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,640
someone who's living in those places

642
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,879
what can they do to help kind of

643
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,480
preserve these regional strains is the

644
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
best thing they can do

645
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
try to get some seeds and do a

646
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,158
reproduction and just make sure they're

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,839
around or should they try to caretake

648
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,760
for australian should they try to get

649
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,439
over to a village and actually

650
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,960
physically help the village out like

651
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
what you mentioned would be a nice thing

652
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,079
if you went there initially like what's

653
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,519
your thoughts

654
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,240
yeah there are a few things i would like

655
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,839
to

656
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,919
talk here i mean

657
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,599
the first thing is that i really want to

658
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,919
i mean take this opportunity because you

659
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,399
reminded me and want to thank

660
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,159
the global community especially from

661
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
australia new zealand

662
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
europe and very specifically from

663
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,320
america because they have been nothing

664
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,880
but supportive for last five years i

665
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,319
mean if it were not for the community i

666
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
mean the global community you know has

667
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,599
helped and supported

668
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,879
uh you know we can't even like imagine

669
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,639
doing one person of what we're doing now

670
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
uh what people can do there are so many

671
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,679
things people can do i mean you know you

672
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,600
could just take a plan you could grow it

673
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,360
and you know if you could show it to 10

674
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,879
people even if you don't reproduce it

675
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,479
let's say you don't want to keep a male

676
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,159
because you have your og and cookies

677
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
going at the same time so you want to

678
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,000
make sure it's safe so even if you grow

679
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,400
a landry is female and you show it to 10

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,480
people then you might show it to someone

681
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,720
you know who may be a little more

682
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
interested and then he would go on to

683
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,038
get those seeds and you know

684
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,839
grow a male and a female and preserve it

685
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:21,919
so

686
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,279
the point being is not what you have to

687
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,919
do the uh the point being that you

688
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,200
uh you have you have to feel that it

689
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,120
that it's

690
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,360
it's priority that you have to first of

691
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,359
all understand that there is an urgency

692
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,279
this is uh this is not uh you know

693
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,479
uh like women are getting oppressed

694
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,879
which has been happening for like

695
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,720
thousands of years and would go on for a

696
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,559
thousand more i mean this is

697
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
something which is happening now and

698
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,319
it's gonna end very soon and then there

699
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,480
will be no more of it so we have to

700
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,639
understand the urgency around this the

701
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,319
preservation effort has to be a little

702
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,600
more than what it is right now but i

703
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,879
think we're on the right track the

704
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,359
attitude

705
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,440
is uh absolutely fantastic in you know

706
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,519
global community for about preservation

707
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
people just have no second thoughts they

708
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,720
understand this is important but what

709
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,798
people are missing on is just just

710
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,720
talking about it just going making

711
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,480
comments and you know liking pictures

712
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,880
and saying oh this is the best thing

713
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,038
that's not really helping anything what

714
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,520
you have to do is that you have to get

715
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,038
hold of something gets get hold of

716
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,359
something not trying to say that buy it

717
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,759
from me or like from some of my friends

718
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,479
get it from anywhere you can get it from

719
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,079
grow it preserve it in a way get a male

720
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,038
and female you know this is i'm talking

721
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,720
about the very basic what you could do

722
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,640
and you know you could preserve it make

723
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,720
some notes you know

724
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,400
when when it grow what what was it like

725
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,759
you know how much time did you take in

726
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,798
what it smells like and all the other

727
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,960
aspects

728
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,960
and that information becomes part of our

729
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
collective consciousness our collective

730
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,640
knowledge about the land race and

731
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
heirloom varieties which to be honest is

732
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,159
very scarce right now okay there we

733
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,600
don't know anything about land risks and

734
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,880
heirloom varieties i mean most of the

735
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,798
questions we have to say i don't

736
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,640
understand and you know i'm not trying

737
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,480
to say that that is because we don't

738
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
really understand the whole thing in a

739
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,798
very comprehensive manner as we do most

740
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,600
of the other things

741
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:14,558
so uh first of all we have to ensure we

742
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,399
have to take every part possible to add

743
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,240
to the collective understanding of the

744
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,559
land race and heirloom varieties and

745
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,558
that could be as simple as growing one

746
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,399
plant in your house making all the notes

747
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,158
about it and you know disseminating that

748
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
information among at least with 10

749
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,720
people

750
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
the second would be to motivate other

751
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
people you know

752
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,919
if you are you know smart enough if

753
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,200
you're that intelligent guy who

754
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
understands you know the importance

755
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,159
around the uh preservation then it's

756
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,240
your responsibility to go out to 10

757
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,559
other people and you know let them know

758
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,278
about it at least make an attempt to you

759
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,079
know

760
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,798
um put things into perspective and you

761
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,879
know

762
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,359
show them why this is really important

763
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
and why this is not just uh

764
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,639
you know another

765
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,240
heated agenda on the horizon

766
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,679
well and then there are other people you

767
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,400
know who are more capable who have

768
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,000
bigger farms they have more resources so

769
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,759
those people should definitely be

770
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,440
supporting these groups and you know

771
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,359
support anyone you know i don't care i

772
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
mean like it's me or anyone

773
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,759
but

774
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,159
support these guys i mean because you

775
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,679
know uh that's the only way i mean you

776
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
can make sure that they stick around

777
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,798
otherwise uh you know it can be hard for

778
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,640
a lot of people i can say that

779
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,400
and you know because you guys have the

780
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,759
resources and i'm now i'm talking about

781
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
these people who have big farms and

782
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,440
resources to put behind the plants they

783
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,960
should be growing more of it they should

784
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,360
be the ones who would be you should be

785
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,278
selecting these and they should become

786
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,399
these new people i mean you know how

787
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,599
there is this

788
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,640
uh variety that goes around in uh

789
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,918
usa i might be wrong it's called

790
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
i don't know i don't remember the name

791
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,159
of some kind of oj kosher i think maybe

792
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,080
let's just say some og or some something

793
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,120
which is very good which was selected by

794
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,839
oh i'm sorry yeah it's like called 78

795
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,639
og fe i don't know something like that

796
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,879
so

797
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,360
somebody that that tells me at least it

798
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,120
is telling me somebody in 1978 got some

799
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,479
of ghani seeds and he was

800
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,239
you know intelligent enough and

801
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
resourceful enough to grow a lot of them

802
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,440
and then select a really nice plant that

803
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,839
has made it down you know 30 years down

804
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
you know down the pipe and now everybody

805
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,240
can enjoy that

806
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,319
but

807
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,480
won't we want to have more of that won't

808
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,319
we want won't we wish there were like so

809
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,079
many other more people

810
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,398
when that was everything would have been

811
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:32,000
you know preserved i mean isn't this the

812
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:34,079
most uh you know regretted thing ever by

813
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,759
people that i wish people had you know

814
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,158
saved the haze i wish people had saved

815
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,278
the skunk or like whatever else you know

816
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,200
isn't this

817
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,278
the biggest regret in the community

818
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,640
right now and if

819
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,480
if you look at the nature of that

820
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,720
concern the nature of the concern is

821
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,480
that you know we weren't vigilant enough

822
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,440
to preserve the things that we thought

823
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
are good

824
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
we knew these things were good we still

825
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,479
did not preserve it so if anything you

826
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,398
know if if anything's gonna wake us up

827
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,120
then it's only going to be our own

828
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,798
history which may be as short as like 30

829
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,959
30 40 years i'm talking about the

830
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,480
communist cannabis community but there

831
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,640
are so many lessons to be learned that

832
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,880
the things we lost why we lost them and

833
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,919
how can we make sure that whatever is

834
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,440
present now is not lost so again for the

835
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,360
people who think that these things will

836
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
not be lost well consider this i mean

837
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,158
even in america where you know things uh

838
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,840
you know are so much more stable and

839
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,679
everything they were varieties which

840
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,879
were really good and then they got lost

841
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,320
so

842
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
you know i mean there is a very good

843
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,759
possibility

844
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,080
this this thing is not going to exist in

845
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,519
like five to seven years

846
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,000
i mean i i could tell you right now i

847
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,319
mean some of them will but most of them

848
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
would be gone and if not gone in a way

849
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,879
that they eradicated then those

850
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
varieties would not be the same because

851
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
like you mentioned earlier in the

852
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,798
podcast

853
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,959
that you know it's only a matter of time

854
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,720
that some people do get those seeds and

855
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,960
they get mixed up

856
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
it's all done for so

857
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
let's do what we can do now when instead

858
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,959
of you know telling our kids

859
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
stories about these varieties let's give

860
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,960
them the seeds let's give them the

861
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,880
actual plants

862
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,880
yeah perfect what a what a brilliant

863
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,799
answer for what people can do to get on

864
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,120
board and help out i think this would

865
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,278
actually be a fantastic time for you to

866
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,599
maybe just explain for maybe the few

867
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,240
people who aren't aware who's a part of

868
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,079
the indian land race exchange and like

869
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,519
where they could get your seeds from and

870
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,558
just some stuff like that if they want

871
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,278
to help out okay um so indian landry's

872
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,079
exchange is a collective uh that really

873
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,278
looks after a few different uh you know

874
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,199
collectors

875
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,240
and you know if they need some kind of

876
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,720
uh health that is related to seeds uh

877
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,798
you know because that also helps them in

878
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,960
a way that financially

879
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,798
uh just let me just elaborate a little

880
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,038
more like i went to manipur this

881
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,480
december and i was alone and i went

882
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,240
there and i got

883
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
you know a few hundred thousand seats

884
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,960
from there

885
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,119
so i don't need that many seats so what

886
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,200
i do is i pass along some of those seats

887
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,959
to my friends and they have different

888
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
pages on instagram and they can you know

889
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,798
sell some of those seats and whatever

890
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,798
uh you know money resource they get in

891
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,960
turn they can then use it

892
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,839
for their next year tours or for you

893
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,200
know

894
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,398
growing the plant that they're growing

895
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,640
in india

896
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,959
and you know just continue the whole

897
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,919
thing right so

898
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,120
we work i i basically work in that way

899
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,440
and what i have is i have two immediate

900
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,119
uh people who work with me one is

901
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
archaic serpent

902
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,759
he's on instagram as archaic serpent rap

903
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,240
realms i think

904
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,240
and he's the guy who's from kashmir and

905
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,319
you know he he does all the stuff from

906
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,399
kashmir basically for me

907
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,158
and then i have another guy that's named

908
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,239
red giant he's on

909
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,640
instagram his red giant 92

910
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,480
he's uh he's the grower he pretty much

911
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,799
grows everything for me

912
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,720
i mean and he's a brilliant grower he

913
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,119
grows a lot of hybrids as well you know

914
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,000
he sells that he does a lot of stuff

915
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,000
so

916
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,240
this is the immediate team and then we

917
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,079
have further extension like indian hair

918
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,679

and you know he moves them

926
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,720
uh so that you know it helps the

927
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:21,919
community as a whole so we can lift

928
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,440

958
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,359

00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,839
know he's nothing short of an icon of

961
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,719
course and it was really interesting you

962
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,558
know that in 2018 i i met with him over

963
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,038
instagram and you know i tried to get

964
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,119
seeds from him him and the scenes got

965
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,640
seized in the mail

966
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,038
because we had no idea that they will

967
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,360
get seized and what i had to do was i

968
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,879
had to actually flew him over to india

969
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,719
along with the seeds

970
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,960
and that's really was the first time how

971
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,399
i got the got hold of the afghani seeds

972
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,798
which were released in april 2018 to the

973
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,879
community and then since then he has

974
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,038
been able to expand his work beautifully

975
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,200
and you know he now has access to a lot

976
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,519
of uh you know european and you know

977
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,759
american seed banks as well who sell his

978
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,399
uh you know seats so that's fantastic in

979
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,720
the way that things have evolved in the

980
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,199
past few years for everyone

981
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,519

982
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,600
we have i mean i'm sure there are a lot

983

of people from america that i want to

984
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,278
name but if i start naming them i mean

985
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,519
you know we would need like for five

986
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,679
more hours to complete that but i'm just

987

uh some of the varieties that i could

1004
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,000
not get like pakistani chitral question

1005
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,839
you know the kandahar black

1006
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,839
so he got it to me and they're like

1007
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,279
amazingly inbred as well so like most of

1008
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,918
the work is done

1009
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,639
so yeah he's been a great help and then

1010
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,158
you know i have another friend i don't

1011
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,639
know if you know him he's known as

1012
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,878
biovortex jesse dodd

1013
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,559
yeah yeah yeah i met jesse

1014
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,639
yeah he's he's probably one of my best

1015
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,559
friends from america i mean he's he's

1016
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,480
one of the best guys he's had me so much

1017
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,000
i mean you know we're almost speaking on

1018
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,398
a weekly basis and we're doing this

1019
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,159
conference and we're discussing you know

1020
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,679
sometimes that i'm writing you know some

1021
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,519
of these articles and papers i have to

1022
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,599
share with him and you know

1023
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,800
so that he can do some you know critique

1024
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,480
on that

1025
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,519
so uh it's really great i mean because

1026
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,358
see

1027
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,559
the most needed thing here is the

1028
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,319
motivation

1029
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,759
the only thing you need to make sure

1030
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,639
that people keep doing what they're

1031
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
doing

1032
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,919
is by making sure they're motivated and

1033
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,240
you know these are the people that i'm

1034
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,078
naming right now they're motivating me

1035
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,159
and i have another friend

1036
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,359
his name is he's by dr grinsky i think

1037
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,440
on the

1038
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,519
instagram that's how he pronounces it

1039
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,760
and you know he helps me a lot for like

1040
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,838
sending money to country like pakistan

1041
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,920
and afghanistan because see we can't

1042
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,759
send money to pakistan because we have a

1043
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,159
very difficult relationship with them

1044
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,480
okay politically and i'm sure you know

1045
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,159
that like everybody knows that so

1046
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,079
sending money there is like if you want

1047
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,879
to get arrested you do that

1048
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,119
so i have to yeah i have to route that

1049
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,720
money through them and just imagine it

1050
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,320
you can't find people in america who's

1051
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,639
going to risk their ass you know and

1052
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,039
send money to pakistan because it's just

1053
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,118
pretty similar for them as well right

1054
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,119
and i'm not trying to say that someone

1055
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,200
is bad or you know some country is bad

1056
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,519
or good by that i'm just saying how

1057
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,559
things politically are right now okay

1058
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,800
so

1059
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,759
he helps me he went he goes out of his

1060
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,680
way and he makes sure that he's sending

1061
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,160
big amounts of money to pakistan which

1062
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,480
is perhaps risky even for him to do that

1063
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,838
but he does that because he want to make

1064
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,079
sure that this

1065
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,639
thing is you know done the whole circle

1066
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,240
is completed and he also was receiving

1067
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,078
seats for me because if i try to get

1068
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,519
seats from pakistan they get busted so i

1069
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
have to get them to america and then i

1070
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,599
have to get it i have to get those seats

1071
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,720
from america to india

1072
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,960
so

1073
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,639
i mean he's been helping me and he's

1074
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,480
yeah he's a busy guy i mean you know

1075
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,400
it's not like he's not a busy person

1076
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
he's a very busy person he has several

1077
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,160
projects of his own and you know so much

1078
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,838
work but he makes sure that he takes out

1079
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,078
some time so like i said the

1080
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,078
preservation or the helping doesn't

1081
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,079
necessarily needs to come in the form of

1082
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
you buying seed or you're growing them

1083
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,480
it can be so many things that you could

1084
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,320
enable other people to do or put them in

1085
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,320
a situation where they could do more for

1086
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,880
themselves and ultimately you know

1087
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,359
contribute to the larger community

1088
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,519
and these are people and one more person

1089
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,759
i want to name is would be i don't know

1090
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,358
his name might never ask to

1091
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,280
i think he's mass medical strain so i

1092
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,519
don't know his real name but he's a

1093
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,519
fantastic guy you know absolutely

1094
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,280
amazing we have lovely conversations

1095
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,679
around the plant very spiritual kind of

1096
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,160
conversations and very philosophical as

1097
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,919
well and you know we agreed that uh i

1098
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,239
had a plant you know

1099
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,920
uh uh you know that i feel was really

1100
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,078
special and you know i didn't have

1101
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,358
enough seeds to release to everyone

1102
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,960
because then some people really get

1103
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,960
angry because there are very few seats

1104
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,760
and i can't get them to everyone so what

1105
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,800
i did was i uh just reproduced like a

1106
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,720
bunch of seeds about like 150 and then i

1107
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,960
gave the f1 seeds to you know mass

1108
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,078
medical and i told him like hey you know

1109
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,920
you could grow them and you're going to

1110
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,920
find like the sativa ones and like the

1111
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,000
indigo ones like the you know tall ones

1112
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,760
and the short ones as

1113
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
you want to classify them

1114
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,599
and you can either segregate them into

1115
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
different your tangents and breathe them

1116
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,200
separately or you could just amalgamate

1117
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,119
everything and just make a very

1118
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,879
homogeneous mix of everything and you

1119
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,720
know just distribute it to people and

1120
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,599
put it into people's hand and you know

1121
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,679
he's

1122
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,599
uh he's a great grower and you know he

1123
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,118
makes uh you know a lot of seats

1124
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,039
available to a lot of people through a

1125
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,079
lot of you know american seed bank and

1126
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,679
menus

1127
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,599
so i thought i should give it over to

1128
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,319
him and he would be the more responsible

1129
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,559
and better person to work with it

1130
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,119
and you know he's doing it and he's

1131
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,880
again that's just another unique way how

1132
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,800
you know he's contributing to the big

1133
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,880
effort i'm really thankful there are

1134
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400

1135

yeah lots of help and like i said

1155
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,039
there's so many other people i want to

1156
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
talk about but you know it's just not

1157
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,480
practical to do that but these are the

1158
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,720
people i can think of

1159
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,440
really who are involved in the movement

1160
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,239

1164
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,279
the show body everyone loves bodhi

1165
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,280
that's a bit of a common sentiment um

1166
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,560
and yeah you know it's so funny you

1167
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
mentioned that i was only talking to

1168
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,159
mass medical strains just yesterday

1169
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,679
about just general stuff and he brought

1170
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,118
up that collab you were doing and so i

1171
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,879
wanted to know

1172
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,960
what can you tell me about the swabi

1173
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,960
line you sent him it looks really cool

1174
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,400
and do you hope to do more collabs going

1175
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,119
forward

1176
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,519
um yes swabi line is a really special

1177
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,640
one and for a few different reasons

1178
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,838
so uh if i talk about my father's side

1179
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,838
of the family

1180
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,480
they were not necessarily

1181
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,159
from india in 1947

1182
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,199
india and pakistan became two different

1183
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,078
countries

1184
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:01,358
and at that point in time my my father's

1185
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,599
family you know they moved from pakistan

1186
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,279
and they used to live in swabi they

1187
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,760
moved to rajasthan and then from

1188
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,440
rajasthan they moved to uttarakhand

1189
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,040
where they found the you know

1190
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,480
environment was pretty much similar to

1191
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,279
where they had come from and they kind

1192
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,800
of

1193
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,319
settled there

1194
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,400
and after a couple of generations you

1195
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,639
know everybody was speaking the language

1196
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,440
and they had completely you know become

1197
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,920
a part of the larger you know gerwali or

1198
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,960
the uttarakhand culture that there is

1199
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,358
so

1200
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,559
i was able to make a friend in 2000 i

1201
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,639
think it was around end of 2016

1202
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,559
in pakistan and you know he sent me some

1203
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,318
seats from swabi and that was really

1204
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,199
special for me i kept those seeds in

1205
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:44,559
refrigerator for a very long time

1206
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:47,118
and in 2019

1207
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,000
i brought them outside when i had the

1208
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,400
resource and i was sure that if i grow

1209
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,239
them i can you know like make sure that

1210
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,920
you know i flower them and i make the

1211
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,318
seeds and do everything that is required

1212
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,800
to reproduce and preserve it so i grew

1213
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,679
few of those and what i did basically

1214
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,920
was

1215
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,598
i excluded all the longer flowering you

1216
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,000
know females which were present in the

1217
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,838
population and i just only selected the

1218
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
ones which are flowering faster and had

1219
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,880
copious resin production

1220
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,199
i used two different meals one male had

1221
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,200
an amazing vigor

1222
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,000
the other male didn't have great vigor

1223
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,838
but it had visible uh you know

1224
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,800
trichomes on it

1225
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:28,480
so

1226
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,318
i mean that was a plus so i wanted to

1227
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,079
use it and see if that really translates

1228
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,199
into something else but it surely does

1229
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,480
because

1230
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:39,519
uh when i grew the f1s here uh last uh

1231
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,599
last year and i saw that you know most

1232
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,000
of the f1 that came up they were just

1233
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,000
way more resonance than what i had

1234
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
originally selected that population out

1235
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,358
of

1236
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,920
so uh for that reason it's a very

1237
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,078
interesting population but now

1238
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,838
the question is why there are some short

1239
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,480
flowering and why there are some longer

1240
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,920
flowering varieties within that one

1241
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,159
population especially if it is

1242
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,159
domesticated in place like pakistan well

1243
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,480
the answer is that swabi is a place

1244
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,639
which is like really the edge of

1245
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,358
khyber pakhtunkhwa near like mardan in

1246
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,960
punjab so while you're just

1247
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,598
it's sort of a place while you're like

1248
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,760
getting down from the mountains

1249
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,000
and you know you're going towards more

1250
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,480
hotter more temperate climates uh which

1251
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,199
are also flatland territories okay

1252
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,519
so

1253
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,719
you have the wilder varieties which are

1254
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,239
growing out there are pretty much

1255
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,000
similar to the indian varieties which

1256
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,039
are thin leaved and you know they flower

1257
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,440
like 14-15 weeks and you know they

1258
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:38,559
seem to have a very unpredictable way of

1259
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,280
producing thc cbd or whatever

1260
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,920
so

1261
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,680
uh what people did in swabi was just

1262
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,599
like everyone else in pakistan you know

1263
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,838
they got their seeds from afghanistan or

1264
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,318
some place like pakistan where they can

1265
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,639
get the seeds uh which you know grow

1266
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,318
plants that flower very short and you

1267
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,679
know have all those desirable effects

1268
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,318
that we know of

1269
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,919
from the short flowering varieties but

1270
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,920
the problem was what they did not

1271
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,680
account for was once again the wilder

1272
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,838
population growing around it and because

1273
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,960
there's no one stopping that they keep

1274
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,719
interacting with with each other

1275
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,599
however if you see

1276
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,000
on an overall basis the flowering still

1277
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,519
remains short and you know

1278
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
the resin production is pretty much

1279
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,759
there because uh because you know the

1280
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,679
domesticated population after all is

1281
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,599
being taken care of even though it is

1282
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,960
getting pollinated uh

1283
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,519
with the one

1284
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,800
which is wild and of course the wild

1285
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,960
variety

1286
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,400
is the farthest thing from a true

1287
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,240
breeding variety while you're

1288
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,519
domesticated one isn't either

1289
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,239
attributing

1290
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,400
variety exactly but it still is a little

1291
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,559
more homogeneous than the other ones so

1292
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,480
it tends to dominate overall but you

1293
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,159
still see a lot of i mean you know

1294
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
longer flowering plants not to the

1295
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,399
extent that 14 15 weeks but yeah about

1296
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
like 11 12 weeks you see them and you

1297
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,358
see they have a significantly more

1298
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,599
stretch

1299
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:00,239
and as a matter of fact i would say even

1300
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,519
the ones that you would consider uh you

1301
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:05,358
know short flowering or indigo away

1302
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,599
even they have significantly more

1303
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,838
stretch compared to a pure guy variety

1304
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,000
or a pure variety brought from a place

1305
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,759
like uzbekistan

1306
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,239
so a lot of diversity going in there and

1307
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,040
the smells are just amazing because

1308
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,039
you'll be getting a lot of spices i mean

1309
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,800
that's the thing about pakistan a lot of

1310
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,318
varieties that come from pakistan have

1311
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,200
this spicy

1312
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,358
flavor and it's just delectable i mean

1313
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,000
you just fall in love with it absolutely

1314
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,920
so the spice is gonna be there in an

1315
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,960
overwhelming fashion and it's gonna be

1316
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,559
coupled with like raw mango and even

1317
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,480
mass medical told me that you know he

1318
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,559
was getting some rubbery tones and

1319
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,358
something like onion

1320
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,279
um so well that really let's see you

1321
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,519
know how it really develops and you know

1322
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,200
because he's really growing and growing

1323
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,679
them out big and

1324
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,199
yeah we'll really see and i'm

1325
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,199
really excited to

1326
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,598
see how they test and what kind of

1327
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,279
phytochemical composition comes up

1328
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,760
you know number wise

1329
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,599
if there's some cbd present or even some

1330
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,680
other rare you know cannabinoids present

1331
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,359
in that plant so that all remains to be

1332
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,559
seen but uh so far the developments are

1333
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,159
good and

1334
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,318
mass medical has

1335
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,239
also gone ahead and you know taken the

1336
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:23,119
opportunity to pollinate

1337
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,439
uh some of his you know stable varieties

1338
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,358
with swabi and you know eventually work

1339
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,800
on those lines and see if he can release

1340
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,719
some of them

1341
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,119
so it's gonna be it's gonna be great for

1342
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,559
people well i'm always open for you know

1343
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,039
collaboration

1344
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,279
uh but like i said you know there's this

1345
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,199
big factor human factor you know that we

1346
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,720
have to be careful about so we have to

1347
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,199
be careful you know who we're working

1348
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,439
with and that our intentions are in tune

1349
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,919
and then we both have the same goal in

1350
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,358
mind and not that you know one person is

1351
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,440
thinking something and the other person

1352
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,119
is thinking something else

1353
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,679
there are so many varieties that i have

1354
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,800
you know which i cannot release because

1355
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,318
that's not uh you know good numbers but

1356
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
eventually i'll find people you know

1357
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,199
good people who will uh who would be

1358
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,280
responsible enough to take them and

1359
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,759
reproduce preserve and then distribute

1360
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,920
them uh to the community so that

1361
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,000
everybody can enjoy them

1362
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,400
yeah that's that's really exciting and i

1363
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,159
think likewise we're gonna wait and

1364
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,119
see all the awesome stuff to come from

1365
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,358
that collab i'm interested to know do

1366
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,079
you have a certain type of breeding

1367
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:30,400
style you like and by that i mean do you

1368
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,640
like to cross different land races

1369
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,480
together do you prefer to just reproduce

1370
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,960
them and just kind of hunt within the

1371
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,719
one line what's your preferred kind of

1372
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,720
way of doing it

1373
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,399
well because see i mean i'm not a

1374
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,039
trained leader or i mean because i've

1375
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,039
been only doing it for a few years but i

1376
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:49,440
mean i've had a background in science

1377
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,039
and you know i also studied uh you know

1378
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,280
cognitive psychology i mean i have a

1379
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,358
master's degree in that so we've done a

1380
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,119
lot of you know you know research and we

1381
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:58,880
understand how the recent methodology

1382
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,960
you know works so that pretty much

1383
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,640
remains the same wherever you go even

1384
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,960
though you know plant breeding is quite

1385
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,440
a different thing when you compare it to

1386
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,679
uh you know other things like psychology

1387
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,639
but uh if you are curious and you

1388
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,480
understand

1389
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,400
you know how to perform experiments to

1390
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
reach and at different conclusions how

1391
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
to form hypotheses and you know how to

1392
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,880
prove and disprove them yourself

1393
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,280
is eventually going to help the help you

1394
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,400
uh you know get at positions where you

1395
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,480
know more than

1396
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,119
uh you know somebody who's just looking

1397
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,920
at the plant in a much simplistic manner

1398
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,599
now

1399
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,358
uh there are a few different things that

1400
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,200
i like to do uh first of all i'm a

1401
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,279
really fan of like pedigree breeding but

1402
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,799
that's more for like the monuis

1403
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,280
varieties you know which has male and

1404
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,480
female on the same plant so it pertains

1405
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,240
more to that because you could

1406
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,318
self-pollinate those

1407
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:50,159
in a way you know

1408
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,159
which is not really conducive for

1409
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,040
varieties like cannabis i mean to say so

1410
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,318
even in cannabis you could do that so

1411
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,400
basically what that means is you're

1412
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,119
going to trace the pedigree so all the

1413
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,559
characteristics that you see in a hybrid

1414
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,519
okay let me just start over i mean if

1415
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,280
you have

1416
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,800
uh let's say two plants that you cross

1417
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,599
together you have two land races let's

1418
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,039
say i have kandahar black and i have pck

1419
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,760
and i cross them

1420
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:16,000
so what is going to happen is that uh

1421
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,920
i'm gonna see the progeny and the

1422
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,039
progeny will have a few different things

1423
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,639
okay

1424
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,079
what's what it's going to have is some

1425
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,279
of the progeny is going to look like the

1426
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,960
male some of them going to look like

1427
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,559
female and some of them will have a

1428
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,800
co-dominant expression which will be an

1429
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,240
amalgamation of both of the parents in

1430
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,318
varying manners

1431
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,558
but when you're working

1432
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,719
with varieties which are highly inbred

1433
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,880
which have been homogenized

1434
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,639
uh for certain traits like i'm going to

1435
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,800
talk about pakistani chitral krishna

1436
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,039
pakistani chitrakesh has

1437
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,160
is so in bread i mean that it's so

1438
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,159
homogenous for that trait or i mean the

1439
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,920
way it grows and everything that no

1440
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,920
matter what you cross it with it's

1441
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,639
completely takes it over

1442
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,159
it is it just knocks off the other you

1443
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,879
know alleles and just

1444
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,358
just takes over completely and

1445
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,358
i don't know about the kandara black but

1446
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,519
i grew only about like five to seven

1447
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,759
plants and i could see

1448
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,599
that almost every plant was identical in

1449
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,160
the way they would acquire you know

1450
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,079
colors and you know way they would

1451
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,920
uh you know grow in a lot of things so

1452
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,760
that made me understand i mean again

1453
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,920
this is also a very

1454
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,640
inbred variety and pretty homogeneous

1455
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,760
for the trade black leaf if not anything

1456
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,159
else

1457
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,640
so i just thought you know you just

1458
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,159
cross these two varieties and the

1459
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,639
predictability is going to be really

1460
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,639
high so for someone who's working in

1461
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,480
small spaces like me i mean i don't have

1462
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:41,440
like [ __ ] farms here like i'm growing

1463
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,199
plants at but i have enough space to you

1464
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,280
know do my breeding work in a meticulous

1465
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,159
and in an honest manner

1466
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,119
so

1467
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,318
i have to readily choose plants or the

1468
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,800
parents

1469
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:56,079
uh when i will be able to greatly

1470
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,920
predict the outcome because i don't have

1471
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,920
really have the space to see what's

1472
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,039
happening every time by growing 200

1473
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,838
plants

1474
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,679
so

1475
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,039
when i run into varieties like hindu

1476
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,519
kush let's just say when i was growing

1477
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,279
hindukush and the first thing that i saw

1478
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:11,519
was again there are these three

1479
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,599
different you know expressions there the

1480
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,559
first is a narrow leaf that corresponds

1481
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,000
to the primordial state of that plant

1482
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,400
because they were all narrow leaf before

1483
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,159
they got domesticated and everything

1484
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,079
and then you have the domesticated

1485
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,000
variety which is of course of course the

1486
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,280
broadleaf variety you know the perfect

1487
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,358
structure and everything that we

1488
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,040
recognize as the cannabis plant and then

1489
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,358
there is intermediate variety which is

1490
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,119
just between both of them it has

1491
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,000
you know certain features from both of

1492
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,559
those varieties in varying manners

1493
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,159
so as soon as i saw that i will i

1494
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,880
thought if i'm if i want the narrow leaf

1495
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,799
trade to carry on into my projects then

1496
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,800
i can't just take this very plant and

1497
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,119
you know start you know crossing it to

1498
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,280
everything else because this is a part

1499
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,480
of a very uh you know

1500
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,440
uh

1501
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,920
a very

1502
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,920
heterogeneous you know population i mean

1503
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,079
it's just not something you know which

1504
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,680
is consistent it's not dominant in the

1505
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,920
population if it were dominant then i

1506
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,598
would see it pop up a lot more often

1507
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,960
like the broad leaf

1508
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,039
so

1509
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,800
then the only option you have then it's

1510
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,639
not really a matter of what you like to

1511
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,800
do the only option you have is to take

1512
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,960
that plant you know and find another

1513
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,000
plant you know its counterpart which is

1514
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,960
as closely related to it physically in

1515
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,400
other aspects smell and all as you can

1516
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,720
and then you start in breeding them

1517
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,599
selectively and you do that until you

1518
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,358
reach a

1519
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,400
you know situation where

1520
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:38,078
almost every plant comes out like that

1521
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,680
it happens in four generation five

1522
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,359
generation who knows depends on the

1523
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,199
variety depends on you know how well

1524
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,598
you're selecting it

1525
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:48,558
and a lot of the things so once you do

1526
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,960
get to that point then you have once

1527
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,800
again reached the situation of that pck

1528
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,039
into gandhar kind of a situation because

1529
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,039
now you have a hindu variety that is

1530
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,119
going to act as a true breeding variety

1531
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,679
because it has been you know how much

1532
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,000
noise for all of those traits in it over

1533
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,879
generations by selectively including it

1534
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,800
with closely related individuals

1535
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,720
now if i take that hindu question i

1536
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,839
cross it with something else

1537
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:16,000
then i can be sure that these traits

1538
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,000
will show up in a overwhelming

1539
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,400
proportion and at least in the f1

1540
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,480
generation and then the selection work

1541
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,559
is going to be you know really easy or

1542
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,280
you could just you know cross pollinate

1543
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,040
the f1 generation get to the f2 you know

1544
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,519
and then select from an even more

1545
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,599
diverse population but then again there

1546
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,000
is no fixed rule there are no rights and

1547
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,359
wrongs you can cross land races to land

1548
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,920
races you can cross land raise to

1549
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,759
hybrids you can do whatever you want

1550
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,079
right you will end up making seeds some

1551
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,680
plants will come out of those seeds

1552
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,839
but if you

1553
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,000
want to work in a way you know that is

1554
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:50,880
predictable and

1555
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,719
that

1556
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,640
kind of creates like a feedback loop

1557
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,480
that your own work has to give you

1558
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,960
certain feedback that what you were

1559
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,119
expecting yes you're able to see that

1560
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,199
like for example again if the kandahar

1561
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,240
black and pck

1562
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,919
cross does not show in f1 population you

1563
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,759
know what i'm expecting to see then that

1564
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,599
tells me that something went wrong in

1565
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,200
the parental generation then i can go

1566
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,880
back and you know i can figure it out

1567
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,199
what it is although i'm pretty sure

1568
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,440
that's not going to happen

1569
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,279
but uh what i'm trying to say here is

1570
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,519
that it really depends on where you're

1571
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,800
trying to reach so if you want to reach

1572
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,400
somewhere

1573
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,079
where you want to be confident in giving

1574
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,160
out your seeds and letting people know

1575
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,920
what they would be like then well that's

1576
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:33,920
the way of working that you have to

1577
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,200
either find true breeding varieties or

1578
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,440
you have to find varieties and you know

1579
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,439
make them breed true for you know traits

1580
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,559
by reading them and just a lot of work i

1581
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,760
know but

1582
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,680
you know

1583
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,280
it has to be done and i understand i

1584
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,039
mean the market situation is completely

1585
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,640
different for people in u.s and europe

1586
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,880
because they're constantly you know

1587
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,838
competing with so many other people and

1588
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,200
you know

1589
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,039
so the actions are pretty much

1590
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,078
predicated by you know

1591
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,920
uh what's market what market is doing

1592
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,599
what what's good in the market more than

1593
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,519
what they want to do

1594
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,359
and it's kind of sad at the same time

1595
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:09,119
but you know people have to put food on

1596
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,199
their table so i mean i'm not going to

1597
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,838
go ahead and blame someone for like

1598
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,000
uh not doing the work that way should be

1599
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,239
done but at the same time there are

1600
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,838
there are no rights or wrongs i mean

1601
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:23,598
you do what you you can do and then you

1602
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,239
try to reach at a place where people can

1603
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,400
appreciate it

1604
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,318
yeah of course understandably people

1605
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,760
have got to provide for themselves and

1606
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:32,719
their family

1607
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,920
just to

1608
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,598
kind of

1609
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,159
tie up two little things i was wondering

1610
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,240
about your breeding process do you given

1611
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,318
what you just said do you tend to like

1612
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,399
to select just one male to pollinate

1613
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,000
females or do you like to use a few and

1614
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,838
then as a follow-up do you keep any

1615
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,838
cuttings at all either male or female

1616
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,599
i i like to select a few males uh always

1617
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:58,239
i mean at least uh three four or five

1618
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,920
depending on the population as well if

1619
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,399
i mean it again it really depends what

1620
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,119
you're trying to do so let's let's say

1621
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,599
if i'm working with lola valley that i

1622
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,358
and my friend archive serpent were

1623
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,599
so we saw there is a staggering amount

1624
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,000
of variability present within the larger

1625
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,240
population so we had no option but we

1626
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,519
had to select five different males

1627
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,118
they looked completely different and

1628
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,960
then we had to narrow it down to one

1629
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,559
which took around like three months or

1630
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,838
just stressing those males and just

1631
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,280
trying to see if there's any you know

1632
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,519
latent intersex

1633
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,599
trade that might pop up later

1634
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,358
so all of those things so it really

1635
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,680
depends what i'm trying to do but if i'm

1636
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:35,838
working with let's say pck

1637
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,399
then i don't really need to have like 20

1638
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,679
different males really i mean

1639
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,838
it it

1640
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,919
it doesn't really make a lot of sense

1641
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,960
but i'm sure you could uh you know

1642
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,798
increase the probability of your results

1643
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,679
in in a better way if you have more

1644
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,480
males and i do understand that but

1645
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,159
uh

1646
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,440
i think a more

1647
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,239
i i think a more uh i should say

1648
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,798
uh

1649
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:03,759
a more in tune way with your process or

1650
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,079
i would say a way that would you know

1651
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,160
take you towards your goal has to be

1652
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,880
taken by people rather than what would

1653
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,879
appeal to people as you're doing good

1654
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,119
because i see that some people would go

1655
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,280
and do things because they feel that you

1656
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,760
know this would uh drive people's

1657
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,599
opinion in us uh you know

1658
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,920
in a certain way and it would make them

1659
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,480
feel that i'm doing the right things

1660
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,079
but i think you always and always have

1661
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,960
to choose

1662
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,200
over

1663
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,720
uh you know you have to choose what you

1664
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,199
want to do over

1665
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:37,759
what would drive other people's you know

1666
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,439
uh opinions and then you could

1667
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,280
i mean it's very hard to explain in

1668
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,960
words for me i mean english not being my

1669
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,200
first language i guess

1670
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,880
but um what i'm trying to say here is

1671
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,960
this that

1672
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,798
uh you know that the breed

1673
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,000
the male selections

1674
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:53,679
i mean

1675
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,039
it's difficult i mean you know because

1676
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,919
most people you know who are growing

1677
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,759
like selecting 20 males they never tell

1678
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,599
you like what they're selecting for and

1679
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,680
how they're selecting

1680
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,519
because i see some people say that you

1681
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:07,118
know if your male you know drops the

1682
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:08,639
pollen late and that's a good male or

1683
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,160
you have to find a male that has a big

1684
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,400
cluster on it

1685
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,480
all valid and you know they make sense

1686
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,119
you know all of them but

1687
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,480
uh i don't see people like you know

1688
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,798
when they're working with the population

1689
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,798
that taking notes of the females you

1690
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,719
know the females you like if let's say

1691
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:26,798
you like four females you know in a

1692
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,558
population then you have to take notes

1693
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,159
from the beginning that what is the you

1694
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,359
know difference between their internodes

1695
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:34,078
you know their life

1696
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:35,679
their leaf surface area and all of those

1697
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,440
things and then you will be finding

1698
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,399
males that's exact thing is going to

1699
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,559
help you that data is going to help you

1700
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,480
determine which are those males which

1701
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,880
will be perfect which will be synonymous

1702
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,559
to the females that you have selected

1703
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,798
instead of just relying on something

1704
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,359
like a bigger you know cluster on the

1705
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,039
male or you know it has a dance stem rub

1706
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,039
or something of that sort which is great

1707
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,440
i mean you should do that

1708
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:02,239
but i mean if you're maintaining data

1709
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,240
from your female selections then you can

1710
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,959
just take that physical data apply it to

1711
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,639
the male and see which males have that

1712
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,519
exact structure in every all those

1713
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:13,358
traits and you know these plants are the

1714
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,358
closest to the females you've selected

1715
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,960
and you could do that so i think

1716
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,598
more than in numbers

1717
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,720
uh it is about how to select the male

1718
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,039
then

1719
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:25,838
that that is more important because you

1720
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,880
could have 10 000 males and yet not have

1721
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:31,440
a clue how to select the right one

1722
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,838
yeah very astute point to make and i

1723
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,679
mean you know while we only just talked

1724
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:37,599
about bodhi just a minute ago i want to

1725
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,838
use him as a good little segue into my

1726
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,920
next question which is when you kind of

1727
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:44,239
travel around and you go and visit

1728
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,119
different places do you predominantly

1729
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,879
trek between them or and is that like a

1730
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,640
style of travel that you enjoy because i

1731
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,160
just i just remember boat he's so fond

1732
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,920
of it

1733
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,798
yeah we have to track i mean most of

1734
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,000
these places are not accessible by um

1735
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:59,679
by roads

1736
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,159
so uh

1737
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:05,358
most of the places you have to track so

1738
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:07,199
himachal pradesh is fairly easy because

1739
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:09,759
um you get if you want to go to the

1740
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,439
malana you get to uh to the last point

1741
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,280
with your car and then it's only about

1742
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,960
two kilometers to the village

1743
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,319
and two kilometers to

1744
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,480
you know waichin valley and about

1745
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:20,480
another kilometer to magic valley

1746
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,240
uh whaling valley is a little farther

1747
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,039
it's about like eight to nine kilometers

1748
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,719
and

1749
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,039
everybody's not even welcome there so i

1750
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,719
mean like most people don't go but apart

1751
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,279
from that i mean it's pretty much easy

1752
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,959
but you go to places like uttarakhan or

1753
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,200
you know northern kashmir then there's a

1754
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,599
whole lot more you know walking involved

1755
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,279
because the roads are just not paved

1756
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,880
those places are not getting the kind of

1757
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,798
revenue and tourism

1758
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,920
pradesh is getting and

1759
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:46,880
you know

1760
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,280
the development is uh i mean pretty much

1761
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,559
uh you know in sync with that i mean as

1762
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,000
much the revenue the state's going to

1763
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,040
have i mean they will only be able to

1764
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,159
spend that

1765
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:58,639
and sometimes not even that so kashmir

1766
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,798
and uttarakhand it's going to be really

1767
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,400
taxing i mean if you're not the kind of

1768
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,480
person who likes to walk then you're

1769
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,880
going to have a very hard time and

1770
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,199
because of the altitude i mean it's

1771
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,798
really difficult and you know i have

1772
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,358
met some people who

1773
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:16,639
come from like america i mean i had this

1774
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:18,880
guy in 2018 he's a good friend of mine

1775
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,118
and uh he came from america and we took

1776
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,880
him to you know uttarakhand and you know

1777
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,760
i took him to kashmir and i took him to

1778
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,519
you know

1779
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,280
uh

1780
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:29,039
pradesh as well in malana and you know

1781
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,519
you had a great time but

1782
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,039
again it got really taxing and tiring

1783
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,798
for that person because you know he was

1784
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,960
just not

1785
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,798
you know used to walking a lot

1786
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,400
on a daily basis so

1787
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,239
and another thing is when you're doing

1788
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,960
this you have a very short window like

1789
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:47,838
you have to spin too of 15 september to

1790
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,920
sort of like 30th october because most

1791
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,679
of the harvest is gonna happen between

1792
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,358
that and you have to make it out to all

1793
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:55,679
of these places

1794
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,519
at least to the three himalayan states

1795
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,798
and have to be present there you know

1796
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:02,639
while it's going down so it's it's

1797
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:04,559
important to you know plan very

1798
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,000
meticulously how you're going to go

1799
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,960
about your

1800
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,599
you know

1801
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,079
hunts every year so every year we make a

1802
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,079
calendar at least four months prior at

1803
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,359
least five months prior and we know that

1804
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,519
you know what places we're going to go

1805
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,519
to this year and what exactly are we

1806
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,119
going to cover and uh you know if you're

1807
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,920
going to make some kind of video like we

1808
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,680
did one in kashmir you know we covered

1809
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,079
how they make cash traditionally by

1810
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,000
cooking it so we we write a storyboard

1811
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,400
for that and we make sure that you know

1812
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,639
we know exactly what to do at that point

1813
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,358
in time because it's all happening live

1814
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:39,118
and if you miss it then you miss it so

1815
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,598
you just have to be prepared and the

1816
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,640
presence of mind is of the essence uh

1817
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,519
while conducting this kind of work

1818
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:49,118
but

1819
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,880
hiking and walking is is basically a

1820
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,559
very integral part as well and if you're

1821
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,680
not up for that are you probably going

1822
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,160
to have a very hard time

1823
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:00,159
understandable of course and

1824
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,318
when i think back to bodhi talking about

1825
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,399
the trekking he often speaks about it as

1826
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,400
though there's like a spiritual aspect

1827
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,400
to it and a lot of the cannabis and

1828
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,920
hashish you sample along the way is

1829
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,519
really special

1830
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,680
is that kind of the way you think about

1831
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,239
it or is it more just like a means to an

1832
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:19,440
end to get the seeds for you

1833
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:22,318
no absolutely there is a deep spiritual

1834
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,760
aspect uh attached to it and i just want

1835
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,639
to be clear and this has nothing to do

1836
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,599
with the religion or the god here when

1837
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:31,759
we when i'm saying spirituality i i just

1838
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,559
mean to say a higher understanding and

1839
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,599
higher awareness

1840
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,680
of you and your surroundings and i think

1841
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,599
there are two very important things that

1842
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,759
happen when you go out on these tracks

1843
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,119
especially if you're alone

1844
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,400
first is that

1845
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,640
you are in a serene environment that is

1846
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,760
very hard to come by and you know a

1847
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:56,318
chaotic life in in places like india

1848
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,480
so now you are actually physically in a

1849
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:01,519
place or in a situation where you can

1850
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,519
reflect back to things in your life

1851
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:05,519
reflect back to

1852
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:07,038
things that you see in nature and you

1853
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,798
can connect with them because there's

1854
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,359
nobody around you to you know judge you

1855
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,960
or to call you crazy or any of that

1856
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,279
sort of thing that we you know we seem

1857
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,639
to be really worried and preoccupied

1858
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,519
about

1859
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,279
and the other aspect of it is the

1860
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:23,679
awareness of the surrounding i mean

1861
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,760
without going out in the nature and you

1862
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,838
could call it data collection in a way

1863
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,079
in a very crude manner and you could

1864
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,719
also call it increasing the awareness of

1865
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,160
your surroundings so both are correct

1866
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:35,919
and

1867
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:38,318
you know that can only happen when

1868
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,880
you're venturing to these places where

1869
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,880
there are no roads because see if there

1870
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,798
is a road somewhere let's understand

1871
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,119
this that place has already been

1872
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:49,038
ventured and you can probably find that

1873
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,000
information somewhere on google

1874
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,559
right

1875
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,480
but if you go to places where you don't

1876
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,559
have a road and you're hiking into these

1877
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,318
mountains to these valleys

1878
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,160
well surely enough you're going to run

1879
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:02,639
into places and you're going to run into

1880
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:05,920
cultures and people and resin and you

1881
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:08,879
know alcohols and honey and you know

1882
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,519
sometimes they make you know butter

1883
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,680
from indigenous milk and all that and

1884
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,079
all of those experiences you know you

1885
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:18,399
will always be devoid of that if you are

1886
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,039
not attempting to go there

1887
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,358
so if some person especially somebody

1888
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,720
who lives in america or lives in a

1889
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,960
country where you know these kind of

1890
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:29,679
experiences are scarce to come by

1891
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,000
and they do make a journey like that

1892
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,759
i mean what possibility do you think

1893
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,599
there is that

1894
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,000
it does not have a spiritual deep

1895
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,480
spiritual impact on that person i mean

1896
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,480
you you basically have to be like you

1897
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,760
know a non-human entity you mean not to

1898
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,400
be moved

1899
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,000
by the beauty of the nature that is

1900
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,160
present in himalayas i'm not sure if

1901
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,920
you've been here but it's absolutely

1902
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,399
breathtaking i mean i've only lived all

1903
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,559
my life here and every time i go

1904
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,880
i'm just dumb stuck you know looking at

1905
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,640
the nature around me so like you said i

1906
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,680
mean you know bodhi really i mean you

1907
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:05,279
know puts it in a very local manner that

1908
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:06,798
i might not be able to put it across in

1909
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,880
that way but

1910
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:13,199
the gist of the story is

1911
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,720
he he's just as interested in hiking and

1912
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,639
in the journey as much as he's

1913
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:18,239
interested in getting to the destination

1914
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,639
and then doing the thing

1915
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:22,798
which is incredible and that is the

1916
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,879
attitude that we need to have

1917
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:27,280
and not because that it's something

1918
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,480
spiritual at the same time this is the

1919
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,319
same thing that is going to help you

1920
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,240
with your data collection if you're

1921
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,480
aware and sensitive all the time if

1922
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,159
you're receptive of your surroundings

1923
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,480
when you're and you're hiking you're not

1924
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,960
going by a motor car or by a bus you

1925
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,199
know you're walking slowly and you're

1926
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,440
taking information as our senses are

1927
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:46,639
evolved to you know at medium speeds at

1928
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,318
medium

1929
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:52,798
uh sizes then we will be taking a lot

1930
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:54,719
more in we will be imbibing all this in

1931
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,480
raw data from nature

1932
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,480
and because there are no roads so we

1933
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,400
might be getting in you know more

1934
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,240
or newer information

1935
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,160
which you could then process in your own

1936
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,038
way use your intelligence what you make

1937
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,159
of it and present it to the community

1938
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,039
you know who

1939
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:10,960
uh

1940
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,520
are not geographically blessed enough to

1941
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,519
be in those places so frequently and you

1942
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:17,759
know that's really what

1943
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,559
what it's all about so i think he puts

1944
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,960
it in a very beautifully and a very sim

1945
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,798
sim puts it very simply but there's a

1946
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,798
deep deep meaning to that i think

1947
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,280
yeah most certainly and i mean bodhi

1948
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:33,038
actually gave me two questions to ask

1949
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,559
you so we may as well roll into him

1950
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,720
saying as we're here and he wants to

1951
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,440
know first off what's the most

1952
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,159
psychoactive indian heirloom strain

1953
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,559
you've been able to try

1954
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,038
okay the most uh

1955
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:49,519
so

1956
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,000
most i mean this is this is a this is a

1957
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,920
tricky question but i'm going to say

1958
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,920
manipuri the one that comes from

1959
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,079
northeast of india manipur and

1960
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,599
especially the one that

1961
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,599
we recently got from uh eastern manipur

1962
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,559
burma border

1963
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,720
and i i don't understand the reasons why

1964
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:11,039
because you know again the domestication

1965
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,598
is pretty much you know

1966
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,839
uh of the same standard as it is in rest

1967
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,760
of the north india but the varieties

1968
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:18,558
that seem to come from

1969
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,880
these

1970
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,960
places northeast of india

1971
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,880
seem to have a really uh you know

1972
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,960
intense high if

1973
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,640
if not more and i have a little theory

1974
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,720
and this might be wrong but i'll just

1975
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,078
tell you what i think about this what i

1976
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,719
think about this is

1977
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,640
uh the eastern part of india is where uh

1978
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,078
which is like quite close to the equator

1979
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:40,000
near south and the east part the

1980
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,200
southeast part where orissa is and

1981
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,358
andhra is

1982
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,358
and those places are very close to

1983
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,279
northeast india and northeast india is

1984
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,318
also close to the

1985
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,798
northwestern you know himalayan regions

1986
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:55,199
so it in a way is a sandwich between

1987
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,440
these two places so it's

1988
01:07:55,199 --> 01:08:00,078
i mean it could be that you know people

1989
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,280
from you know different places like east

1990
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,280
and north

1991
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,760
went out there migrated and they may

1992
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:08,079
have contributed somehow you know

1993
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,440
in what makes up the natural population

1994
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,318
out there today

1995
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,200
but we also understand this as a matter

1996
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:16,960
of fact that you know the mao tribes uh

1997
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,838
you know of

1998
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,480
you know the the tank holes and they

1999
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:23,439
have descended uh from the burmese

2000
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,559
people

2001
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:29,599
and specifically the burmese people

2002
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:32,400
of uh the tibetan descent tibetan

2003
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,838
chinese descent so that's the migration

2004
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,960
pattern that has

2005
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:36,880
uh

2006
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,480
that has been traced and they have been

2007
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,079
able to trace it because of the language

2008
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,158
because the way

2009
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,600
uh you know the languages they speak and

2010
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,278
these are different dialects so they can

2011
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,520
understand that this dialect evolved

2012
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,679
properly from this one so that really

2013
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,480
paints the picture of the migration for

2014
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,319
northeast of india so those people have

2015
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,158
come through the ways of china so i

2016
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,080
don't know if they bring varieties from

2017
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:00,000
china or tibet along with them and then

2018
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:01,519
it gets mixed along with the general

2019
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,960
population which is just entirely

2020
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,279
different because

2021
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,319
of being in a very wet tropical like

2022
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,400
climate but it it seemed to have an

2023
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,719
amazing an unparalleled high at least if

2024
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,399
you uh you know compare it to any other

2025
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:17,759
variety in india

2026
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,759
and kashmiris can be quite strong but um

2027
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,359
they're not psychoactive in a way i mean

2028
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,520
i wouldn't call them like they don't

2029
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:27,838
have that psychedelic kind of

2030
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:29,279
uh edge to them and they're more like a

2031
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,119
they're different kind of high i mean

2032
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,960
which which could more be associated to

2033
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:35,599
like broad leaf plants

2034
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,600
but yeah northeast india varieties

2035
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,319
manipur eastern manipur burman

2036
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:44,159
specifically i think would be the most

2037
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,159
or the best in terms of high

2038
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,960
yeah a really solid answer and so the

2039
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,960
second question he asked was

2040
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,960
do you think that the high elevation

2041
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,760
himalayan cannabis

2042
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,679
differ in effect from the tropical more

2043
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,640
sea level specimens

2044
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,480
and

2045
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,239
do you think that it's because of maybe

2046
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,158
the uv that it creates a little

2047
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:05,599
something special and the reason why he

2048
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,039
asked is because he said he knows of

2049
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,960
some barbers

2050
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:12,960
who just want to try to find cannabis

2051
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,840
from like the highest elevation possible

2052
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,560
okay

2053
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,480
um i i think we did bring this up in

2054
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,080
conversation somewhere previously that

2055
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:21,519
you know about the uv radiation when i

2056
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:23,840
was speaking about the highland

2057
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,560
varieties which also grow in the high

2058
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,760
lot high latitude regions so they seem

2059
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:32,719
to be getting a lot more exposure of you

2060
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,920
know uv rays than any other place

2061
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,939
in the world

2062
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,158
so

2063
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,519
[Music]

2064
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,759
is that

2065
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,600
is that something that makes the plant

2066
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,159
behave in a different way

2067
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,760
phytochemically i mean i i can't say yes

2068
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,679
or no to that because i don't have any

2069
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,960
tests to you know fall back on or any

2070
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,239
kind of study

2071
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,158
but what i can tell you for sure is that

2072
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,559
the varieties that tend to grow at

2073
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:58,399
higher altitudes or you know high

2074
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,640
latitudes especially

2075
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:03,839
they seem to uh you know they seem to

2076
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:07,119
produce like we said before

2077
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,079
and in a competitively dense coverage of

2078
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,158
resin

2079
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:13,119
and you know the resin gland gland

2080
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:16,158
glands seem to be bigger and you know it

2081
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:18,399
just seems to be more potent in the way

2082
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,238
you know overall in the way they uh make

2083
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,079
you feel and and this would you know

2084
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:23,839
encompass india in the way and i'm

2085
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:25,840
talking that when i say highland high

2086
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,640
latitude that would include everything

2087
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,039
from central to southeast asia but

2088
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,840
in india itself as well if you go to

2089
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:36,000
places like northern kashmir you know

2090
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,360
it's at 34 degrees north and then you

2091
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,600
have altitude of like 3000 plus meters

2092
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,359
just more than ten thousand feet

2093
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,719
and you definitely see that there are

2094
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,079
certain plants

2095
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,600
uh there

2096
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:52,238
you know which are just insane to simply

2097
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,719
say the least so i think because those

2098
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,559
babas that bodhis

2099
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,239
is referring to they have been to all of

2100
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,560
these places because these babas are

2101
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,399
just about getting you know getting to

2102
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,280
all the places to highs of the mountains

2103
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,000
to the

2104
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:08,079
lowest of the cities you know so so they

2105
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,079
they know they know the higher up the

2106
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:12,238
out there is

2107
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,359
are the plant populations which seem to

2108
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:16,000
have you know

2109
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:17,920
bigger trichomes and you know larger

2110
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,760
density of trichome so if you're rubbing

2111
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,279
the plants you can probably get the same

2112
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,600
thing done within

2113
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:25,198
10 minutes instead of doing it an hour

2114
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,120
if you're working with those varieties

2115
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,279
if you're working with varieties in low

2116
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:31,039
land in places like punjab you may have

2117
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,000
to spend like three to four hours before

2118
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,560
you can

2119
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,920
get anything at all in your hands so i

2120
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,960
think they tend to have that

2121
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:41,359
understanding maybe not in a way that we

2122
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,800
would like to think about it but uh you

2123
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:45,439
know as always

2124
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,039
indigenous cultures and uh these

2125
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:48,960
primitive cultures

2126
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:51,198
they knew so much because they didn't

2127
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,520
have these distractions of you know all

2128
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:56,960
the societies and the markets and these

2129
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,280
phones and laptops and whatnot so they

2130
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,920
could rely they used to rely on their

2131
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,319
natal their innate senses so much more

2132
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,880
often than we do

2133
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:07,840
i mean you know we were just not able to

2134
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,079
you know

2135
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,480
think in in those ways so i think it's

2136
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:14,880
always a great idea to take advice from

2137
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,718
your elders and especially those elders

2138
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,400
happens to be some uh you know chilean

2139
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,520
smoking baba i mean

2140
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:21,920
you know

2141
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,600
uh yeah and you know bodhi knows i mean

2142
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,920

2144
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,279
much understands india very well because

2145
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,239
when he was here

2146
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,840
i mean

2147
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,439
you know he's not asking me that you

2148
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,679
know how to get around so he pretty much

2149
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,359
knows everywhere and in fact when i was

2150
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,399
in the mela he was able to show me some

2151
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,719
of the

2152
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,799

2155
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,800
guy so just to kind of wrap up this

2156
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:51,439
section on kind of the little trekking

2157
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,119
stuff what's one of the most memorable

2158
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:55,279
smokes you've had while doing the

2159
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:57,119
trekking around and as a follow-up do

2160
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:58,719
you have any kind of crazy stories from

2161
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:00,960
while you're tracking

2162
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,600
yeah i'm just gonna answer that all in

2163
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,760
one and this has happened now last year

2164
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:10,719
so uh last year around the month of uh

2165
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,640
end of july or beginning of august

2166
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,439
um india

2167
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,679
made a huge change in the way you know

2168
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:20,238
the things are in jammu and kashmir we

2169
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,920
kind of took hold of kashmir entirely

2170
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,198
our government i'm not gonna go into

2171
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,800
whether that's right or wrong i mean

2172
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:27,039
that's their thing

2173
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,880
so there was a lot of tension there a

2174
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:31,679
lot of people it was locked up for the

2175
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,199
longest time and i was there before that

2176
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,679

2177
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:38,319
me to get out but i got out somehow on

2178

2198
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,640
smooth sailing we went to dachigan

2200
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,520
samples pictures everything

2201
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:23,119
then we moved to northern kashmir and uh

2202
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,320
i'm really happy i'm going to the lola

2203
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:26,479
valley and i'm going to go to those

2204
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,238
spots where you know my friend got the

2205
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,678
seats last year and i will get to see

2206
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,000
those in person

2207
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,440
as well now you have to uh first of all

2208
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,279
let me put things in perspective a

2209
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:37,279
little bit lola valley is just like

2210
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:39,920
three to four hills away from pakistan

2211
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:42,719
okay and not only that it's at the

2212
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:45,279
border that's a de facto water what that

2213
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,719
means is that there is no actual border

2214
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,319
it's just assumed that there is

2215
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,158
somewhere a border in between and you

2216
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:51,840
just don't cross so

2217
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,039
very often what happens is that you

2218
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,480
wouldn't realize and you would just

2219
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,039
cross over and

2220
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:59,439
well that would be you know a very bad

2221
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:00,238
story to tell in the end if you survived

2222
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:00,960
too

2223
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:02,158
but

2224
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,319
we were there and you know we were

2225
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,479
rubbing hash we were actually 12 people

2226
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,479
because we had an entire team from lola

2227
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,879
i had like seven guys from srinagar and

2228
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,639
some from the lab locals and we were

2229
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,319
there we were rubbing hash

2230
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,199
and you know i was collecting samples i

2231
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:18,719
made several videos and even posted that

2232
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,879
then we were almost done and we were

2233
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:24,239
coming down

2234
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:27,199
the there's an indian army post there

2235
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:29,198
all right so they were uh they were wire

2236
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:30,799
i mean somebody did a wireless to them

2237
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,238
that there are like about 10 to 12

2238
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,480
people they can see on the top of the

2239
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,158
hill and they're like coming down and as

2240
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:38,238
we were descending down in the first

2241
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:40,960
meadow that came there were these two

2242
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:42,319
guys from sog that is special operation

2243
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,000
group and let me tell you something

2244
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:45,840
about special operation group i mean

2245
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,479
they're just asked to shoot people if

2246
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,079
they think that they should be shot and

2247
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:52,399
no questions asked

2248
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:54,158
so they had their guns and you know they

2249
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:56,319
they made us sit there

2250
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:57,839
and you know they everybody just went

2251
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:00,238
around telling them that how they are

2252
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,840
just from you know this local place and

2253
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:04,319
even the guys from srinagar had some

2254
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,319
relatives living in this place so they

2255
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,158
were like almost all off the hook i mean

2256
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,479
it was natural for them okay so you guys

2257
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,639
are not coming from the pakistan or you

2258
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:14,479
know something fishy

2259
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,079
then when they got to me and they asked

2260
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,799
me where i'm from and i told them that

2261
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,800
i've come from punjab and these guys

2262
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,719
were absolutely they just absolutely

2263
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,039
lost their mind they were like

2264
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,039
oh man like are you not watching the

2265
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,399
news or like do you not live in this

2266
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:29,198
world of what like

2267
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:31,279
you

2268
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,678
first of all you don't come to kashmir

2269
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,679
in time like this and if you do come to

2270
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,319
kashmir you stick to the lake or to the

2271
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,000
srinagar to the southern part you don't

2272
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:41,840
freaking come to the northern kashmir

2273
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,600
and even if you come to northern kashmir

2274
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,279
and this is exactly how he said i mean

2275
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,120
not in english but

2276
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,599
even if you come to northern kashmir

2277
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:50,800
then you don't climb up the mountain and

2278
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,039
you don't

2279
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,520
uh try to you know get close to the

2280
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:57,840
border region and like how dare you and

2281
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,880
he's like that i've been here for 10

2282
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,640
years

2283
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,719
you know serving an army within just the

2284
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,039
kashmir and i've never got my family

2285
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,560
here to show them around i've never had

2286
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:08,479
the courage to got my family here to

2287
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,239
show them around and look at you like

2288
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,479
what are you even doing here

2289
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:14,399
and then we just kind of told him like

2290
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,238
what exactly i was doing there and you

2291
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,839
know i had to tell him because you know

2292
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,198
i wasn't doing something that i wasn't

2293
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,880
proud of

2294
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,479
and the good thing there is like they're

2295
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,400
not the kind of they're not like police

2296
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:26,718
so they're not worried about hash or

2297
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:28,479
feed that's like

2298
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,000
none of their concern their only concern

2299
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:31,759
is the security that

2300
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,520
who are you where are you coming from

2301
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,760
and why are you here when you're not

2302
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,000
supposed to be on top of these mountains

2303
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,000
so that thing went on for about

2304
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,238
i don't know two two and a half hours

2305
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,600
and you know they scared uh the [ __ ] out

2306
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:45,599
of me you know

2307
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,039
but i think at some point i had like

2308
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,440
kind of understood that they will

2309
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,279
eventually let me go because most of the

2310
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,799
guys that we were there with not only

2311
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:55,279
that they were local but their fathers

2312
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,039
are in army you know in certain

2313
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:58,479
different regiments so

2314
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,399
that helps them you know build on the

2315
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,879
confidence that okay these people are

2316
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,359
not you know anti-social elements or

2317
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,359
someone who's here to do something bad

2318
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:08,960
they're just young guys who want to

2319
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:12,079
smoke and

2320
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,920
uh you know that was one incident i mean

2321
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:15,840
one hell of an incident i mean you

2322
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,679
you're just sitting there and they took

2323
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,760
our pictures they took our ids and they

2324
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:21,440
had this machine where they could scan

2325
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,880
our ids and they figure out you know

2326
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,799
they could

2327
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,640
check that number with the

2328
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,480
data government database whether or not

2329
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,800
these are like fake or these are like

2330
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,238
the real ids so they did everything that

2331
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,560
they could and they took our phone

2332
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:36,718
numbers our addresses and it was only

2333
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,039
after that that they let us go the first

2334
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:41,760
thing i got down at the lola valley

2335
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:44,960
floor i got into the car with my friend

2336
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,119
and we left and we only stopped at i

2337
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,359
mean srinagar not before that's about

2338
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:50,640
120 30 kilometers

2339
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,960
uh although there were a lot of

2340
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,640
stoppages in between so this is like a

2341
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,399
very usual thing for kashmir that you

2342
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,039
travel like 10 kilometers then you stop

2343
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,599
for the army and then just happens like

2344
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:03,519
that everywhere but that was that would

2345
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,679
be one incident that i'm never going to

2346
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,760
forget and definitely something to be

2347
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,840
spoken about

2348
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,079
yeah well i think i would have been in

2349
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,920
the same boat as you quite worried

2350
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:16,158
so i'm only just in this moment

2351
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,039
realizing that i haven't asked you at

2352
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,920
all

2353
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,158
do you in general tend to prefer like

2354
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,960
more kind of uplifting highs or more

2355
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:28,960
kind of sedating

2356
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:32,079
i i like i i like more sedative eyes

2357
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,760
uh something you know that helps you

2358
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:36,479
relax because

2359
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,480
uh i don't smoke much during the daytime

2360
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,559
i i usually you know begin my morning

2361
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:42,399
and then i try to refrain from smoking

2362
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,440
till you know six or seven in the

2363
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,638
evening

2364
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:48,799
and then i just gradually you know

2365
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:51,199
start hitting some bongs but

2366
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,880
when i really feel an urge

2367
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:54,638
where i really feel a nourish to smoke

2368
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,079
is when i'm you know going to sleep

2369
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,679
because i have some you know issues

2370
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:58,399
relating sleep

2371
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,880
and

2372
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:03,359
uh you know so so i'm always just

2373
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:06,159
looking for varieties you know that can

2374
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:07,198
you know help me accomplish or help me

2375
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:09,839
you know

2376
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:10,799
just mitigate those uh issues that i

2377
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,880
have

2378
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,639
around the sleep so i'm always inclined

2379
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,639
towards finding varieties which are more

2380
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,920
sedative in nature and you know would

2381
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,359
make you

2382
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,239
feel sleepy

2383
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:22,960
uh which is also one of the reasons why

2384
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:24,559
i

2385
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,639
tend to you know get

2386
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,480
some of my resin or cherries in bulk and

2387
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:31,119
you know try to cure it for the longer

2388
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:34,799
durations because then even if you know

2389
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:37,198
the plants naturally are not

2390
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,600
or plant predominantly do not produce

2391
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,119
you know a narcotic effect we can

2392
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,120
actually cure the hash in a way and you

2393
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:46,880
know get it to a point where it would

2394
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,880
induce that sort of sleepy effect

2395
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,000
yeah i think i can certainly relate to

2396
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,440
many aspects of that answer something i

2397
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,880
wanted to ask you a little about a

2398
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:56,638
little bit about was

2399
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,039
kind of the general smoking culture in

2400
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:02,079
india and i guess specifically

2401
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:05,039
is tobacco normally mixed with cannabis

2402
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:07,039
and as a follow-up are there other

2403
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:09,519
things besides tobacco whichever get

2404
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:12,479
mixed with cannabis and smoked

2405
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,880
yeah so tobacco is big big big in india

2406
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,638
i mean there is no uh you know hash

2407
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,239
smoking or even wheat smoking in india

2408
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,760
without tobacco

2409
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:22,158
so

2410
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,239
yeah i mean everybody spoke tobacco it's

2411
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:25,519
not a matter of who or where i mean you

2412
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:27,119
could go to himachal pradesh you could

2413
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,120
go to kashmir and

2414
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:30,960
sure the brand of the cigarette is going

2415
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,880
to change or the brand of the tobacco is

2416
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,520
going to change but they all want

2417
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,600
tobacco i mean it's it's the bread you

2418
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,679
know that we are going to spread the

2419
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,639
jelly on basically

2420
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:43,600
so

2421
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:46,400
uh yeah tobacco is a very integral part

2422
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,159
of our smoking culture everywhere but

2423
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:50,719
there are few other things that actually

2424
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:52,879
get mixed along with it and opium would

2425
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:54,800
be you know one of the things

2426
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,930
that do because we have a lot of

2427
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,360
ayurvedic

2428
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:59,280
[Music]

2429
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,319
opium you know preparations here in

2430
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,238
india

2431
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,639
so just to be sure not to confuse this

2432
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,559
with heroin in any way i mean opium

2433
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,359
preparations as in like uh they're

2434
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:12,239
ayurvedic they're mixed with some spices

2435
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,119
and then it becomes a medicine actually

2436
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,678
and it's

2437
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:19,039
it's really beneficial so

2438
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:21,840
we have uh those getting mixed a lot

2439
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:24,079
with uh you know cannabis often but then

2440
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,760
again the can uh the tobacco has to be

2441
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,600
there i mean you know without tobacco

2442
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,760
you just cannot imagine i mean at least

2443
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:33,120
i can ottoman

2444
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,719
so if i smoke without tobacco and i've

2445
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,399
tried you know because sometimes some

2446
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,840
people would give me that what do you

2447
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,238
call that dab

2448
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,719
and it just feels incomplete you know

2449
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:44,638
if you're not smoking with tobacco and i

2450
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,000
understand the underlying reason for

2451
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,960
that i mean you know part of that is

2452
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,238
that you

2453
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,679
eventually get addicted to the you know

2454
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:53,039
substances in

2455
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,760
tobacco

2456
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:58,158
but i mean if we were just to talk about

2457
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:01,039
the experience and the very typical

2458
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:03,839
indian experience of smoking then it

2459
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:05,920
just can not be imagined without tobacco

2460
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,159
in any any place no matter where you go

2461
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,760
in india

2462
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:12,238
yeah that's that's understandable and

2463
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,320
i'd certainly heard that so

2464
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:16,559
how do people tend to smoke do they use

2465
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:18,238
chilums do they use bongs so they use

2466
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,560
joints what would you say is the most

2467
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,319
common

2468
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,080
usually people begin with cigarettes and

2469
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:25,599
when they empty cigarettes and then fill

2470
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,760
them back up

2471
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,079
you know with the mix and then usually

2472
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,760
people graduate to smoking in joints

2473
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:33,519
that is they start buying you know

2474
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,400
rolling paper

2475
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,800
and

2476
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,799
as people uh you know tend to grow a

2477
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,000
little more older and i'm of course not

2478
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,239
talking about everyone but i'm just

2479
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,719
going to talk about the typical smoker

2480
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:47,039
uh you know middle class like a working

2481
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:49,520
class kind of a society that works in

2482
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:52,319
the ideos and relate software related

2483
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:54,320
jobs so those people then after a while

2484
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,639
they tend to lean more to gravitate more

2485
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:58,880
towards bond smoking because it's just

2486
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,960
more convenient and it's not that time

2487
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,560
consuming you know you could just smoke

2488
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,639
get a good high and get on with your

2489
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,760
curriculum so

2490
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,239
i think that

2491
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,920
contributes a lot uh in people you know

2492
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:11,119
gravitating more towards smoking in

2493
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,399
bongs

2494
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:14,399
the chilum

2495
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:17,839
is more like a

2496
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,920
it's more like a pseudo connoisseur uh

2497
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,840
environment in india

2498
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,520
related to chileam so while you have a

2499
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,760
lot of people you know who smoke in

2500
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,120
chilam and they have very expensive

2501
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,159
children as well

2502
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:30,158
but

2503
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:32,319
um more than often and i'm not talking

2504
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,799
about everyone of course more than often

2505
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:36,639
i see people they are using us smoking a

2506
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,719
childhood only because they would want

2507
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:41,440
the other person to see that they're

2508
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,520
smoking into them and you know that

2509
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:45,839
that is supposed to you know give you a

2510
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,280
high ground in their opinion i mean

2511
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,360
amongst other smokers i don't

2512
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:51,198
necessarily feel that way but i can

2513
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,880
certainly see that you know

2514
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:53,678
you know in people

2515
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,400
so

2516
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:59,039
while i mean uh you know

2517
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,920
uh chilling smoking is morally

2518
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:03,840
culturally confined within the babas

2519
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,800
but the new generation that smokes in

2520
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,960
chilemi i think they smoke arachila more

2521
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,960
that has to do more with

2522
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,279
um either

2523
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,279
you know

2524
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,679
either trying to you know experience

2525
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:20,479
if what baba's experience in a way you

2526
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,399
know

2527
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,638
or just to uh

2528
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,839
be in a place where you have a

2529
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,840
you know

2530
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,440
moral high ground or just a high ground

2531
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,520
over everyone that you smoke in chile

2532
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:33,359
man other people smoking bomb

2533
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,080
it's it's weird but that's how it is i

2534
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:38,319
mean this is a thing in india basically

2535
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,800
so if you have like an italian chilem

2536
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:42,158
you know that costs like 200

2537
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,760
and you're smoking in it so you

2538
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,519
automatically become a connoisseur i

2539
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,199
mean you may not know anything about

2540
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,480
cannabis but if you have a chillum then

2541
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:51,119
whoa man

2542
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:51,919
yeah look out for this guy and you know

2543
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,399
if

2544
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,679
i'm just smoking uh a joint then you

2545
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:58,559
know i'm i'm

2546
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:59,440
then you're just like everybody else

2547
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,520
so

2548
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:04,799
immediately children will give you a

2549
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,840
status hike amongst the smokers in the

2550
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,560
circle

2551
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,279
but

2552
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:11,920
does it does it have an intrinsic you

2553
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:14,000
know property to it uh

2554
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,800
then i mean i'm not really able to see

2555
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,719
that to an extent that i can explain it

2556
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,400
and i don't much prefer to smoke into

2557
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:22,399
them a lot but when i go to himachal

2558
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:23,359
pradesh they have some absolutely lovely

2559
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:25,519
chilums

2560
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,639
and i indulge in that fully till my

2561
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,880
throat is

2562
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:33,039
you know sacrificed but yeah i enjoy it

2563
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,760
i love that what a great answer so i

2564
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:38,719
guess just as a really quick follow-up

2565
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,400
is there that same kind of hype culture

2566
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,480
maybe more particularly in the younger

2567
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:44,638
people like what we see in america where

2568
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,238
like you know they want to try to use it

2569
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,159
as a status thing so it's like you know

2570
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,479
i'm smoking cookies in my chillum look

2571
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:52,079
how cool i am

2572
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:54,000
yes exactly so

2573
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,238
but there uh but in a much different way

2574
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,520
i would say

2575
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,959
so uh

2576
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,960
yeah yeah okay

2577
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,880
okay the way this works in india would

2578
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,279
be maybe that if you go to malana like i

2579
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,560
said if i go to malana and i'm always

2580
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,158
like you know trying to smoke in

2581
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,120
different chilums and i'm not really

2582
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,119
trying to

2583
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,158
find a joint or just bong just forget

2584
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,279
about it

2585
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:15,759
so

2586
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:19,119
why why what that happens is because

2587
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:22,159
when when you're at a place you know uh

2588
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:24,158
where it's a common practice then then

2589
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:26,000
as a human nature you know we want to

2590
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:28,158
gel in we want to fit in

2591
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,639
and we we don't want to be you know

2592
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,399
going around the village holding a bomb

2593
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,920
and you know look different some people

2594
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,559
certainly like to do that

2595
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:39,279
but most people would like to gel in so

2596
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,800
uh it has that aspect to it uh the the

2597
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:41,759
children smoking

2598
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,239
and

2599
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,960
the high ground really or or the

2600
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,559
superiority that that is imparted by

2601
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,480
owning a chilum or smoking in a

2602
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,320
childhood really comes from

2603
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:53,919
one that it cost a lot if it's an

2604
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:55,119
original italian children everybody

2605
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,039
knows that

2606
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,399
and second is that

2607
01:28:57,039 --> 01:28:59,920
it is

2608
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,799
it is almost

2609
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,639
as if assumed or you know presumed that

2610
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,039
if you have very nice children then you

2611
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:09,600
must have very nice hash too which is

2612
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:10,960
not necessarily correct again because

2613
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,840
you know why

2614
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,158
and

2615
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,319
i mean those are just really the things

2616
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,319
uh you know why people tend to have

2617
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,000
chilums because of course you go in

2618
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,238
circle there are girls as well and you

2619
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,359
know you wanna you wanna look good right

2620
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:24,959
you wanna

2621
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,559
make sure that girls are like totally

2622
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,639
stoked on you so

2623
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,719
i mean there are just so many reasons

2624
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:32,079
but i just don't see it for the cultural

2625
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,319
reason so much

2626
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:36,000
so among the youngsters with that said

2627
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:38,000
there are certainly some

2628
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
youngsters who are you know very

2629
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,479
dedicated and they would follow all the

2630
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,039
rituals you know pass it to the right

2631
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,879
and you know pray before you know

2632
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,039
smoking it they take care of everything

2633
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,039
and i absolutely love to be with those

2634
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:51,760
people sometime in smoke

2635
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:53,519
but

2636
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,119
as you move out of those circles i mean

2637
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,880
most of the people you see are just the

2638
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,800
rich people you know can afford to spend

2639
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,400
a lot of money and get hold of these

2640
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,639
things but they don't

2641
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:05,359
uh actually appreciate them in a way

2642
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:07,359
that you know a baba would do or another

2643
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:10,079
youngster is doing who is following all

2644
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:10,079
the rituals

2645
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,678
yeah of course and i guess

2646
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:15,439
understandable there's a natural kind of

2647
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,520
distribution there

2648
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,119
so one of the other things i noticed on

2649
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,719
your instagram that i wanted to follow

2650
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:23,039
up on which seems like it's kind of more

2651
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,920
of a local thing is that you posted a

2652
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:30,000
photo of what you said was a traditional

2653
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,279
kashmiri corn wrapped and baked hash

2654
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,238
please tell me a little bit more about

2655
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:37,198
this i've never even heard of that

2656
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:39,279
yeah so that's a really special one in

2657
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,198
2018 first of all let's talk about i

2658
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:44,479
mean how that came to be i mean like how

2659
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:47,759
we were able to document it so in 2018

2660
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:49,839
i invited my friend from usa to come and

2661
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,639
you know let's go to kashmir and see if

2662
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:55,600
we can come back live right so we went

2663
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:57,440
there and once we were there um

2664
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,440
the guy that was supposed to take us

2665
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:01,279
around and my friend archaic serpent

2666
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:04,000
they said you know what we can actually

2667
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:06,399
arrange because we have material we can

2668
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,760
arrange for making hash right now and if

2669
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:10,079
you want you have mobile phones you

2670
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,679
could like you know capture it and then

2671
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:13,600
it could be made into documentaries so

2672
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,079
when i was in college because

2673
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,920
uh you know along with psychology i also

2674
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:19,439
was part of you know mass you know mass

2675
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,840
communication team so i know a little

2676
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:24,960
bit of editing and software's like you

2677
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:26,560
know final cut pro and sony vegas pro

2678
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,000
so i thought yeah that's a great idea i

2679
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,360
could just take that footage and i could

2680
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,520
make it into a small you know

2681
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:33,439
documentary or a short film kind of

2682
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,960
thing and show it to other people

2683
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:36,879
because

2684
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,679
um i mean showing is always you know

2685
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,039
better than telling so we we covered

2686
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:43,679
that and

2687
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,600
you know i myself didn't really know a

2688
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:48,399
lot about it even though because i live

2689
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,520
in i live near kashmir you know so we

2690
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:52,079
often get

2691
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,159
uh get that here i mean we we get that

2692
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:56,399
kind of hash here but we never tried to

2693
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:58,479
redeem and you know reconcile

2694
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:00,638
what this is and why would this hash be

2695
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:02,479
like this and you know there's so many

2696
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,319
other things that could be thought of

2697
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,799
so when i was there it was happening in

2698
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,639
front of me and i was able to see the

2699
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,480
entire process i was even like asking

2700
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,719
them the things that i could not uh you

2701
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:15,198
know readily understand

2702
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:17,279
so what this process is it's very

2703
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:18,960
interesting it's a mix of you know a few

2704
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,880
cultural phenomena

2705
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,880
a few techniques which are apparently

2706
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,159
not from kashmir has been brought you

2707
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,400
know from other countries like

2708
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:28,479
afghanistan and then you have

2709
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,719
a few things happening which are really

2710
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:31,919
really local to that place

2711
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,319
so

2712
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,760
how people usually go about it so

2713
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:40,799
this is happening mostly in srinagar in

2714
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,400
the southern kashmir region okay so

2715
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,639
northern kashmir they're not doing it so

2716
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:46,638
much because it's really wet out there

2717
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:49,359
in sudden kashmir what they do is they

2718
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:50,560
don't have a farm population of cannabis

2719
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,319
out there so

2720
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,760
they would just go during the season and

2721
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:55,519
as soon as they find a good plant they

2722
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,119
break it they break it and they leave it

2723
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,639
there they break it they leave it there

2724
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:00,000
and they mark the plants they remember

2725
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:02,079
where i broke the plants and i have to

2726
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,800
go back to those places

2727
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:06,880
after a few days uh or a few weeks they

2728
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,480
would go back with a big polythene and

2729
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:11,119
they would you know then collect all of

2730
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:12,638
the material that's on those plants and

2731
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:14,559
just bring it back to a place where

2732
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:17,279
they're going to you know go about the

2733
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,560
rest of the process and

2734
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:20,960
the first thing that is done is they

2735
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,880
just spread it out in the sun let it dry

2736
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,399
let the material dry completely in case

2737
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,639
there is some water

2738
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:28,638
uh you know some moisture in it once

2739
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:31,359
it's completely dried um they just

2740
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:33,840
simply go about how people usually or

2741
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:36,960
traditionally dry safe they take a

2742
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,639
uh they take a cloth and you tie it over

2743
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,480
a plastic

2744
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:42,319
sort of like what do you call that

2745
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:44,638
plastic sort of tub

2746
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,158
and then they just you know see the dry

2747
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,079
material over that

2748
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:49,359
you know pile after pile and the resin

2749
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:51,279
is collected

2750
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:52,719
in the tub so that process is pretty

2751
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:54,639
much i mean

2752
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,399
similar to what you see in places like

2753
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:59,440
afghanistan and pakistan and i'm pretty

2754
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:01,679
sure this process has come from there

2755
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,479
but the interesting part and the part

2756
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:06,719
that is not seen or heard anywhere else

2757
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:09,359
is what happens after that i mean they

2758
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:11,920
don't actually stop there so what they

2759
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:14,079
usually do is they they take that dry

2760
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,560
seed resin and they will make it into a

2761
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:20,000
ball i mean they of course just press it

2762
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,639
into a you know ball like thing inside a

2763
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,840
plastic and they would let it sit and

2764
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:28,560
you know cure a little bit so that

2765
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,560
those lipids and you know

2766
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,480
cannabinoids can be you know separated

2767
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,320
and would be easy for it to you know

2768
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:36,559
process it later i mean not that they're

2769
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:38,639
thinking in those ways but it's usually

2770
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,960
what happens when you're curing it

2771
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,239
now after a few months if you're doing

2772
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,639
it properly then you would do it after a

2773
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,399
few months if you're like um you know a

2774
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,560
youngster from srinagar who's just

2775
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:50,399
trying to you know make some hash they

2776
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,320
usually do it the same day

2777
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:55,759
so on that particular day they did it

2778
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:58,559
the same way they took the hat and

2779
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:00,560
you need uh corn wraps

2780
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,000
you know the corn husk

2781
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,280
and they need to be dried and they need

2782
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,039
to be cleaned

2783
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:07,439
uh before you're going to put resin

2784
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,600
inside them so what they do is they take

2785
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,158
the dry seed resin and they completely

2786
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,800
you know smuff them just fill them up

2787
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:17,679
and tie it very tightly you know bound

2788
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,360
it in a way around it with a thread

2789
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:22,239
then they would put a cloth over it

2790
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:24,319
which is a little wet or rather wet and

2791
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:26,559
then they would wound it again

2792
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,158
uh with you know some kind of thread and

2793
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,320
they would light a fire and they are

2794
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:32,079
thrown into the fire like directly to

2795
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:34,000
the fire now this fire is not being

2796
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:36,079
controlled you have no idea what

2797
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,920
temperature what temperature it is on

2798
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:41,039
you have no idea what temperature your

2799
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:43,359
hash is going to go up and down to

2800
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,279
and it's just all

2801
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:47,519
a matter of experience from that point

2802
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:49,519
onwards i mean once you throw that uh

2803
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,119
you know little thingy into the fire

2804
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,560
then you just have to know when to take

2805
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,000
it out and just beat it into a

2806
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,039
snake-like shape

2807
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,439
which they do later on and if you're

2808
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:02,319
late then it'll be all burnt and if you

2809
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:04,719
do it early then it's just gonna be a

2810
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,799
really messed up thing which is not uh

2811
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:09,279
you know properly homogenous but if you

2812
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,800
do it just right and you let everything

2813
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,679
just go to a lick

2814
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,239
to a liquefied form but at the same time

2815
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:18,158
you bring it out and not let those

2816
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:20,079
cannabinoids and terpenes degrade to a

2817
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:21,839
level that it won't even make you high

2818
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:23,600
then you can do a perfect job because

2819
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,719
once it cools down it comes out of the

2820
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,039
fire

2821
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:29,520
it is perfectly homogenized because you

2822
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:31,519
break it open and you look at the layers

2823
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,080
i mean that tells the story i mean

2824
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,480
pretty much that how well it's done

2825
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:38,880
so it's a very unique process but what i

2826
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,879
really felt uh i mean because somebody

2827
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,039
asked me a question that why would they

2828
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,279
do it what would make them

2829
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:46,800
uh do such a thing why could they just

2830
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:48,880
not cure it like they would do in

2831
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,480
pakistan and afghanistan would they just

2832
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,800
like you know pack it and store it and

2833
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:54,319
you know leave it for months on end

2834
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,520
well there's a good answer for that

2835
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:57,039
because you know

2836
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,560
you are in kashmir i mean this is not

2837
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:03,039
pakistan or afghanistan and uh you know

2838
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,880
things and the culture has been so much

2839
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:08,960
different and you know smoking hash is

2840
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:09,760
not seen something you know particularly

2841
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,198
good

2842
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,440
so

2843
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:15,359
these people have a pressure to not only

2844
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:18,158
harvest these plants but at the same

2845
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:21,839
time process them and process them fast

2846
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:24,000
in a way or get get it to a form where

2847
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,400
it does not smell a lot but it still

2848
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,439
gets you high and it's ready to go

2849
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,519
from the day one you make it and i i

2850
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:33,279
think because the decarboxylation

2851
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,560
process is happening you know while

2852
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:37,198
you're heating it

2853
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,920
and you're just speeding up you know

2854
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,599
that curing process although it's very

2855
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,960
rough and you shouldn't be doing it i

2856
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,079
mean because

2857
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,600
you're just gonna end up you know

2858
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,319
burning a lot of

2859
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:50,800
cannabinoids and especially terpenes but

2860
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:53,840
that's the only way these people know

2861
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:56,480
and when they do it actually well it

2862
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:59,119
comes out beautiful and it's like

2863
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:01,759
nothing else that you've ever had and as

2864
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:05,118
a matter of fact when i met bodhi in

2865
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:08,480
allahabad uh you know in 2019 january

2866
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:11,679
i was able to bring some of the ash from

2867
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,718
kashmir which was in the powder form

2868
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:15,440
and

2869
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:18,239
some hash which was then made into this

2870
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:19,599
you know this cornhurst cache big dash

2871
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:21,118
and then i also

2872
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,440
got some which my friend you know

2873
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:25,279
archaic serpent had pressed in the

2874
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:26,399
modern ways with some heat and you know

2875
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:27,439
pressure

2876
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:28,638
so

2877
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,519
yeah i mean

2878
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,440
it's a good question you asked but um we

2879
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,679
don't really understand i mean what

2880
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:38,079
drives the whole thing why they do it

2881
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,600
this way or not any other way but there

2882
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:42,000
certainly seems to be a cultural

2883
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,079
pressure and the way things have been

2884
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,079
evolving in that place that they have an

2885
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:47,600
urgency to process everything quickly

2886
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,600
and just

2887
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,039
get it to a condensed state which is

2888
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,600
easy to hide

2889
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:53,600
and everything

2890
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:57,920
yeah of course makes sense you know

2891
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:00,559
different historical situation they're

2892
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,800
going to do things a bit differently so

2893
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,239
kind of in that same vein of historical

2894
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,079
things i noticed in one of your posts

2895
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:08,959
you were talking about how sugarcane and

2896
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:10,800
cannabis have a very intertwined history

2897
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,279
and you go on to talk about how it was

2898
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,960
kind of transported by a lot of slaves

2899
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:17,840
that were a part of the european

2900
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,118
colonialist kind of settlements would

2901
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,639
you be able to just talk a little bit

2902
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:22,000
about that that's a really interesting

2903
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,880
point i think

2904
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,319
yeah of course i mean uh i mean if you

2905
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,079
look at all the varieties which are

2906
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:29,759
going in west indies i mean when i say

2907
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,238
west indies so let me just make this

2908
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:34,800
clear i'm speaking of caribbean islands

2909
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:36,718
so in india we usually do not say

2910
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,880
caribbean or caribbean islands we refer

2911
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,480
to them as west indies

2912
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,319
or western these islands

2913
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:44,079
so when you look at the west indies

2914
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,079
islands and you know and i'm just going

2915
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:47,920
to speak about those places there are so

2916
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:49,760
many other places that could also share

2917
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,840
the same history

2918
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,760
but we're just not sure of them so i'm

2919
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,440
only going to speak about them

2920
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,440
the cannabis varieties which are growing

2921
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:58,638
there and i'm not aware of the many

2922
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:00,719
which are

2923
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:03,039
uh they seem to be

2924
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,760
uh you know a product

2925
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,439
of

2926
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,360
uh you know history you know what

2927
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:09,599
happened in history because

2928
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:11,198
when we had uh you know the colonial

2929
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,480
colonial rule from you know the

2930
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,799
britishers

2931
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,799
so of course you know they had just

2932
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,960
figured out that hey you know what the

2933
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,119
sugar that is so expensive back in

2934
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,679
europe and it's almost like a luxury

2935
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:24,719
like every goddamn person is eating here

2936
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,359
i mean the

2937
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:29,198
guy who doesn't have anything on him can

2938
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,599
still have some sugar

2939
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:33,519
so they thought uh you know what they

2940
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,239
need to do is they need to

2941
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:38,560
produce it a lot more so then they could

2942
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,319
make it abundantly you know available in

2943
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,719
their country in their region as well so

2944
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:45,599
everyone can enjoy it and

2945
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,118
rightly so so they started uh i mean of

2946
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,480
course doing the surveys and they

2947
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:50,399
understood this is a crop that would

2948
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:51,519
grow in tropical regions or sub-tropical

2949
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:53,279
regions

2950
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,800
and they started looking for those

2951
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,439
places and it just so happens at the

2952
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,039
same time they i mean they had colonies

2953
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:00,559
uh the west indian islands and they

2954
01:40:59,039 --> 01:41:02,158
thought wow this is this is a perfect

2955
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,239
place and these are islands you know we

2956
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,920
could just bring slave from you know

2957
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:06,879
these places and put them here and make

2958
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,359
them grow

2959
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,279
sugar cane and you know just

2960
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,118
yeah i mean things really went in

2961
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:14,479
history you know

2962
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,238
so what they did was they got some

2963
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:18,238
people from africa and some people from

2964
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:20,079
india which both were their con

2965
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:22,479
colonies at that point in time and you

2966
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:24,559
know they put them there in west indian

2967
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:26,638
island and said hey you know what go

2968
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,719
ahead and just you know do our thing

2969
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,480
here the farms they already had the farm

2970
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,079
set up and they started working there

2971
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:35,759
but just imagine this these people are

2972
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:36,639
being taken on the ship so it was only

2973
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,719
uh

2974
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:40,319
you know it only made sense to these

2975
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:42,239
people that you know we're not coming

2976
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,000
back so we have to take everything with

2977
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:46,079
us that you know we like to do on a

2978
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,520
daily basis and cannabis seems to be one

2979
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:49,519
of those things

2980
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,080
and this is a fact because we know that

2981
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,760
because if you go back into the

2982
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:57,118
you know the british commission report

2983
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,199
that they did on hemp and drugs i i i

2984
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:02,238
don't remember the name exactly but

2985
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:04,479
there's a report that was published by

2986
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:05,759
the britishers about the indian about

2987
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:07,678
the use of

2988
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,440
cannabis in india and the cultural

2989
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,199
effects and the

2990
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:12,000
physical effects as well

2991
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:14,158
so

2992
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,920
that tells us that uh you know even

2993
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:18,079
before that uh

2994
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,719
there was a widespread use of cannabis

2995
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:22,399
in india so we know that these people

2996
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,920
took these seeds along with them to the

2997
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,359
west indian islands and they started

2998
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,158
growing it

2999
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:28,719
and

3000
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:31,039
you know uh those seeds are in those

3001
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,560
varieties readily acclimatized to those

3002
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:33,359
region because

3003
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,039
why

3004
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:37,118
the whole reason they were brought to

3005
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,719
west indian islands was because

3006
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:40,880
the temperature and the climate was

3007
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,880
pretty similar to that of where they

3008
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,760
were living in south india so most of

3009
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:48,159
these uh you know um slaves were taken

3010
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,400
taken from southern india and uh very

3011
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:52,238
rarely from northern india

3012
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:54,079
so uh the cannabis varieties that they

3013
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:55,759
brought with them just readily took off

3014
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:57,439
and over time i'm sure they must have

3015
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,800
adapted in few different ways i've never

3016
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:00,158
been there so i don't know what they

3017
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,520
look like or

3018
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:05,118
any idea anyway so uh that's the

3019
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,440
connection between them and you know

3020
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:09,439
even you could just see the same thing

3021
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:11,678
happening in the people as well because

3022
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:12,719
they got people from africa and india so

3023
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,560
you had

3024
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,800
people in africa

3025
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,400
uh you know who were like turned into

3026
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,400
christians

3027
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,000
okay earlier when they were in africa

3028
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:25,118
and then you had indians who were just

3029
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,600
hindus so now you have people in west

3030
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:29,599
indies right now who have

3031
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,520
a lot of people they have very weird

3032
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:34,079
names which are half english and of

3033
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,159
hindi like shiv narayan chandra paul

3034
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:39,679
they have a ball in their name they have

3035
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:41,839
shiva they have chandra and or

3036
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,560
there's just so many examples you know

3037
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,039
so

3038
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:47,360
you just see the cultural amalgamation

3039
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:50,639
and you know the way history played out

3040
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:53,679
in in in people and in their names and

3041
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:55,760
in their languages and you know the

3042
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:58,158
plant that they grow there

3043
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,239
so yeah they have they sure can and

3044
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,079
cannabis go back a very very long time

3045
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:05,279
in fact

3046
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:06,880
wow okay and so do you think that this

3047
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:08,319
is kind of a bit of a two-parter but do

3048
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,118
you think that

3049
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:12,000
given many people consider some of these

3050
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:14,880
um

3051
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,118
islands to have their own kind of native

3052
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,800
land race do you think that that's proof

3053
01:44:17,118 --> 01:44:20,799
that it only takes you know a couple

3054
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,960
hundred years for a land race to

3055
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,719
readjust and become a whole new land

3056
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:26,800
race

3057
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,800
uh yeah because see land race is a very

3058
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,039
uh broad term again i mean it could

3059
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,600
cover it could basically cover a lot of

3060
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:35,760
uh things right so if you go just by the

3061
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,079
word definition it says that any uh

3062
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,920
domestic uh any traditionally

3063
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:41,679
domesticated variety

3064
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,760
at a certain you know geographical

3065
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,920
locale right but

3066
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:48,159
at the same time there are plants which

3067
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,399
were not domesticated which were there

3068
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:52,479
even before we have we were there and we

3069
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:54,399
know that for a fact this the plans have

3070
01:44:52,479 --> 01:44:55,599
been before us like way before us when

3071
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:57,679
we came here

3072
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,639
so how do we account for those varieties

3073
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,440
so

3074
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,679
those are the primordial land races but

3075
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:05,118
yes if you if you're saying about if

3076
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,279
you're talking about the regional land

3077
01:45:05,118 --> 01:45:09,839
race varieties which which i think would

3078
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:10,639
be a more appropriate term to use here

3079
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,319
uh

3080
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:17,199
yes that happens in as uh in as small of

3081
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:19,359
a time as 200 to 100 years you can see

3082
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:21,039
these plant varieties evolve and just

3083
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:22,639
become completely different varieties

3084
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:24,880
because of the selective environmental

3085
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:26,719
pressure and of course human beings are

3086
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,440
just all around this plant all the time

3087
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,880
so

3088
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:31,279
you really have to track all the

3089
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,118
activities and understand their culture

3090
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:34,479
for you to really uh you know paint a

3091
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:36,158
picture that what could have happened

3092
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:37,359
with this plant for it to become like

3093
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:39,039
this today

3094
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:40,799
and once you understand their culture

3095
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:42,000
and you understand the environment and

3096
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,920
the history

3097
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
i mean you can just paint a very

3098
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,319
comprehensive picture that how things

3099
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,079
came to be and that just that might just

3100
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:53,359
also give you a theme

3101
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:55,198
or an uh insight into you know how

3102
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:56,880
a cannabis plant basically adapts to

3103
01:45:55,198 --> 01:45:59,599
different terroirs

3104
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:01,520
and i mean we just need a lot more data

3105
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,800
and a lot more studying from a lot more

3106
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,960
people but

3107
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,760
i mean uh this is not something that you

3108
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:09,840
know cannot be done

3109
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,920
yeah certainly so

3110
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,440
i mean this is a bit of a weird idea

3111
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,199
i've had but i'd love to hear your

3112
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:18,158
thoughts on it but basically i'm

3113
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:20,799
wondering if you've ever noticed that in

3114
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:22,799
areas where historically cannabis was

3115
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,560
grown with other crops like maybe say

3116
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,400
maize or sugarcane like they were kind

3117
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,719
of grown in the same general area maybe

3118
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:31,359
even the same field have you ever

3119
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:34,158
noticed that maybe those plants have

3120
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,759
increased ipm because what i kind of

3121
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:38,559
wonder is like

3122
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:40,719
where these two crops be at corn maze

3123
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:43,280
and cannabis were they ever grown side

3124
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:45,279
by side because maybe they benefited

3125
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:49,118
each other in an ipm sense or have you

3126
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:51,439
never really seen much like that sorry

3127
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:54,799
um as far as the ipm is concerned i

3128
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:57,039
think it's it might be the other way

3129
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,039
around because uh even if you look at

3130
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:01,359
the plants which are of the same family

3131
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:03,118
like the canopy family

3132
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,719
uh you look at sticking nettle i mean

3133
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:05,920
nettles are of the same family as

3134
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:08,319
cannabis

3135
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:09,920
so you you do see that those both of

3136
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:12,399
those plants are you know getting

3137
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:16,000
affected by similar pests

3138
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:17,039
and uh but but that really uh

3139
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,960
i mean but

3140
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:21,118
that's not a thing like because cannabis

3141
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,639
plant was there that's why the pest must

3142
01:47:21,118 --> 01:47:24,639
have gotten onto the nettle plant or

3143
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:26,880
because the nettle plant was there

3144
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:29,359
they made it the vector to ultimately

3145
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:32,480
reach you know the cannabis plant but i

3146
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:34,238
i think the way it really works uh for a

3147
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:37,198
lot of other crops that grows along with

3148
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:39,678
it like maize and you know you could say

3149
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:42,000
wheat or even potatoes

3150
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:44,158
that they may have certain benefit in

3151
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,760
terms of like you know fixing nitrogen

3152
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:48,000
or something of that sort

3153
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,239
but as far as ibm is concerned they do

3154
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,158
not because you know cannabis as we know

3155
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:53,759
is one of the plant that produces

3156
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:55,359
aromatic compounds

3157
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,119
and some of the plants that we're

3158
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:59,198
talking about are like

3159
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:01,279
potato maize and all that they just do

3160
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:03,519
not produce aromatic compounds like

3161
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:06,238
cannabis so

3162
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:07,600
they they just do not have the kind of

3163
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:10,158
uh you know

3164
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,600
protection against the pests and

3165
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:14,238
you know other

3166
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:17,440
uh insects as cannabis as a plant has so

3167
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:19,198
maybe cannabis provides them security

3168
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:20,559
from the past but again i don't know

3169
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:22,559
i've never looked into that never

3170
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,760
thought of it but definitely a great

3171
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,960
thought i'm going to make a note of it

3172
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,960
right now

3173
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:29,520
and you know next this year when i go

3174
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:32,079
out i will try to look for that i will

3175
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:35,199
try to look for some uh some conclusive

3176
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:37,359
data that could uh you know show clearly

3177
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:38,879
what what's happening uh whether you

3178
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:40,799
know cannabis is helping the other

3179
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,239
plants you know

3180
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,840
uh

3181
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:45,439
not get a lot of pests or actually

3182
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,039
they're using it as a vector to get on

3183
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:49,039
to the other plant so

3184
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:51,760
i'll try to collect data and definitely

3185
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:53,519
get back to you this year

3186
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,520
yeah awesome thanks so thanks so much

3187
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,280
for that um

3188
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,960
now let's move on to

3189
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:01,519
some viewers from our questions that we

3190
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:03,760
had submitted just a couple hours ago

3191
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:05,199
and we got some good ones and so the

3192
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,079
first one i think it's going to be a

3193
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:09,678
little hard but um first question is do

3194
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:12,079
you think there will be a time in the

3195
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:14,719
near future where americans will be able

3196
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:17,039
to travel through the farms of pakistan

3197
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:19,198
and afghanistan

3198
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:20,960
i mean they're doing right now so

3199
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,519
i mean i i don't really understand that

3200
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,118
question uh basically because people are

3201
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,400
doing right now it's only a matter of

3202
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:28,479
finances

3203
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:29,920
and it's only a matter of courage

3204
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:31,519
because see

3205
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,880
nobody's going to stop an american from

3206
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,719
getting a visa for pakistan or

3207
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,480
afghanistan i mean if anything it's the

3208
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,560
other way around it's hard to get a get

3209
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,559
an american or a european or australian

3210
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,239
visa for people who are in asian

3211
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:45,039
countries especially india pakistan

3212
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:47,359
afghanistan right so i think it's only a

3213
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:50,238
matter of

3214
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:52,399
courage and resources i guess you can go

3215
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:53,839
there and you can roam around i mean

3216
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:55,759
i've certainly seen a couple of french

3217
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:57,679
guys you know who were there they took

3218
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:00,159
some pictures got some seed for some of

3219
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:01,440
the european seed banks recently

3220
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:04,399
so

3221
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:06,719
but if you're maybe referring to it in a

3222
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:08,559
way that when things would legalize then

3223
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,639
i'm not sure if things are going to

3224
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,000
legalize very very soon but

3225
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:14,159
we don't know what's going to happen in

3226
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,880
future and all we can do is just stay

3227
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:18,799
hopeful that it does happen and you know

3228
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:21,039
everybody could be out in the open and

3229
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,719
you know flaunt their read on instagram

3230
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:24,880
without having to fear about you know

3231
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:27,279
getting abjected or you know

3232
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:29,039
taken into custody

3233
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:31,439
yeah of course

3234
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:34,000
uh so the next question is have you ever

3235
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:35,759
found any land races that kind of have a

3236
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,158
strawberry smell to them and

3237
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:40,960
specifically any pakistanis with the

3238
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:42,158
strawberry smell

3239
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,639
i have

3240
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:46,719
smelled a few plants in

3241
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:49,599
highland regions which is around

3242
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:52,158
uttarakhand and himachal pradesh they

3243
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:54,639
had a distinct smell of strawberry but

3244
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:57,519
they were just one odd plant

3245
01:50:54,639 --> 01:51:00,000
which were growing in a very variable

3246
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,440
population so i didn't really think of

3247
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,118
you know getting those seeds and didn't

3248
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:06,238
really think that it's going to help me

3249
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:07,198
you know get to that terpene profile

3250
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:09,759
uh

3251
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:12,399
but if you talk about pakistani i'm

3252
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:15,760
gonna say no because most of that stuff

3253
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:19,439
is like really uh accurate and you know

3254
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:22,000
um spicy and like dalwin like smell like

3255
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:24,000
phenol like smell do you you guys use do

3256
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,359
you guys use like a disinfectant it's

3257
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,520
called itol

3258
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:30,399
and it has that phenol yeah it has that

3259
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,800
phenols phenol smell in it and you you

3260
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:34,559
get that a lot and always smell that

3261
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,639
comes from the whitener you know the

3262
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,480
correction whitener people even you know

3263
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:41,199
use it to get high sometimes

3264
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:43,359
and so those uh

3265
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:45,279
those uh smells

3266
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:47,359
are pretty uh you know pretty often

3267
01:51:45,279 --> 01:51:50,079
found in pakistani varieties but i think

3268
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:52,158
there was one balochistani variety which

3269
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:54,479
came from our balochistani friend that

3270
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:56,479
he claims has apples and strawberry like

3271
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:58,959
smell now i haven't started growing them

3272
01:51:56,479 --> 01:52:02,718
yet so i'm not gonna go ahead

3273
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:04,800
and say if yes or no but we'll see but i

3274
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:07,439
have complete faith because uh we're not

3275
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:10,159
talking about a cross-pollinated

3276
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:11,759
uh you know uh population here these are

3277
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:13,359
the plants which

3278
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,840
have been you know

3279
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:18,158
selectively inbred by

3280
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,000
by the fam by the family itself and they

3281
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:21,920
keep it within the family

3282
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,840
so i mean if he's specifically pointing

3283
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,679
towards you know strawberry and

3284
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:27,599
apple and they seem to have a very good

3285
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,960
understanding towards the flavors

3286
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,400
because they're eating so many different

3287
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,319
fruits over there

3288
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:35,279
so i think i'll trust him and we'll see

3289
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:36,639
if uh you know it does come out exactly

3290
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:39,198
like strawberry i mean that would be

3291
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:41,679
amazing because i've never had anything

3292
01:52:39,198 --> 01:52:42,879
uh that is like even close to the

3293
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,520
strawberry

3294
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,440
and and that's kind of i wanted to ask

3295
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:48,960
in fact i wanted to ask you a question

3296
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:51,359
and i asked that question to everyone

3297
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,359
that i speak of from you know

3298
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,839
from the western society that

3299
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:57,920
it's it's the smells that people talk

3300
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,679
about i mean often people talking about

3301
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:02,079
like smells like banana and people are

3302
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:04,158
talking about smell like rubber

3303
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:06,158
and i've never smelled those

3304
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:08,238
uh things on plants i mean never smelled

3305
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:10,000
a plant that was exactly like a banana

3306
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:12,718
or like exactly like

3307
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,719
rubber so could you maybe tell me i'm

3308
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:16,880
sorry i'm but i'm just curious i want to

3309
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:20,158
know i mean are there plants that really

3310
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:22,159
actually smell straight up like that

3311
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:24,879
yeah that's a really good question so in

3312
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:27,759
terms of the banana one i've smelled the

3313
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:30,319
popular clone only banana oh g and stuff

3314
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:33,599
like that in the states it smells like a

3315
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:36,158
candy banana not like a real banana so i

3316
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:37,679
can understand why you would say i've

3317
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,158
never smelled anything like banana

3318
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,599
because i think the reality is no one's

3319
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:44,000
really smelled anything that smells like

3320
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:46,400
an actual banana but people have smelled

3321
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,079
things that smells like a candy banana

3322
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:50,559
which is just probably like

3323
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,479
two or three of the main terpenes that

3324
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,560
come out of a banana but obviously not a

3325
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:55,678
full spectrum picture of what it

3326
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,760
actually is

3327
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,599
and then in terms of the rubber one

3328
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,440
i hear people say that all the time but

3329
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,599
i myself have never smelt anything that

3330
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:05,439
smells like rubber i think maybe it's

3331
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:07,520
just a general term people use to

3332
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:09,118
describe a more accurate

3333
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,000
maybe kind of

3334
01:54:09,118 --> 01:54:12,479
um

3335
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,679
yeah like offensive smell but yeah i

3336
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:15,439
would agree with you if we're going to

3337
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:17,199
be very strict about it i've never

3338
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:20,079
smelled anything that smells like a real

3339
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:21,598
banana or like real burnt rubber

3340
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:23,679
okay because i was really curious about

3341
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:25,599
that i had a word with

3342
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:27,199
um again i don't know his name and i'm

3343
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:29,920
really bad with this i don't ask

3344
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:31,519
people's name um pip sweet you must know

3345
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,679
him he must be your friend

3346
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,960
yeah yeah yeah i like peeps

3347
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:36,719
he's an amazing guy i mean i've been

3348
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,359
speaking to him for

3349
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:41,118
uh you know some time now and you know

3350
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,039
i was really interested because he had

3351
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:45,118
this uh variety that's called rubber

3352
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:47,519
city and i just you know asked him does

3353
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:49,759
that really actually smells like rubber

3354
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:52,159
and i think what he said was really

3355
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,920
interesting because i think he said uh

3356
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:54,719
pretty much similar to what you said

3357
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:56,880
that

3358
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:58,800
well it's not exactly

3359
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,960
you know closing your eyes and you know

3360
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,520
that you would be able to imagine rubber

3361
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,439
like smell but it's more like an oniony

3362
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:08,480
offensive smell that

3363
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:10,960
could you know at times be

3364
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:13,439
uh you know felt like it is coming off

3365
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:14,960
as a bunt rubber so you know i had to

3366
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:17,039
get a pack from him and you know i'm

3367
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,399
just going to grow and see

3368
01:55:17,039 --> 01:55:21,760
you know what exactly it's like i'm

3369
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:23,598
really curious so i really want to see

3370
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:25,440
yeah yeah that's that's an interesting

3371
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,599
one i mean i've got a little follow-up

3372
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:30,158
question for that do you have any issues

3373
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:32,639
getting seeds in from like america or

3374
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:35,039
the eu

3375
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:37,039
seeds uh i mean like getting seeds from

3376
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:38,880
america to india yeah yeah like if

3377
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:40,399
people send you stuff do you ever really

3378
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,920
have any issues with it or it usually

3379
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:44,399
always makes it

3380
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,840
no no issues at all i mean india is very

3381
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,598
very cool i mean especially if it's

3382
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,000
coming from america or europe australia

3383
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:52,480
new zealand i mean these great countries

3384
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,238
i mean we just don't really bother about

3385
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:56,399
that yeah if i'm getting seats from

3386
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:59,039
pakistan afghanistan that's when we

3387
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:02,158
really tend to have issues

3388
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:03,599
yeah understandable okay well uh the

3389
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:05,759
next question i think is a really good

3390
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:08,000
one and the person says what is one of

3391
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,119
the land races that you that you've

3392
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,560
experienced i guess we should say

3393
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:12,238
regional cultivars if we're going to be

3394
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:13,679
correct um

3395
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:15,598
that you've found that you would

3396
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:17,199
recommend for like kind of a home grower

3397
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,639
who's just looking to start out with a

3398
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:20,799
land race they don't want anything

3399
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:22,319
that's going to get too unruly or really

3400
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,679
out of control like just to help them

3401
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,840
get their feet wet what would you

3402
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:28,239
recommend

3403
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,920
that's an amazing question because we i

3404
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:31,919
think about it all the time because i

3405
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,158
mean as much as i want to you know

3406
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:37,279
motivate other people and talk about

3407
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:38,079
preservation the ground reality is is

3408
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:39,920
that

3409
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:41,439
people have responsibilities and people

3410
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,520
have to feed their families and they

3411
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:45,839
have to you know manage their space and

3412
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:47,679
do other work as well right and that's

3413
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,520
what life is all about so

3414
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,000
in order to strike balance uh there has

3415
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:55,040
to be some varieties you know who

3416
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,198
would let you preserve a land race

3417
01:56:55,039 --> 01:57:00,079
variety or an heirloom variety or like a

3418
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:01,839
regional variety but at the same time it

3419
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:03,599
will not bother you

3420
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:06,159
a lot that it would interfere with you

3421
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:08,400
know your work let's just for an example

3422
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:10,079
let's say you're you only have 110 which

3423
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:12,559
is 4x4

3424
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:15,279
and you're going some og cushion there

3425
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:18,000
and you have kerala gold

3426
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:19,759
it's it's going to grow really wide and

3427
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,319
tall and eventually you would be forced

3428
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:24,400
to lift your lights up but your og kush

3429
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,158
may not grow that tall and then it would

3430
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:28,238
have to be you know lifted up or you

3431
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:30,158
would have to do some kind of makeshift

3432
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:32,238
arrangement so it will be a constant

3433
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:34,879
improvising you know which is not really

3434
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:37,039
a big problem though but everybody's not

3435
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,400
does not have the kind of schedule to be

3436
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:40,158
in their

3437
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:41,519
you know grow room all the time and do

3438
01:57:40,158 --> 01:57:43,920
these adjustments

3439
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,840
so i think uh as we discussed earlier

3440
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,079
the pakistani varieties are perfect i

3441
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,480
mean they bring you know both uh the

3442
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:51,920
best of the both were you know the

3443
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:54,479
narrow slim leaf and you know the

3444
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:56,800
broadleaf varieties in a way that is

3445
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:58,158
just unparalleled and

3446
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,480
again they they

3447
01:57:58,158 --> 01:58:02,079
the the variety and the variation is

3448
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:04,559
still there nobody has selected it for

3449
01:58:02,079 --> 01:58:07,198
anything specifically so you can pretty

3450
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:09,199
much you know turn your magic on them so

3451
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:11,118
swabi would be one of those things one

3452
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:13,279
of those varieties i mean it has an

3453
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:15,439
amazing high amazing height for a

3454
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:18,079
variety you know that

3455
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:20,158
that people have not heard of so much

3456
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:22,719
and it's very easy to grow i'm going to

3457
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:25,839
say that and you know it's not going to

3458
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:27,359
get uh you know all unruly and it's not

3459
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,639
going to become like a swamp monster

3460
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:30,000
inside your tent you'll be able to

3461
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,880
control it

3462
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,238
uh

3463
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:37,118
so i think just you know keep an eye out

3464
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:38,799
for that swabby lines that's gonna come

3465
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:39,759
out he's uh mass medical is gonna you

3466
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,400
know

3467
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:43,920
release them pure in the long flowering

3468
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:45,519
and the short flowering version and i'm

3469
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,679
sure he'll be working on some hybrids

3470
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:49,679
that's like his thing but

3471
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:51,679
yeah those would be really good options

3472
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:54,158
to pounce on to if people just want to

3473
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:56,960
get into and not really get into very

3474
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:58,799
deep waters straight away this is this

3475
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:00,639
is a great way to get a taste of it and

3476
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,480
not get into trouble

3477
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:04,319
yeah what a great answer

3478
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:05,678
so the next question we have from our

3479
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:08,639
viewer is

3480
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:10,560
how do you know babaco

3481
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,039
okay that uh that's very interesting

3482
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:16,400
story because uh initially i i met him

3483
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:18,960
over the instagram i came across uh his

3484
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:20,879
account and but i never really did send

3485
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:23,359
him any message because

3486
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,679
that's usually how we were not working i

3487
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,439
mean we were we had like stopped sending

3488
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:29,359
messages to random people and you know

3489
01:59:27,439 --> 01:59:30,879
getting random seeds from them so we

3490
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:33,598
were kind of like traveling out to

3491
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,800
places more working more like that

3492
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,639
so um

3493
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,760
at the same time uh

3494
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:39,760
i had a

3495
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:42,000
you know i had a friend in delhi

3496
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,840
you know who's basically a south indian

3497
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,840
but he was in delhi at that point in

3498
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:47,119
time and he was also

3499
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,639
following him

3500
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:50,319
uh somehow i don't know what the

3501
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:53,440
connection was basically

3502
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,479
but uh baba he came to india because uh

3503
01:59:53,439 --> 01:59:56,319
you know

3504
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:57,839
i'm not gonna go into the details of his

3505
01:59:56,319 --> 01:59:59,920
affair because he was there for some

3506
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:01,440
kind of hospital related thing

3507
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,480
uh you know that they have to come

3508
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,079
because they don't have that kind of

3509
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:06,079
services in afghanistan and you know

3510
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:08,158
india just seemed to have

3511
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:10,319
a a little better when it comes to you

3512
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:11,759
know medical services doctors and all so

3513
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:15,039
he was here for that and you know he

3514
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:17,440
wanted to smoke so uh he basically

3515
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,880
called uh you know the guys uh you know

3516
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:20,479
who live in delhi

3517
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,560
guys who are usually doing the balance

3518
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:24,158
stuff and you know they offered to give

3519
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,639
him some hash but i think because it was

3520
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:28,158
very costly so you know he was not sure

3521
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:31,118
whether or not he would get it

3522
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:32,638
so then uh subsequently he contacted me

3523
02:00:31,118 --> 02:00:34,238
and he told me you know hey you know

3524

uh you know if you want seed i could

3547

send you seeds and i told him that you

3548
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,520
know this is what we do we actually take

3549
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,520
seeds from indigenous communities or

3550
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:22,960
farmers directly you know we you know

3551
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:24,400
give them out to other people who need

3552
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,760
it and the best and you know they kind

3553
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:27,759
of pay for it

3554
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,360
and you know that uh

3555
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:30,719
money could be distributed amongst you

3556
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:32,719
know people who are collecting it and

3557
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:34,560
people you know who are connected to the

3558
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:35,679
operation in many different ways as they

3559
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,760
deserve

3560
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:39,760
now he was he was really gay for that

3561
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,440
because you know of course everybody

3562
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:44,320
would need some financial help at the

3563
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:45,118
end of the day and you know i i set up

3564
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:47,198
uh

3565
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:48,799
you know i spoke to these people at full

3566
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:50,079
power selection and told them basically

3567
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,400
you know we're gonna do this and we're

3568
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:53,279
gonna do a pre-order and seeds were on

3569
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:54,879
its way

3570
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:56,960
and next thing you know the seeds get

3571
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,639
busted so seeds didn't make it to india

3572
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:02,158
and this is around this is happening

3573
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:04,239
like beginning of april 2018 okay

3574
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:06,399
i got really nervous i was like i have

3575
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:08,559
to get these seats and again you know

3576
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:10,799
baba told me that hey man i'm game for

3577
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:12,320
this i mean i will do anything you just

3578
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:14,079
tell me what i have to do and i will get

3579
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:15,519
this thing to you i mean

3580
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:17,519
i

3581
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:19,840
absolutely have no problem it's just the

3582
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:22,400
way government you know works

3583
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:24,960
and what we uh you know realize at that

3584
02:02:22,399 --> 02:02:27,679
point in time the only way around it was

3585
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:29,359
to actually get the guy you know

3586
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:31,039
actually fly the guy over to india and

3587
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:33,519
you know ask him to simply just get the

3588
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:35,039
seeds because they're not gonna you know

3589
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:38,080
take it out on the airport because

3590
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:39,039
basically to possess seeds is legal in

3591
02:02:38,079 --> 02:02:41,519
india

3592
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:43,840
because of the you know religious

3593
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:46,400
uh you know things attached to it

3594
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,239
so that's exactly what he did he flew

3595
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:50,000
along with so many different varieties

3596
02:02:48,238 --> 02:02:52,079
and you know we picked him

3597
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,639
we picked them up and came to delhi and

3598
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:56,880
from delhi we got him to you know our

3599
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:59,440
headquarters just somewhere near you

3600
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,599
know punjab shivalik and you know we sat

3601
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:03,839
we spoke i tried to understand the

3602
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:05,119
culture as much as i could because uh

3603
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,719
you know

3604
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:08,079
language is a little bit of problem not

3605
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:09,840
much of a problem because he does

3606
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:10,960
understand hindi you know which is our

3607
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,679
language

3608
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:13,920
and

3609
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:15,679
but i don't seem to really understand

3610
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:18,960
you know the arabic language or the

3611
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:21,199
farsi language that much

3612
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,118
so he speaks english

3613
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:25,279
you know as well not as much but you

3614
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:27,359
know as much as you could he could make

3615
02:03:25,279 --> 02:03:29,359
you understand what he's trying to say

3616
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:31,039
so that was great we we sat there for

3617
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:32,799
about a week and you know we went out to

3618
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:34,880
a few places you know roamed around

3619
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,039
punjab had a good time he gave me the

3620
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,359
seas and then you know we we sent him

3621
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:41,118
back with all due respect and you know

3622
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:43,920
that's where we really started to work

3623
02:03:41,118 --> 02:03:46,079
with those seats and i think i i i did

3624
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,520
get to you know send him like a couple

3625
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:49,439
more times there were a few different

3626
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:52,079
varieties i went ahead and documented

3627
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:53,039
those varieties for him you know so that

3628
02:03:52,078 --> 02:03:54,960
you know that

3629
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,198
so not just seeds but information could

3630
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:58,719
also become you know available to people

3631
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:00,479
so that when they're growing it and if

3632
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:02,319
they see something peculiar they can

3633
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:04,799
fall back to that cultural historical

3634
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:06,799
geographical data and see if that has

3635
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:09,520
any relevance to it i mean that's

3636
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:12,000
basically how the findings are made

3637
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,840
and uh yeah that went on for about a

3638
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,679
year but uh then you know of course we

3639
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:17,119
are a small collective and uh we gotta

3640
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:18,560
understand them in you know full power

3641
02:04:17,118 --> 02:04:21,198
selection even they're just like couple

3642
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:24,159
of my friends so we can send out like a

3643
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:26,000
lot of orders so we we have to we can

3644
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:26,799
only do a limited amount of work but you

3645
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,439
know

3646
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:31,599
uh you know he had a massive amount of

3647
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:34,158
seeds and you know he had so much more

3648
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:35,319
coming in so you know it was only the

3649
02:04:34,158 --> 02:04:36,479
best that you know he

3650
02:04:35,319 --> 02:04:38,319
[Music]

3651
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:40,238
got in contact with you know bigger seat

3652
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:42,799
banks who have the ability to take more

3653
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:44,638
orders and the ability to you know uh

3654
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:46,000
send out more orders readily and you

3655
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:47,679
know that's exactly what he's doing

3656
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,760
which is fabulous and i'm really happy

3657
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:51,760
you know that he's been able to do so

3658
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,520
much for himself and you know all the

3659
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,360
credit is to him i mean like you know

3660
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:56,960
it's it's all been him he collected

3661
02:04:55,359 --> 02:04:59,519
those varieties he understood they need

3662
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:00,960
to preserve he took immense amount of

3663
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,880
risk getting those varieties out to

3664
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,880
these different places so you know i i

3665
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:07,039
have a great amount of respect for

3666
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,359
for him and you know he has

3667
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:10,960
really been a central figure in this

3668
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:12,880
whole movement

3669
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:14,560
and i think i'm i was pretty lucky to

3670
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:16,159
have met him at a certain point in my

3671
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:18,159
life

3672
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:20,319
yeah awesome what a great little recount

3673
02:05:18,158 --> 02:05:21,839
on that introduction so the next

3674
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:24,479
question we had was

3675
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:26,239
what's the single most surprising smell

3676
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:28,238
you've come across from a regional

3677
02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:30,959
cultivar

3678
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:33,118
the single most uh you know

3679
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:35,198
weird or i was a weird smell was there

3680
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:38,399
was this one plant that was growing in

3681
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:41,039
baling valley and it has a smell which

3682
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:42,960
is straight like ammonia like like

3683
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:43,760
hydrogen you know

3684
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,880
uh

3685
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,960
should i say

3686
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:52,000
uh i mean you in india they use a cheap

3687
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:53,920
uh you know derivative that is uh you

3688
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,158
know used to color the hair you know to

3689
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:59,279
bleach your hair as basically uh

3690
02:05:56,158 --> 02:06:02,399
hydrogen i think if i'm not wrong and it

3691
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:03,519
it has that stringent ammonia-like smell

3692
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:05,839
to it

3693
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:08,560
uh right and you know the same smell

3694
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:11,199
that comes from urine as well

3695
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:14,639
because there's ammonia in it so i i

3696
02:06:11,198 --> 02:06:16,879
could smell exactly the straight ammonia

3697
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:19,599
smell from a plant it was a really ugly

3698
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:21,520
plant i have i took a picture of that

3699
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:23,840
and i made a post about that and back in

3700
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,760
2017 if you go down my

3701
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:28,000
uh you know feed you can actually find

3702
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:30,719
that post from 2017 and you can also

3703
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,198
look at the plant it looks weird it does

3704
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:34,719
not look at all like any of the plants

3705
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:37,439
which were growing there

3706
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:38,239
and you know the smell was something i

3707
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:39,759
mean

3708
02:06:38,238 --> 02:06:41,439
it was just

3709
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:43,280
awful i mean

3710
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:45,279
awful in a very good way straight

3711
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:47,198
ammonia

3712
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:49,359
yeah it sounds like you found like the

3713
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:51,439
uh the regional cultivar equivalent of

3714
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:53,759
the roadkill skunk but there you go

3715
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:56,319
we'll have to look more for it so the

3716
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:58,560
next question we had was do you have any

3717
02:06:56,319 --> 02:07:01,198
tips or tricks for people who are trying

3718
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:03,520
to grow high altitude cultivars at sea

3719
02:07:01,198 --> 02:07:03,519
level

3720
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,880
i i don't really think i mean i mean

3721
02:07:07,039 --> 02:07:11,359
given that you know

3722
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:13,760
cannabis as adaptive as adaptive as a

3723
02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:16,158
plant that it is and rightly so it's

3724
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,560
called the weed you know for that reason

3725
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:20,158
um you you never what i've experienced

3726
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:22,000
from my growing and i don't have a lot

3727
02:07:20,158 --> 02:07:23,519
of experience but this is what i'm going

3728
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,479
to tell you from my experience whatever

3729
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,480
i have

3730
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:28,319
that cannabis does not require like very

3731
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:32,319
special things you don't have to make it

3732
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:33,039
so hard on you and you know you grow

3733
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:35,279
and

3734
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,359
if you keep it simple i i pretty much

3735
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:39,118
believe every plant

3736
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:43,198
does pretty much good as long as you're

3737
02:07:39,118 --> 02:07:45,519
growing it in in a 22 degrees to a 26 27

3738
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:47,759
degree celsius range temperature range

3739
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:50,639
and you know relative humidity is

3740
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,239
somewhere around like 50 55 60 and you

3741
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:55,039
know you're you have a decent soil

3742
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:56,559
medium you don't really have to you know

3743
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:59,679
worry about

3744
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:01,679
things at all but on the other hand if

3745
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,560
you are growing an equatorial variety

3746
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:05,920
and you happen to be living in a place

3747
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:07,199
which happens to be higher up in the

3748
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:08,560
latitude that means you can have a

3749
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:11,198
shorter season

3750
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:13,760
uh for flowering so then you have to uh

3751
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:15,678
you know then you have to ensure that

3752
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,840
uh you know either you're working with a

3753
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:20,078
variety that's not going to flower you

3754
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:21,520
know past november or you just have to

3755
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:23,279
grow it indoors

3756
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:25,520
and you know put it into flowering

3757
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:27,519
straight away instead of giving it veg

3758
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:29,679
time because even if you grow those

3759
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,040
equatorials or highland narrow leaf

3760
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:33,039
varieties

3761
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:34,560
you know straight away under 12 to 12

3762
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:37,439
which is basically what induces a

3763
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:39,280
flowering in them they still have go on

3764
02:08:37,439 --> 02:08:42,158
to grow pretty much like four or five

3765
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,679
six feet and if you wet them then i mean

3766
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,399
it's really gonna be a problem if you're

3767
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:46,399
not expecting

3768
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,560
yeah right they just get out of hand all

3769
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:54,560
of a sudden um

3770
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:56,239
cool okay so the final question from our

3771
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,800
viewers that they've submitted is have

3772
02:08:56,238 --> 02:09:02,559
you ever made your way over towards kind

3773
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:05,199
of thailand and down that way

3774
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:06,400
um i have been to burma i mean i have to

3775
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:07,919
uh you know

3776
02:09:06,399 --> 02:09:10,879
you can actually go to burma you know

3777
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:12,880
without a visa and without a passport so

3778
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,880
i've been to burma but i'm planning to

3779
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,279
go down thailand this year and you know

3780
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:19,359
i have a great friend there

3781
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:21,359
they have a beautiful collective you

3782
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:23,198
know they're preserving thai and you

3783
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:24,559
know other land races from you know

3784
02:09:23,198 --> 02:09:26,719
different regions

3785
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:29,039
so i really want to go there meet them i

3786
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:31,439
do have friends in laws as well i have

3787
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:33,599
friends in cambodia as well

3788
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:35,439
and you know i'm really meaning to meet

3789
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:37,679
them because i did get seeds from them

3790
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:39,839
last year and i was able to help them i

3791
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:41,440
was able to you know give back to them

3792
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:43,119
and they were really happy you know that

3793
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:45,598
i told them something and i came through

3794
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:47,598
and you know they kind of trust me with

3795
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:49,199
it so i'm just going to go and meet them

3796
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:51,279
in person and you know establish a

3797
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:54,719
deeper relationship and try to collect

3798
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:56,639
some data as well firsthand

3799
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,520
wow that sounds really cool

3800
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:00,078
so

3801
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:02,079
now on to our last little quick fire

3802
02:10:00,078 --> 02:10:04,960
questions before we wrap things up so

3803
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:07,359
the first one i had for you was

3804
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:10,319
in your opinion what kind of little

3805
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:12,238
pocket or region of the world has really

3806
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:15,840
fantastic cannabis but just doesn't

3807
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:15,839
often get recognized for it

3808
02:10:17,359 --> 02:10:22,479
cold as it regions

3809
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:25,039
which are basically in the trance

3810
02:10:22,479 --> 02:10:26,799
himalayan ranges i don't think i think

3811
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:29,279
they're completely unheard of nobody

3812
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:31,199
talks about them yet they seem to have

3813
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:32,559
plants you know which would

3814
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:35,198
uh rival

3815
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:36,880
most of the you know modern varieties

3816
02:10:35,198 --> 02:10:39,439
only in terms of you know resin

3817
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:40,480
production not in terms of high or the

3818
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:42,638
structure

3819
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:44,479
but in terms of the amount of resin that

3820
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:46,159
they can produce they can pretty much be

3821
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:49,359
at par with some of the

3822
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:49,359
you know modern varieties

3823
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:54,560
well yeah you bang on right i hadn't

3824
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:56,400
heard of those at all really so the next

3825
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:58,159
question is what's what's the one type

3826
02:10:56,399 --> 02:10:59,920
of cannabis that you've always been

3827
02:10:58,158 --> 02:11:01,679
looking for but you've never really

3828
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:03,840
found you know is it like a certain

3829
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:06,800
smell or a certain look like what are

3830
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:09,599
you still chasing

3831
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:12,239
i mean i'm pretty much not

3832
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:14,880
i'm not trying to chase like a specific

3833
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:18,638
flavor or a specific kind of plant or

3834
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:22,319
what i'm rather trying to chase is

3835
02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:25,440
uh as many places as i can you know

3836
02:11:22,319 --> 02:11:27,439
so that i have a rather complete picture

3837
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:29,678
of the evolution of this plant or at

3838
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:32,000
least i can you know forward this data

3839
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:34,239
to people who are competent enough or

3840
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,399
have the scientific abilities

3841
02:11:34,238 --> 02:11:39,439
to put a bigger picture together of you

3842
02:11:36,399 --> 02:11:41,839
know how this plant evolved into these

3843
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:44,078
different types because although we can

3844
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:45,760
you know classify them and we can do all

3845
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:47,599
the labeling we want but that doesn't

3846
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,679
really tell us you know what actually

3847
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:51,199
happened how they evolved into these

3848
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:52,639
different and branched off into these

3849
02:11:51,198 --> 02:11:55,519
different plants

3850
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:58,000
so what i'm really after is you know if

3851
02:11:55,520 --> 02:12:00,800
i can just somehow get

3852
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,880
get to all of these places physically

3853
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:05,279
within this lifetime and then you know

3854
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:07,760
concise that data in one like a book

3855
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:10,399
kind of thing or i mean not necessarily

3856
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:12,639
but in one place and then you know

3857
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:14,399
other people can take that data and then

3858
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:16,319
they can you know develop it further as

3859
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:18,078
we advance and you know as more

3860
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:19,759
scientific people

3861
02:12:18,078 --> 02:12:21,679
will be you know coming into the

3862
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:23,679
industry because it's no longer a

3863
02:12:21,679 --> 02:12:25,440
stigmatized industry so what we're

3864
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:27,920
seeing if you're seeing a surge of you

3865
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:29,678
know scientists and you know engineers

3866
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:31,520
and even you know one of my friend is a

3867
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:33,359
software engineer so

3868
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,280
they want to do it they don't feel like

3869
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:36,880
it's wrong anymore so this is the time

3870
02:12:35,279 --> 02:12:39,759
when we are going to

3871
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:40,880
really see a very steep curve of you

3872
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,440
know the advancement in the

3873
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:45,920
understanding of cannabis all across the

3874
02:12:43,439 --> 02:12:48,399
world uh but you know what is really

3875
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,480
going to be of the prime importance here

3876
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:52,559
is going to be that data and i mean if

3877
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:54,799
you don't have that if you don't really

3878
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:56,639
have the data and those things are gone

3879
02:12:54,800 --> 02:13:00,960
and it's going to be really really hard

3880
02:12:56,639 --> 02:13:04,880
to really reconcile the complete picture

3881
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:07,599
yeah very valid answer right there so

3882
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:10,319
what is your favorite cannabis that

3883
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:12,239
you've ever had be it flower hash what's

3884
02:13:10,319 --> 02:13:16,158
the single one that stands out the most

3885
02:13:12,238 --> 02:13:18,718
in your memory is the best ever

3886
02:13:16,158 --> 02:13:21,519
that's ever the best ever for me would

3887
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:23,118
have to be lola valium in

3888
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:24,079
the low lab valley

3889
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:25,920
is

3890
02:13:24,078 --> 02:13:28,238
i mean i don't have words and i'm not

3891
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:31,520
even going to attempt to explain it in

3892
02:13:28,238 --> 02:13:35,198
words i'm just going to say this is the

3893
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:37,119
best kind of effect if i'm only speaking

3894
02:13:35,198 --> 02:13:39,118
in terms of effects and nothing else the

3895
02:13:37,118 --> 02:13:41,519
way it makes you feel the

3896
02:13:39,118 --> 02:13:43,198
the place it takes you as a person when

3897
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:45,840
you get high on this

3898
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,519
so i like that place a lot and you know

3899
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,440
other cannabis also takes me to these

3900
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,040
different places and i like them

3901
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:53,678
but you know lola valley northern

3902
02:13:51,039 --> 02:13:54,479
kashmiri varieties take me to a place

3903
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:57,279
that

3904
02:13:54,479 --> 02:13:59,678
is just unparalleled and you know

3905
02:13:57,279 --> 02:14:01,599
i i just love it i mean you you just get

3906
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:03,760
some some seeds from me if you want and

3907
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:06,400
grow them and smoke them and you'll

3908
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:08,560
you'll know what i'm talking about

3909
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:10,960
oh music to me is my friend i'll have to

3910
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:13,360
take you up on that but i want to give

3911
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:15,599
you a good little remix question so

3912
02:14:13,359 --> 02:14:17,920
often we hear people talk about oh you

3913
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,920
know i got to try this landry strain it

3914
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:21,279
wasn't really that good or something to

3915
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,920
that effect you know like standard

3916
02:14:21,279 --> 02:14:26,158
western person so here's the remix for

3917
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:28,000
you have you ever tried a more modern

3918
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:29,759
strain maybe like a cali import or

3919
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,479
something and you were like a bit

3920
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:35,760
disappointed

3921
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:37,919
um i i was but i think uh that was

3922
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:39,599
primarily because

3923
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:42,960
it was not grown by me it was grown by

3924
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:45,279
someone else and i felt that you know

3925
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,960
had it been grown properly i mean it

3926
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:49,118
would have certainly lived up to the

3927
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:51,679
expectations because see like i said in

3928
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:53,598
the beginning in india i mean hybrid uh

3929
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:57,118
weed cells for any

3930
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:59,360
anywhere between 800 to 1500 or 1200 at

3931
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,759
least for an ounce and the biggest

3932
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:03,519
reason behind that is is the boat i'm

3933
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,400
sorry is the potency that you cannot

3934
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:08,159
find in the regional varieties here

3935
02:15:06,399 --> 02:15:09,759
you just cannot i mean uh the high is

3936
02:15:08,158 --> 02:15:12,078
unparalleled in the

3937
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:14,880
uh hybrid repertoire that you guys have

3938
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:16,639
over there so uh it's very hard to be

3939
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,118
disappointed i mean i mean i i don't

3940
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:21,359
really understand i mean um you know how

3941
02:15:19,118 --> 02:15:23,279
can somebody be disappointed but then at

3942
02:15:21,359 --> 02:15:25,759
the same time i can understand if all

3943
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:27,519
you have is all of this good weed then

3944
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:29,440
you tend to have a relative scale you

3945
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:32,400
know which is mapped against some of the

3946
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:34,158
best varieties like cam dog or og kush

3947
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:36,479
so then people tend to

3948
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:38,319
or headband like things then people tend

3949
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:39,839
to like you know compare everything to

3950
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:42,158
that and

3951
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:43,840
by the virtue of that comparison you

3952
02:15:42,158 --> 02:15:45,519
know some of the people who are

3953
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,760
regularly you know experiencing these

3954
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:49,920
things could say that you know that this

3955
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,679
thing is uh not gonna get you that high

3956
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,840
or it's not that enjoyable or if this is

3957
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:55,599
crap if somebody chooses to talk that

3958
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:57,360
way then

3959
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:59,520
but for us it's really hard to say a

3960
02:15:57,359 --> 02:16:02,078
hybrid sucks because i mean

3961
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:05,280
we're like smoking varieties mostly you

3962
02:16:02,078 --> 02:16:07,759
know which are not that potent okay so

3963
02:16:05,279 --> 02:16:10,000
uh you know it's hard for somebody from

3964
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:13,039
india to just look hybrid and say that

3965
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,078
it is not good especially if it's coming

3966
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:16,238
from

3967
02:16:14,078 --> 02:16:18,399
usa because i see a lot of good work

3968
02:16:16,238 --> 02:16:21,279
happening in usa and there are so many

3969
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:22,879
people doing it i mean

3970
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:26,319
i mean i think the

3971
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:28,159
plant is in very good hands in america

3972
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:29,840
yeah hard to argue that they're not

3973
02:16:28,158 --> 02:16:32,398
progressing things forward in a lot of

3974
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:34,000
ways so final question of the interview

3975
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:36,000
this brings us to it and this is the one

3976
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,718
i wanted to ask you the most

3977
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,439
if you could go anywhere and select

3978
02:16:38,718 --> 02:16:43,199
seeds from any area any point in time in

3979
02:16:41,439 --> 02:16:45,599
history where would you go and what

3980
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:46,719
seeds would you want to get

3981
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:49,599
okay

3982
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:51,839
if i could go back in history and i

3983
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,359
could collect wow that's a good question

3984
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:55,120
i'll have to think about it because i've

3985
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:56,399
never thought about it before so just

3986
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:59,439
give me a second

3987
02:16:56,398 --> 02:17:01,679
take as long as you need my friend

3988
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,439
okay who would i want to go

3989
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:06,398
then that's uh

3990
02:17:03,439 --> 02:17:08,479
yeah uh okay i think i know what i would

3991
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:11,358
like to do is uh i

3992
02:17:08,478 --> 02:17:12,840
okay and you could only go to one place

3993
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:14,880
yeah just one

3994
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:17,040
place oh man sorry

3995
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:19,759
okay then

3996
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:22,399
i would like to go to that uh near that

3997
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:24,079
cave at exactly the same point in time

3998
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:26,079
you know in tibbat

3999
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:26,959
where they just found this evidence for

4000
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:29,840
you know

4001
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:31,678
some cannabis which was used by you know

4002
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:33,519
some people some hundred thousand years

4003
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:35,599
ago so i would want to be at that point

4004
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:36,800
in time and get some of those grab some

4005
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:38,960
of those seeds

4006
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:41,679
while those primitive gentlemen are you

4007
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:45,598
know smoking on their cannabis i just

4008
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:47,840
take my time machine and come back

4009
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:49,200
hell yeah i just get that primordial

4010
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:50,239
stuff

4011
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:52,000
