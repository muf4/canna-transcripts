169
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,758
decide to plant for this year so um

170
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,478
always smoking kind of something

171
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,720
different I love that you're a man after

172
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:50,199
my own heart I too transitioned from um

173
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,880
from having Brey bongs to just smoking

174
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,520
in the evening usually after the kids

175
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,680
have gone down and um I can certainly

176
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,159
appreciate how much well for me at least

177
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,639
it helped me to appreciate cannabis a

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
lot more I started getting a lot more

179
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,960
fire which I really enjoyed you

180
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,638
mentioned the white Thorn Rose anyone

181
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,799
who's come across your brand would have

182
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,800
seen the iconic strain that's associated

183
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,520
with you guys let's let's talk a little

184
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,598
bit quickly about the Inception of that

185
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,198
one because it's such a signature strain

186
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,878
for you guys how did that strain first

187
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,120
come to

188
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:24,919
be um you know when you've grown we've

189
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,720
grown I've been growing for maybe 45

190
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,639
years now and so it's always still

191
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,960
exciting every single year is exciting

192
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,360
every single year is a little bit

193
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,478
different um but what really becomes

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
very exciting to a lot of us Growers is

195
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,878
the breeding process and and really

196
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,879
trying to find the the next new thing

197
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,879
right um and that's kind of how white

198
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,800
Thorn Rose came to be um and in honor of

199
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,840
my mom who passed away um I really

200
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,240
wanted to make this Farm um about her

201
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,679
and about what she taught me and so all

202
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,680
the different strains that we grow here

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,560
are breed to a strain I used to grow

204
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,478
with her when I was 10 so and that

205
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,639
strain was called Froot Loops back then

206
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,719
we didn't did rename it to Paradise

207
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,560
punch and so um whitethorn Rose is a

208
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,039
lemon OG crossed with the paradise punch

209
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,560
and we we named it uh after my

210
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,439
girlfriend Rose and after um the town of

211
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,199
whitethorn which is right down the road

212
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,918
where I consider to be um really the

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,038
bullseye of a dartboard where a billion

214
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,918
dooll industry was created and I say

215
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,360
that

216
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:36,079
because back in the 80s and back in the

217
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,759
90s there was enforcement around you

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,360
know they were flying helicopters they

219
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,639
were dropping guys down on wires and

220
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,680
eradicating you know the cannabis plants

221
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:48,159
and arresting you if they could and um

222
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,958
really hanbul County and whitethorne the

223
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,919
town of whitethorne was really the

224
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:55,599
epicenter of those enforcement um

225
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,838
dollars that they had and it was pretty

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,879
pretty sketchy so I thought white Thorn

227
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,120
Rose was a fitting name for that that

228
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,919
Cult of our so many people like it I

229
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,519
just thought it uh would help tell the

230
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,278
story of the Emerald Triangle small

231
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:12,320
farmer oh manate that's beautiful like

232
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,159
an homage to your mom your hometown your

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,800
partner what a what a brilliant Trifecta

234
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,958
I I realize you have this epic backstory

235
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,599
and let's let's jump into it cuz I know

236
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,039
that you know you you've been in the

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,320
beating heart and epicenter of worldwide

238
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,000
cannabis so tell me a little bit first

239
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,680
let's go all the way back to the start

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,039
what was your first experience with

241
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,679
cannabis you know um I moved here when I

242
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,799
to this very piece of property that

243
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,479
we're sitting on today and moved here

244
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,078
with my mom and my stepdad when I was

245
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,278
five years old and really from the the

246
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:49,519
first first two years that we moved here

247
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,480
um cannabis was a part of our life right

248
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,120
it was just a small part of our income

249
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,720
that we had to do to live in the country

250
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,919
so we grew a little bit cannabis we were

251
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,759
part-time loggers we were part-time

252
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,399
commercial fisherman um we cut firewood

253
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,319
in the winter time and sold it to a

254
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,039
local Merchant so you just did a bunch

255
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,640
of different things we had a vegetable

256
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,319
garden we had fruit trees and cannabis

257
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,559
really very quickly for me growing up as

258
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,800
a kid became like growing a tomato plant

259
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,838
I really looked at it as just that it

260
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,000
was just another plant and um my mom

261
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,360
really taught me everything I know about

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,639
cannabis and she really taught me that

263
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,120
there's no sop you know stand standard

264
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,639
operating procedure that you could write

265
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,560
down on a piece of paper because every

266
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,559
strain kind of needed its own individual

267
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,958
attention it wasn't like OG and and

268
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,278
white Thorn Rose could be grown exactly

269
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,799
the same and they both could Thrive so

270
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,278
she was the one that really taught me

271
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,319
that they they each needed individual

272
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,519
attention and that they each uh uh

273
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,519
needed to be grown a little bit

274
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,600
differently so it was really from I the

275
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,679
the age of 10 that I started growing

276
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,120
with her and she gave me little chores

277
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,799
like checking the emitters the drippers

278
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,879
you know checking the water tank and it

279
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,879
didn't really take that long before um I

280
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,200
really wanted to experiment around and

281
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,799
see what these different cultivars or

282
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,519
these different strains responded to we

283
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,639
were uh we were already doing some stuff

284
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,720
together like you know putting Rusty

285
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,120
Nails in the planter box you know for

286
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,360
the iron um at Harvest time we were

287
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,000
using birth control pills because

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,240
neighbor had told us that that would

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,120
help the flowers harden up um we would

290
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,360
sometimes pull the big plants out of the

291
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,039
ground with the roots and everything and

292
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,120
we'd stick those roots in boiling water

293
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,078
before we hung them upside down because

294
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,919
somebody said that all the resin would

295
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,679
go to the the flower if we did that so

296
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,319
you know I don't do any of that stuff

297
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,919
today but I still experiment around in

298
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,680
my own little ways um not so extreme I

299
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,159
guess um to really find out what these

300
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,919
plants really respond to

301
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,559
and uh well I'll just keep going a

302
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,360
little bit unless you want me to stop

303
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,319
but I love it keep going so it it's it

304
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,278
really took like four or five six years

305
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,480
before you know I could talk my mom into

306
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,480
giving me my own plants and really that

307
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,519
was you know my goal is to have my own

308
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,839
plants to grow them the own way the way

309
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,320
I wanted to grow them and you know she

310
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,279
struggled as being a parent you know to

311
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,720
let your kid grow something that was

312
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,639
technically illegal right like how do I

313
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,639
let him do that I'm not a good mom blah

314
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,639
blah blah but after I nagged enough I

315
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,198
think she gave in and she said okay well

316
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,680
these are the conditions I'll give you

317
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:42,759
10 plants and given none of these plants

318
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,198
were ever grown in our front yard these

319
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,360
were plants that we had to like make

320
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,639
trails and hide to Trails and Hike into

321
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,399
the woods and hide them from aerial

322
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,120
surveillance and airplanes and

323
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:59,320
helicopters and enforcement team so it

324
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,600
wasn't as easy as it is today and uh

325
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,079
part of the condition was any of the

326
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,680
money that if I were to make it to

327
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,159
harvest any of the money that I were to

328
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,519
make it had to go to like a college

329
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,120
education or I had to invest it in

330
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,360
something something for my future I

331
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,600
couldn't go out and buy a motorcycle or

332
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,639
something that was fun and and frivolous

333
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,680
so that first year I remember I made 12

334
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,919
pounds and I think uh the price back

335
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,399
then was like $1,200 a pound or

336
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,399
something like that which sounds good

337
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,480
now um

338
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,679
but and so she ended up taking the

339
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,920
product after it was dried and and

340
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,359
trimmed and she sold it for me and I put

341
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,519
uh I put $10,000 down on a a piece of

342
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,879
property along the Eel River you know at

343
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,959
the age of 15 and so um I then started

344
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:49,439
growing there during the summertimes and

345
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,359
uh yeah just really fell in love with

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,639
this plant and and growing with my

347
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,320
friends and my buddies and it was like

348
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,399
okay let's go work on the gardens in the

349
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,399
morning and then let's go surfing or

350
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,078
let's go fishing or hiking or something

351
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,440
like that so Humble County is an amazing

352
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,679
place to to grow up at there's redwoods

353
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,040
everywhere the ocean's right 15 minutes

354
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,319
over the hill um there's plenty of

355
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,120
hiking trails and it's just a very

356
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,278
beautiful clean place and so I feel

357
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,639
pretty fortunate growing up here as a

358
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:22,480
kid I'll let you get a couple words

359
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,600
in what an incredible story that's

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,159
that's beautiful I love it a very

361
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,079
admirable upbringing that I think

362
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,399
everyone can can when they hear that

363
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,039
they'll think man that sounds awesome I

364
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,000
guess I'd be interested given you know

365
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,879
you and your parents were in the the

366
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,480
Beating Heart of cannabis for all those

367
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,078
years first question were there any old

368
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,839
genetics that were ever grown by

369
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,078
yourself or your parents that left a

370
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,079
really lasting memory on

371
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:50,638
you yeah actually uh this one genetic

372
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,758
that I ended up breeding with um the

373
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,120
lemon OG to create the white Thorn Rose

374
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,800
was a um strain my mom bred with a

375
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,360
really good friend of mine's mother um

376
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,799
she she had a

377
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,480
blueberry uh blueberry cush that she

378
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,838
crossed with u my friend's mom's

379
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,959
lavender cush and together they they

380
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,880
ended up calling that Froot Loops at the

381
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,758
time and one of the reasons we used to

382
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,559
grow that strain not only because it was

383
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,440
really fruity and it tasted amazing but

384
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,000
it it harvested really early it

385
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,320
harvested you know early September the

386
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,198
first week of September so if you were

387
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,680
on top of your game you had the ability

388
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:33,799
to dry cure it trim it and sell it

389
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,838
before the big Harvest of humbo County

390
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:39,120
came in and dropped the price so we

391
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,600
always got2 or $300 more a pound um

392
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
whatever we trimed because it was an

393
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,639
early

394
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,160
Harvester and it also really allowed you

395
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,360
to get your harvest in before maybe some

396
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,318
of the enforcement teams might you know

397
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,800
eradicate you and and and just to

398
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,240
reflect a little bit back to those

399
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,879
eradication teams sometimes especially

400
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,399
after 1985 Ronald re had declared the

401
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,278
war on drugs and enforcement got bad the

402
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
government was supplementing the

403
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:09,000
counties with Monies to flly do

404
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,680
overflights and drop guys in and cut the

405
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,679
weed down and um that got really really

406
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,838
really bad and really scary you'd wake

407
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,919
up some mornings you know right at

408
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,759
sunlight and there'd be like a a

409
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,759
Blackhawk helicopter sitting over your

410
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,959
house with guys and AR15s I mean it was

411
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,240
only a plant but they took it seriously

412
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,198
like we were doing something bad and you

413
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,159
know growing with my best friend it was

414
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:37,000
always our opinion that well we live in

415
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:41,439
Humble County every single person we

416
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,839
knew was growing pot back then and so

417
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,839
the the few people that we knew that got

418
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,880
caught or got in trouble just got

419
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,680
probation so that was kind of our game

420
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,198
plan well if we get caught and we get in

421
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,120
trouble um we'll get probation and then

422
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,799
we can decide how to go forward with our

423
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,919
life but um enforcement was really bad

424
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,519
sometimes there was four or five

425
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,038
helicopters in the air at a time and

426
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,519
that's really when my parents decided

427
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,679
excuse me to to move out and they bought

428
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,038
a commercial fishing boat and really

429
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,160
sailed around the world to China to uh

430
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:17,679
excuse me to the South Pacific to China

431
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,079
to uh Alaska and really fish for albore

432
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,640
11 months out of the year and I stayed

433
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,159
back here with my best friend and we

434
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,600
just kept growing and we were just

435
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,480
loving it loving everything and uh long

436
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,678
story short

437
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
we were pretty naive as as Hill kids

438
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,798
right we we knew about redwood trees we

439
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,679
knew about growing Po and fishing and

440
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,000
all those kind of things but really

441
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,480
worldly we were pretty naive you know we

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,119
didn't know there was a difference

443
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,480
between you know state law and federal

444
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,798
law and all these different things and

445
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,319
then kind of got an eye opener one day

446
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,279
at the age of uh

447
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:01,200
24 um this old man down our road ended

448
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,720
up turning Us in to the cops and they

449
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,480
like I said Ronald Reagan had declared

450
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,798
the war on drugs and he really wanted to

451
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,798
make an uh an impression on people in

452
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,918
humbal and really attempt to stop people

453
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,918
from growing weed and I had 30 federal

454
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
agents drive up my driveway one morning

455
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,320
at 6 o'clock and um really from that

456
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:24,720
point forward my life was never the same

457
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:27,319
um I was now uh you know getting

458
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,279
searched um at the end of that day they

459
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,038
searched my place they eradicated all

460
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,399
the

461
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,798
weed and um then at the end of the day

462
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,280
they left they gave me a little yellow

463
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,599
speeding ticket and they said if we want

464
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,678
to contact you we will and it uh you

465
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,759
know then I'm I'm starting to learn the

466
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,600
difference between state and federal and

467
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,798
how they operate and a year and a half

468
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,240
later they came back with a federal

469
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,558
arrest warrant um I went down to San

470
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,519
Francisco courthouse building was

471
00:18:53,558 --> 00:19:01,079
arraigned and uh retained an attorney

472
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,440
and now was being made aware that there

473
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,158
was something called the mandatory

474
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,759
minimums and the mandatory minimums

475
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,320
don't clear so much if you're a

476
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,038
firsttime nonviolent offender the

477
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,519
mandatory minimums don't care if you

478
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,119
would never hurt anybody if you're nice

479
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,119
if you're bad the mandatory minimums

480
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,959
really was looking me straight in the

481
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,798
face with a 10year to life in prison for

482
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,558
a firsttime nonviolent offender and I

483
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:29,038
really refus to and my best friend um so

484
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,639
together for the next three and a half

485
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,000
years we went to court we went to court

486
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,159
telling the judge you know we were

487
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,720
growing the the the tomato plant or we

488
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,640
were growing the weed plant whatever you

489
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,679
want to call it and um we would never

490
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,280
hurt anybody and you know at the end of

491
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
three years of going to court he stood

492
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,200
up and he said you know because I'm

493
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,960
Bound by the law you know I I'm going to

494
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,519
sentence you to the lower end of the

495
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,159
mandatory minimums and he ended up

496
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,879
giving us 10 years in jail um and in

497
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,120
federal prison you do 85% of your time

498
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,080
so I did um eight years in prison six

499
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,399
years in Lao and then another two years

500
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,038
at Nellis Air Force Base you know all

501
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,200
for this plant and ironically full

502
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,679
circle now I'm a permitted Farm in humbo

503
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,000
county and permitted by the state of

504
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,840
California so you know still to this day

505
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,519
their rules and their regulations and

506
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,480
their laws don't really make a whole lot

507
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,558
of sense to me but um I really like to

508
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,720
look at the positive side of everything

509
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:32,399
and um it's just a uh it was just a

510
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,440
story in my life that um that I had an

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,440
experience that I feel pretty fortunate

512
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,919
that a lot of people didn't have that

513
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,440
gives me a different perspective on the

514
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,480
reality of of our government and the

515
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,519
reality of some of the really cool

516
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:51,759
people that are in jail for really a uh

517
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:55,279
a harmless crime and so um I'm okay with

518
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:58,158
it wow look first of all thank you so

519
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,720
much for you know I I I for lack of a

520
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,799
better words for your service you know

521
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,798
what you've contributed to the scene

522
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,038
with your sacrifice that's that's

523
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,558
incredible that sadly someone as

524
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,480
successful as yourself was a victim of

525
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,000
of the drug war I think that we we need

526
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,319
to talk about that a little more because

527
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,159
we often on the show talk about the

528
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,879
people who' have come before us who have

529
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,640
say for example like yourself had to

530
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,679
serve sentences to help progress the

531
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,919
scene I think we really need to give a

532
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,480
bit of homage to that the first question

533
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,559
that comes to mind is what what why did

534
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,038
the old man tip you off why was he upset

535
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,000
you know he was he was about 90 years

536
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,879
old he had lived in that um area for his

537
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,519
whole life and he just wasn't really

538
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,720
keen on having somebody new move in I

539
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,038
don't I'm really not sure unfortunately

540
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,558
while we were gone he passed away and

541
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:53,240
like you know I never had a chance to

542
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:56,000
ask him or talk to him or um it really I

543
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,038
guess doesn't matter at this time but

544
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,839
you know sometimes uh people are stuck

545
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,519
in their way and maybe he didn't agree

546
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:06,759
with cannabis or whatever his reasoning

547
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:08,480
was um you know sure sure and then so

548
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,919
you mentioned that they came initially

549
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,480
and then they sort of left at the end of

550
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,400
the day and then there was a year in

551
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,880
between the visits what was that year

552
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,880
like were you sort of walking on

553
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,159
eggshells or did you just get back to it

554
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,360
or well I kind of knew I was in trouble

555
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,159
but you know it was a year and a half

556
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,079
before they came back with the the

557
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,120
arrest warrant and you know it was about

558
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,639
a year where I didn't do a whole lot and

559
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,278
I was like after a year went by I was

560
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,520
like well you know maybe they just

561
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:38,480
messed up maybe they just came here and

562
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,000
they realized that you know I am

563
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,159
somebody that would never hurt anybody

564
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,359
and it was just some plants and blah

565
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,520
blah blah whatever it was and so I

566
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:52,038
started growing again and uh long story

567
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:54,240
short they were following me and so um

568
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,798
yeah I got lucky not to get in trouble

569
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,519
again while I was um about to get

570
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:03,079
arrested again um but yeah so I guess

571
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,720
they still never learned my lesson I'm

572
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:07,399
here now still doing the same thing that

573
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,038
I was doing back then but now it's legal

574
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,038
so yeah no look I'm glad you're still

575
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:15,079
doing it and I I think everyone can

576
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,919
relate to that after a year of waiting I

577
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,158
think it's safe everyone would basically

578
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,320
assume similar to yourself that maybe

579
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,000
something else has happened so you know

580
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:25,960
that that's a bummer they they came back

581
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,558
after a year and a half so um when you

582
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,440
eventually ended up going to the the

583
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,399
Federal prism what was that experience

584
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,640
like any memorable characters did you

585
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,120
meet any other growers in

586
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,759
there yeah well I was fortunate enough

587
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:43,199
to go to Lao which is one of the they

588
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:46,759
say the cushier the easier prisons um

589
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,440
out there um my mom and my dad drove me

590
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:53,119
to prison um where you selfs surrender

591
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,240
you self surrender at the USP which is

592
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,798
the United States Penitentiary where

593
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,278
people have life in prison with the

594
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,359
razor wire and they check you in there

595
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,079
they fingerprint you in there and they

596
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,278
process you in there before they take

597
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,759
you over to where I finally ended up

598
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:12,839
which was the camp which was a a cattle

599
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,919
ranch which was a dairy which was a uh

600
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,399
had some Farmland where we grew corn and

601
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:21,320
beans for the the cows um so I got to go

602
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,360
out every day and work in the fields and

603
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:27,519
um make 11 cents an hour and um at least

604
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,918
be outside and get to work out and play

605
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,798
some softball and really after I uh

606
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,720
after the first year when you're you

607
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,278
know kind of done missing the things

608
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,200
that are on the outside like good food

609
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,519
and you know your family and your

610
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,759
friends and you kind of get into a

611
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,038
routine in there and it's not like you

612
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,720
forgot what's on the outside but I think

613
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:50,839
we're pretty strong as as humans and we

614
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,038
learn to adapt to the situation and you

615
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:54,759
get into your routines and you start

616
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,079
looking forward to hey on the weekend I

617
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,158
get to play softball and hey I'm playing

618
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,960
volleyball and basketball and you know

619
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,200
you just occupy your time with doing

620
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,720
things that you like to do even in there

621
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:11,278
and so um I do remember walking over to

622
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,038
the camp and I had uh the maximum time

623
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,720
you can have to go to the prison camp is

624
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,839
10 years so when I got there I had the

625
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,600
longest prison sentence out of anybody

626
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,119
there for a first time non-violent

627
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,798
offender and people were looking at me

628
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,479
going what what you you grew weed wait

629
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,158
you had to have done something else or

630
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,159
how you can't just be here for a plant

631
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,960
and and so because of that they knew I

632
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,320
wasn't a rat they knew I didn't

633
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,798
cooperate and and rat off one of my

634
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:41,038
friends and really gained a lot of

635
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:44,440
respect from all ethnic groups blacks

636
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:47,158
whites Hispanics um Asians all of them

637
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,440
really accepted me with open arms and

638
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:54,320
and really gave me a lot of respect very

639
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,798
quickly because of solely that um and uh

640
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,319
so I felt pretty at home and you know

641
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,639
they brought me over toothpaste and

642
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,158
toothbrushes and kind of welcomed me

643
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,120
there and made it as as really as good

644
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,559
as could

645
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,719
be that's that's nice to hear that you

646
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,359
were able to sort of make the most of it

647
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,919
I guess the question that I always think

648
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,000
about whenever I'm contemplating either

649
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,759
myself theoretically in jail or someone

650
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
else as you describe I have to imagine

651
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,359
that there were points where you were

652
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,398
sitting there going I can't wait to get

653
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,959
out I'm going to light up some fruit

654
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:27,839
loop like what was the strain that you

655
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,200
were thinking about like what what were

656
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,000
you having the The Mirage dreams about

657
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,240
smoking when you first got out and as a

658
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,398
followup tell me about as you got closer

659
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,599
to getting out how did that all pan

660
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,359
out so

661
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,158
um because I was in a camp you had the

662
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,719
ability to get whatever you wanted in

663
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,240
there like visitors could drop it off in

664
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,679
the visiting room that prison system was

665
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,159
pretty corrupt it was it was pretty

666
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,519
awful actually and

667
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,360
um but you were really in command of

668
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,798
your own destiny if you get in trouble

669
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,959
there you would have to go to a higher

670
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:07,759
security facility so I didn't mess

671
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,558
around too much and uh really was just

672
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,640
playing sports trying to get in the best

673
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:15,839
shape I could um back then it was all

674
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,120
about OG and Sour Diesel and so we

675
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,038
didn't have and it I didn't look forward

676
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,519
to the fro Loop so much you know I

677
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,240
remember growing it with my mom and um

678
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,879
thought it was cool but really there was

679
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,599
a time in the the 80s and early 90s

680
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,679
where was all about OG and sour d and we

681
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:37,000
were getting $5,800 a pound um right

682
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,559
before I went to jail so um yeah I guess

683
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,880
I was thinking about that I was hearing

684
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,440
stories of my friends really doing

685
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,278
pretty well in the Cannabis industry out

686
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,278
out here which was a little bit hard to

687
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:51,919
hear at times and you know we were in

688
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:55,440
there um but uh yeah time went pretty

689
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,679
fast after a while I mean 3,000 days the

690
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,278
first year was slow the next little bit

691
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,080
went fairly quick and then six months

692
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,679
before I got out like all of a sudden

693
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,759
every day was like forever and it just

694
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,640
slowed down because I could finally see

695
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,158
the light at the end of the tunnel and I

696
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,559
was like wow I'm G to make it out of

697
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:18,240
here and uh so it really got really

698
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,839
tense and really slow and stressful and

699
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
you know finally made it out went to a

700
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,038
halfway house and got home and um really

701
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,278
didn't smoke for for quite a while and

702
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,079
didn't grow because I still was on I got

703
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,359
five years federal probation which

704
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,439
didn't allow for you to grow at the time

705
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,719
and did get released a little bit early

706
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,399
from that and then immediately started

707
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,720
growing my 215 but one thing I I want to

708
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,599
share is what was very odd to me at the

709
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,960
time was I love fishing I was a fishing

710
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,359
guide on the river for years I

711
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,079
commercial fished with my my parents for

712
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:56,119
Sam and albacore and crab and I love the

713
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:58,519
water and I love the outdoors and when I

714
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,839
got back

715
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,200
I didn't have that drive that I

716
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,879
remembered that I used to have to want

717
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,440
to go do those things because when you

718
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,360
don't do those things for so long you

719
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,679
forget about what it is about those

720
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,959
things that really made you get up in

721
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,159
the morning and want to do them and so

722
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,759
it really took me a minute even with

723
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,480
growing pot I didn't realize what it was

724
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:25,000
so much about growing a plant that I

725
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,679
love so much until I put a few in and I

726
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,319
was like whoa and then all of a sudden

727
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,080
you know we had the 215 era and so I was

728
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,879
able to you know grow a certain amount

729
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:39,798
once I was off probation and really just

730
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,240
fell in love with that and then um very

731
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:44,759
quickly you know California was going to

732
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,038
legalize cannabis and allow you to get

733
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,558
permits and ended up falling all back

734
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,798
into that and was the fourth existing

735
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:55,398
Farm to get a permit in Humble County so

736
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,599
um yeah ironically now I'm here I'm one

737
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:00,918
of three farms in Humble County to get a

738
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,678
tourism permit so I take people here and

739
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:06,200
I really it's not so much about the

740
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,480
money for me it's about creating these

741
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,558
strains honoring my mom that passed away

742
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,399
when I was in jail um telling stories

743
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:16,960
about not Huckleberry Hill Farm so much

744
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,959
but all the Emerald Triangle small

745
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,038
farmers that have families and kids that

746
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,679
are exactly like me that could have

747
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,398
ended up exactly like me and there's

748
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,200
thousands of those people that really

749
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,398
just want to grow the best possible

750
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,558
product they can and and feel like just

751
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,239
energized and amazed to be able to share

752
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:38,158
it with these consumers for the first

753
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:44,000
time in our lives like to have somebody

754
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:47,120
after 45 years say to you excuse

755
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
me say to you hey the white Thorn Rose

756
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,678
made me feel amazing you know I slept

757
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,240
really good last night thank you so

758
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,639
much like that

759
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,079
validation is the reason why we're doing

760
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:03,000
what

761
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:05,158
doing 100% excuse me no that take your

762
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,880
time that's such a powerful statement to

763
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,480
be able to give someone relief you know

764
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,799
if if nothing else in this world to to

765
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,159
not have pain is a is a noble thing you

766
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:17,839
can grant someone and and it's just so

767
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,120
sad that we've been lagging behind for

768
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,000
so many years and that has you know sort

769
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,359
of been on the table but for so many

770
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,159
people not accessible so it's it's

771
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:27,678
beautiful to see you know native

772
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
passionate people like yourself bringing

773
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,798
that to the table and there's so many

774
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,759
things you you referen you know we'll

775
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,519
have to loop back on so many of them but

776
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,200
I guess the first question I'd love to

777
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,200
ask is you started growing again what

778
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,840
was the progression from planting those

779
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,399
few seeds finding that spark again to

780
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:49,879
then starting your own breeding

781
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:52,439
Journey um really it was dictated by my

782
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,720
ability to get my County permit because

783
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,399
once you were in the the permitting

784
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,839
process you know The Regulators would

785
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,439
come here frequently and do their

786
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,398
inspections like they were supposed to

787
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,880
make sure you have rainwater catchment

788
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,278
ponds make sure that all the the the

789
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,840
sediment wasn't flowing into the

790
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,038
tributaries and um there was all these

791
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,519
rules and regulations that now that we

792
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:16,119
entered into the system we had to follow

793
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,319
and we were getting checked up on all

794
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:22,199
the time so um kind of started off slow

795
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:25,119
but my farm here is permitted for 5,000

796
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,759
square fet um one of the smallest

797
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,158
permitted farms in the state of

798
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:32,440
California like one of the bigger ones

799
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,399
is 2.2 million square feet and I'm 5,000

800
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,720
square feet so that's like 500 5,000 I

801
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,798
don't even know how many times bigger

802
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,360
than mine maybe 10,000 times I don't

803
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,319
know but um yeah so it's just my

804
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,798
girlfriend and I that are really here

805
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:52,720
and um I was saying before having grown

806
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:56,599
so long um really found a a big interest

807
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,519
in breing and creating different strains

808
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,678
and found that

809
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,120
maybe a pathway forward for the small

810
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:06,080
farmer wasn't ever going to be to

811
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:09,038
compete with big a with all these gush

812
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,398
mins and sour diesels and all these um

813
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,679
commercialized strains that they could

814
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,839
easily get at commercial nurseries but

815
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,798
maybe it was highlighting our Legacy

816
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:21,158
strains that nobody else in the world

817
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:24,079
had and so I really just focused on you

818
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,600
know breeding different strains which

819
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,759
hundreds of them turned out to be

820
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,278
failures that I didn't do I really

821
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,839
valuated them myself and what I liked

822
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:34,519
then that's what I really presented to

823
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,678
the consumer and then um once the

824
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:39,159
consumer got it in their hands then they

825
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,919
really uh determined whether or not I

826
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,679
would ever grow It Again by their

827
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,759
feedback and so I Rely a lot on their

828
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,159
feedback to to dictate what I grow and

829
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,960
today we grow 90% of our farm is

830
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,240
whitethorn Rose and I just because I

831
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,079
won't give up the other 10% because I

832
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,720
want to experiment around and grow some

833
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,319
of these little pheno hunts that I'm

834
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,919
running around trying and doing and um

835
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:04,398
gotten a lot of attention doing so um

836
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:06,080
yeah feel pretty blessed being able to

837
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,159
do something I love and wake up every

838
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:11,719
single morning and run on my front door

839
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,878
with a cup of coffee and uh tend the

840
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,000
plants beautiful it sounds like you're

841
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,000
living the dream I love that and

842
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,039
specifically in terms of the the white

843
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,719
Thorn Rose let's let's delve into that a

844
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,519
bit we we love to focus on genetics and

845
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,918
breeding here on the show and so I guess

846
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:29,119
the first question is it's made using

847
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,638
some of those Legacy strains you just

848
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,079
referenced that are you know native to

849
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,358
yourself in the area were you working

850
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,639
with seed stock did someone retain some

851
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,960
clones was the first creation of white

852
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:44,000
Thorn Rose a fem or a regular cross that

853
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,519
that was that's a very good question and

854
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,519
um I guess a very important point that I

855
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,599
think I always leave out on most of the

856
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,239
stories

857
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,599
for there's just so much information

858
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,199
when I share that Journey that a lot of

859
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:00,760
stuff gets uh left out and and that's

860
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,519
one thing that I I leave out but when I

861
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,800
was gone and you know I told you I

862
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,519
didn't rat on any of my friends which if

863
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,400
I would have I would have got no time I

864
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,280
didn't have to do any time and they

865
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,760
wanted me to cooperate with them and

866
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,960
that's how the federal government worked

867
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,160
but it was the single most important

868
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,800
decision I ever made in my life not to

869
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:23,838
to cooperate with the federal government

870
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,880
and really ensure assure the people that

871
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,159
I grew up with that I am who I said I

872
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,240
was and you know in Humble County we

873
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,759
were like one big family we trusted one

874
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,679
another with his with our lives so if

875
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,160
you break that trust you never get it

876
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,358
back so I did never broke that trust

877
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,440
even when I got in trouble and so when I

878
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,598
showed back up here um after being gone

879
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,079
for eight years I had 50 people from

880
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,318
this community here to welcome me back

881
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,359
to bring me silverware to bring me

882
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:53,199
plates and toothpaste and all those

883
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,400
simple things that we took for granted

884
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,679
that had gotten stolen when I was gone

885
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,960
and you know they all were here to

886
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,159
celebrate me in my return and um just

887
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,199
was really grateful for that and some

888
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:07,318
people brought me over barbecues and

889
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,078
just brought me over everyday living

890
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:10,679
stuff but there was this one friend in

891
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,200
particular his name was

892
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,039
trell um trell was a really super good

893
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,679
friend of mine and he was the friend

894
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:21,079
that I was telling you that my mom bred

895
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:23,879
um her blueberry cush to the lavend

896
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,880
berry cush and so trell came over and

897
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,039
after being that gone uh for that long

898
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,800
he had kept Froot Loops alive in his

899
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,199
garage underneath a light for me for

900
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,720
eight years and he brought that mother

901
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,960
plant back to me after that long and

902
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,879
instead of giving me a barbecue he gave

903
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,358
me this plant back that really was a

904
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,240
reflection of my mom and what we created

905
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:51,559
so um he really enabled this Farm to be

906
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,959
what it is today um by that kind of

907
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,639
thoughtfulness and that kind of

908
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,760
generosity and um just we'll never

909
00:36:55,639 --> 00:37:01,358
forget that ever and um just to Circle

910
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,480
back a little bit I you know we're

911
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,639
always talking about growing and and

912
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,039
smoking different strains and that

913
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:10,679
amazingness of with all that but um one

914
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,599
of the little projects when you and I

915
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:15,199
first met a couple years ago with the

916
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,599
weed in the jar and the little uh peep

917
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:21,239
Puck on the top really was trying to

918
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,359
find a way to share with people the

919
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,279
validation that I felt from growing I

920
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,519
wanted people to understand that

921
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,200
starting a seed growing it throughout

922
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:33,599
its life cycle harvesting it drying it

923
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,719
curing it and then sharing it with your

924
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,359
good friends and watching them smile and

925
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:41,159
alleviating their pain or their stress

926
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:44,119
was really where all the magic H happens

927
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,879
and so this breeding that I do here is

928
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:50,119
is as much to find a new strain but is

929
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,240
is is also part of trying to encourage

930
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,559
people to grow their own like nobody

931
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,279
really needs to buy pot from the retail

932
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,920
shop and and pay this ridiculous amount

933
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,960
of money like on a jar that you saw

934
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,599
there which was a quarter ounce I make

935
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,039
$3 they sell it for 65 at the retail

936
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:10,039
store so like it's ridiculous and I just

937
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,000
want people to experience growing their

938
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,838
own because that's where the true magic

939
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,719
is so many incredible points there I

940
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,960
think we got to say shout out to tr for

941
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,959
hanging on to that clone that's

942
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,960
absolutely beautiful I've I've held on

943
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,599
to a clone for a bu for one year and

944
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,079
that felt like a lifetime I can't

945
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,480
imagine eight that's shout out to him

946
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:32,240
that's a that's a good homie yeah for

947
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,280
sure yeah look so many incredible points

948
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,879
you you touched on then um I guess the

949
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,760
first question is tell me about when you

950
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,920
so you've made the uh the white Thorn

951
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,400
Rose was was that a regular pollination

952
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,599
and and tell me about when you popped

953
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,920
those seeds and and started to realize

954
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:53,640
what magic you'd stumbled

955
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:56,119
upon yeah so I think that was in

956
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,598
2018 was the first year I had grown the

957
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:02,000
seeds I created those seeds the lemon OG

958
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:04,318
to the paradise punch um in 2017 and

959
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,039
then in 2018 was the first year I grew

960
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:09,199
them and at that time I was putting some

961
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,719
of my product in the willly reserve jar

962
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:15,039
the Willie Nelson jar and um really

963
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,679
having fun participating with that crew

964
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:21,079
and learning about Willie Nelson and and

965
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:25,078
having our stuff in his jar and

966
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:28,039
um ended up with maybe 15 different

967
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,480
plants all a different variation at that

968
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,480
time we were still growing from seed and

969
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,119
the marketplace was a little hesitant

970
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,400
because what happened was growing from

971
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,160
seed every plant is a little bit

972
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,240
different right they're not identical

973
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:44,279
like growing from a clone eventually the

974
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,118
industry pushed back so hard on that

975
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,400
that many of us grow from clone now we

976
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,400
make we do feno hunts we make mother

977
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,480
plants and then if we like those we we

978
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,358
grow like a bed of that or or 10 plants

979
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,639
of that so at least the product looks

980
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:01,400
exactly the same that's going to be

981
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:04,480
going in the jar that I'm calling white

982
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,240
Thorn Rose and so what came about those

983
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,039
15 different phenos of the white Thorn

984
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:13,000
Rose was another strain that we renamed

985
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,039
called mom's weed so people ask me well

986
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,838
you got Mom's weed and you got white

987
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,480
Thorn Rose and they both say it's a

988
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:22,078
lemon OG crossed with um Paradise punch

989
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,119
like you must have made a mistake but

990
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,760
really it was just a different pheno of

991
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,039
the same cross and so we liked them both

992
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,680
so much that we kept them both and what

993
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,318
you'll notice really quickly is that all

994
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,199
the names here are from seeds that we

995
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,318
named ourselves are strains we named

996
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,159
ourselves and so they we have strains

997
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,039
like a MF because we went to Italy and

998
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,920
went to the mfi coast we named one after

999
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,719
my girlfriend's mom that passed away

1000
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,680
when she was 48 called Margie's magic

1001
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,879
her name was Margie um we had one that

1002
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,159
was called sweet Marlene my mother was

1003
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,358
marleene you know we just named them

1004
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:59,000
what we wanted to name them right and

1005
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,759
and then we really tried to educate the

1006
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,039
consumer why we did that instead of

1007
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,319
really trying to let them dictate what

1008
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,279
names were popular or whatever we just

1009
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,759
did what we wanted to do we grew what we

1010
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,560
wanted to grow and then we shared it

1011
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:17,560
with them and and really found a a

1012
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,639
little niche in in what they liked so

1013
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,920
yeah I don't know no that's that's

1014
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:23,920
beautiful and I too do the same thing

1015
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,680
you know I've I've actually got a few

1016
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,280
phenotypes of the same cross and I give

1017
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,480
them slightly different names and people

1018
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,319
always ask me they're like can't you

1019
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,639
just like col it down to the one that's

1020
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:34,480
better and you're like no they're

1021
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,679
different like that's that's why they're

1022
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,519
different and some PE and some people

1023
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:43,000
love moms weed better than they do white

1024
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:46,880
Thorn Rose and vice versa and it's truly

1025
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,960
amazing to have watched since 2018

1026
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,519
whitethorn Rose to its Evolution to

1027
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,400
today it's really taken a life of its

1028
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,800
own it's won like 20 different Awards in

1029
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,960

1030
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,200
different products with hash holes and

1031
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,240
vape pens and rosin and resin and bubble

1032
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,039
has and all the different things and and

1033
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,719
manufacturers are really having a fun

1034
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,920
time experimenting around and creating

1035
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:15,039
different products with a strain they've

1036
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,960
never seen before and um really is given

1037
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,440
a leg given us a leg up in the

1038
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,519
marketplace and the newest and the

1039
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,880
latest um I guess momentum that we've

1040
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,159
gotten with the right uh whitethorn Rose

1041
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,358
was when somebody that had came and

1042
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,879
visited my farm here took that white

1043
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,719
Thorn Rose back and shared it with a a

1044
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:41,160
comedian named Bert Cher and he's a

1045
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:43,439
pretty famous comedian out of LA and um

1046
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,799
he took it on one of his podcasts that

1047
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,599
has like three million viewers and you

1048
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,920
know he started yelling this is the best

1049
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,359
Trin in the world and like hundreds of

1050
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,559
people reached out to me where can I get

1051
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:57,199

1052
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,480
thing you know Tony Hawk smoking it and

1053
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,439
Tom sagira and all these famous people

1054
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,838
that I never even had heard about until

1055
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,159
then and um and then we got invited to

1056
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:11,519
his podcast me myself in in Ridgeline

1057
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,480
Farms Jason another award-winning farm

1058
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,920
that I I really work very closely with

1059
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,440
and grew up with and um it's kind of

1060
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,960
mutated since then and now we have done

1061
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,240
a across between his award-winning Lance

1062
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,720
and we cross it to the white Thorn Rose

1063
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:31,279
and Bert ker is going to feno hunt

1064
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:33,838
this year at his his house in LA and we

1065
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,119
actually did a mockup jar and we hope

1066
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,759
that he's going to accept our proposal

1067
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,318
to sell a Bert ker pheno hunt of a

1068
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,200
strain that we're going to name after

1069
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:46,480
his nickname the machine and so we're

1070
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:48,159
having fun doing what we're doing we

1071
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,159
don't know if any of it makes any sense

1072
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,199
or anything but as long as we're having

1073
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,838
fun and enjoying life and um living

1074
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,239
every day to the fullest I think you

1075
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,480
know that that's what life's all about

1076
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,799
wow you I feel like you must have a copy

1077
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,679
of my questions cuz you just answered

1078
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,559
about 10 of them in one go that was like

1079
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:08,639
no you you did it you're a mind reader

serial alcoholic funny guy though um is

1084
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,480
uh hugely involved in the mainstream

1085
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,519
comedian scene I guess I guess I was

1086
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,119
interested how did that connection

1087
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,838
initially happen who gave him the

1088
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,440
whitethorn rose that started it all

1089
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:34,039
so um Bert's

1090
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,760
sister's um boyfriend had come here with

1091
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:38,960
the

1092
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,319
ganier um program and for a tour and at

1093
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,679
the end of every tour I always save a

1094
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:46,119
bunch of product and and one of my

1095
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,440
highlights is sharing a bunch of product

1096
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:51,800
with people that got to hear my story

1097
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,920
got to hear you know stories of people

1098
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,680
that are on um the

1099
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,000
property and uh he went back and he

1100
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,879
actually shared it with bertt and Bert

1101
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,920
fell in love with it and then he started

1102
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,480
seeking it out and then when we went

1103
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,280
down to his podcast you know we bought

1104
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,400
him we brought tons of weed down to him

1105
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,960
and really hoping that um kind of have

1106
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,680
it on the schedule he's going to come up

1107
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,639
here um this summer and do a podcast on

1108
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:20,558
the farm um so just yeah just kind of

1109
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:23,719
riding the wave and got to go to the

1110
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:25,880
Chelsea Handler um comedy show a couple

1111
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:27,919
weeks ago and I passed her off a bunch

1112
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,079
of white Thorn Rose so she hasn't said

1113
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,318
anything about it but kind of exploring

1114
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,519
the comedian World there and getting a

1115
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:38,079
chance to share um our story and our

1116
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,519
Legacy sungrown strains with a whole

1117
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,280
different group of consumers so really

1118
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:46,318
stoked about that and um yeah yeah

1119
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,800
hugely hugely like the the amount of

1120
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,440
overlap between the Cannabis and the

1121
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,720
comedian scene is huge and when you

1122
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,280
think about it not that surprising I

1123
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,039
guess the question I thought when I was

1124
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,000
thinking about this appearance on

1125
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,400
bertcast and I'd encourage everyone to

1126
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,679
to go check it out it's a it's a great

1127
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,639
episode um what do you feel like this is

1128
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,159
a sign that we're becoming more and more

1129
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:07,000
mainstream or do you think it was just a

1130
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,719
lucky

1131
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,280
coincidence I I want to say it's a lucky

1132
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:15,879
coincidence but I am a firm believer

1133
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,599
that everything happens for a reason and

1134
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,039
um I've always

1135
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:25,119
felt from the very beginning that that

1136
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:27,079
we were going to do something amazing

1137
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,400
and amazing I don't mean by making a a

1138
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,599
whole bunch of money because money I

1139
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,480
know doesn't make people happy I was

1140
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,760
taught that from the age of 10 like

1141
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,599
never chase money because you'll never

1142
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,880
have enough there's always somebody that

1143
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,599
has more it will never make you happy it

1144
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,280
always make you feel hollow and yeah it

1145
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,800
does make you know paying the rent

1146
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,599
easier and it does make you know going

1147
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,359
to the grocery store yeah but it's

1148
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,480
really friends family and community that

1149
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:54,719
make you feel real and make you feel

1150
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,599
whole and um I still feel that same way

1151
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:01,519
today I don't know what part or what

1152
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:05,400
role Bert ker is playing in really

1153
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:07,318
uplifting our community um or sharing

1154
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,000
with the world the story of the Emerald

1155
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,079
Triangle small farmer and where a

1156
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,920
multi-billion dollar industry was

1157
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,280
created um but I I do feel like he has

1158
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,318
and he is going to play a bigger role in

1159
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,319
in really helping share our story and um

1160
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:25,558
really Greatful for

1161
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:27,318

Hill Farms on some of his comedy shows

1164
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,880
and um when he does that the response

1165
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,480
from people is always to reach out and

1166

DM us through Instagram and um so just

1167
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,400
really grateful that he even remembers

1168
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,598
to say it and that he's still smoking

1169
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,800
our weed and really want to uh give him

1170
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,559
something really special and and cool to

1171
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,839
um have fun with himself and let him

1172
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,839
grow his own yeah that that would be

1173
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,440
epic to see what comes from from his

1174
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,639
little hom grow earlier on in the answer

1175
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,519
you you mentioned you were uh involved

1176
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,960
with the Willie Nelson crew and I had

1177
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:06,480
seen on your Instagram there was a

1178
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,000
number of photos and before I'd figured

1179
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,519
out sort of what was going on I was like

1180
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,119
what's with the Willie Nelson Obsession

1181
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,759
so tell me a little bit about how you

1182
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:15,680
got involved with that crew and how your

1183
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,240
work ended up being in some of the jars

1184
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:23,199
of his brand so I started working really

1185
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,799
early with uh a company that thought

1186
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,318
they were going to be the world's

1187
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,720
largest sungrown cannabis company and uh

1188
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:33,519
really went out and started building

1189
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,000
their brand by representing small

1190
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:38,838
farmers of the Emerald Triangle they had

1191
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,358
five people in their company um when

1192
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:43,078
they first started in uh when they

1193
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:46,078
finally went out of business they had

1194
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:50,798
300 people in their company and so they

1195
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:54,559
ended up raising $300 million and along

1196
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:57,719
that um four years before they lost it

1197
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:01,119
all um they brought on

1198
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,959
Brands like the Willies Reserve which uh

1199
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,720
really Incorporated Willie Nelson and is

1200
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,960
his ideals in there and you know that

1201
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,598
team would come up here not Willie

1202
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,318
himself but his Willie The the Reserve

1203
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,079
team and they would look at all the

1204
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:18,920
flour and then the different Farms that

1205
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,798
they went to they would decide what flow

1206
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,280
they wanted Willie Nelson to actually

1207
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:24,400
taste and then they would bring a little

1208
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,440
bit back to him Willie would taste it

1209
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,599
and he was the chief tasting officer so

1210
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,079
at the end of the day he would decide

1211
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:33,359
what flower ended up going into his jar

1212
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:36,000
and the first year we grew legally he

1213
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,679
picked three out of our four strains and

1214
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,358
um you know got to go to some of his

1215
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:44,199
concert got to go backstage and just

1216
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:46,279
really admire that man for kind of the

1217
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,879
little bit that I know of him and what

1218
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:52,040
he went through and just his life

1219
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,000
Journey really was just truly amazing

1220
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:56,838
and hearing some of his stories and what

1221
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,760
he's been through and um just really

1222
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,838
respect that person a very lot and was

1223
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,799
happy to participate in the the small

1224
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,880
amount of time that I was with him our

1225
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:09,159
product also was introduced uh first

1226
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,838
year in 2018 at the

1227
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:13,480
Oscars so some of the biggest stars in

1228
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,798
the world it was in the gift bags the

1229
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,358
Huckleberry Hill joint and you know

1230
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:22,079
Denzel Washington Merill Street and all

1231
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:24,039
them got to smoke a a huckleberry joint

1232
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,000
um they never admitted it and they never

1233
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:29,159
showed it but it was in their gift bag

1234
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,440
so maybe they gave it away it was

1235
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,639
definitely uh a strain that was bred to

1236
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,318
the paradise punch I'm I'm not exactly

1237
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:38,199
sure which one it was I think we called

1238
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:40,719
it huckleberries but um it was it was

1239
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:43,519
definitely bread to Paradise punch yeah

1240
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:45,358
pretty cool that that's incredible while

1241
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,639
we're on the topic of awards you know

1242
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,639
you you touched on it a little bit

1243
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,879
earlier you've been picking up Awards

1244
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,798
left right and center and I tried to go

1245
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,760
over it last night quickly and I might

1246
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:57,719
have missed a few but you've won awards

1247
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,240
for your flower your bubble hash your

1248
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,679
concentrates your pre-rolls your Vapes

1249
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,519
you said many of these but I just wanted

1250
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,199
to verify you weren't you weren't being

1251
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,960
factious you've actually want awards for

1252
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,439
all of those categories I guess the

1253
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,480
question is what's the key like some

1254
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,400
people can pick up Awards in flour cuz

1255
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,639
maybe the strain is good as a flower but

1256
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,480
it's often not as good as a concentrate

1257
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,879
but it seems like your stuff is just

1258
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,119
nailing it across the board like how do

1259
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,358
you rationale it's been so successful is

1260
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,920
it the genetics is it the grow style

1261
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:30,480
what do you attribute it to

1262
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,119
that's a a good thing to recognize um

1263
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,920
because a lot of times either a strain

1264
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,880
is really good for for rosin or it's

1265
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,200
really good for flour and very rarely

1266
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,358
I've been told that you find something

1267
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:44,480
that's good for both and and and that

1268
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:48,159
happens to be what white Thorn Rose

1269
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,838
really does fulfill is is being both um

1270
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,399
demand huge demand for flow and rosin

1271
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:55,759
and all the other different byproducts

1272
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,400
that are made from it um I want to say

1273
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:02,160
it it has a to do with the the cultivar

1274
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,119
and those Legacy strains for sure but I

1275
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,679
I don't also want to take away um

1276
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:11,559
anything from the way a farmer

1277
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:15,480
grows um that flower um you know it's

1278
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:19,160
all about the TLC we don't dump liquid

1279
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:21,719
fertilizer into a into a a tank and and

1280
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:23,798
water it in usually it's all stuff

1281
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:26,558
really from the forest around us if it's

1282
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:31,159
not you know white Thorn or white thorn

1283
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:33,040
Bush mulch or uh Manzanita mulch or um

1284
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,759
you know I do a lot of top dressing with

1285
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,838
Dr Earth 444 you know everything's

1286
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,960
organic everything is kind of natural

1287
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,798
but I really like the idea of top

1288
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,760
dressing on a plant with you know like a

1289
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:48,239
dry Amendment so pretty much every time

1290
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,040
and I I I do have drippers on all the

1291
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,879
plants but I hand water every morning

1292
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,920
usually in the middle of the summer just

1293
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,200
because some need more water and some

1294
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,720
need less water and I want to have that

1295
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,159
ability not just to turn the water on

1296
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,719
and everything gets the same I want to

1297
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,318
have the ability to say okay this one

1298
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,759
looks pretty wet I might want to skip

1299
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:09,318
this one this time and let it dry out

1300
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:12,079
and so but anyways every time you water

1301
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:14,480
really um you're watering in just a

1302
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,000
small amount of of fertilizer so it's

1303
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,318
not getting this huge concentration of

1304
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,480
this big

1305
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:24,318
green synthetic fertilizer it's getting

1306
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,880
all natural consistent every time and I

1307
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:28,719
think the plants just respond to that

1308
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:32,039
better and I really want my

1309
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:34,798
flower good or bad to really taste like

1310
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,599
the place that it's grown in like I've

1311
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:40,400
I've shared some of my genetics like

1312
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:42,920
Mom's weed um moonmaid Farms over on the

1313
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,920
east side of the county who is somebody

1314
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:49,599
that I respect a lot excuse me

1315
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,920
um her mom's weed tastes totally

1316
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,119
different than my's mom's weed it looks

1317
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,119
fairly similar but it does definitely

1318
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,079
taste different and you know ridg line

1319
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,680
grows a few of my strains in can of

1320
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,960
country and hogwash farms and they're

1321
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:05,199
all really good Growers it's just it

1322
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,119
tastes different from the places I get a

1323
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,039
little influence a little fog from the

1324
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,599
ocean that comes over the hills where

1325
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:13,000
maybe the east side of the county

1326
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:15,240
doesn't and so all these different you

1327
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,239
know things that really are attributed

1328
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:20,159
to the Tera is what really affects the

1329
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,118
taste along with you know the way you

1330
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:26,000
nurture and take care of the plant and

1331
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:28,160
so um forgot what your question was but

1332
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,039
um it's really a combination of the

1333
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,598
farmer and that's why I always tell the

1334
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,358
consumer know your farmer know how

1335
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,440
they're

1336
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:36,719
cultivating really know who they are

1337
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,838
inside know if they support to Veterans

1338
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,199
and donate to Compassionate Care because

1339
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:42,039
I mean if you're looking for something

1340
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,078
that's going to make you feel amazing

1341
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:46,000
that's going to be good for you that

1342
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,039
maybe has some healing properties that

1343
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,559
can make an ailment that you have go

1344
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,239
away you kind of want to know the doctor

1345
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,519
that's working on your you right you

1346
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,959
want to know who's farming your stuff if

1347
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:59,318
you want to feel the the best possible

1348
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,838
way so knowing your farmer is the most

1349
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:04,639
and the best advice I can give to any

1350
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,400
consumer yeah 100% if you if you know

1351
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,199
where it's coming from it'll it'll make

1352
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,160
every follow-up question all that much

1353
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:12,000
easier and I just realized you know

1354
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,960
we're talking so much about the white

1355
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,239
Thorn Rose but there's probably some

1356
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,358
people out there especially those

1357
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:19,519
outside of the USA who have probably

1358
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,199
never had a chance to uh try it

1359
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,838
themselves just yet so just as a as a

1360
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:26,318
general sort of example how how would

1361
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:27,880
you describe it for someone who's never

1362
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,480
never had it I remember when I first

1363
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,720
smelt it I thought oh this is like a a

1364
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,000
much more complex version of forbidden

1365
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:39,318
fruit like real tropical fruit explosion

1366
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,798
really gorgeous sort of fruity smells

1367
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:42,480
how would you describe it to someone who

1368
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:46,000
hasn't encountered it

1369
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,679
yet um I would agree with that and uh

1370
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,639
you know it's been explained to me like

1371
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:54,838
words like kind of grapefruity like um a

1372
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,318
tinge of grapefruit or um the one the I

1373
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,759
guess one of the things that I know

1374
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,199
noticed right off when I smoked white

1375
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,960
Thorn Rose and really went whoa this is

1376
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,879
this is something cool is really the

1377
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,480
flavor of that joint all the way down to

1378
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,039
the very last hit tasted amazing it

1379
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,838
wasn't like oh half the joint tasted

1380
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,240
good and then the rest tasted sort of

1381
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,358
shabby it just tasted really good really

1382
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:21,239
fruity you could put it down and pick it

1383
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,880
up and it still tasted amazing and

1384
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:25,959
that's kind of what's lingered with me

1385
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,400
and um and most people describe it as

1386
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,318
something just that they haven't

1387
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:33,680
experienced before something so unique

1388
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:36,920
and different and just uh in combination

1389
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:39,960
with hearing the story of this place and

1390
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,480
how it came to be maybe affects the way

1391
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,280
people really enjoy it too and so

1392
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:48,159
knowing the story really before you

1393
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,599
smoke it really enables you after you

1394
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:53,440
smoked a little bit to really imagine

1395
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,440
the journey that we've been on to get to

1396
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,079
this

1397
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,880
point certainly so certainly and look we

1398
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:01,798
we've heard a lot about how it really

1399
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,119
thrives Outdoors uh the majority of our

1400
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:06,318
listeners I think are probably more

1401
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:10,200
indoor orientated how does it perform

1402
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:12,000
indoors never tried it I love that I

1403
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,439
don't know anybody that's ever tried it

1404
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
inside and so that that's curious there

1405
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,519
was there was several indoor operators

1406
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,719
that have reached out to me there's been

1407
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:23,480
some big giant companies that have

1408
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:26,279
reached out to me to want to license it

1409
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,559
um most of them want to license it so

1410
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,240
they can take it down to Southern

1411
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:32,440
California grow it more commercially

1412
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,279
like with tractors and and you know I

1413
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,639
always tried to explain to these bigger

1414
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,720
companies that it won't be the same it's

1415
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,358
not going to taste the same the thing

1416
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,759
that you think you love about it and the

1417
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:43,920
reason you want it so much won't be

1418
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,240
there and you'll probably be

1419
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,318
disappointed

1420
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,399
so and that's a little bit of a

1421
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:54,318
hindrance as a as a such a small farm

1422
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,480
there's really a limited amount of it

1423
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:59,119
that we're growing and yeah I just it

1424
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,719
and let uh hogwash farms grow it on his

1425
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,480
farm we grow really similar same inputs

1426
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,480
he's always coming over here I'm going

1427
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,318
over there you know it's like an

1428
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,318
extension of Huckleberry Hill over there

1429
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,000
and um he's another grower that really

1430
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:15,719
just is very passionate about what he

1431
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,679
does so I felt okay doing that and I've

1432
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:20,639
even smoked his and I can't tell the

1433
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:22,078
difference between his or mine so um

1434
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:25,038
yeah so we're just trying to figure out

1435
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,798
how to navigate this business and really

1436
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:30,079
make it work for a lot of people and get

1437
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:32,679
it into as many consumers hands as

1438
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,760
possible yeah certainly look the

1439
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:37,000
challenges of scaling up is something we

1440
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,079
talk with many guests about you've

1441
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,679
referenced a few different um you know

1442
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,079
really fantastically reputable uh

1443
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:45,960
collaborators in the area and the one I

1444
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,559
wanted to touch on for sure is Ridgeline

1445
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,838
as you mentioned you know they're

1446
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:51,400
extremely well known in the industry I

1447
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:53,480
think almost every time I've been to the

1448
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,318
emerald cup they've come first second or

1449
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,119
third in multiple categories they

1450
00:58:55,318 --> 00:59:00,079
absolutely C rush it how did this uh

1451
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:01,960
friendship first start and how did it

1452
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,000
evolve into the collaboration you're

1453
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:08,199
moving into

1454
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,318
now I grew up with Jason who's Ridgeline

1455
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:13,159
and uh it was always kind of a little

1456
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:15,119
battle between we're on the west side of

1457
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:17,159
the county and he's on the east side of

1458
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,640
the county so it was kind of the west

1459
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:21,879
side of this Hill Country versus the

1460
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,719
east side and who could grow more and

1461
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,079
who had the better strain so it was

1462
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:28,318
always a friendly competition not only

1463
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,039
drawing weed but with fishing like when

1464
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,679
we had our boats out in the ocean who

1465
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:36,880
caught the biggest fish or who caught

1466
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:40,719
the most fish and um once we went legal

1467
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,798
and we got a little bit older um we just

1468
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:45,480
really

1469
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:49,280
started relying on one another to try to

1470
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:52,798
navigate the legal market and how to to

1471
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:56,440
run a business and um he's just a really

1472
00:59:52,798 --> 01:00:00,000
kind person good heart um good human

1473
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,838
being um and our value system is the

1474
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,199
same and he just isn't really about

1475
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:06,558
excuse me he's not really about the

1476
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:09,279
money he's about you know making people

1477
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,798
happy and and you know having fun doing

1478
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,200
it because we only go around once and so

1479
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:16,440
we we're very fortunate to to work

1480
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:18,519
really closely with together we're very

1481
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,880
fortunate to have won a lot of awards

1482
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:24,759
and um I'm just as happy for him to win

1483
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:27,960
an award as I am for myself to win one

1484
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:31,000
and um I think it's vice versa too

1485
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,720
so um yeah really cool guy you should

1486
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,519
definitely try some of his legacy

1487
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:37,798
strains and he's a second generation

1488
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,759
cannabis farmer he grew with his dad and

1489
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:43,440
his dad was was hauled off one year in a

1490
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,640
a camp helicopter during a raid and he

1491
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,400
was coming home on a school bus and you

1492
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:49,480
know he watched his dad he heard his

1493
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,000
house was getting raid and his dad you

1494
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,358
know was hauled away in a in a

1495
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,760
helicopter with you know AR-15s and so

1496
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:59,558
that kind of stuff is traumatized and at

1497
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,000
the same time very um bonding to those

1498
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:05,920
people that are um that that have gone

1499
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,159
through that with you and so um we have

1500
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,798
that much in common and um really trust

1501
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:13,920
each other yeah wow that's that's so

1502
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:16,519
interesting to hear you have that common

1503
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,480
sort of experience as a as a young

1504
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:20,440
person being really affected by those

1505
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,679
those raids that's that's really

1506
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,920
powerful and I guess just to follow up

1507
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,519
you know you've got this new collab

1508
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,760
that's going down with the Lance and the

1509
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:31,199
white Thorn Rose tell us a little bit

1510
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,520
about what sort of things people might

1511
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,480
expect to find in those seeds if they're

1512
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,239
interested in grabbing

1513
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,519
some well um they're they're going to

1514
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,318
need to know that it might be a while

1515
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:46,038
because we haven't offered those

1516
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:48,079
particular seeds to the public yet um

1517
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:50,200
you know we we both work with the same

1518
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,240
seed company that Tangled Roots

1519
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,519
store.com um he has released you know

1520
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:58,439
some award-winning genetics like the

1521
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:01,798
green Lantern um I think his ridg line

1522
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,559
runs that one Emerald cup um are on that

1523
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:07,920
site you know and I have a couple

1524
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:09,960
Creations that I released um but really

1525
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,639
we want to grow and experiment around

1526
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,039
with all these new strains for multiple

1527
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,118
years before we you know torture

1528
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,278
somebody's Harvest by giving them

1529
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,160
something that turns out terrible so

1530
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:24,798
it's still in the evolution process

1531
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,440
Bert's going to be part of that process

1532
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:28,798
in pheno hunting

1533
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,920
and there's four or five different

1534
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:34,719
phenos of the machine of the Lance white

1535
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,599
Thorn rose that we're trying to evaluate

1536
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,558
to see which one we like and ultimately

1537
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,440
at the end of the day if if Bert wants

1538
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,920
to participate he's going to be the one

1539
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,519
that really chooses the one that's going

1540
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,960
to go in the jar um there'll be a

1541
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,880
limited amount of jars and um yeah it'll

1542
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:55,440
be something special it's it's it's

1543
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:57,400
really purple um it's really fruity um

1544
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,798
yeah have we haven't tested it you know

1545
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,639
in the California labs yet to to really

1546
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:05,318
know how it tests

1547
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:07,358
out but uh yeah pretty excited and

1548
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:09,639
having fun with it

1549
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,199
nonetheless yeah hugely we'll we'll all

1550
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:13,159
have to watch and keep an eye on it to

1551
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,399
see when it becomes available and you

1552
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:17,199
just mentioned something which really uh

1553
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,720
got my brain going which is you

1554
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:21,399
mentioned you know it's fruity it's

1555
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,118
purple it's what people like and I'm I'm

1556
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,960
interested to hear the thoughts of our

1557
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,680
guests about what they feel are some of

1558
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,798
the necessary components to make a

1559
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,480
strain popular these days and some of

1560
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:34,239
the most recent guests we've had on have

1561
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,119
all pretty unanimously said that they

1562
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:37,838
feel like uh for something to be really

1563
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:39,720
commercially popular at the moment has

1564
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,318
to have a degree of purple to it whereas

1565
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:42,879
in the past that had fallen off you know

1566
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:45,278
we went through the purple age in the

1567
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,039
early 2000s feels like it's coming back

1568
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:50,039
a bit in your mind what are some of the

1569
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:53,079
components that you think need to be

1570
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:57,039
there to hit that current popular

1571
01:03:53,079 --> 01:04:00,160
Market um definitely needs to be purple

1572
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:03,720
like purple is in like it could be gone

1573
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:06,118
next year but this year it is like is it

1574
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:09,879
purple that's almost the first question

1575
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:12,920
um you know purple and gassy is really a

1576
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:15,440
popular thing um even though I most of

1577
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,720
my strains aren't gassy a lot of

1578
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:21,400
Ridgeline strains are a little bit more

1579
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:24,078
on the gassy side um but what what what

1580
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,920
to be honest what has really happened

1581
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,240
over the last six seven eight years with

1582
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,798
both Ridgeline and and Huckleberry Hill

1583
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:35,199
and even Cana country and hogwash Farms

1584
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:38,519
is those consumers have really built a

1585
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:40,558
trust system with us and so it almost

1586
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:43,079
doesn't matter if it's green purple

1587
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,400
gassy fruity whatever we put in their

1588
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:50,839
jars they know has really gone through

1589
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:53,318
our evaluation system or techniques that

1590
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:55,078
they have resonated with and maybe liked

1591
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:57,358
if they continue to purchase our product

1592
01:04:55,079 --> 01:05:00,160
so it's doesn't matter what we put in in

1593
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:02,679
our jars so much and what what is really

1594
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,879
important for consumers to know is it's

1595
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,318
at the end of the day really up to them

1596
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,318
what makes them feel good so if you ever

1597
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:12,199
run into a farmer that says I grow the

1598
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:14,358
best that's when you want to run because

1599
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:16,798
what makes me feel good might not make

1600
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:19,239
you feel good our endoc canabo system is

1601
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,440
made up differently so Tarpin and

1602
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:23,558
cannabinoids of the cannabis plants are

1603
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,760
going to affect each one of us totally

1604
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:28,000
different so I can never say hey White

1605
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,480
Thorn Rose is the best but I can say

1606
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,838
white Thorn Rose a lot of people have

1607
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,838
had amazing experience you should try it

1608
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:36,920
and if that doesn't work maybe pick up

1609
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:39,000
some ridgel line because we're circling

1610
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,400
back to knowing your farmer and really

1611
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
the most important thing to know is how

1612
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,720
they cultivated the product that you're

1613
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,719
about to put in your body and so really

1614
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:50,798
that's the most important thing yeah

1615
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,558
100% you you got to know how it's grown

1616
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,119
and uh you know I forgot to mention

1617
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,920
earlier I'm a DI hard organic Sky myself

1618
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,680
as well so so it's beautiful to hear

1619
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,159
that's how you do it out of curiosity

1620
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:05,480
when when Brands like yourself are just

1621
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,639
so highly prized by the consumer base it

1622
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,000
can actually be almost hard for people

1623
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:12,118
to get their hands on the product what

1624
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,760
sort of reach does your product have at

1625
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,760
the moment is it fairly limited because

1626
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,720
there is such high demand in the local

1627
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,440
area or what's your thoughts on your

1628
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:25,159
reach at the moment it it is very it is

1629
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:28,039
very limited in how far south that it it

1630
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:31,000
kind of able to reach um more so just

1631
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:34,240
because I work with a a kid Chris

1632
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,920
Anderson with redwood Roots who um

1633
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,919
started a Distribution Company and the

1634
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,519
state of California makes us go through

1635
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,838
distribution companies to sell to retail

1636
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:45,358
right so um I wanted to work with

1637
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:49,000
somebody that I trusted somebody that

1638
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:51,679
you know I grew up with and um Chris is

1639
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,039
that that person and he has like three

1640
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:57,358
people in his company he only has the

1641
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:59,760
ability to you know drive the van down

1642
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:01,719
to to La once in a while so it doesn't

1643
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,000
even really make it to San Diego there

1644
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:07,118
are companies like Nabis that give the

1645
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,278
farmer the ability to you know pay

1646
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,200
monthly fees and to do this and they'll

1647
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:14,880
deliver anywhere in California within a

1648
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:16,358
couple days and and that's an option um

1649
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,680
but I'm trying to give Chris with

1650
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:20,920
redwood Ruth the opportunity to to

1651
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:23,000
figure it all out and to kind of be on

1652
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,000
the journey with us and or us be on the

1653
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,880
journey with him and and figure it out

1654
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,000
together um yeah so it's we we sell out

1655
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,400
all of our product

1656
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,920
all luckily every year unfortunately a

1657
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,720
lot of people in San Diego and a little

1658
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,358
bit in in La don't get a chance to get

1659
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:45,000
it unless they come

1660
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:46,519
north yeah fair enough but you know what

1661
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,838
like it's it's a testament and it's

1662
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:51,400
almost like uh good for brand promotion

1663
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,480
because you know I'm sure you've learned

1664
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,039
this yourself if if people have to work

1665
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,880
hard to get it they're going to Value it

1666
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,520
more someone from La driving up your way

1667
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,160
I'm sure they're just going to be riding

1668
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,759
High the whole way home because it just

1669
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:04,960
makes it that little bit extra sweet

1670
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,720
that they put the effort in but I want

1671
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,838
to loop back to your breeding just for a

1672
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:11,959
moment um and just talk a little bit

1673
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:13,639
about like the future you know we've

1674
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,599
mentioned the the collaboration with

1675
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:17,719
Ridgeline runs but I wanted to know

1676
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,119
what's what's your sort of um Vision

1677
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:22,079
moving forward with the genetics and as

1678
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:23,640
a quick followup is there any new

1679
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:24,798
genetics or just things that you've seen

1680
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,400
recently that you're thinking oh I

1681
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,119
wouldn't mind in incorporating that into

1682
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:31,439
some of my

1683
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:32,960
lines yeah I you know I did a this last

1684
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,318
year I did a few different

1685
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,239
collaborations like the one with

1686
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:40,239
Ridgeline I also did a project with you

1687
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:42,519
know everybody wants to participate

1688
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:46,000
luckily with the white Thorn Rose and so

1689
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:48,040
I'm pretty selective on you know who

1690
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,439
those people are and you know it's

1691
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:53,119
usually people that I grew up with and

1692
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:56,318
um one of those peoples is is Ted Blair

1693
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:59,000
with Cana country farms um who also has

1694
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,880
a lot of award-winning cultivars some of

1695
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,079
them that only test 16% like the Cana

1696
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,359
country 26 that won quite a few Awards

1697
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:11,318
too and so I had smoked some of his Cana

1698
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:13,319
country 38 and all his are numbers right

1699
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:16,880
because he doesn't want to give them

1700
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:18,719
names until he pheno hunts the ones out

1701
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,920
that are amazing and then he'll name

1702
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,759
them different

1703
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,399
So currently we're all just on numbers

1704
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:27,479
but um Cana country 38 was one that I

1705
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:29,559
tried last year something that he bred

1706
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,399
at his place that I don't even actually

1707
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,199
know the cross with but it was so

1708
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:36,039
amazing and so he brought me over some

1709
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:39,158
pauland last year and we BR it to the

1710
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:41,479
whitethorn the whitethorn rose and uh I

1711
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:43,439
did a little feno hunt in my garage this

1712
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:46,119
this winter with along with Ridgeline

1713
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,838
and um that's a really amazing one and I

1714
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:51,399
think we're going to call that Country

1715
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:53,359
Rose um kind of like the Sun or the song

1716
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:55,599
and then you know can of country country

1717
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:58,039
Rose and thought that was an amazing

1718
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,400
name and if if Bert doesn't end up

1719
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:02,198
naming uh or want to participate with

1720
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:04,679
the machine we're going to name that

1721
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,359
Ridgeline Rose and just put the same

1722
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,158
product in a different you know with a

1723
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:12,399
different name um because we think it's

1724
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:14,960
amazing and so yeah for this year um I I

1725
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:17,119
don't have any big plans this year yet I

1726
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,039
would love to cross the white Thorn rose

1727
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,158
with the Cana country

1728
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,880
26

1729
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:25,799
um and yeah I guess we'll see we always

1730
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,800
we always kind of midseason after we get

1731
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,079
everything planted then focus our

1732
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,560
attention on okay what am I going to get

1733
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:35,279
and what am I going to breed to and um

1734
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,560
there was a lot of uh demand for the

1735
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:40,920
white Thorn rose that we cross with

1736
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:43,400
rs1 I I sold out on all those seeds

1737
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,359
within a like three or four days I never

1738
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:49,639
even grew any of them like I don't even

1739
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:51,359
know they could all be winners um so uh

1740
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,800
probably I'll do that one again maybe

1741
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:56,439
keep a few for myself to grow um but

1742
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,239
yeah I don't I don't I'm not yet I

1743
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:01,238
haven't pivoted to to being in that

1744
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:03,479
mental state yet to to figure out what

1745
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:06,279
I'm going to cross but going to

1746
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:08,079
definitely do it no that that's awesome

1747
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:09,279
and as like a bit of an extension of

1748
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,880
that and referencing what you just

1749
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:15,319
mentioned I I noticed on sites that that

1750
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,800
sell your uh seeds there was actually a

1751
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:19,319
nice variation of crosses there and

1752
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,400
there was ones like you know that used

1753
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:24,359
the mom's weed um and and a few other of

1754
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,799
those Legacy strains but as you just

1755
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:28,119
referenced there was also some really

1756
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,440
modern stuff like some rs1 cross white

1757
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:32,399
Thorn Rose I was wondering is this a

1758
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:34,079
conscious decision to do a bit of both

1759
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:35,599
or does it just happen to work out that

1760
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,639
way that you do a bit of the hype stuff

1761
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,400
a bit of the Legacy stuff I was doing a

1762
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:43,679
little bit of the hype stuff because I

1763
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:46,079
got some of those um those clones from

1764
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,880
friends of mine that were growing those

1765
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:49,399
commercial strains and so they always

1766
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,199
had extras and I said hey give me one of

1767
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:53,679
those RS 11s or give me one of this or

1768
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:55,759
give me one of that um and then I also

1769
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,480
had you know some leftover mom's weed

1770
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,480
that I was able to breed with kind of

1771
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,079
was second guessing myself on was that

1772
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,879
the right move to let the the mom's weed

1773
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:06,639
cross with Paradise P like there's a

1774
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,639
winner in there somebody's gonna have to

1775
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:11,800
find it somebody's gonna have to hunt it

1776
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:14,159
and I'm am really having a great time um

1777
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,800
sharing that journey of other people

1778
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,638
that I don't even know phenoh hunting my

1779
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,159
strains that I haven't even grown before

1780
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,840
like um there is one that we found we

1781
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:25,479
did a little pheno hunt last year of the

1782
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,319
paradise Pine that we did release too

1783
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:29,799
and I've been watching this guy that I

1784
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:31,519
don't even know he he's been showing me

1785
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,000
all the different fenos that he has

1786
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:37,239
growing indoor and there's some just

1787
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,479
amazing ones and and we actually Cherry

1788
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:42,439
Picked a couple really good amazing

1789
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,319
Paradise Pine here that we're doing some

1790
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:46,319
um rosin with entered it into the

1791
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,759
emerald Cup this year with a company

1792
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:50,679
named iy who that really takes a lot of

1793
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:53,119
pride in what they do and they always

1794
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:55,239
use a lot of our white Thorn Rose too so

1795
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,039
um keep an eye out for Paradise Pine I

1796
01:12:55,238 --> 01:13:00,119
think that's a sneaker that's going to

1797
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:02,639
be another staple uh cultivar here that

1798
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:06,119
we grow at Huckleberry and in hogwash

1799
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:08,199
farms and this year uh I actually am

1800
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:10,679
sharing some of those genetics with

1801
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:14,359
another really really really good farmer

1802
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:16,639
called uh mat sunr and uh mat Valley

1803
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:19,559
sunr and that's Dylan mat he's been out

1804
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:21,400
at um over the mountain for 50 years on

1805
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,719
that same piece of property so should

1806
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:27,759
check him out too he grows amazing stuff

1807
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:29,520
and um really good guy too yeah that

1808
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,639
that's awesome to hear Paradise Pine

1809
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,520
everyone keep your eyes out for it it's

1810
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:35,039
it's going to creep up while we're on

1811
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,719
the topic of genetics I wanted to just

1812
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,960
quickly throw it out there are you much

1813
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:42,319
of a sativa guy yourself or you more

1814
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,079
just into the indicas no I I prefer

1815
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:45,799
actually like a you know most of the the

1816
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:47,679
strains that we're doing nowadays are

1817
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,000
like hybrids so you know there's a

1818
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,600
little this and a little that and but um

1819
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,520
the Margie magic is a a really cool um

1820
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,159
strain it's more of like a a sativa

1821
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,360
hybrid and I really enjoy that from time

1822
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:04,879
to time it's you know got that really

1823
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:09,639
cool um after taste it's it's more of a

1824
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,639
like a jack herrer um blue dreamy um and

1825
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:14,039
I either find that people really love

1826
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:16,520
Margie's magic or they're just like

1827
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:19,439
really burnt out on it like that was a

1828
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:21,639
strain that was more in the 80s that was

1829
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:23,960
really something that we just we did so

1830
01:14:21,639 --> 01:14:25,400
much of that it just kind of overwhelmed

1831
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,399
people they didn't even want it any more

1832
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:29,000
so a lot of my friends say oh that's the

1833
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:32,158
charity no we don't we're don't we don't

1834
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,039
want any of that but um a a lot of uh

1835
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:37,198
the Reta the consumers at the retail

1836
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:40,359
level really love Margie's magic and we

1837
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:41,839
grow uh we grow 15 pounds of that a year

1838
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:44,000
we put it in a thousand different

1839
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,719
quarter jars and that's all we do a year

1840
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,679
and that's what we're going to do we

1841
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,639
don't do too much we don't do too little

1842
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,119
we just that that's a staple thousand

1843
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:54,480
jars that's that's brilliant You' you've

1844
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:56,000
just reminded me because you know you

1845
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,000
you referenced how that one's been

1846
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,158
around for quite a while I wanted to

1847
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,359
just quickly loop back to when you were

1848
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:04,198
younger you you mentioned your early

1849
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:06,399
experiences with cannabis helping your

1850
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:08,359
parents in the garden and sort of having

1851
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:10,799
that really organic introduction to it

1852
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:13,119
all I forgot to ask you what was the

1853
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,320
first strain you ever actually smoked

1854
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,158
was it one of the ones you're working

1855
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:18,920
with now or just one of the ones back

1856
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:22,399
then it was uh it was one called Fruit

1857
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:26,920
Loops that my original the one you know

1858
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:29,319
um my mom was Catholic and so she was a

1859
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:32,079
even though we grew pot it she was her

1860
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:34,119
her her parents were really straight and

1861
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:37,238
you know really strict

1862
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:39,439
and even though she wasn't super strict

1863
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:42,479
and we moved up to the country and did

1864
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:44,238
our own thing um you know I didn't

1865
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,638
really drink in front of her and I

1866
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,959
didn't smoke in front of her but you

1867
01:15:46,639 --> 01:15:51,319
know every so often maybe I you know if

1868
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,760
a bud fell off one of the plants into my

1869
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:56,119
hand and you know I took it and to a

1870
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,600
party or something um you know that's

1871
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:01,639
what I first experim experimented around

1872
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,120
with was was the Froot Loop strain wow

1873
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:05,400
that that's so cool that you you're

1874
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:07,679
still smoking on you know the The Strain

1875
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:10,079
that you first ever puffed on I guess as

1876
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,399
a out of curiosity we we talk about this

1877
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,880
idea of like genetic deterioration over

1878
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,719
the years have you noticed any

1879
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:20,760
difference in it yeah I was just going

1880
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:24,639
you read my mind um because yeah I think

1881
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,760
um there was one point that I did notice

1882
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:28,520
a little deterioration I don't know if

1883
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,440
maybe you know there's things called

1884
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:36,440
russed mites and Broad mites and now

1885
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:37,198
they have uh ex hop Lon vir vroid and

1886
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:40,198
you

1887
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:42,559
know even though I've been able to avoid

1888
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:44,839
a lot of that stuff because all the Gen

1889
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:48,080
I don't really take genetics in here

1890
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:50,279
except maybe an rs11 and um there was

1891
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:51,760
one year I took one strain in that I did

1892
01:16:50,279 --> 01:16:54,920
some breeding with that maybe I

1893
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,360
introduced something that maybe affected

1894
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:01,000
some of my plants and so I I did start I

1895
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:03,839
had some Paradise punch seeds and I did

1896
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,279
restart a whole bunch and I pheno hunted

1897
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,639
one that I thought was exactly the same

1898
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:11,238
and kind of started over and I think I

1899
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:14,760
think I ended up with the better end of

1900
01:17:11,238 --> 01:17:17,279
the deal I think that after that long of

1901
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,199
cutting off those this the not the same

1902
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,319
mother because I'm always making new

1903
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:24,039
mothers but I do think there was some

1904
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:26,519
kind of deterioration and I haven't ex

1905
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:28,760
explored too much around with doing like

1906
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,560
tissue cultures which I heard can

1907
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:33,600
Revitalize that and and help with that

1908
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:37,080
and don't know a whole lot about that

1909
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,880
kind of stuff and um but I'm I'm really

1910
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:41,198
happy with where they're at and I feel

1911
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,239
like the genetics are still really

1912
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,960
strong and um maybe I'll have to explore

1913
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:49,279
that another time but I I always have

1914
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:51,439
these seeds of of kind of those genetics

1915
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:53,238
and I could always reeno hunt something

1916
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:56,079
real similar or something that I really

1917
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:57,879
like so yeah yeah certainly no we we've

1918
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,800
spoke to many guests who have done

1919
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:02,199
similar things maybe they make some s1s

1920
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,199
and rehunt something from there and it's

1921
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:05,960
certainly an issue people encounter when

1922
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:08,479
you when you're maintaining genetics for

1923
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,000
such a long period of time I I was a

1924
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,039
little bit curious and you may not know

1925
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,800
the answer did your parents ever talk to

1926
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:15,399
you about where they got the genetics

1927
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:19,039
from because they must have been getting

1928
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:22,759
some of the early stuff I imagine

1929
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:25,880
right yeah that's funny um yeah so when

1930
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:29,119
we moved here um you know we got some of

1931
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:31,760
those genetics um from our neighbors and

1932
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:34,279
stuff and um you know there was all this

1933
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,560
variation of different there was like so

1934
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:39,079
many different phenos and basically my

1935
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,760
mom found one that she liked and don't

1936
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:44,679
exactly really know where it kind of

1937
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,880
came from or who our neighbor got it

1938
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:48,520
from but ended up with that and it ended

1939
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,359
up being pretty stable and we kind of

1940
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,679
utilized that and then named kind of

1941
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:56,880
considered it ours after a while and

1942
01:18:53,679 --> 01:19:01,840
there is um one other genetic we called

1943
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:04,039
it the uh the number 21 and um it was

1944
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,719
one when my dad was out partying pretty

1945
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:08,479
hard and I was a really young kid he had

1946
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:10,760
taken me to a friend of his place and

1947
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:13,319
they were rolling up a joint and a seed

1948
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,880
had rolled out of the Rolling tray into

1949
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:17,399
the bottom of this box and I was really

1950
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,119
I think I was like nine or 10 or

1951
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:23,238
whatever and I had picked up that seed

1952
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:26,559
and put it in my pocket and took it home

1953
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:29,559
and then we started it and my mom said

1954
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,760
oh yeah we'll try that and it ended up

1955
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:36,520
being amazing and so we made a bunch of

1956
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:39,000
seeds out of it and long story short I

1957
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:42,000
still have like um trell ended up

1958
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,679
remodeling his house and in the wall of

1959
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,158
his house he found a bunch of those 21

1960
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:50,359
seeds that I had given him 40 years ago

1961
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:53,079
and so he gave those back to me I've

1962
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:56,000
tried every different technique to try

1963
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:58,960
to get one to pop get one to sprout I

1964
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,359
can't do it I have like maybe 15 of

1965
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,158
those left not wanting to keep trying

1966
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:06,319
because I had so many failures of so

1967
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:09,238
many like waiting for somebody to have

1968
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:12,000
some kind of new advanced technology

1969
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:14,519
that can scoop the tissue out of it and

1970
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,119
and Revitalize it but I remember that as

1971
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:20,400
a kid just being another amazing just

1972
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:22,479
great strain so I'm hoping somebody

1973
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,238
either has some knowledge that I don't

1974
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,238
yet or can steer me in the right

1975
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:29,119
direction or something develops

1976
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:31,238
so yeah 100% I think there's a there's a

1977
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:32,399
lot of people waiting for that sort of

1978
01:20:31,238 --> 01:20:34,718
what do they call it the uh the

1979
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,920
artificial embryo to sort of come out

1980
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,359
and to to help bring back some of this

1981
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,960
killer old stuff and you know Kudos Fe

1982
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:43,359
to recognizing that we just need to hang

1983
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,719
on to these last ones and wait till we

1984
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,920
get the right Tech at hand if we fast

1985
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:49,359
forward back to sort of the modern era

1986
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,319
from you know having a bit of a

1987
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,799
reflection on the past I'd love to ask

1988
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:55,599
you a lot of the guests who come on the

1989
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,960
show talk about how over the past say

1990
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,440
five or more years there's been a big

1991
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,319
Market shift for people wanting almost

1992
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:05,960
exclusively feminized seeds when you

1993
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:08,119
talk to Growers do you notice any clear

1994
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:10,039
preference over regular versus feminized

1995
01:21:08,119 --> 01:21:13,679
and you yourself do you have any

1996
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:16,880
preference so I do you know with the SE

1997
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:19,440
with the little seed business do see a

1998
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,600
greater demand for feminized seeds just

1999
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:25,000
because typically I think people that

2000
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:27,639
don't have um a lot of experience it

2001
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,719
just eliminates a step for them from

2002
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:32,760
making a mistake right you know they

2003
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:35,279
know it's a female they can do it but it

2004
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:39,199
also for my friends none of us grow

2005
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:42,000
femin seeds like they they're a little

2006
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:44,279
bit um it can I should let me say this

2007
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,760
differently it can they can be a little

2008
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:49,399
bit unstable and you know they can shoot

2009
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,360
out a little you know male flower here

2010
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:55,000
or there or I've had some little

2011
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:58,079
disasters happen um with femin seeds

2012
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,840
before so none of us really grow our

2013
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,359
whole crop we might grow one or two

2014
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,360
feminized seeds and there are some you

2015
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:06,319
know breeders like humble seed company

2016
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:10,399
that really has done a lot of

2017
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:13,119
experimenting Nat and and hie um have

2018
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:16,238
done experiments with that a lot more

2019
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:18,439
and have refined it to really isolate

2020
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:21,718
some of those staer genetics where they

2021
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:23,519
they're pretty successful at it um I

2022
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,279
don't think I've graduated to that point

2023
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,960
and I would really hate to to ruin ruin

2024
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:31,238
somebody's crop so the only feminized

2025
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,960
seeds that I do are ones that you know

2026
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:34,839
I've played around with that I feel very

2027
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,359
comfortable with but I still don't

2028
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:40,679
really grow those or too many of those

2029
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:42,639
on my farm now that's understandable and

2030
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:44,960
um as as a follow-up i' love to ask all

2031
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,719
of our guests without being able to know

2032
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,520
anything about the grower because I know

2033
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,239
that the intuitive answer is oh I'd want

2034
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,320
to talk to them a bit but if you could

2035
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,678
only recommend one of your strains to

2036
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:55,359
someone and just think look this is an

2037
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,399
allrounder most people are going to be

2038
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:02,238
really happy with it what would you

2039
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:04,719
recommend to grow yeah to grow Paradise

2040
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:08,359
Pine there you go you're you're solid

2041
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:10,520
Paradise Pine there's a 100% not even I

2042
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:12,279
mean I'm growing two of the the very

2043
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:17,040
exact seeds that I'm selling on the

2044
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:19,800
there is I I I'm I'm I'm almost I'm not

2045
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:22,079
greedy I want people to grow amazing

2046
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,800
strains there's a winner there's

2047
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,319
something that's better than white Thorn

2048
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,320
Rose in those Paradise Pine seeds I I

2049
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,000
know it I feel it I when I smoked the

2050
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:33,799
rosin that was made out of the paradise

2051
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:36,600
Pine um I had believed and because the

2052
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:39,440
emerald cup got pushed back that um

2053
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:43,199
Paradise pine rosin from ippy was going

2054
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:46,599
to Dethrone the white Thorn Rose and um

2055
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:49,879
I I still believe it it is a very unique

2056
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:52,639
flavor um and I have pheno hunted the

2057
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:54,600
very one that I like it does it is a

2058
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,279
pretty good yielder for the the

2059
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:59,280
manufacturer so they're pretty happy

2060
01:23:56,279 --> 01:24:01,559
with it and um I got really high host

2061
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,399
for it white Thorn Rose seems like it

2062
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:07,400
will always have a place here on this

2063
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:10,198
Farm it is unique it's it's some

2064
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:13,000
people's favorite strain ever and they

2065
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:15,439
have said such kind words to me that I

2066
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:19,238
would never not want to have it here to

2067
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:22,198
offer to them um and it's really just a

2068
01:24:19,238 --> 01:24:25,759
reflection of my mother and her kindness

2069
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:29,119
and really who she was as a person and

2070
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:31,639
so um I feel very honored to have that

2071
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:33,158
and feel lucky that I stumbled upon it

2072
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:34,199
and I probably don't really truly

2073
01:24:33,158 --> 01:24:37,238
deserve

2074
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:39,238
it oh look I I think you deserve it you

2075
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:41,039
you put in the hard yards you've you

2076
01:24:39,238 --> 01:24:42,839
know sacrificed part of your life for

2077
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,359
the community I I think there's there's

2078
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,039
no doubt you deserve that but just to

2079
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,039
follow up you mentioned you know that

2080
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:51,279
you you smoked the rosin and and it just

2081
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:54,439
signified to you that we're rering in a

2082
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:57,079
new era almost uh I love how how you

2083
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:58,399
know how memorable that was for you I

2084
01:24:57,079 --> 01:25:00,479
get the growing feeling that

2085
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:02,679
concentrates are going to continue to

2086
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:05,158
dominate the market in terms of what

2087
01:25:02,679 --> 01:25:07,118
people are looking to consume my

2088
01:25:05,158 --> 01:25:08,479
question for you is is that something

2089
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:10,238
you're thinking and will you be

2090
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,519
considerate of that going forward or do

2091
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:13,238
you think I'm just going to keep

2092
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,920
breeding the way I'm doing now if it

2093
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:16,479
happens to work well for concentrates

2094
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:19,279
that's great but you know not the

2095
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:21,919
primary focus where do you sit on

2096
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:25,000
that I'm really truly breeding for

2097
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:28,480
concentrates now um 90% % of my farm

2098
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,000
goes to concentrates but 90% of my farm

2099
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,359
is split up between 8 to 10

2100
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,118
manufacturers next year it'll be split

2101
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,920
up between 10 to 15 because I like to

2102
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:41,880
see their different techniques and I

2103
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:46,319
like the um what that creates for me the

2104
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:49,440
ability to get it to more people and um

2105
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:52,479
the flower that I do grow here will be

2106
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:55,719
flower that I put in my jar and so where

2107
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,759
I fear for most people with concentrates

2108
01:25:55,719 --> 01:26:00,198
is

2109
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:04,119
that um I think the industry as a whole

2110
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:07,960
is kind of utilizing concentrates to

2111
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:11,399
really get rid of their subpar product

2112
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:14,760
because you can transform it into uh

2113
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:17,039
product that maybe's not uh well formed

2114
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,840
into a flower that can be put into a jar

2115
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,319
you can put it into make it into a

2116
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:25,199
concentrate and it kind of all looks the

2117
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:26,920
same right um when when we do

2118
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:28,638
concentrate especially with the white

2119
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,359
Thorn Rose here we do Whole plant

2120
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:34,760
concentrate so when I'm selling um our

2121
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:36,000
fresh frozen to uh manufacturer like I

2122
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,800
harvest the whole plant they get

2123
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,039
everything they get the tops they get

2124
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,880
everything um because I want that rosin

2125
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:46,800
or that bubble hash or whatever to be

2126
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:51,239
the best that it can be and um I don't

2127
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,560
know what truly affects that so I don't

2128
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:55,359
want to take the chance and and have any

2129
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:57,000
kind of negative effect so they get

2130
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:58,559
everything they get the tops they get

2131
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,679
everything I don't go and top all my

2132
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,520
plants and then give all the the lower

2133
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:04,639
stuff to the manufacturer they get the

2134
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:07,199
whole plant and and they can take part

2135
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,800
in it they can be here and do it with me

2136
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:12,238
however they want or they see it when

2137
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,960
you know they're washing it and stuff so

2138
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:15,519
um I think they all appreciate it and I

2139
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,800
think it does end up being a better

2140
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:21,280
product So eventually I I don't know if

2141
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,159
the consumer how well the consumer can

2142
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:24,880
tell the difference but I think there's

2143
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:28,158
a fine line

2144
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,279
between really good flow and and flow

2145
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:33,359
that's okay and and the same with rosin

2146
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:36,319
and um I know a lot of Manufacturers are

2147
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:38,639
trying to drive that price point down

2148
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:42,000
you know we keep the white Thorn Rose at

2149
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:44,440
135 flat rate per pound and I think a

2150
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,760
lot of you know companies are trying to

2151
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:48,879
you know there there slim margins out

2152
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:52,639
there so if they can find some subar

2153
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:55,480
stuff for $50 a pound or $40 a pound you

2154
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:58,880
know it maybe that more beneficial for

2155
01:27:55,479 --> 01:28:00,879
them and um I just I just haven't worked

2156
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:04,239
with those kind of people because that

2157
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,319
can't you know help my farm survive so

2158
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:09,519
we just are the higher end

2159
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:11,559
right yes sure and I want to loop back

2160
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,800
and and talk about the pricing but

2161
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:15,719
before we go there I just want to

2162
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,000
quickly ask the discussion around indoor

2163
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:20,079
versus outdoor cannabis has evolved and

2164
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,679
for the longest time it was always

2165
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,279
indoor Supreme it's the best um more

2166
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:26,239
recently I feel like there's a lot lot

2167
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:28,679
more Credence given to the idea that

2168
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,678
outdoor can produce a much more shelf

2169
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:35,118
stable product in the long run as well

2170
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:37,158
as arguably a superior tpine profile how

2171
01:28:35,118 --> 01:28:38,799
do you rationalize the difference how

2172
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:40,000
would you explain it if someone who said

2173
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,199
oh I don't really know all that much

2174
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,719
about cannabis what's the difference

2175
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:43,879
between indoor and outdoor what would

2176
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:46,679
your answer

2177
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:48,239
be um I think the same reason you don't

2178
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:50,158
buy your vegetables that are grown

2179
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,198
underneath artificial light is the same

2180
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,599
reason you shouldn't buy your cannabis

2181
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:58,319
grown underneath artificial light I've

2182
01:28:54,600 --> 01:29:00,920
grown a lot of indoor in the the the

2183
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:03,679
traditional days um when I was younger

2184
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:08,199
to avoid the helicopters and invoid uh

2185
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:10,960
avoid um enforcement um and I think

2186
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:13,559
there was some amazing indoor back then

2187
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,399
um but what I know now is from doing

2188
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,840
experiments with Columbia University and

2189
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:20,118
really

2190
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:23,760
identifying um the different tpine

2191
01:29:20,118 --> 01:29:24,719
profiles from indoor and outdoor um

2192
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,039
really

2193
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,719
understanding that the the heads are a

2194
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:32,639
lot thicker um grown outdoor because

2195
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:36,198
they're subjected to the the wind the

2196
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:39,440
the rain the weather and um because of

2197
01:29:36,198 --> 01:29:44,118
that um influence from the weather those

2198
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:46,719
tpen are able to um last longer in a jar

2199
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:48,238
they're they're they have a thicker wall

2200
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,960
around them I don't know what that I

2201
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:52,599
forgot the name of the actual wall

2202
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,760
around the tpine head and so I just

2203
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,440
learned a lot about uh the difference

2204
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,039
between Sun grown and outdoor through

2205
01:29:56,439 --> 01:30:00,599
Columbia University and the different

2206
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:02,439
cannaboids and learned that you know a

2207
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:07,159
lot of us are relying on these testing

2208
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:08,719
Labs that test for maybe 20 or 25 tpin

2209
01:30:07,158 --> 01:30:10,198
because that's what the standards are

2210
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,319
that's all they have to test for by the

2211
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:15,000
states standards and through Columbia

2212
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:19,198
University I learned that white Thorn

2213
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:23,520
Rose had 444 different cannabinoids you

2214
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:27,319
know never even knew of them had um over

2215
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:30,440
60 different tpin so there was there was

2216
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:32,639
35 to 40 different chin that were never

2217
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:35,319
tested for and what we figur found out

2218
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:37,319
was that I kept wondering how white

2219
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:38,960
Thorn Rose can be so amazing and smell

2220
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:41,399
and taste so amazing and then the

2221
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:44,239
turpine um percentages was always coming

2222
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:46,799
back 1.5 1.5 well because they're only

2223
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:50,279
testing for certain CH pins well white

2224
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,800
Thorn Rose has certain tpin um that

2225
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:54,559
aren't even tested for and so that that

2226
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,279
works negatively against with the

2227
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,880
California labs and um once I found out

2228
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:02,719
it had 60 different chir Pines um

2229
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,520
especially one called Selena dying um

2230
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,319
that really has some ability to cure a

2231
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:10,800
lot of different ailments um really made

2232
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:12,519
a lot of sense to me and so if you have

2233
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,480
smoked a lot of cannabis and now we're

2234
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:18,280
hearing people like burner from cookies

2235
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:20,479
who is was strictly about you know

2236
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:23,439
indoor cannabis starting to really

2237
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,238
highlight and work with Legacy Farmers

2238
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:28,198
without door and you know he works with

2239
01:31:25,238 --> 01:31:30,718
Ridgeline now with his Lance um and

2240
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:33,319
really just had him here at my farm and

2241
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:35,800
you know had him not on video saying it

2242
01:31:33,319 --> 01:31:39,559
but he said sungrown way better you know

2243
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:43,159
the Entourage effect um the amount of

2244
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:46,719
how long that um Entourage effects last

2245
01:31:43,158 --> 01:31:48,198
last a lot longer smoking outdoor um and

2246
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:51,399
you know it'll affect each one of us a

2247
01:31:48,198 --> 01:31:54,039
lot differently but um I think like you

2248
01:31:51,399 --> 01:31:56,118
were saying before the consumer is slow

2249
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:58,880
starting to figure out that even though

2250
01:31:56,118 --> 01:32:01,359
it's not this rock hard tight OG Bud

2251
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:04,920
that we were always educated that that's

2252
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:06,639
what determins it being the best um and

2253
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,719
it looks a little fluffier and it might

2254
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,400
be a little bit um shaggier or looks a

2255
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:15,319
little different it can still make you

2256
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:16,719
feel amazing so um I always encourage

2257
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:19,519
people to smoke

2258
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:22,600
both hugely that's that's really cool to

2259
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,600
hear that uh as the kids say uncle burn

2260
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,400
was around the farm that's it's good to

2261
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,480
hear um I was just going to ask you know

2262
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,759
cuz you mentioned talking about the labs

2263
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:34,319
giving you these uh tpine readings of

2264
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:37,440
like 1.5% and tpine percentages have

2265
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:39,439
become such a focal point of what buyers

2266
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:42,000
base their purchasing decisions off

2267
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:45,158
these days and um you know likewise the

2268
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,920
same is said for THC percentages what's

2269
01:32:45,158 --> 01:32:49,519
your thoughts on the future of that I

2270
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:51,199
feel like although it hasn't started yet

2271
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,239
I feel like we're getting close to a

2272
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:55,319
point where people are going to start to

2273
01:32:53,238 --> 01:32:58,000
accept that that the numbers they see

2274
01:32:55,319 --> 01:33:01,238
for tpin or THC content is not

2275
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,359
necessarily the entire story where do

2276
01:33:01,238 --> 01:33:05,479
you see us in regards to

2277
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,198
that yeah I think I think they're

2278
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:10,678
figuring that out and I think they're

2279
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:13,559
also figuring out that the labs are are

2280
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:17,118
pretty inaccurate and you know you're

2281
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:19,119
seeing stuff like 710 Labs tested um

2282
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:22,319
from the same batch their flower did you

2283
01:33:19,118 --> 01:33:26,079
see that and like I think it the THC

2284
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:29,599
levels varied from 14 % to like 25 or

2285
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:32,118
26% um and that's how inconsistent the

2286
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:35,719
labs are because what happens is that

2287
01:33:32,118 --> 01:33:37,679
the labs really only have the ability to

2288
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:40,439
make their business work if they

2289
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:43,158
generate you know test from the

2290
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:46,359
Distributors and so if they continually

2291
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:48,479
give low THC scores it really makes it

2292
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:51,158
hard for those Farmers to survive so

2293
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:54,319
you'll switch Labs so it it's

2294
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:57,638
really it behooves the labs to those

2295
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,319
Farmers higher THC scores because then

2296
01:33:57,639 --> 01:34:01,480
you go back to them and you use them

2297
01:33:59,319 --> 01:34:03,799
again and so you can generate a lot of

2298
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:06,118
business by continually just turning the

2299
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:09,000
dial up a little bit and at the end of

2300
01:34:06,118 --> 01:34:12,639
the day probably 90% of the people can't

2301
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,719
tell the difference anyways and um you

2302
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,920
know it's my belief that the consumer

2303
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:20,118
starting to understand that the tpine

2304
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:23,880
profile and the tpen and the THC and the

2305
01:34:20,118 --> 01:34:26,079
cannabinoids together really um give you

2306
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:28,159
different Entourage effects and it's a

2307
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:31,760
little bit more complicated than reading

2308
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:33,879
you know a number on a jar and um I

2309
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,560
think once they experiment around with

2310
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:39,400
enough strains and come back to knowing

2311
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,400
your farmer again um they're figuring it

2312
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:44,839
out it's probably not as fast as I had

2313
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:45,879
hoped but um yeah they're figuring out

2314
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,319
they're pretty

2315
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,359
smart that's yeah look that's awesome to

2316
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:52,719
hear cuz I know certainly some of the

2317
01:34:50,359 --> 01:34:54,238
the older strains may not produce quite

2318
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,800
as high numbers as some of the more

2319
01:34:54,238 --> 01:35:00,079
modern ones but are still able to stand

2320
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:02,920
up side by side not to interrupt you but

2321
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:05,198
what really ends up hurting the uh the

2322
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:07,279
educational process are things like the

2323
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:09,319
state fair and and I'm Ambassador with

2324
01:35:07,279 --> 01:35:12,079
the state fair and so I'm going to try

2325
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:15,079
not to say anything too negatively about

2326
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,800
the the way they're going about it but

2327
01:35:15,079 --> 01:35:19,399
as they're developing and trying to

2328
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:23,880
educate people they're they're not

2329
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:27,679
really helping the cause because um you

2330
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:30,118
they're they're basing their Awards on a

2331
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:34,199
co-a test that's done by a lab and

2332
01:35:30,118 --> 01:35:36,198
they're saying things like um this is

2333
01:35:34,198 --> 01:35:39,359
these are the best growers in California

2334
01:35:36,198 --> 01:35:41,479
or this is the best flower in California

2335
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:45,198
and you're you're coming up with that

2336
01:35:41,479 --> 01:35:47,759
conclusion by a lab test that we already

2337
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:50,399
know is completely

2338
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,639
inaccurate so like I've been pushing

2339
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:55,039
back to them I think you know any

2340
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,520
Contest out there has to be you know

2341
01:35:55,039 --> 01:36:00,158
they have to touch and feel and and

2342
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:02,119
experience the flower or the rosin or

2343
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:04,559
the gummy or whatever they're they're

2344
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:09,439
they're ex you know entering the contest

2345
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:12,440
with um and so I don't know um I'm

2346
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:14,519
having a little issue with that yeah no

2347
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:16,000
look I I too would take issue especially

2348
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:19,159
as we just said you know given the

2349
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,719
variation that 710 pointed out is it

2350
01:36:19,158 --> 01:36:23,279
even within their own metric of how

2351
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:24,760
they're grading things is it even

2352
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:26,880
accurate it by the way they think

2353
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:29,039
they're marking it which may not

2354
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,679
necessarily be the case you know and and

2355
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:32,399
then you get into the the more minute

2356
01:36:30,679 --> 01:36:34,399
details of like well let's just say it

2357
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,759
all is getting tested by the one company

2358
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,000
so there's some amount of

2359
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,360
standardization there's it usually comes

2360
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,560
down to the way the individual

2361
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:44,799
technician processes the bud sample and

2362
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:47,320
then loads it into the hlc so it really

2363
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,840
is like you know a bit of a quagmire to

2364
01:36:47,319 --> 01:36:51,359
to wander into but I think I think we

2365
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,119
are we're both pretty much on the same

2366
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:55,880
page that it's should be more about

2367
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:57,799
effect and um how it makes you feel than

2368
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,760
than any of the numbers but you said

2369
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,639
something really quite profound a little

2370
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,079
earlier on and I have to loop back and I

2371
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:07,239
wanted to talk a little bit about you

2372
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:10,479
within the marketplace as you know a a

2373
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:12,638
medium/ small to medium siiz farm and

2374
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:14,599
how you're able to still be profitable

2375
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:15,960
and so I I guess the first thing I'd say

2376
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:18,440
is you know you mentioned earlier you

2377
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:21,239
were the fourth existing Farm in hanbul

2378
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:23,158
County to be fully permitted uh what was

2379
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:25,479
that process like you know was it was it

2380
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:28,079
really difficult and how many Hoops did

2381
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:30,959
you have to jump through excuse my

2382
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:33,118
language but it was hell um and it's

2383
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:36,480
it's hell for a lot of uh my fellow

2384
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:38,719
Farmers too um you know you're talking

2385
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:41,359
about a bunch of regulators that know

2386
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:44,279
nothing about weed that really are

2387
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:46,198
trying to capitalize on um the

2388
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:50,158
marketplace that we built in the

2389
01:37:46,198 --> 01:37:53,118
traditional era and as they're learning

2390
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:57,079
as they're going um it's been brutally

2391
01:37:53,118 --> 01:38:00,279
painful for many of us um compliance

2392
01:37:57,079 --> 01:38:02,279
wise to to to bow down to some of the

2393
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:05,479
things they're asking us to do like

2394
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:08,960
weigh every plant wet and then weigh

2395
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:11,919
every plant um dry and then keep track

2396
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:14,439
of all the waste on that plant and then

2397
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:17,679
reway the flour and then keep track of

2398
01:38:14,439 --> 01:38:20,158
the trim off of that flour and like

2399
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:21,960
they're making us do so much work

2400
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:24,679
because they think they have the ability

2401
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:26,960
to keep track of

2402
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:29,039
something we can waste out in one one

2403
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,399
click of a key on the keyboard and say

2404
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:35,000
it molded um they have no ability to

2405
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:39,079
control what we're doing and they should

2406
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,960
really give into working with us instead

2407
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:42,118
of trying to control us and I think

2408
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,319
that's where they're making a mistake

2409
01:38:42,118 --> 01:38:47,279
and and we do take do some Educational

2410
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:51,279
Tours with the DCC who's a regulating

2411
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:53,118
body of of this industry and um you know

2412
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,479
they always are very nice people that

2413
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:58,639
work in the industry and they seem

2414
01:38:55,479 --> 01:39:02,439
genuine and want to help but

2415
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:05,520
um man it's just so slow everything they

2416
01:39:02,439 --> 01:39:08,479
do and yeah they agree with us but they

2417
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:11,920
just take years before they actually act

2418
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:14,238
on what they know to be true and

2419
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:17,639
um I just try to take it with the grain

2420
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:20,238
of Sal we're a small enough Farm where

2421
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:22,079
tagging every plant isn't a huge

2422
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:26,759
deal

2423
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:29,000
um yeah I don't know there it it cost a

2424
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,400
you know cost a fortune you know for

2425
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,920
many of us to put in rainwater catchment

2426
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:37,319
ponds to fix our roads to fix our

2427
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:39,679
ditches to change out coverts um and to

2428
01:39:37,319 --> 01:39:43,319
do a lot of things that they were

2429
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:45,760
thinking was helpful um that now they

2430
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:48,479
think isn't help didn't need to be done

2431
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:51,520
and you know they have uh like moonmaid

2432
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:55,000
Farms I was talking about her Farm was

2433
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:57,719
logged in the 80s and when part of her

2434
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:01,679
permitting process she has to change out

2435
01:39:57,719 --> 01:40:06,039
25 coverts on a piece of property that

2436
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:07,960
was um that she bought in the 2000s that

2437
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:10,079
really was logged in the 80s that all

2438
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:12,639
these coverts were put in so like these

2439
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:14,800
are roads that are never used but since

2440
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,920
they have the ability to kind of

2441
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:20,000
control the properties once they're in

2442
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:22,000
the process they're really trying to I

2443
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,719
don't know punish us still or I'm not

2444
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,039
sure what what they're gaining or what

2445
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,760
the benefits are they they're really

2446
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,760
destroying the whole cannabis the

2447
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:34,239
California Cannabis industry is quickly

2448
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:37,199
failing and they're starting to realize

2449
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:40,198
that now most of the small farmers are

2450
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:42,198
are really struggling and you know

2451
01:40:40,198 --> 01:40:44,319
they're they're not making money they're

2452
01:40:42,198 --> 01:40:46,479
you know if they're if they're still

2453
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:49,359
around they're maybe breaking even or

2454
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:51,799
surviving and you know a lot of my

2455
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:53,359
friends are going going away

2456
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,159
unfortunately

2457
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:57,118
let's touch on that in just a second but

2458
01:40:55,158 --> 01:40:59,279
you you actually made a really profound

2459
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:01,039
comment there about how the regulatory

2460
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:02,880
bodies are worried you're going to make

2461
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,920
you know a bunch of the crop disappear

2462
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,400
and say it molded and it's really

2463
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,158
interesting to hear that because I think

2464
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:10,598
a lot of the discussion around that

2465
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:13,000
issue is actually far more targeted

2466
01:41:10,599 --> 01:41:16,199
towards the massive like multi-state

2467
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,719
operations and the people I talk to have

2468
01:41:16,198 --> 01:41:22,238
the suspicion that um a lot of the

2469
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:24,439
flower that is subpar or is just excess

2470
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:27,559
from some of these big like multi-state

2471
01:41:24,439 --> 01:41:31,439
operations ends up in these black market

2472
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:33,199
you know New York little um Bodega being

2473
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:35,279
sold on the corner sort of thing like

2474
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:38,000
that's what they think is where all that

2475
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,519
Supply is coming from do you have any

2476
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,560
suspicions about that and do you feel

2477
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,719
like the regulatory bodies are targeting

2478
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:45,000
the wrong people if they're worried

2479
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:48,359
about you doing it when really there's

2480
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,198
10 million hectare farms and seemingly

2481
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:52,920
all their product just you know it's not

2482
01:41:50,198 --> 01:41:55,839
left over well they're absolutely right

2483
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:58,158
that's where 90% of the weed goes I mean

2484
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,000
you if if you're not participating in

2485
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:03,079
that market and I'm not saying anybody

2486
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,679
does but if if you're not you're not

2487
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:09,319
making it in California so it's it's

2488
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:11,000
it's in my opinion that they understand

2489
01:42:09,319 --> 01:42:13,519
that it's happening since there's only

2490
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,960
enough retail stores that they've given

2491
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:20,080
licenses to to Really distribute two to

2492
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:22,679
three million pounds in packaging but

2493
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:25,719
yet they've permitted enough Farms to

2494
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:28,880
produce 15 million pounds this year so

2495
01:42:25,719 --> 01:42:31,198
where do they think the other 13 12 or

2496
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,880
13 million pounds are going to go they

2497
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:35,719
know there's nowhere it can't go

2498
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,440
anywhere and you can't lose that much as

2499
01:42:35,719 --> 01:42:39,800
a business or you would be out of

2500
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:42,158
business so I think they understand that

2501
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:45,000
it's happening and I think they're being

2502
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,799
very lenient about that now because if

2503
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,639
they enforce too hard on it the whole

2504
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,279
industry goes away and then what it

2505
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,239
makes them all look really bad that's my

2506
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:55,238
opinion I could be way off base and

2507
01:42:53,238 --> 01:42:58,238
could be wrong but I would put a lot of

2508
01:42:55,238 --> 01:43:00,839
money on that I'm absolutely 100%

2509
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,718
right yeah you're right and God wouldn't

2510
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:04,719
that be egg on their face if they

2511
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,639
regulated their own industry out of

2512
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:08,239
existence I never thought of it that way

2513
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,960
but that's it and right they have so

2514
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:11,879
many they they've created so many

2515
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,560
different sub businesses like the

2516
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,719
regulators and uh you know the retail

2517
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,520
shop inspectors and they have they've

2518
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:22,158
created this huge industry enforcement

2519
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,119
and as farmers are going away they still

2520
01:43:22,158 --> 01:43:25,920
have this many people right so if

2521
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:27,880
they're not generating that money all of

2522
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:30,560
a sudden now California is running at a

2523
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:33,199
deficit and with the Cannabis industry

2524
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,320
that they created now is costing them a

2525
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:36,678
fortune and like at one point or another

2526
01:43:35,319 --> 01:43:38,399
they might not even be able to have

2527
01:43:36,679 --> 01:43:40,319
enough people to actually run it they're

2528
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,839
in a they're in a pickle right

2529
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,439
now yeah and and it loop back to the

2530
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,560
point you made just a question or two

2531
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:46,919
ago about how you were saying you know

2532
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:50,199
many of your friends are finding it

2533
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,840
really difficult to remain in the market

2534
01:43:50,198 --> 01:43:53,719
the the the comment you made that's

2535
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,960
really lasted with me is

2536
01:43:53,719 --> 01:43:59,760
um how you said that you keep the price

2537
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:02,319
firm of the the white Thorn Rose for 135

2538
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:05,880
a pound and so you hear someone and just

2539
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:08,799
to clarify I'm talking about 135 for a

2540
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:12,239
wet pound so it's really a five to one

2541
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:15,840
conversion right so um it ends up being

2542
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:19,479
like maybe seven or $800 dried trimmed

2543
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,440
pounds go for about 500 so so to put

2544
01:44:19,479 --> 01:44:23,399
that in perspective I guess the the

2545
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:25,279
reason why I bring that up is it does

2546
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:27,399
beg the question you know how how do

2547
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:29,279
people stay in businesses when the

2548
01:44:27,399 --> 01:44:31,679
prices are so low and and the price you

2549
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:33,880
just reflected is one of high quality

2550
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:35,960
where there's a bit of Premium sech

2551
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:39,079
charge you know you also referenced a

2552
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:40,800
$50 wet pound you know is it like is it

2553
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:42,679
is it even financially possible to stay

2554
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:46,199
in business if that's the prices you're

2555
01:44:42,679 --> 01:44:48,399
able to fetch um only if you're

2556
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:51,000
avoiding paying their

2557
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:53,198
taxes okay so it's not sustainable if

2558
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,599
you're diverting no it's not yeah that's

2559
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:58,839
the answer it's not sustainable unless

2560
01:44:55,599 --> 01:45:01,960
you maybe flirt around with the gray

2561
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,960
areas I'll put it I'll put it like that

2562
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:06,118
that's crazy so I guess what do you

2563
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:08,599
think is the future of sort of the mum

2564
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:11,598
and pop businesses is is the entire

2565
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:14,679
model under threat the I think the

2566
01:45:11,599 --> 01:45:17,840
entire model is definitely under threat

2567
01:45:14,679 --> 01:45:21,359
unless you're pivoting and really

2568
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:24,159
building your small business model with

2569
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,559
the only pathway forward I see and I

2570
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:28,279
don't know everything I'm not a great

2571
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:29,920
business person I'm just a farmer but um

2572
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:32,198
really found a lot of momentum with the

2573
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:34,239
white Thorn Rose and really think that

2574
01:45:32,198 --> 01:45:37,039
most small farmers should highlight

2575
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:38,718
those Legacy strains that strains no one

2576
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:41,000
else in the world has and I and I always

2577
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:43,639
say that and it sounds redundant but

2578
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,319
just the sound of it creates a little

2579
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:50,639
mini demand for for it whether or not

2580
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:53,118
it's great or not um you know they just

2581
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,039
think that we can't compete with the

2582
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:57,198
commercialized strains or will'll never

2583
01:45:55,039 --> 01:45:58,920
make it and um if you know you're not

2584
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,319
going to make it you know you want to

2585
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:02,800
Pivot earlier than later and trying to

2586
01:46:01,319 --> 01:46:04,799
make something and then if it's not

2587
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,400
going to work then you can become a

2588
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:08,880
fisherman or

2589
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:11,118
something yeah look it's sad because

2590
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:13,880
there's a lot of you know incredibly

2591
01:46:11,118 --> 01:46:16,039
talented cultivators who probably will

2592
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,039
end up taking up an alternative

2593
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:20,599
profession and just all of that

2594
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:23,238
knowledge and wisdom will sadly be lost

2595
01:46:20,599 --> 01:46:25,360
for the most part I guess with that in

2596
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:27,319
mind what do you think would be the most

2597
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:29,839
important sort of message you could give

2598
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:31,719
to someone who's just trying to get into

2599
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,960
the market or maybe is in the market but

2600
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:35,880
struggling a bit what should they focus

2601
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:38,639
on or or what do you think people could

2602
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:43,079
do a bit better that would help their

2603
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:44,639
brand um well what we did and I think

2604
01:46:43,079 --> 01:46:47,198
maybe not even purposely but what

2605
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:49,079
benefited us the most was you know our

2606
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:53,719
farm is small enough it's those in

2607
01:46:49,079 --> 01:46:56,158
between Farms that um your farm too big

2608
01:46:53,719 --> 01:46:58,079
to work yourself or work with your a

2609
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,439
family member that you need to have

2610
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:03,000
employees which then requires you to

2611
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:05,158
have workman's comp and all these other

2612
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,520
expenditures that really eats at the

2613
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:12,000
bottom line you know it it's uh it's

2614
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,119
really up to me and Rose my girlfriend

2615
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,880
we do all the work you know I'm out here

2616
01:47:14,118 --> 01:47:18,598
at five o'clock at night I'm planting

2617
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:21,880
flowers I'm you know work cutting clones

2618
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:24,119
I'm doing all the stuff so um you know

2619
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:27,920
it's a little bit harder on having any

2620
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:30,679
kind of freedom but um I think you have

2621
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,440
to limit the amount of your expenses um

2622
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:37,079
your overhead really um you know I don't

2623
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:39,238
have uh I don't have high-tech automated

2624
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:41,359
depth things I don't have you know all

2625
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:43,439
these high-tech expensive things I kind

2626
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:46,439
of limited my overhead and and it's

2627
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:48,759
really allowed me to produce a pound

2628
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:51,960
that maybe I sell for $500 maybe it cost

2629
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:54,079
me $250 $300 to produce like I know

2630
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:56,679
moonm made Farm was telling me it costs

2631
01:47:54,079 --> 01:47:59,238
her $600 to $700 a pound that she can

2632
01:47:56,679 --> 01:48:01,279
only sell for $500 so that doesn't make

2633
01:47:59,238 --> 01:48:03,118
any sense right but she had to have she

2634
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:05,079
had a big enough she had like a half an

2635
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:08,158
acre so she needed employees and they

2636
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:11,399
were doing depths and so I do one crop a

2637
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:13,920
year um I have 65 outdoor plants and

2638
01:48:11,399 --> 01:48:15,399
then I have two green houses which you

2639
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,520
know I don't have too many plants in

2640
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:20,399
they get so it's it's all manageable for

2641
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:23,920
me and my overhead isn't that big and if

2642
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:26,920
uh if yeah it's just really up to me and

2643
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:31,440
Rose so um keeping your overhead low is

2644
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:32,880
I think key and not trying to B expand

2645
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:34,598
you don't want to be too big now there's

2646
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,440
no reason none of those bigger companies

2647
01:48:34,599 --> 01:48:38,800
are making it you know they're all

2648
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:42,158
failing you can't you can't more isn't

2649
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:44,320
more less is more and then just focus on

2650
01:48:42,158 --> 01:48:47,799
educating people about who you are and

2651
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:49,639
your story and um that's the where the

2652
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:53,079
real value is I

2653
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:54,800
think yeah 100% And and that's some some

2654
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:57,479
great words there more is not always

2655
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:59,880
more I like that so I think that just

2656
01:48:57,479 --> 01:49:01,839
about brings us to our our tail end of

2657
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:04,760
it where we do our five quickfire

2658
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:06,880
questions we love to ask all guests so

2659
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:09,239
the first question I'll ask is what's

2660
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,880
the single most memorable experience

2661
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:12,759
with cannabis you've ever had it doesn't

2662
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:14,319
have to be like the most potent dab hit

2663
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:16,199
you've ever done but like you know maybe

2664
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:17,759
you're at a concert the music was just

2665
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:20,638
hitting right like what's the most

2666
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,800
memorable experience for you most

2667
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,920
memorable experience or the most

2668
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,199
impactful experience I think I ever had

2669
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:30,760
was um several years ago I got an email

2670
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:34,439
from the warden and from the guard of

2671
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:36,280
the prison that I was um housed at for

2672
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:39,638
over six years and they reached out to

2673
01:49:36,279 --> 01:49:41,679
me and um they felt so bad that somebody

2674
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:45,520
that was growing a plant would get that

2675
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:46,960
much time and they learned who I was and

2676
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,440
they they knew I would never heard

2677
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:51,439
anybody and they asked to come to my

2678
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:53,479
farm and they came up to my farm spent

2679
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:56,839
two days here and at the end of those

2680
01:49:53,479 --> 01:49:59,039
two days um of showing them around of

2681
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:01,760
watching them you know federal prison

2682
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:04,679
guards and wardens in playing with the

2683
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:08,119
plants they each took six of my plants

2684
01:50:04,679 --> 01:50:10,199
my my unique cultivars home and today to

2685
01:50:08,118 --> 01:50:13,920
this day they still grow those cultivars

2686
01:50:10,198 --> 01:50:15,638
at their their house in in Lomo and they

2687
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,239
they already called me this year and

2688
01:50:15,639 --> 01:50:20,880
just even last week I just sent them

2689
01:50:17,238 --> 01:50:23,638
seeds of the paradise Pine and so um to

2690
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,440
realize that all of us no matter who we

2691
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:27,960
are can make a difference in somebody's

2692
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:33,279
life whether or not it's a prison Garden

2693
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:34,560
a pot grower um or whatever um I think

2694
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:37,639
that's

2695
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:39,920
really really an amazing thing and it's

2696
01:50:37,639 --> 01:50:41,840
just always on my mind and he calls to

2697
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:45,359
check in on me to make sure I'm okay and

2698
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:47,800
that's just it just seemed so farfetched

2699
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,880
and not even real that it just it just

2700
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:51,000
impressed me that they could come full

2701
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:53,840
circle like

2702
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,479
that yeah compl completely full circle

2703
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:59,360
and and at the core a message of love

2704
01:50:56,479 --> 01:51:01,399
which is absolutely beautiful on the

2705
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:03,679
other end of the spectrum what's a

2706
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:05,879
strain where everyone around you was

2707
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:07,880
hyping it up telling you oh man you got

2708
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:12,279
to try it and you finally try it and

2709
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:16,239
you're like ah is that all gush

2710
01:51:12,279 --> 01:51:19,039
Ms not the first one to say that yeah I

2711
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:20,519
bet yeah um yeah you know it lasted a

2712
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,639
year or two around here and then it was

2713
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:25,000
over like they just rotate through

2714
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:27,319
strains that are hype strains and um

2715
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,719
gush minz was one of them and I was not

2716
01:51:27,319 --> 01:51:31,319
impressed there you go okay next

2717
01:51:29,719 --> 01:51:33,599
question is I'm going to drop you off on

2718
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:35,799
a desert island you've got the resources

2719
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:37,599
to grow plants for the rest of your life

2720
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,880
but you can only take three genetics

2721
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:42,078
with you can be either three clones or

2722
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,000
three packs of seeds if you prefer seeds

2723
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:46,439
maybe do a bit of breeding what three

2724
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,880
things are you going to take with you

2725
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:49,198
I'm going to take Paradise Pine I'm

2726
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,599
going to take white Thorn Rin I'm going

2727
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:53,638
to take Mom's weed oh brilliant there

2728
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:57,119
was no hesitation I love that that's

2729
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:58,760
good no absolutely yeah perfect okay

2730
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:00,158
look we might already have the answer to

2731
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:01,440
this one but I want to ask you anyway

2732
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:03,799
this is one of our new ones we've been

2733
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:06,078
doing let's say under crazy

2734
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:08,360
unpredictable circumstances your your

2735
01:52:06,078 --> 01:52:11,078
house burns down but as you're going

2736
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:14,000
through the rubble you see one pack of

2737
01:52:11,078 --> 01:52:16,759
seeds preserved perfectly in the dust to

2738
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,118
restart the company with what pack would

2739
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:19,639
you hope that would be what would you

2740
01:52:18,118 --> 01:52:22,519
want to restart the company with if you

2741
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:24,800
could only pick one pack I would have to

2742
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:26,280
to say Paradise punch my original strain

2743
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:29,000
I used to go with my

2744
01:52:26,279 --> 01:52:30,599
mom that was what I was thinking okay

2745
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,960
cool yeah there you go there you go

2746
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:35,560
brilliant okay final

2747
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:38,279
question I have a time machine for you

2748
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:41,280
you can go back anywhere any place to

2749
01:52:38,279 --> 01:52:42,439
presumably collect a clone or some seeds

2750
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:44,439
where you going to go what are you going

2751
01:52:42,439 --> 01:52:47,638
to

2752
01:52:44,439 --> 01:52:47,638
get you

2753
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:53,399
know I don't think I I I do anything

2754
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,199
different and maybe I go back in time

2755
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:57,519
and and maybe save some of those

2756
01:52:55,198 --> 01:53:00,118
original 21 seeds that I was talking

2757
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,960
about that trell found in his wall and

2758
01:53:00,118 --> 01:53:03,559
and maybe try to breed with those and

2759
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:05,118
and preserve those because I believe

2760
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:08,320
there's some magic in there somewhere

2761
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:11,519
and I feel like that is something that

2762
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:14,198
I'm yearning to to to restart or to

2763
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,880
refigure out so um yeah I'm going back

2764
01:53:14,198 --> 01:53:17,839
in time I'm getting some of those 21

2765
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:19,840
seeds and I'm I'm keeping them alive and

2766
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,920
I'm keeping them around that's

2767
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:24,639
absolutely brilliant I love that answer

2768
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,920
I have to imagine as a killer strain uh

2769
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:27,760
we we'll all have to wait for the

2770
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:30,118
artificial embryos to see what's inside

2771
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,760
those last few you got so I think that

2772
01:53:30,118 --> 01:53:33,679
just about brings us to the end of it

2773
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,520
for things today was there any comments

2774
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:38,319

2775
