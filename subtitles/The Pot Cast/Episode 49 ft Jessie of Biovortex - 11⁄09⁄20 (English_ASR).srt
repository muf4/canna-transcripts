i've got a lot from hearing breeders get

55
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,520
to go into

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,640
their thought process and just the way

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
that you create this format um i feel

58
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
that you get a real stream of

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,760

76
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
my friend so the first question we like

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
to ask our guests what have you been

78
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,679
smoking on recently

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,039
well today it's mostly been a

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,120
black dog with

81
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,878
a mixture of

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,759
banana dog

83
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,439
rosin from garden of greece and not

84
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,598
rosin actually straight ice water hash

85
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,199
it just was pressed out a little bit and

86
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,719
then um

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,158
also some

88
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:32,878
uh

89
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:34,079
24k from um resin ranch uh it was just

90
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,639
exceptional

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
flavored great great citrus

92
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,039
um and

93
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,238
um yes some cherry lime dog flowers too

94
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,959
which is just kind of one of my

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,400
favorites that combination between

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
um

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,560
i mean jeans cherry lime pop and the

98
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,480
black dog uh and been playing with that

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,878
for the last several years and uh some

100
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,479
of my favorite aromas and flavors have

101
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,399
come out of that so that's a pretty

102
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,399
constant one but that's what i've been

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,438
smoking on today

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,280
wow what a lovely little selection there

105
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,359
what a lovely selection there's a few

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
things i'd love to chat about i mean

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
we're definitely going to chat cherry

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
lime dog because that's of huge interest

109
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,798
to me but just to quickly backtrack you

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
said the 24k that's an interesting one

111
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,040
because the citrus turps have been

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,000
dominant for a while

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,879
and

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,839
now they're kind of like almost making a

115
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,600
comeback but in like a

116
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,439
sort of a changed form like with other

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,199
stuff brought into it what's your

118
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,399
thoughts on citrus do you think we've

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
reached the peak do you think we've

120
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,159
passed where do you predict it

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
i think there's a lot of a lot of

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,880
different types of citrus um there's

123
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,799
certain citrus that

124
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,120
you know works more or less with other

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,680
people you have those hazy

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,079
citrus you have the piney hit citrus you

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,319
have sometimes it's more on the lime

128
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,519
some more lemon so you get straight

129
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,360
mandarin you have you know full lemon

130
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,680
like a lemon tree or something or

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,439
mandarin like mandarin or nectarine or

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
you have uh

133
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,319
there's a lot of different ways citrus

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
expresses itself and what i like about

135
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,399
the 24k is it's

136
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,879
um i feel like it's the like

137
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,399
it's kind of the juice and gas it's like

138
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,159
the the sweet

139
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,279
orange citrus

140
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
with a bit of that that gas and earth

141
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,799
that

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
i

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
i really enjoy that a little bit more

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,960
than maybe some of the super spiky hazy

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,959
citrus which i also enjoy too but i i

146
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,519
for all the time um i kind of like that

147
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,399
a little bit more gas with that citrus

148
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,599
and i think like the mandarin and that

149
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,198
24k seem to deliver that really well and

150
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,199
they they yield pretty well in ice water

151
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,840
hash too

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,919
yeah lovely what a bang on description

153
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,239
and i mean while we're talking about it

154
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,839
what's your thoughts on like the kosher

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
and the jew gold you know they're kind

156
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,478
of the two gassy og things which i don't

157
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
feel get as much of a mention as some of

158
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,639
the other og cuts how do you find them

159
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
do you like them

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,680
oh sure um

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
yeah and i mean it's it's difficult too

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,199
to know like if we're talking about the

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
same thing all the time too whether it's

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,038
a certain cut that was the basis for

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
something or whether it's the feminist

166
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,120
seeds that were put out in europe and

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,319
and what what is your definition of that

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,560
variety but um i mean yeah i i enjoy

169
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,560
those those gas flavors there's a it's

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,839
coming from a long

171
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,560
line of very similar og cuts and it's

172
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,038
just different versions of the of a

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,918
similar thing um that i've enjoyed since

174
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,800
i was um you know since the late well i

175
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,198
guess yeah late 90s early 2000s or so so

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,000
um yeah i've always enjoyed those

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,759
flavors and stuck with them

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,600
lovely well we'll have to get into that

179
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
but just as one last quick question on

180
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,400
this subject what's your favorite og if

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,400
you had to pick one

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
um

183
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,680
i mean

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
it was good from the beginning uh just

185
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
the standard kind of

186
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,680
the first og cut that guy

187
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
that we saw like

188
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,319
really in circulation around probably

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,800
two thousand

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,960
two i mean and it's very similar to the

191
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,478
sfv very similar to

192
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,598
tahoe and trinidad

193
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,560
uh

194
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,519
um lost coast og

195
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,598
yeah they all had that that same kind of

196
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,359
thing and sometimes it's like is it just

197
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,598
being grown in a different spot or not

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
it's it's hard for me to to fully know

199
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,319
and we don't have i don't have all of

200
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,160
them

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,039
saved or the records to know like what's

202
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,039
what but um

203
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,959
i don't have a

204
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,240
favorite because they were all so

205
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,959
similar um

206
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,879
it's really if how it was grown at the

207
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,839
time too like is this a real living soil

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,038
uh

209
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:56,159
expression um is it just perfectly done

210
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,639
organic indoor is it a really nice light

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
depth um

212
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
but

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,960
yeah and then just having that addictive

214
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,959
banging kind of gas flavor at the end

215
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,359
it's it's interesting what og did with

216
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,000
our area it actually

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,479
it created an appellation of its own in

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,279
like a very

219
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,360
uh free market kind of way the fact that

220
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,918
there was this variety that had this

221
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,160
addictive flavor that um we were growing

222
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,000
out in the hills in in light depth and

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,039
getting um incredibly beautiful flowers

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,199
that

225
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,080
were better looking than indoor and

226
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,759
better

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
you know especially anyone who messed up

228
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,718
their indoor which is most people so

229
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,240
like

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
um

231
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,519
people could come from all over

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,000
and just make a ton of money on selling

233
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,278
this stuff at top shelf indoor flowers

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,759
because it blew away their indoor

235
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,679
flowers and it created an really an

236
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,439
appellation because it was a flavor and

237
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,679
a standard of this area that happened

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,160
with light depth and og

239
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,239
and it really made a a lot of

240
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,120
a lot of history and a lot of economic

241
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,120
um

242
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,919
strangeness

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,159
yeah

244
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,639
yeah i mean it's it's so true and it

245
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,319
makes me wonder let's say you had to

246
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,080
make a you know a bit of a pie in the

247
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,560
sky i guess but let's say like you know

248
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,080
25 years from now most countries around

249
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,159
the world are legalized do you think

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,160
america would look into really pushing

251
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,319
that appalachia sort of thing a bit

252
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,079
harder with specific strains in the way

253
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
we see like wines and stuff or do you

254
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,759
think people are still going to just

255
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,278
pick different genetics each year and do

256
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,679
their thing

257
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,879
um well it's definitely happening

258
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,639
and there's really smart amazing

259
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,879
excellent farm

260
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,639
and breeders and advocates that are

261
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,838
working towards that and luckily these

262
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,519
are uh

263
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
a lot of the people who who very much

264
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,639
support the regenerative cannabis

265
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,560
farming movement and these ideals and um

266
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,679
they're putting and also real science

267
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,119
and so

268
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,359
um you know there is an appellation

269
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,759
project in humboldt that's um going into

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
place right now um dr holly hall is

271
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,919
helping

272
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,560
um head a lot of the research and uh the

273
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,360
fundraising for

274
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,958
the

275
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,399
getting

276
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,239
nine different weather stations that

277
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,799
will be put in different legacy farms

278
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
with good practices and we can start get

279
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,958
recording all of the environmental data

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,560
from high quality weather stations that

281
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,799
will be properly monitored

282
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,359
um and then janine coleman has been

283
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,078
leading this amazing appalachian project

284
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
from mendo and in humble and has been

285
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,519
doing just this

286
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,239
incredibly difficult work because it's

287
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,159
such a complex issue and like we're

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,519
dealing with you know cannabis is so

289
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,519
complex to begin with and then

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,200
appellations and then we're dealing with

291
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
everyone's different perspectives and

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,079
everyone's different cultures and

293
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
everyone's different spot and what's

294
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,039
special about their place and what's

295
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
special about their genetic and what's

296
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,078
special about their terroir and also

297
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,560
like who do you include and what doesn't

298
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,759
get included and like is a plant grown

299
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,078
in a pot in a greenhouse or in indoor in

300
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,360
that location qualifies as an

301
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,519
appellation when we're talking about

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,079
environmental expression so you know

303
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,720
things like do the roots need to be in

304
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,599
the ground is it okay if there was other

305
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,120
added potting soil or amendments is it

306
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
okay if there's some environmental

307
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,919
controls and so you know there's a lot

308
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,600
of things to kind of hash out i'm on the

309
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,360
the side of like

310
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
as long as those roots are tapped into

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,120
that soil and that it is part of that

312
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
environment and it's not environmental

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,399
control and you don't have artificial

314
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,239
lights then then that's qualifying for

315
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,480
an appellation the second you go indoor

316
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
or an environmentally controlled

317
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,278
um

318
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,199
greenhouse or the second that you have a

319
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,320
pot that does not allow the roots to go

320
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,720
into the ground then i think that those

321
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
suspend the idea of an appellation

322
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
because you're taking out the

323
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
environmental aspect of it which is such

324
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,240
an important part of it of course the

325
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,919
culture part of it the breeding the art

326
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,639
you know like all of that is a huge part

327
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,919
of an appellation too it's like

328
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,838
how do you grow a cultivar like which

329
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,439
what are you breeding for and then what

330
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,440
are you doing with that that's that's

331
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,279
that all is part of it too but i do

332
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,640
think that the environment has to be a

333
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,320
part of that as well

334
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,319
um so i'm really excited about all the

335
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,639
amazing people that are are working on

336
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,160
this and amazing farmers too like moon

337
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,240
made farms tina gordon um just so many

338
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,679
are are doing a lot of work and actually

339
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,159
the women have been spearheading this

340
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,599
pretty hard like um just a powerful

341
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:26,879
group of incredibly intelligent uh

342
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,879
powerful people that are are doing the

343
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,320
the work that i'd want to see done so

344
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,559
you know there's so many ways to get

345
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
these things wrong and i'm really

346
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,278
concerned about things that could

347
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,719
restrict

348
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,320
freedoms you know i don't want people

349
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,839
growing only one kind of cultivar in a

350
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
place because that goes to monoculture

351
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
that goes to

352
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,278
all these different issues or restrict a

353
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
farmer from breeding in their own

354
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,078
environment like the whole point is to

355
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,919
establish these things that are

356
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,000
a part of the culture a part of the

357
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,278
farmers a part of the breeders a part of

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
making something that makes sense for

359
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,039
that area and i think biodiversity goes

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
with that so it's like

361
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,399
you don't just be like oh this place is

362
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
known for this

363
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,320
variety this cultivar because

364
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,879
that same farm should be able to grow a

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,839
type 1 a type 2 type 3 type 4 they

366
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,278
should be able to like you know cbd thc

367
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
they should be able to have things that

368
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,320
are harvested early things that are

369
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,879
harvested late that are of different

370
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
sizes that make sense uh in their

371
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,399
environment so

372
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,159
and that's a very dynamic landscape if

373
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,958
you think of like a green source gardens

374
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,559
like um you think of all of the the

375
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,159
breeding that they're doing and then all

376
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,319
the different growing that they're doing

377
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,480
and they that's

378
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,399
to me like very much what an appellation

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
is but they are working on so many

380
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,720
different cultivars at the same time and

381
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,240
having a full polyculture mixed in with

382
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,800
there like many of the other

383
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
regenerative farms like moon gazer farms

384
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,599
um

385
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
they're just great examples of that and

386
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,159
it's kind of hard for bureaucracy to

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,559
understand that kind of like freedom and

388
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,000
polyculture and um but i'm hopeful that

389
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,278
maybe this is the place where we can do

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it

391
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,519
yeah wow what a really knowledgeable

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
little burst of info there i think

393
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,519
people have to redo that

394
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,278
i'm interested to know

395
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,000
because i got two questions from two

396
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,519
fans and one of them was related to they

397
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,879
were kind of interested in trying to do

398
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,799
what you're talking about in their own

399
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,198
little setup and they were saying do you

400
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,159
think it would be beneficial to get that

401
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:24,078
whole process going to kind of do your

402
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,159
own imo and try to like um culture your

403
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,000
own indigenous microbes from your area

404
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,559
as opposed to say using like maybe an

405
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,799
em1 or like like a good microbial source

406
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,679
but it's external would you recommend

407
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,759
that like that could be a viable way to

408
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,359
get some microbial activity going that's

409
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,600
related to your terroir or do you think

410
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
it's a bit more complex than that

411
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,360
so this is a

412
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,560
cultivator that's um

413
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,879
asking about living soil cultivation um

414
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,559
yeah is this indoor outdoor what kind of

415
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,720
situation are we talking about i think

416
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,159
that they recently moved to a new

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,519
property and they're looking to grow

418
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,838
outdoor and they were kind of wondering

419
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,278
like the first time you grow something

420
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,120
is there terroir there immediately or

421
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,320
does it have to develop over time and do

422
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,159
i need to use imos and things like that

423
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
well the terroir is there

424
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,319
but

425
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,679
yeah i mean

426
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,959
like any

427
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,039
gardening and the whole idea of

428
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,799
regenerative farming is the fact that

429
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,919
you make something thrive more every

430
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,879
year so

431
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,838
you do the things that build nutrition

432
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,720
that build that that generate uh more

433
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,760
life just by going through um

434
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,639
you know the cycles of things and so

435
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,958
by

436
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,639
cover cropping um

437
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,078
in the in the fall so after you've grown

438
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,198
your crop you immediately start your

439
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,319
cover crop um before the rains come

440
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,240
and that grows over the winter and

441
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,839
all the nitrogen fixing bacteria that

442
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,919
work with the

443
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
the root nodules in something like fava

444
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,198
beans or something like peas or bell

445
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,440
beans or veg those are pulling nitrogen

446
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,958
from the air and they are fixing it into

447
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,120
the ground just

448
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,518
through the process of photosynthesis

449
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,000
and through the process of having a

450
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,560
mutualistic relationship with

451
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,120
bacteria that they they literally

452
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,198
create these nodules to house the

453
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,198
bacteria like they grow these big things

454
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,559
and they they put out resources to make

455
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,639
sure that they are

456
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,799
housing and taking care of these

457
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,440
bacteria that can

458
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,838
process the the nitrogen from the air

459
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,240
which literally is prob is one of the

460
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,240
most difficult things uh to break apart

461
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,759
is a triple bond that's the hardest bond

462
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,000
to break apart and um n2 in the air is

463
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
is two nitrogens together in a triple

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
bond the only thing that has enough

465
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,078
energy to break that apart is is a

466
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,919
lightning bolt and so like when

467
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,479
lightning hits like

468
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,559
some of that nitrogen in the air becomes

469
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,920
free and it can attach to water and

470
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,399
oxygen and different things in the air

471
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,439
and then rain down as actual usable

472
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,600
nitrates for plants so you actually get

473
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
some nitrogen um

474
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,720
in your your rains when there's

475
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,838
thunderstorms

476
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,240
but the bacteria have the enzymes that

477
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,640
can start working on those triple bonds

478
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,519
and they can they can take them apart so

479
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,520
the how the plant houses basically a

480
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,400
laboratory that allows these enzymes to

481
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,000
work

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,120
and uh

483
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,199
so

484
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,279
just by planting these seeds all of a

485
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,279
sudden you're able to pull

486
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,119
the most difficult thing you know that's

487
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,959
the the nutrient that

488
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,958
that everything

489
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,200
needs to build proteins

490
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,440
that's locked up in our air and should

491
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,880
be too by the way the nitrogen cycle

492
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,798
it's really important to keep it the way

493
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
it is and we've really messed it up by

494
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,558
artificially producing nitrogen through

495
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,679
the harbor bosch process where we're

496
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,558
actually

497
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,960
using pressures in a catalyst and uh

498
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:50,000
hydrocarbons to fuel it all to make

499
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,000
to make nitrogen

500
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
and what we do is we we we've literally

501
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,038
put more than twice the amount of

502
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,120
nitrogen into

503
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,359
the system that should be there and so

504
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,599
you see a lot of issues with rivers with

505
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,279
water quality with die-offs with blooms

506
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,599
of algae with uh toxic blooms and with

507
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,000
full-on die-off because all the oxygen

508
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,079
is robbed of from the water so it's a

509
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,798
really big deal that we think about

510
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,918
nitrogen in a way that is regenerative

511
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,519
that

512
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,200
is the way that the planet has always

513
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,599
done it because it's always kept it in

514
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,919
the balance and it's it's allocated

515
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,439
those resources in an amazing way so

516
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,880
much of it's locked up in the sky the

517
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,558
bacteria can release the release the the

518
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
right amount for plants to be able to

519
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,798
use lightning you know releases the

520
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,798
right amount um and then we've just

521
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,879
completely changed that just like we

522
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,798
have with so many other things and co2

523
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000
in the air

524
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,359
and that's the other thing that you're

525
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,038
doing when you're cover cropping is

526
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,759
you're actually taking carbon from the

527
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,440
air and you are storing it in these

528
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,679
plant cells and in the roots and they're

529
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,279
growing and they're taking more carbon

530
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,679
from the air that's what photosynthesis

531
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,038
is it's it's taking carbon from the air

532
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,640
and it's building

533
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,400
plant matter with it you get organic

534
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
material from that you know and that's

535
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
also like with cannabis that's where we

536
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,519
get all our phytochemicals all our

537
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,359
medicine it's literally coming from

538
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,960
pulling carbon from the air and growing

539
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,479
from that through

540
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
relationships with roots and with

541
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,720
microorganisms and

542
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
doing that imbalance

543
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,880
is

544
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,119
is just what we need to do with

545
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
everything in life

546
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,399
and so

547
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,599
just the simple process of putting out a

548
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,000
cover crop

549
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,319
seed at the right time you pull in

550
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,160
carbon you build it into the soil that

551
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:36,000
that carbon is stored in the soil it

552
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,480
feeds more microbiology uh and

553
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,319
while you're pulling that carbon the

554
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,319
microbiology in the root nodules are

555
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,720
pulling in the nitrogen and making that

556
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,798
a nutrient-rich soil and all you have to

557
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,679
do is mulch that back in in the in the

558
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,839
spring and plant and you've just built

559
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,759
soil you've built fertility

560
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,000
while doing a positive thing for the

561
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,839
earth and then those plants get to grow

562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,839
with all of the nutrition and the

563
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,159
organic matter that you just grew out of

564
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,879
thin air in a way

565
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,720
what a fantastic explanation of nitrogen

566
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
fixation i i definitely think people

567
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,880
need to listen to that one again i

568
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,120
really enjoyed that so i guess there's

569
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
maybe just a follow-on in relation to

570
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,879
our listeners question

571
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,880
let's say you did exactly what you said

572
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
you'd done some nice cover crop and

573
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,160
you've plowed it in and you're looking

574
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
to go again this season well it doesn't

575
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,400
have to be plow plow makes a lot of

576
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,279
sense certainly in dry farming uh

577
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,440
plowing is is is the way that it is done

578
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,759
for well in certain places like river

579
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,360
banks and stuff you plow it in

580
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,679
it gets eaten quickly and then you

581
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,918
actually disturb the soil in a way that

582
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,919
works for the dry farming process

583
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,119
i prefer in certain locations mulching

584
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,679
in so you can figure out what you have

585
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,959
on a property that would work to mulch

586
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,519
something in whether it's a bunch of

587
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,840
cardboard or maybe wood chips old depth

588
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,038
covers for a moment although the plastic

589
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,720
you want to be careful about because you

590
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,640
only want to do a certain certain amount

591
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,640
of time and make sure that the oxygen

592
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,120
and that you aren't harming but you are

593
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,038
just returning organic matter to the

594
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,319
earth but you know worms will come up as

595
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,000
soon as something's covered and start

596
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,119
eating it you get all the millipedes you

597
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,640
get all kinds of um diversity of

598
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,319
creatures that get all this food that

599
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,440
they get to eat and then you just you

600
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,599
know you talk about like frass or like

601
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,600
um you know or compost teas like what's

602
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,399
happening on the top of this surface is

603
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,719
just

604
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,559
everything you could never even buy in

605
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,600
the store it's every positive thing you

606
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,918
could imagine and it's just piles of it

607
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,279
that just happen you know overnight

608
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,400
constantly they just come up and they

609
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,639
eat and they poop and they give

610
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,720
everything that the plants want as this

611
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,520
this layer of organic material goes back

612
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,079
so um yeah i'm a big fan of mulching

613
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,679
sometimes the tilling makes sense for

614
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,879
and there's certain farmers that really

615
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,360
know what they're doing and they know

616
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,559
how to maximize production and

617
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,479
you know really reduce resource use

618
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,240
in other cases maybe that's not the

619
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
place the thing to do for that because

620
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,038
you want to encourage a different type

621
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,520
of

622
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,279
soil life and

623
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,440
you know whether that's

624
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,519
using rotational grazing or whether it's

625
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,440
fully mulching and

626
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,519
developing more perennials there's lots

627
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,120
of different strategies um

628
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,359
but yeah i would

629
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,038
encourage mulching as well as as

630
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,678
not just healing

631
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,200
yeah of course and uh my my bad using

632
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,038
the wrong wording there were definitely

633
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,080
no you didn't no no because both both

634
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:31,038
are very are are needed and viable and

635
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,798
make sense in their applicable um uh

636
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,798
scenarios

637
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,839
yeah so before we get too in depth

638
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,918
because we're definitely going to go

639
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,678
further down the organics rabbit hole

640
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
take me back what was your first

641
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,919
experience with cannabis

642
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,480
um

643
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,559
kind of as early as my memories are just

644
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,120
watering beautiful plants

645
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:54,480
as a as a baby

646
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:58,000
and then next would be monday night

647
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,960
football there was a roommate who uh

648
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,279
old

649
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,159
peace activist and he actually had a

650
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,639
radio show too on kpfa and uh it was

651
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,400
about social justice and

652
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,400
but every every monday night

653
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,080
everyone would go in to his room and

654
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,240
watch monday night football and i

655
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,119
remember really enjoying when you know

656
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,038
people talk like this as they

657
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,798
passed the joint and held it in it was

658
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,119
like man everyone's super nice when they

659
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,480
talk like that and

660
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,199
you know just

661
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,960
fun watching you know a football game

662
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,279
with a bunch of happy adults that are

663
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,840
you know very carefree and enjoying each

664
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,759
other um so and the smell was wonderful

665
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,000
you know just this wonderful lingering

666
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,240
smell in the air and just positive

667
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
memories uh positive memories

668
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,558
um

669
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
and then

670
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,918
you know as a teenager just starting to

671
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,000
smoke with friends and um

672
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,840
also just being interested in the seeds

673
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,759
too and watching the plants grow like i

674
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,399
kind of you know both started around the

675
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,279
same time pretty early for me too um i

676
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,200
think 13 14 is when

677
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,399
you yeah it was about the right age for

678
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,720
me to

679
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,519
start perking my interest back into

680
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,319
something that i'd seen although where i

681
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,079
grew up

682
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,599
there was no more growing it was only

683
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,480
early when i was a kid and then they

684
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,678
made a decision that just with legal

685
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
um

686
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,000
uh impli you know issues that they they

687
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
were not going to risk the property i

688
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,759
actually grew up um

689
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,798
the property i grew up on was joan

690
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,200
baez's old place uh it's a place that is

691
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,119
uh was named by her struggle mountain

692
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
and it's uh

693
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,519
connected to

694
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,120
the

695
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:40,240
non-violent movements and and uh

696
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,278
the the movement against the vietnam war

697
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,440
and

698
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,119
multiple social justice movements as

699
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,360
well as being connected to this thing

700
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,359
called the land which was um

701
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,119
a area up there that uh basically

702
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,600
intentional communities were built on

703
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:01,278
land that was accessible at that time

704
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,959
and uh so they they built

705
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,960
all kinds of cool houses they had

706
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,120
irrigation there's spring systems

707
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,880
there's a um

708
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:13,278
a a long haul for for meetings and for

709
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,278
dances and um

710
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,558
and there was back to landers and there

711
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,798
was front landers that were more

712
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,639
political back the landers were more

713
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,000
about living off the land and the

714
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,320
gardens and

715
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,359
um

716
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,798
yeah so

717
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,038
yeah there's a rich history there um and

718
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,038
uh

719
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,959
they like cannabis and stuff but decided

720
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,960
that you know the the properties and

721
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,558
stuff of that area wasn't it just wasn't

722
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,720
worth uh

723
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,759
the legal risk during the time you know

724
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,400
and

725
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,720
i grew up during the reagan era and the

726
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,278
the war on drugs which always seemed

727
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,278
like just a horrible crime against uh

728
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,798
human rights and humanity and i can't

729
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,720
wait to see

730
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,119
that as as something

731
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,558
so far in the past and and just as

732
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,479
something is

733
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,798
i mean it's just a disgusting horrible

734
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,599
thing that destroyed so many lives and i

735
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,918
i can't wait till it's over

736
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,000
yeah certainly certainly

737
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,640
so what were some of the earliest

738
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,240
strains you can remember when you first

739
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
were getting into cannabis or was it at

740
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,558
a time when it was still like the kind

741
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,840
and it wasn't really named

742
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,319
yeah you know it was a little bit in

743
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,558
between um it wasn't so much about the

744
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,000
names um

745
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,158
as

746
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,079
it was it was interesting things so like

747
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,840
we had the monday it was a certain

748
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,599
variety it was super good that like my

749
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,558
friend would get every monday you know

750
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,278
like uh we had the crackhead and it was

751
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,278
just so strong and so stimulating that

752
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,440
it was just like crack you know and it

753
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,480
smelled so good and that's actually one

754
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,360
i super long for i i i would love to

755
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,038
find that profile again because it was

756
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,558
it was actually very addictive too

757
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,359
um yeah

758
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,240
uh you know other things uh

759
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,678
it

760
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
yeah a lot of things just weren't they

761
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,240
were just really good you know you just

762
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,798
call something like well it's a golden

763
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,480
indica you know it's beautiful

764
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,798
and that was the flavor profile and the

765
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,880
way that it grew um i remember coming up

766
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,038
the humble like so i grew up with like

767
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
santa cruz um

768
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,519
mountains and

769
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,839
also the indoor and um

770
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,319
it was a relatively it was extremely

771
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,519
wealthy area in palo alto um as far as

772
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,678
kids i we didn't have any money or

773
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,599
anything but like all the the the kids

774
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,519
around me were tremendously wealthy in

775
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,278
general um in that area is the booming

776
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,679
of silicon valley

777
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,640
and uh

778
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,360
so actually the weed was incredibly good

779
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,000
because there's the economic driver for

780
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:45,038
it to be uh i remember like we didn't

781
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,679
like we just didn't see uh sweat you

782
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,400
know mexican or brick or

783
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,240
or even like bee

784
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,559
letter like for

785
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,240
ever like honestly we just had like you

786
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,918
know cause you're buying eights and

787
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,278
twumps and then stuff like at least the

788
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,720
kids are in like

789
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,480
um

790
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,159
and it had to be really good i mean the

791
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,240
quality standards were super high so

792
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,559
honestly we started with like the best

793
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,798
and uh they remember i remember like

794
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,720
somebody like coming with like brickweed

795
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,319
and just like everyone's like it was a

796
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,079
novelty for a second and everyone had a

797
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,278
headache and by the next day like i

798
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,038
don't think you could sell it for any

799
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,640
price but you could sell a gram for 20

800
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:27,519
bucks the next day you know um but

801
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,840
yeah it's just yeah interesting times um

802
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,440
and coming up here well i remember the

803
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,519
first time coming up and humbled still

804
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,798
in high school and stuff and we got some

805
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,599
honeydew

806
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,000
uh

807
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,158
which at the time was like is that the

808
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,960
name of the variety or the place that it

809
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,440
came

810
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,440
and it was so good it had that kind of

811
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,600
pre-98 bubba

812
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,519
look and and structure but it was just

813
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,599
extra gooing it had kind of a honeydew

814
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,038
smell you know that made you even think

815
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,959
like is it called honeydew because of

816
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,278
that but i know it came from it had to

817
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,880
come from honeydew

818
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,599
and it was probably light depth too that

819
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,880
was you know looked better than um you

820
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,558
know a lot of the android people are

821
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,559
used to as well

822
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,440
um so you know if you paid the right

823
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,759
price freaking you got [ __ ] fire back

824
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,960
then um so

825
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,200
yeah we grew up an insanely good herb

826
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,840
and i loved putting away like the really

827
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,840
nice seeds i always just wanted to grow

828
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,359
all the time and and it was just really

829
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,439
interested in seeds and really

830
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,000
interested in and putting different

831
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,759
things together so i just always saved

832
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,679
in categories and like any nug that it

833
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,038
came from i'd like save the nug and save

834
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
the seed with it and write down

835
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,440
information about it and so when i

836
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,719
had you know like started uh doing my

837
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,679
first programs i had all this

838
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
information just literally from the the

839
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,200
flowers you know it wasn't like oh i

840
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,719
bought it from here and i know that it's

841
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
this or that i just

842
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,919
just from my own observations and the

843
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,519
nugs that it came from

844
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,440
wow and back at that time was did people

845
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,519
talk about seeds you found in bud as

846
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,120
though it was like oh you know you

847
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,879
shouldn't grow those or was it more

848
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,519
accepted that you could get some nice

849
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
stuff out of seed you found in bud

850
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,599
i mean if the flower is super nice and

851
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,519
it's a treasure you know like i think

852
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,199
you might as well look what's what why

853
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,960
not um

854
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,440
and also there wasn't so much uh

855
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,640
information or misinformation going on

856
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,278
where people didn't necessarily have uh

857
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,919
you know set ideas of what is a good

858
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,000
thing or a bad thing or not um

859
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,640
and god i mean if you pull the seed out

860
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,119
of a flower that was just like the best

861
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,038
flavor and best effect like that's a

862
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,558
freaking treasure put it away and see

863
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,839
what happens

864
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,798
100

865
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,879
and so

866
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,278
as you accumulated your kind of little

867
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,640
treasure trove of i called it the vault

868
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,240
it was the vault

869
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,799
i love it the vault i think everyone

870
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,679
needs to get the vault going um and was

871
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,519
this kind of what spurred you to get

872
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,120
growing initially and were those seeds

873
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,319
some of the first ones you planted how

874
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,798
did that go

875
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,439
yeah absolutely yeah um

876
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,038
yeah so you know doing cool gorilla

877
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,759
grows and

878
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,000
with springs and and you know nice

879
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,158
forest soil and um

880
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,159
and growing some of those varieties and

881
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,080
then doing

882
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,240
oh god probably

883
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:22,000
yeah night i was 98 doing um indoors

884
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,599
up in arcade actually moving up here at

885
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,240
that time um in humble and uh running

886
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,000
through the vault and what i did was i

887
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,960
just named all kinds of different things

888
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
um

889
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,038
mostly i was pretty into greek mythology

890
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,558
and so i'd name them different greek

891
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,919
names and

892
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,000
one of the ones that stood out was

893
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,759
athena and

894
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,200
um

895
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,000
that's a cultivar that's still with me

896
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,840
today

897
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,038
wow as far as like through the breeding

898
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,158
there's like

899
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,839
yeah

900
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,080
25 years of different projects with her

901
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:59,278
wow that's that's really impressive i

902
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:02,079
mean it makes me wonder um what do you

903
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,000
have any specific end direction or it's

904
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,240
just more of like a blank canvas and you

905
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,398
just see where it takes you

906
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
oh she's taking me a lot of places um

907
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
yeah it's it's a canvas it's it's

908
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,720
honestly it's not an interaction it's

909
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,720
it's um the plant teaches me

910
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,398
yeah what a brilliant sentiment so

911
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,039
the question i love to ask breeders when

912
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,678
you made your first cross was it an

913
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,960
accident or was it intentional and what

914
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,159
happened

915
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,679
um

916
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,440
well the first cross that i'd call

917
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,278
across um that went to

918
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,278
something else as far as making a clone

919
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,038
selection and then other people

920
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,440
growing that clone selection out was

921
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:49,440
actually just the bubba selection that

922
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,679
uh made up here with a friend back um

923
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,080
about 2001

924
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,320
crossing that onto and that became

925
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,960
actually the bubba that was pretty much

926
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,960
grown up here and became the main bubba

927
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,720
and mixing that with the athena that i

928
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,440
was talking about um

929
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,360
that selection and that was athena kush

930
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,200
um and that actually was growing up

931
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,398
quite a lot up here

932
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,399
it was just an amazing

933
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:18,079
hybrid between them um just insane

934
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,959
giant trichomes amazing resin production

935
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,519
um

936
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,399
really great division between

937
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,399
flowers just tons of beauty

938
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,319
and it couldn't get powdery mildew which

939
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,158
a lot of people really like so it ended

940
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,319
up getting grown quite a bit in that

941
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,278
that clone variety form

942
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:37,599
um and yeah so all throughout the early

943
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,398
2000s that was a pretty pretty popular

944
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,519
variety

945
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,518
um in the humble area

946
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:47,119
hell yeah and so do you feel like that

947
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,879
was kind of what really lit the passion

948
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,639
to start breeding for you seeing that

949
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
success people were having or was it was

950
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,480
already there it was just you know nice

951
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,319
to see people enjoying it

952
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,000
i've always been interested in plants um

953
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,240
and putting things together

954
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,640
um but yeah that i mean that that that

955
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,079
success of that was you know that was

956
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,080
definitely a

957
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,480
great spark

958
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,918
to continue to see

959
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,519
all the different

960
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,519
cool things you can put together and

961
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,599
what can come out of that and and also

962
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,679
being able to see how those come out on

963
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,838
all these different farms

964
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,918
because i you know way back then i i was

965
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,918
already doing this where i got to go see

966
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,598
something you worked on grown

967
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,358
in all these different places and seeing

968
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,599
the different expressions and

969
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,279
um it's just

970
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,879
massively interesting to me and it's

971
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,159
never stopped being it's like what i do

972
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,598
every year it's just i go to all the

973
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,838
farms and see everyone growing all the

974
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,879
seeds and and try to take in as much

975
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,878
information as much

976
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,039
art photography

977
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,200
much as much understanding of their

978
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,559
practices and and then hopefully knowing

979
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,759
everything about the flowers and the

980
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,838
products that get made from it

981
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,359
afterwards because it all is just

982
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,918
amazing information for the next

983
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,918
generation

984
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,640
great answer and you know what it segues

985
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,079
really brilliantly into something i

986
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,000
think we both wanted to touch on a

987
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
little bit which is kind of you're

988
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,920
talking about how

989
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,760
there's all these different facets that

990
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,760
you like to approach cannabis from you

991
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,640
know not just growing a photography the

992
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,720
information the research documentation

993
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,078
and i think that it raises the overall

994
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,118
question kind of

995
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,200
what is biovortex to you because i've

996
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,880
seen you post online and i'm assuming

997
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,879
that maybe not everyone has seen it but

998
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,079
it was a great post so i'd love for you

999
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,400
to be able to tell the listeners you

1000
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,240
know what is biovortex is it just a name

1001
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
is it something a lot more than that how

1002
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,719
would you pitch it

1003
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,800
yeah it's a it's been a thing of

1004
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,358
confusion a lot uh

1005
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,599
because it's like oh is this a

1006
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,000
you know is it just a genetics company

1007
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,039
are you selling vortex brewers or are

1008
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,800
you a living soil consultant or you know

1009
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,639
i mean i do all these things i guess

1010
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,920
like i make seeds and i make

1011
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,159
uh

1012
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,400
you know and i i've made vortex brewers

1013
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,000
and i've made living soil and and

1014
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,320
consulted on that and helped all that

1015
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,920
but um

1016
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,680
really at the base of it and also just

1017
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,519
the whole um

1018
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,838
you know the regenerative farm award and

1019
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,679
all of all of that kind of education

1020
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,679
towards that that at the base of

1021
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,440
biovortex it is a conceptual art piece

1022
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,199
that's what it it was from the beginning

1023
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,559
and continues to be

1024
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,960
and the concept of it is to influence

1025
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,480
the cannabis industry towards a more

1026
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,599
ecological

1027
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,320
um

1028
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,079
future one that's uh thoughtful about

1029
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,960
plant genetics that is thoughtful about

1030
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,839
social justice that is thoughtful about

1031
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,320
the soil about the earth about how we

1032
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,159
cultivate about the end users

1033
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,519
that putting all of this thought into

1034
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:46,159
how we do something and um what i

1035
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:49,039
thought was really powerful and

1036
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,799
about connecting these concepts with

1037
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,440
cannabis is

1038
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,119
how much attention is cannabis has right

1039
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,039
now and how much

1040
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,320
um

1041
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:03,599
economic attention and medical attention

1042
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,680
um that it has that if we can really

1043
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,559
show these types of

1044
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,078
farming practices about these kinds of

1045
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,159
community

1046
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,440
ethical practices in the way that we

1047
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:17,759
produce a healing product that we can

1048
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,119
really

1049
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,800
drive and change the way we look at

1050
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,320
marketing the way that we look at

1051
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,599
medicine the way that we look at

1052
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,640
agriculture

1053
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,559
and and you know forge a better future

1054
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,799
through that understanding and so i just

1055
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,960
but the trojan horse of of all the

1056
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,200
enthusiasm of cannabis i want to put

1057
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,358
these these concepts into it and um

1058
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,719
and what's amazing is cannabis is a a

1059
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,799
consciousness

1060
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:49,439
um uplifting um plant that

1061
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,599
allows for these ideas to to soar and so

1062
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
many different people that have been

1063
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,920
inspired by some of these concepts have

1064
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,079
done so many amazing things or have

1065
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,000
already been doing the work before but

1066
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,400
there's a mutualism and a synergy

1067
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,320
between all the people that are working

1068
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
towards these goals that i think is

1069
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,160
incredibly beautiful and and really

1070
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:12,319
that's what i want to cultivate and

1071
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:14,559
encourage and um so it's it's a it's a

1072
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,079
conceptual art piece that wants to build

1073
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,679
community and awareness of ecology and

1074
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,280
all of the amazing things that this

1075
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,159
plant can do for

1076
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,400
our

1077
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,118
mental awakening for our society and for

1078
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,838
social justice

1079
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,160
yeah what an incredibly detailed and and

1080
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,400
really kind of altruistic kind of body

1081
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,239
of work you've got going on there

1082
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,880
a question we commonly hear from our

1083
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,199
listeners is that they struggle to

1084
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,599
conceptually see how the small farm can

1085
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,919
progress going forward as things get

1086
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,800
harder to operate do you think operating

1087
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,880
under these sort of ideals and um

1088
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,519
guidance is a way in which smaller

1089
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,760
people can still make things possible to

1090
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,880
operate and maybe you know earn a living

1091
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,240
from

1092
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,559
well i think like all things it's just

1093
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,879
like things diversify it there's so many

1094
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,838
different things that cannabis produces

1095
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,480
so um no i don't know if like small

1096
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,719
farms makes sense for large biomass for

1097
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,719
phytochemical companies i don't know if

1098
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:15,519
it makes sense for you know large

1099
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,759
biomass for um fiber but it maybe it

1100
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,280
does it depends on your end product your

1101
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,359
your marketing and then like who you're

1102
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,880
working with and uh i know that there'd

1103
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,119
be amazing people doing that but

1104
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,039
hopefully you know we can that the

1105
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,838
practices are good regardless of the

1106
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,599
scale and that as a

1107
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,279
a community that

1108
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,838
buys these products that we are aware of

1109
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,760
these things and that we um hold people

1110
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,078
responsible for how they are producing

1111
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,560
things um and and really think about the

1112
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,640
environmental impacts in in certain

1113
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,880
large scale and and monoculture and what

1114
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,319
we want to see from that as far as the

1115
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,599
small farm

1116
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,800
um

1117
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,680
staying

1118
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,680
viable uh i think actually as far as

1119
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,639
the more um

1120
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
i hate the word recreational because i

1121
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,879
think it's all

1122
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,838
uh medical but like the craft and the

1123
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,920
you know and connoisseur market um

1124
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,078
that that it's only gonna be small farms

1125
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,800
because uh i think

1126
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,680
that it only goes one direction as far

1127
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,000
as

1128
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:24,559
understanding of quality um you don't

1129
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,800
you don't experience true quality and go

1130
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,000
backwards you don't experience the

1131
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,800
quality of an amazing dry farm peach you

1132
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,119
know from an amazing farm like and the

1133
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
quality of that that flavor like it

1134
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,079
can't be

1135
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,598
reproduced you can't just buy it and

1136
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,440
have it shipped somewhere

1137
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,320
um you can't

1138
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,400
you know

1139
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,240
recreate a michelin star restaurant that

1140
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,760
has a relationship with a small farmer

1141
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:52,159
near them um so i think we already

1142
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,480
understand that quality

1143
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:58,318
but we have a lot of work to do as far

1144
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,240
as education for the consumers

1145
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,519
through in just even in california but

1146
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,118
throughout the world california might

1147
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,639
have a very sophisticated market in

1148
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,440
general but there's a lot of work to do

1149
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,679
there

1150
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,039
um in in understanding practices and and

1151
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,759
so that's part of like the regenerative

1152
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,759
cannabis farm award is like not just

1153
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,680
about products not just about flowers

1154
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,680
which is of course king and you know

1155
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,399
it's like we need to know what

1156
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,559
everyone loved smoking on the most but

1157
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,800
let's talk about the practices and you

1158
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,799
know some of these farms do quite well

1159
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,480
in the contest as well with the insane

1160
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,119
products that they're they're coming to

1161
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,318
the table with um

1162
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,000
and so we get to actually look at the

1163
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,719
practices of these farms like how are

1164
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,318
they growing how are they um

1165
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,679
how are they using water how are they

1166
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,838
interacting with their community what

1167
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,399
medicines are they making and this is

1168
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,400
how we actually we created a matrix to

1169
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,160
judge these different farms and we go

1170
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,720
out on

1171
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,719
a site visit and we will

1172
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,719
get the whole tour go through everything

1173
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,639
ask the questions and then later we we

1174
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,399
run it through this this matrix of all

1175
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,039
these different um

1176
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,760
aspects of of what regenerative

1177
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,838
can mean um and a lot of it is

1178
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,079
ecological but there's also like the

1179
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,838
community and medical and social justice

1180
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,880
aspects of that as well

1181
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:14,000
um

1182
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,960
and

1183
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,800
and

1184
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,679
dan maher of high tide permaculture has

1185
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,079
done an amazing job um developing that

1186
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,639
with me with an amazing

1187
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,318
permaculture and um

1188
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,400
you know science mind

1189
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:32,639
ecology like that is put into it is is

1190
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,280
it's very thoughtful and

1191
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,799
we we get to kind of understand

1192
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,319
something about these farms so having

1193
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,160
these awards so people can see

1194
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,920
uh a little bit more about these farms

1195
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,440
and making movies about them and so

1196
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,559
people can see the practices and and

1197
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,720
know that they

1198
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,480
want a flower grown like that they want

1199
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,480
a flower that's grown with love that

1200
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,920
helps the environment they want a flower

1201
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,400
that

1202
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,800
comes from a farm that that is a part of

1203
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,119
cannabis community that is a part of uh

1204
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,039
you know their watershed and their

1205
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,160
environment their forests

1206
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:12,838
um that are true stewards as well as

1207
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,838
growing just insanely fire herb

1208
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,159
100 and do you think that we can get to

1209
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,880
a point one day where the average

1210
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,679
consumer could take all of these factors

1211
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,440
into mind and truly appreciate the

1212
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,879
quality of a product that comes from one

1213
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,559
of these farms

1214
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,960
and view that as the best or do you

1215
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,039
think that it's hard for consumers to

1216
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,599
understand all of the inner workings and

1217
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,440
why this regenerative farmed product is

1218
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,440
so superior

1219
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,599
it's hard

1220
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,800
but it gets easier every year and it

1221
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,599
takes a lot of cooperation

1222
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,519
um

1223
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,200
and it's i think it's i'd like to see

1224
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,679
more on the dispensary ends there's some

1225
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,439
that are really cool um you know soulful

1226
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,639
from a very early

1227
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,358
um

1228
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,199
point in sebastopol california had had

1229
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,838
been excited about these regenerative

1230
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,358
farms and wanting to convey all the

1231
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,159
information they could about them and

1232
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,239
have done an outstanding job with that

1233
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,078
and then now we're really lucky to have

1234
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,759
um our dear friend

1235
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,800
uh crystal who has opened up the um

1236
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,599
humble urban market in arcata and

1237
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,480
i think like like no other dispensary

1238
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,039
it's gonna really be able to tell that

1239
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,039
farm story because she is such a deep

1240
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,639
part of canada's community important

1241
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,400
part of you know

1242
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,960
uh so much of the policy developing

1243
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,280
appellations and um

1244
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,280
but the and just working with all the

1245
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,519
farms and just being she's just a

1246
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,000
positive pillar in the community so i'm

1247
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,960
just so happy to have someone like that

1248
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,639

1249
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,318
help educate the public to the um

1250
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,159
the amazing farming practices that are

1251
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,639
happening on some of these farms the

1252
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,159
quality differences and just

1253
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,039
giving them access to really quality

1254
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,199
medicine medicine

1255
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,039
yeah certainly

1256
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,679
so let's go back

1257
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,759
give me the rundown how did the creation

1258
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,679
of black dog go down i think a lot of

1259
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,079
people are interested in what the

1260
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,679
genesis story was how would you describe

1261
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,680
it

1262
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,519
um well it starts with um

1263
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,759
my dear friend ryan with humbled seed

1264
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,960
organization and projects that we were

1265
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,839
doing together

1266
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,838
uh from an early

1267
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,239
point you know back in even

1268
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,960
a little ways into like the athena kush

1269
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:37,118
days like i got to meet him through um

1270
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,599
my neighbor and we

1271
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:43,200
you know instantly were we're

1272
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,960
close friends and um you know he was

1273
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,318
very ahead of the game understanding

1274
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,039
where you know what was happening with

1275
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,800
seeds and you know saw the work that i

1276
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,838
was doing and saw

1277
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,839
um

1278
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:54,960
the potential and um

1279
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,960
and all of the things that were

1280
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,119
happening here and did an amazing job

1281
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,400
bringing that to um really the whole

1282
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,119
world

1283
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,559
um and so with projects that yeah we

1284
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,200
were working on together uh a uh just a

1285
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,279
regular blackberry um you know mother

1286
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,000
with a um

1287
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,760
the

1288
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,760
emerald headband it was which is a uh

1289
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,280
a california sour diesel with a lemon og

1290
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,480
and that

1291
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,960
um

1292
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,960
yeah it was kind of the genesis of the

1293
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,599
black dog and working with that in 2012

1294
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,480
i made a selection that was like

1295
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,079
just exactly what i wanted and i was i

1296
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,159
actually originally called it like

1297
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,000
trimmer's delight because it was it

1298
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,759
literally took less than two hours to

1299
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,519
trim a pound so like

1300
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,800
you know it's just like okay that's way

1301
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,639
too much money

1302
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
but it was it was it was a dessert you

1303
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,759
know it's like okay cool you know but

1304
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,159
you know when you finished a hard job

1305
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,280
like okay here's dessert like

1306
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,279
you get to make a bunch real fast

1307
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,599
but uh and then of course i you know i

1308
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,640
like to just trim it myself too but

1309
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,119
um

1310
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,799
so anyway that clone got saved and then

1311
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,358
i just continued working with that and

1312
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,160
that kind of became the canon for

1313
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,759
what i was doing with it and then um

1314
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:15,519
really i mean black dog's still being

1315
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,359
made you know like uh that was 2012 and

1316
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:21,920
every year i've done multiple different

1317
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:24,799
um variations of back crosses or um you

1318
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,960
know continuing sibling generations um

1319
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,599
as well as probably at this point maybe

1320
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,000
crossed it on to 250 maybe different

1321
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,760
things or more um and then multiple

1322
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,159
generations from multiple different

1323
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,079
crosses from that so i ca it's kind of

1324
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,519
this fun flagship project where it's

1325
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,760
just like i'm gonna do everything you

1326
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,119
could possibly do with this plant like

1327
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,960
you know just

1328
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,039
unbelievable like

1329
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,079
uh stored potential

1330
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,838
in one plan so like yeah just from [ __ ]

1331
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,440
all over the world you know all the

1332
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,920
different things like i've probably put

1333
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,039
it on black target at some point

1334
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,639
um

1335
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,199
so yeah i don't know there's something

1336
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,078
about having this this one plant with

1337
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:07,439
the stored information of

1338
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,839
such a vast worldwide genetic potential

1339
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,880
yeah certainly as well as having this

1340
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,078
super inbred line

1341
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,358
as yeah you know getting that

1342
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,440
consistency

1343
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,358
um you know it's what i really love is

1344
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,920
just like hearing all the positive stuff

1345
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,358
from people's experience with it

1346
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,960
it's been a lot of people where it's

1347
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,960
helped them

1348
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,159
with medical issues with addiction

1349
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,199
issues with mental health issues like

1350
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,558
um that it puts them in a place that

1351
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,919
that helps them there's something about

1352
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,519
the

1353
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,200
the chemotype that

1354
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,960
the terpene and the the cannabinoid

1355
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,519
combination it's you know nothing like

1356
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,519
specifically unique and it's not super

1357
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,880
potent or anything but it's just there's

1358
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,199
something the way it like connects you

1359
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,800
with nature balances like it

1360
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:52,719
and and people seem to have a very

1361
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,119
similar experience

1362
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,399
um and it's just so [ __ ] pretty to

1363
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,838
watch grow

1364
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,440
and yeah yeah she's a special one

1365
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,000
lovely so

1366
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,318
i i assume you've heard a plethora of

1367
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,280
feedback from people about it but are

1368
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:11,358
there any kind of traits or properties

1369
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,040
you're pretty neat to see the hashtag

1370
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,119
blackdog kush and it made sure to put

1371
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,159
the kush on the end so it's not buried

1372
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,599
in a pile of labradors and stuff

1373
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,399
which would happen

1374
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,079
yeah

1375
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,838
it's like if everyone just tags black

1376
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,000
dog it's like no one's gonna see that

1377
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,358
hashtag i promise you but if you do

1378
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,280
black dog cush it's like it's pretty

1379
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,960
good but there's thousands from all over

1380
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,519
the world and it's it's really amazing

1381
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,480
to see and you know super thankful uh

1382
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,480
with a

1383
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,679
relationship with um yeah the friend

1384
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,358
ryan and eric and humble seed

1385
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:42,000
organization with getting that

1386
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,279
everywhere um it's really really cool to

1387
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,239
see

1388
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,000
and are there any uh characteristics or

1389
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,159
problems you feel it's particularly good

1390
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,239
for like for example if someone was

1391
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,838
having like low energy or like is there

1392
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,439
anything which stands out you think it's

1393
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:56,799
quite good for if patients were having

1394
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,559
that issue

1395
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,079
i think it's good for

1396
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,800
what it's good for for the person you

1397
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,599
know i don't i wouldn't pigeonhole it um

1398
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,680
but

1399
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,680
the one thing that has been um

1400
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,119
consistent though is

1401
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
a connection with nature and a balancing

1402
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,318
um

1403
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,239
which helps with a lot of things i think

1404
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:19,838
um

1405
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,799
yeah

1406
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:25,519
sure so do you prefer in general to kind

1407
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,760
of work lines till you've got a pretty

1408
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,239
good idea of what's going on or are you

1409
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,960
a bit more like let's do some f1s and

1410
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:35,679
kind of see what comes out of it

1411
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,559
well i mean every year i

1412
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,598
i work a few lines

1413
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,040
i figure out what is possible and you

1414
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,599
know maybe that's

1415
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,960
one maybe it's four maybe it's six maybe

1416
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,880
it's two

1417
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,639
and then

1418
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,280
on top of that i just try to do every

1419
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,519
freaking thing i can so like yeah i make

1420
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,000
and and uh yeah i make all kinds of poly

1421
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,239
hybrids uh i you know

1422
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,318
and i try to i try to set things up i i

1423
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,439
make probability waves is kind of how i

1424
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:05,759
think about it

1425
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,838
and so i set multiple different timings

1426
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,440
up and i have my like super planned out

1427
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:10,799
like my four projects like i'm doing

1428
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,679
this year that are like

1429
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,559
you know i'm doing my cherry lime dog bc

1430
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,399
uh one f threes and i'm making the f the

1431
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,960
cherry lime dog f4s

1432
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,039
um and i'm doing a very concentrated you

1433
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,880
know effort towards

1434
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,679
making those be exactly what i want them

1435
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,838
to be but at the same time i've

1436
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:33,279
i've planned i have

1437
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:35,039
maybe 100 different varieties that are

1438
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,760
staggered at different times that will

1439
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,400
be

1440
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,000
for different projects and um i will

1441
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
just try to

1442
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,800
see what makes sense at each

1443
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,039
time you know there's a lot of thought

1444
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,839
going into how i set it up but the thing

1445
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,480
is the way the probability wave

1446
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:54,880
collapses uh i might not know until the

1447
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,880
days that they come you know as you you

1448
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,800
smell a variety that you see their

1449
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,800
resistance that you see

1450
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,519
their profiles and that you see

1451
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,760
you know what kind of male might

1452
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,280
work with them or what the timing will

1453
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,760
be um

1454
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,280
and yeah what you want to save what you

1455
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,280
want to clone what you pollen you'd want

1456
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,319
to save what which ones you want to put

1457
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
together

1458
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,039
um and what kind of preservation work

1459
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,639
that you might be doing just putting a

1460
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,079
couple things together that you already

1461
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,118
have or

1462
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,039
or

1463
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,000
are you going to do a whole lot of new

1464
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,318
things um i want to do it all

1465
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,639
so i just work really hard on a couple

1466
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,880
lines and then i make a whole lot of

1467
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,279
poly hybrids

1468
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,800
yeah brilliant answer and and i guess

1469
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,599
the question that comes to mind for me

1470
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,240
is

1471
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,640
like the athena do you think there's an

1472
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,439
end point or is it a forever changing

1473
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:50,078
and morphing sort of piece of art

1474
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,960
exactly yeah forever changing morphing

1475
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,960
piece of art um

1476
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:58,400
yeah i mean yeah i can't i don't want to

1477
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,639
manipulate that relationship i don't

1478
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,159
know there's something about that plant

1479
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,838
but

1480
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,838
uh she's just given me so much and

1481
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:12,558
yeah i'm just gonna just watch and learn

1482
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,400
from her and and each year um see see

1483
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,319
what happens and make sure to

1484
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,680
preserve things i've lost some of the

1485
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,759
things that i might have thought that i

1486
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,399
wanted to continue but i've also gained

1487
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,280
so many others so uh yeah i'm just open

1488
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,680
to

1489
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,720
to where that goes um

1490
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,279
but

1491
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,519
as long as i still see her in there

1492
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,119
sure and out of the current crosses

1493
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,519
you're working on i mean you mentioned

1494
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,680
the cherry lime dog earlier on what are

1495
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,800
some of the ones you're really excited

1496
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,719
to delve more into

1497
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,400
oh yeah of that flavor right now too

1498
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,558
well the thing is it's it doesn't even

1499
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,559
have to just like so i'm looking at just

1500
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,160
cherry lime dog as multiple ways to dive

1501
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,760
into the same thing

1502
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,960
um so

1503
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,920
you know i took

1504
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,358
the

1505
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,079
cherry lime dog

1506
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,920
and you know i made my f2s from that but

1507
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,960
then i was also like out of those f2s

1508
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,039
i'm like

1509
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,800
you know i kind of want

1510
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,519
it to look a lot like

1511
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,640
the black dog structure it too and bring

1512
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:13,358
some of that back so i just i i put some

1513
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:16,239
of that back onto the um

1514
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,639
the 2012 black dog clone

1515
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,959
uh to make the vc1

1516
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,480
uh and then and then i made the f2s with

1517
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,400
those and i'm making the f3s right now

1518
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,559
so it's like it's kind of going down a

1519
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,200
different line although it's still i did

1520
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,440
make my selection holding on to the

1521
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,519
flavor profile that i really liked that

1522
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,358
a lot of the cherry lime pop you know

1523
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,280
shines through from that from from

1524
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,480
jackson from mean gene freeborn

1525
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,359
selections

1526
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,400
um

1527
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,480
but it's like it's a super great blend

1528
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,240
with the black dog it's like yeah it's

1529
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,760
just got that

1530
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,558
it's got the right

1531
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,280
harmony of the blends of flavor and then

1532
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,800
but it's a little more black dog in

1533
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,079
structure so this is also a more um

1534
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:03,200
uniform dwarfy and i also made a a a

1535
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,880
dark selection and um a slightly lighter

1536
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,519
selection so one that just turns purple

1537
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,920
super quick and like right now it's like

1538
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,000
really really dark just with the first

1539
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,680
little like nugs coming up for the um

1540
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,880
the breeding project i'm working on

1541
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,078
right now with them

1542
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:21,119
um frosted out like crazy just at you

1543
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,599
know they're not even a half a

1544
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,318
inch like wide yet but just

1545
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,760
completely coated and dark

1546
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,440
but they have the structure of the black

1547
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,160
dog and so they're they're consistent

1548
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,800
they're squatty um they won't need any

1549
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,039
caging they need no effort i don't water

1550
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,800
or feed or do anything i just let them

1551
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,480
do their thing so i kind of like

1552
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,200
breeding for plants that you don't have

1553
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,079
to do anything to and that produce a

1554
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,439
tremendous amount for their biomass

1555
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,960
they don't they're not necessarily the

1556
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,920
monster plants

1557
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,679
um

1558
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,079
that you need to cage and that you know

1559
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,399
take up all this space and but um the

1560
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,880
thing is they're producing more flowers

1561
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,440
for the rest of the the plant

1562
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,280
and they um and if you have them next to

1563
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,920
each other you're probably going to have

1564
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,839
a more productive square footage

1565
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,079
so i do like reading about

1566
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:11,119
thinking about those kinds of lines

1567
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,440
um

1568
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,119
and then with the cherry lime dog f4s

1569
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,960
that making right now

1570
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,838
um i'm kind of going with the more

1571
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,159
classic hybrid growth where they were um

1572
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:24,480
but they're a taller one the cherry lime

1573
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:26,000
pop was tall um and it had a really nice

1574
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,920
mix with the black dog where it was

1575
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,760
still like a medium tall plant but it

1576
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,159
was well structured from the black dog

1577
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,720
but not the i had problems with the over

1578
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,519
stretching of the the lime pop

1579
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,118
um

1580
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,759
in this area because the branches got

1581
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,440
too wet or wind and stuff they they had

1582
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,440
a tendency to break a little bit easier

1583
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,880
and i really don't i'm kind of an

1584
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,720
all-natural style and i don't want to

1585
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,280
have to do cages and things

1586
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,279
um so that the black dog structure

1587
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,599
really worked

1588
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,920
great to keep those those stems and

1589
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,920
branches uh really strong

1590
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,240
and uh but the you know the the f3

1591
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,480
generation is is a nice tall fast

1592
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:06,639
growing it's not all squatty

1593
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,079
and you know that's nice for people too

1594
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:12,400
um and then it just has a just insane uh

1595
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,400
flavor profile and so i did a pretty big

1596
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,760
selection last year and that god it was

1597
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,280
so

1598
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,440
i mean it wasn't giant or whatever but

1599
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,599
it was so hard to choose because it was

1600
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,119
literally like this is my favorite aroma

1601
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,960
i've ever smelled in my life no this one

1602
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,760
is no this one isn't like

1603
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,960
um you know and so the one i ended up

1604
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,119
like

1605
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,358
popping from like god damn that the

1606
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,280
aroma from that is just like yeah it's

1607
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,078
from the gods for sure

1608
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,880
and big big respect to jackson for his

1609
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,640
his nose and his work

1610
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,798
yeah most certainly i mean to me

1611
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,279
yeah yeah yeah so it makes me wonder

1612
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,599
then are there any other sort of modern

1613
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,000
genetics or modern clones that you would

1614
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,519
be interested in incorporating into the

1615
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,280
black dog line just kind of seeing where

1616
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,719
it goes dude you could literally

1617
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,359
probably name every single one and it's

1618
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,358
already happened

1619
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,798
like go ahead

1620
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,358
it's happening all right yeah i mean

1621
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:11,199
yeah so i mean like well

1622
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:15,039
and like hash lines too like the banana

1623
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:17,039
dog is is uh been wonderful and um i

1624
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,440
mentioned smoking on some of that

1625
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:22,639
cash earlier too that um the garden of

1626
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,440
greece did cush kirk and um amanda they

1627
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:25,838
uh

1628
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,440
they are just freaking hash artists and

1629
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,239
and amazing regenerative farmers

1630
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,720
dragonfly earth medicine uh

1631
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,318
pure farmers up in oregon just just

1632
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,879
making

1633
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,239
i i honestly like their freezer it's the

1634
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,079
best

1635
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,479
the the highest concentration of the

1636
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,720
best hash in the world legos is like i

1637
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,838
went up with was simply adam and we're

1638
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,159
just like

1639
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:49,759
yeah they just took our breath away the

1640
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:51,838
some of the best gourmet experiences of

1641
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,920
my life uh with actually their puppy

1642
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:58,239
breath which was the mendo breath with

1643
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,720
uh an sfe uh black dog um and

1644
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:04,479
yeah so i mean there's two you know sf

1645
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:06,959
eog and mendo breath on black dog but oh

1646
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,000
my god the the quality of that hash is

1647
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,400
just unbelievable it's so um

1648
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
just great structure great consistency

1649
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,240
too you can just like snap it off and

1650
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,798
like it just took a second to like

1651
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,759
just press it and it just like i mean

1652
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:23,599
the idea of rosing that quality of full

1653
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,920
melt would be so insane because it's

1654
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,798
just so beyond you just touch it and

1655
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,639
it's already so beyond rosin um and then

1656
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,079
and then it holds a consistency too

1657
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:34,078
where it's like amber i can like break

1658
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,599
it even at room temperature where like

1659
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,798
other stuff would just kind of get a

1660
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,920
little like

1661
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:39,920
you know start to be a little more

1662
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,039
volatile a little greasy

1663
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,798
um you know either cake or grease and uh

1664
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,318
this this has this like jewel like

1665
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,358
quality to it the puppy breath had that

1666
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,199
too

1667
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,679
it makes it really easy to catch too and

1668
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,519
they get really high yields and

1669
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,960
they're very resistant too very mold

1670
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,838
resistant

1671
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,318
but i love breeding for high ice water

1672
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,400
hash yields i'm really interested in

1673
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:06,480
trichomorphology

1674
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,400
and also uh you know bud structure and

1675
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,318
and then also the terpene and

1676
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,358
cannabinoid uh

1677
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,880
production that is associated with

1678
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,119
trichomes that are easier to work with

1679
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,358
with ice water hash that lead to higher

1680
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,119
yields and then also thinking about like

1681
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:22,880
where the um

1682
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,760
you know getting different unique

1683
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,240
flavors and how you could do that with

1684
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,640
out neces with still getting a decent

1685
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:33,358
return on other varieties that might not

1686
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:37,039
be as uh good for

1687
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:39,039
for catching in a mesh

1688
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,960
yeah what a what a sort of conscious

1689
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,519
effort with breeding to take it in that

1690
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,960
direction i and then with cbd too i

1691
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,039
really want to do that with cbd and i

1692
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,480
have the last couple years i have some

1693
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,759
pretty

1694
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,318
you know good uh beginning successes

1695
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,119
towards that effort and i'm excited for

1696
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,719
like

1697
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:01,280
um uh the holy tonic selection which was

1698
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,039
a big sur holy weed catatonic cross that

1699
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,079
there's a two to one selection that has

1700
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,519
the right kind of trichomes and then um

1701
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,599
some of the different crosses with that

1702
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,199
like um black

1703
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,760
black sapphire on that which is double

1704
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,798
black dog sapphire scout holy crack um

1705
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,880
and then

1706
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,559
just straight black dog on that too it's

1707
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,400
like some of these are gonna

1708
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,359
they

1709
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,440
they're gonna come out with the right

1710
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,598
trichomes i also did some banana og

1711
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,119
harley sue but really the the cantatonic

1712
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:31,599
and the holy tonic um crosses are

1713
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,280
look like they're gonna work really the

1714
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,318
selections that i made years ago of

1715
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:40,400
these they're specific ones um

1716
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:43,119
and a really orangey really beautiful um

1717
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,200
high trichome content variety of the the

1718
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,519
cantatonic that's a three to one

1719
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,318
uh that the holy tonic was was was made

1720
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:49,280
from

1721
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,759
they

1722
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,280
just more than most cbd varieties they

1723
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,760
have the type of trichomes that could do

1724
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,440
it and i've seen some good successes so

1725
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,040
far so i'm really excited

1726
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,880
uh for some of the research projects

1727
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,279
that are happening this year with that

1728
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,880
and seeing that with come to fluorescent

1729
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:09,280
with some of the extractors and farmers

1730
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,519
yeah of course of course so

1731
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,480
i mean a question i've had for a little

1732
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,440
while now is do you think that

1733
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:20,639
ultimately terroir is able to manifest

1734
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,559
itself more so in hash maybe than flour

1735
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,039
like do you think it's more perceivably

1736
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,359
noticeable if you made a product kind of

1737
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,119
like what you described that that might

1738
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:30,719
stand itself out a little more than the

1739
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,480
flour or do you think not necessarily

1740
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,480
like they could both equally be very

1741
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,480
unique

1742
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:38,480
um

1743
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,559
yeah they both could be very unique i

1744
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:46,318
mean certainly

1745
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,319
there's a concentration that happens

1746
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:50,960
with hash and i think

1747
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,558
what one thing i've i've definitely

1748
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,880
heard over and over again from hash

1749
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,760
artists um and extractors

1750
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,559
is

1751
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,000
they

1752
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,599
fully

1753
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,719
have been blown away when they first

1754
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,480
like run some living soil uh

1755
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:07,199
base trichomes like when they've just

1756
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,400
been running salt you know or indoor or

1757
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,558
or maybe

1758
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,599
less uh

1759
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,599
organically grown depths or stuff with

1760
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,960
dust and all the things

1761
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,640
but uh

1762
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,039
you know i yeah i've seen it happen a

1763
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,440
bunch of times just like oh my god like

1764
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,119
what is the quality of this is just

1765
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,519
incredible and it's hard for them to go

1766
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,880
back so um most extractors that i've

1767
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:30,639
worked with who've been turned on to

1768
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,240
that have been very

1769
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,679
uh

1770
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:35,439
they only want to source that type of

1771
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,798
material

1772
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,119
yeah so i think that shows something

1773
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:41,679
about the terroir for sure

1774
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,760
yeah certainly i mean just to kind of

1775
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:45,038
stimulate a bit of discussion it wasn't

1776
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,520
too long ago i was chatting with

1777
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,599
burnside collective who were the guys

1778
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,599
who won the hash category of the ego

1779
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,119
clash and they did it in salts and they

1780
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,720
made this interesting comment where they

1781
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,280
were kind of like

1782
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,838
we think that producing hash and

1783
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,720
concentrates specifically it's more

1784
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:02,639
about

1785
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,480
like the watering techniques and like

1786
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,719
the humidities and stuff

1787
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,318
more so than organic versus inorganic

1788
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,558
because you're just kind of getting the

1789
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,480
glandular heads do you think do you

1790
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,519
think there's any truth to that or do

1791
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,960
you think sure sure um absolutely

1792
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,719
environmental conditions like never

1793
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,960
being stressed out having the right like

1794
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,719
temperature and and you know just the

1795
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,159
plant being happy all the time and it

1796
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:27,279
being the right genetic in the first

1797
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:30,480
place is it might be stand out even more

1798
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,280
than uh other other things too um i mean

1799
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,960
i think

1800
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,880
every it first just starts off with the

1801
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,119
genetic like is that genetic gonna put

1802
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,798
off the flavor that's gonna work out

1803
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,119
like if it doesn't then it doesn't

1804
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:43,920
really matter what you're doing it's not

1805
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,760
going to work um next though i mean i

1806
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,400
really think yeah just like not having

1807
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,799
an environment that has stress um you

1808
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,880
know i remember when uh like simply adam

1809
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:54,798
first like was washing some of our

1810
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,480
living soil grown

1811
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:58,400
um

1812
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,079
coastal stuff you know like i think

1813
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,358
there's something about the lack of

1814
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,599
stress in the environment because it

1815
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:05,440
never gets too hot or too dry or

1816
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,640
anything and the trichomes could really

1817
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,039
just be

1818
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:11,598
what they wanted to be with never seeing

1819
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:14,000
any stress so i think uh

1820
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,400
yeah i mean someone putting a lot of um

1821
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,920
effort towards environmental control and

1822
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,920
not using any

1823
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,519
shitty products at least or at least

1824
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,480
stuff that would be very um

1825
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,440
you know benign i guess like uh you know

1826
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,798
people that are going to be using

1827
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,720
pesticides or any kind of sprays are

1828
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:32,400
going to destroy hash i mean obviously

1829
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,598
it's not going to taste good and it

1830
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,920
would be toxic and all that stuff

1831
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,440
but you know some mineral salts that are

1832
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,920
thoughtful um in a good environment um

1833
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,838
i don't think it would be what it

1834
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,119
could be but i do think it would be

1835
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,199
better than a

1836
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,760
uh something else that

1837
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,879
uh was was stressed out potentially and

1838
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,160
certainly better than something that

1839
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,599
wasn't the right genetic in the first

1840
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,519
place

1841
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,640
yeah certainly

1842
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:00,880
and so

1843
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,639
an issue i've been kind of tossing in my

1844
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,559
mind is do you think there's any

1845
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,480
relationship between

1846
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,880
like the trichome density that you see

1847
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,480
on the plant and the quality of hash or

1848
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,000
do you think they're not tied in

1849
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,920
together and the reason i bring this up

1850
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,760
is because i think a lot of people look

1851
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,559
at like mac or whatever and they're like

1852
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:24,000
oh it must make the best hash yeah next

1853
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,319
um so yeah and like this is something i

1854
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,159
like to bring up when you know like

1855
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,838
just in that the idea of trichome

1856
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:31,519
density it's like how do you even

1857
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:34,000
measure that you know and i i would like

1858
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:35,920
to establish like you know better

1859
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,599
uh

1860
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,920
better ways to

1861
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,920
to measure that because you can't just

1862
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,280
say there's this many trichomes that's

1863
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,519
not telling you

1864
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:48,880
what you need to know it's what size are

1865
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:50,559
the heads you know like uh you know what

1866
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,559
just you have to describe the next like

1867
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,200
are they all snaking around and making

1868
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,880
that illusion of the whole thing and and

1869
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,480
you know it's like black dogs is one

1870
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,680
that's like both you know it's got the

1871
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,440
long necks and it's got the the heads so

1872
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:05,759
it's got that like

1873
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,599
it can have that super frosted out look

1874
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,839
um but you know there's other varieties

1875
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,400
that might even be packing more

1876
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:13,679
trichomes but they they're not um

1877
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,280
they're not poking them out with the

1878
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:19,679
necks you know um you know like they're

1879
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,280
they're just heads that kind of

1880
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,399
grow

1881
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,160
before the neck even or

1882
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,838
um

1883
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,519
or then yeah they grow and then the neck

1884
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:31,920
will kind of come after and they'll hook

1885
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,679
a bit but it's like the plants that put

1886
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,000
that effort towards the head

1887
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:39,118
but it's not just that too it's what is

1888
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,880
the makeup inside that trichome what are

1889
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,880
the terpenes and cannabinoids and a lot

1890
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,358
of cbd varieties like why i was talking

1891
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,480
about it they don't yield that well they

1892
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,000
they have like high immersing um

1893
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,920
contents quite often and different

1894
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,599
volatile trips like i just they just

1895
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,920
grease out really easy you touch them

1896
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,280
and they grease out like you obviously

1897
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,240
you're going to lose so much if you're

1898
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,640
trying to

1899
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,000
to separate trichome heads um if they

1900
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,118
all just burst

1901
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,838
um

1902
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,760
so

1903
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:08,558
there's a lot of things to think about

1904
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,599
um in in the morphology and the chemical

1905
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,400
makeup

1906
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,960
beyond

1907
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,119
uh trichome density

1908
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,439
and do you think over time as the

1909
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,159
quality of hash and concentrates in

1910
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,519
general improves that we're gonna see

1911
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,439
more and more people move away from

1912
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,120
flower move towards concentrates or do

1913
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,318
you think it's just like whatever floats

1914
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:27,759
your boat

1915
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,600
your flower's never going to go anywhere

1916
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,238
and it's like the basis for everything

1917
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,520
and

1918
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,119
um even if

1919
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,640
i want to smoke

1920
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:36,479
all day i want to see where you know the

1921
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,798
flower came from too and enjoy that too

1922
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,838
or roll the joint with the two together

1923
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,039
um

1924
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:42,079
and

1925
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,920
yeah

1926
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:46,000
there's

1927
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,560
and right now like actually it's kind of

1928
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,479
funny in the california like legal mark

1929
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,359
in all the markets there's really like

1930
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,678
no end to the desire for really quality

1931
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,520
flower especially after the um

1932
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,640
outdoor season's been over for so long

1933
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:03,440
and depths are just hitting and um

1934
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,279
and indoor is so rare in general

1935
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,960
especially also in the legal

1936
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,880
market too that

1937
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,039
people

1938
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,560
uh yeah they i mean if you got really

1939
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,479
good flowers they

1940
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,480
people go for the flowers like it's

1941
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:19,439
still you're gonna make more on that too

1942
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:21,919
as the farmers in general um

1943
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:23,838
it's still it still gets the best best

1944
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,759
price um

1945
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,439
but that's what's really nice about

1946
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:30,238
breeding for

1947
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,719
yield um that

1948
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,278
let's say something you're growing a

1949
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,239
variety that yields well in ice water

1950
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,560
hash

1951
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,479
let's say yields average you know but

1952
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,120
it's good enough to work you know and

1953
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,798
you're growing that but then

1954
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,358
you get

1955
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:49,519
genetics of another variety that yields

1956
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,279
three times as much as that decent

1957
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,520
yielding variety you just grew three

1958
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,040
times as much in that same location with

1959
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,360
the same amount of resources and the

1960
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,399
same license and the same square footage

1961
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,679
um

1962
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,399
so that's huge difference and so i i

1963
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:07,440
try to i want to breed towards things

1964
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:09,839
that help farmers do better

1965
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,839
yeah i mean a great point and on the

1966
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,440
topic of breeding something which really

1967
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,840
stood out to me about your breeding

1968
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:18,079
which i'd love to chat about is that

1969
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,880
i've noticed and i'm probably wrong but

1970
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:20,960
i

1971
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,800
when it comes to mind i've noticed that

1972
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,560
you do something really unique with your

1973
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,440
breeding that i've only ever seen res

1974
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,440
dog do which is like explore these sort

1975
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:32,238
of back cross and then take it to the

1976
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:34,399
next filial generation and then like you

1977
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:36,238
know interweaving back crossing and

1978
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,719
filial breeding whereas most breeders

1979
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,000
tend to stick to one or the other what's

1980
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,840
your thoughts on that and do you think

1981
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,520
that other people might be missing out

1982
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,400
on a little something by just back

1983
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,920
crossing or just philly or breeding

1984
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,479
yeah i mean i think it's all something

1985
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,960
to explore and like you know i want to

1986
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:55,519
do both um at the same time because i

1987
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,480
get to see what comes out of that and

1988
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,920
i'm just interested to um

1989
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:02,319
in how

1990
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,279
to get to certain places faster and

1991
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:08,000
sometimes i think uh yeah bc back cross

1992
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:09,279
generation makes more sense

1993
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,198
and

1994
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:13,519
yeah

1995
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,439
i like that to also like yeah people are

1996
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,199
actually to have people think about that

1997
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,198
too and like

1998
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:21,839
because i remember like back cross you'd

1999
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:22,639
like see it it was like so often used as

2000
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,319
like

2001
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,280
sibling pairing and stuff too and it's

2002
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,799
just like it didn't yeah so just using

2003
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,719
the terminology of course that gets

2004
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,039
really difficult too because like

2005
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,600
well which back cross is it on you know

2006
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:38,000
so i i mean i actually do note it'll be

2007
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,239
like oh the 2012 black dog selection you

2008
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,800
know for the that cherry lime dog bc1f2

2009
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:43,759
number three like so i know that but

2010
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,719
like

2011
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,199
um

2012
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,119
but it could have been but the bc

2013
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:51,759
the same thing what if i put it back on

2014
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:54,719
the cherry lime pop or something like it

2015
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,400
would still be the same notation and

2016
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,239
yeah that kind of

2017
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,319
i just have to write down all the things

2018
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,399
basically like

2019
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:03,198
being well labeled is is important and

2020
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:05,519
then

2021
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:06,639
yeah i just really love to see you know

2022
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,239
later on i don't know what kind of

2023
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:13,280
research i can do to you know like um

2024
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:14,879
are already able to do a decent amount

2025
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,359
and being able to see

2026
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,079
how genetically consistent something is

2027
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:22,559
and um

2028
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,198
yeah being able to learn from what's the

2029
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,719
fastest way to achieve something in a

2030
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:28,399
generation of seeds

2031
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,719
um

2032
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,479
you know an interesting example that i

2033
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,640
really love um

2034
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:37,119
and we got these giant

2035
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,440
beautiful

2036
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,920
glazed cherry plants in the yard and

2037
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,678
these are from green source gardens

2038
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,279
and the first time we met nick from

2039
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,000
greensborough's gardens i was with ryan

2040
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,519
of the humble seat organization and

2041
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,600
we went over to their place in

2042
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,360
jacksonville uh before they got their

2043
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,480
their current farm

2044
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,839
and uh yeah we gave them a bunch of

2045
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:59,759
seeds created a bunch of seeds hung out

2046
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,679
had a great time put my hands in some of

2047
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,719
the most beautiful soil i've ever seen

2048
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,560
and

2049
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,920
they had this amazing little like

2050
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,840
medical

2051
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,480
backyard grow that like in the pictures

2052
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,960
look like the most giant amazing oasis

2053
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:16,158
you could imagine and the most giant

2054
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:19,119
pinkleberry flowers and um

2055
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:21,679
yeah just the total magic place

2056
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:25,039
but uh with these seeds the the glazed

2057
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:27,760
cherries that that um ryan humbled seeds

2058
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:30,399
organization gave them uh from keith

2059
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,719
swett's uh work on on the glace cherries

2060
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:35,839
which is cherry og and it was a cookie's

2061
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:38,239
cross that worked a little bit

2062
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:42,640
that nick ended up taking it to five

2063
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:44,839
generations uh out there and um in their

2064
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:48,079
their farm in

2065
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,880
oregon and adapted to their spot and

2066
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:52,479
everything and so like that's a an f5

2067
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,279
from you know these seeds when we met

2068
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:57,519
five years ago and then he'd also taken

2069
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:59,759
the the black dog bc4 multiple

2070
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,960
generations too so he had two very

2071
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,880
established inbred lines that he put

2072
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,679
together and made these f1s last year

2073
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,679
and he gave gave me some of these and

2074
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,000
they're just true f1s you know when we

2075
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,158
talk about a hybrid like

2076
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,960
um an f1 hybrid like normally it should

2077
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,479
be coming from two established lines and

2078
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,079
you know he just freaking did the work

2079
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,879
spent five years you know and it's just

2080
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:24,640
it's just cool like a gift from when

2081
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,920
you first meet and then that turning

2082
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,199
into this

2083
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,199
amazing thing

2084
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:32,079
but the consistency between these plants

2085
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:34,238
and the giant leaves and the the the

2086
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:37,039
vigor and everything it's just it's what

2087
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,559
you'd expect in a f1 generation a lot of

2088
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,519
other plants it's it's kind of how it's

2089
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,800
done a lot of times you'll take

2090
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,360
something to it

2091
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,960
you know f9 before and and before you

2092
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:49,519
start putting it together for an f1

2093
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,039
yeah certainly i mean it's a really

2094
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,679
interesting point you bring up there

2095
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:55,519
because a lot of people talk about how

2096
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,119
if you took two really inbred lines and

2097
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,560
crossed them together that would be like

2098
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:00,238
what you might think of as like a true

2099
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,920
f1 because it's like you know two really

2100
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:02,959
diverse things

2101
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,960
do you

2102
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:08,079
find that you like that sort of pairing

2103
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:10,319
over the more like f1 cross f1 making a

2104
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,279
new f1

2105
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:16,079
yeah i mean i i guess

2106
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,920
i like everything i super like these

2107
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,559
these f1s of the chair the glazed

2108
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,079
cherries they're just insanely nice uh

2109
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,920
they they kind of yeah they're just the

2110
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:26,559
standard of what you'd want from an f1

2111
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,760
generation it's amazing um

2112
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,600
yeah i mean i think a lot of other

2113
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,560
things i'd probably classify as a poly

2114
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,039
hybrid

2115
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,039
instead of a f1

2116
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,479
yeah sure because because you know i

2117
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,079
don't know what the i don't have a

2118
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,079
pedigree on the other thing and also

2119
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:42,800
when you're just like which i do all the

2120
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:44,238
time too crossing in the you know a

2121
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,000
well-established cut or whatever you

2122
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:47,678
don't know if that was a bad seed if

2123
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,800
somebody did any work on that or if it

2124
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:53,600
was just a found thing or not um or or

2125
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,679
how crazy the the

2126
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,840
um the generation was before it you

2127
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:59,600
don't actually know

2128
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,640
um because a lot of these things we

2129
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,760
don't have any kind of uh pedigree on it

2130
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,840
that's something i kind of look forward

2131
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,920
to i really like dogs and

2132
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,440
i like the idea of like kind of the

2133
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,920
breed standard and different things

2134
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:15,039
being built by breeders and so we have

2135
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:18,000
this information that we can uh work

2136
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:19,519
with and and um and actually know all

2137
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,679
the you know i like when i look at a

2138
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,920
plant i love that i get to like

2139
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,840
think about their grandmother and their

2140
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,840
great grandfather and all of that stuff

2141
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,480
you know like it

2142
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,400
and because i i label well

2143
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,079
and i take pictures of everything like i

2144
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,319
can really go back and just know all

2145
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,960
these things it just brings me a lot of

2146
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:41,679
joy to have that family history

2147
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,000
yeah it sounds like a consistent theme

2148
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:47,119
i'm picking up that is important to you

2149
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,880
is like good documentation good record

2150
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:51,279
keeping do you think that this is

2151
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,039
something which unfortunately might not

2152
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,880
be done well enough by others at the

2153
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:56,319
moment

2154
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,440
well i mean i can always do it better

2155
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:01,439
too but you know i i uh

2156
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,279
no actually i mean i go crazy if i do it

2157
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:06,000
wrong

2158
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,559
but yeah i don't know like it all works

2159
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,560
but yeah

2160
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:13,839
it's tough too and i go to these amazing

2161
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,679
farms and they've mixed everything up

2162
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,360
and it's just like no like

2163
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,960
and then i try to be all positive and

2164
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:24,399
stuff because everything looks great but

2165
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,399
i'm like dying inside

2166
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,760
um yeah no everyone label well please

2167
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:32,559
please it makes breeders happy

2168
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,199
yeah definitely and i think that

2169
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,280
like this idea is something even both

2170
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:38,879
myself and obviously you as well are

2171
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,800
hoping to promote because there have

2172
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,239
been times when you know maybe i've

2173
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,159
messaged a breeder and i was like hey

2174
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,238
man just so you know um like you should

2175
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:48,000
put the female first and the male second

2176
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:49,119
in when you're listing the parent stuff

2177
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,640
and sometimes people get really

2178
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:52,158
defensive and it's like i'm not trying

2179
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,520
to have a go at you man i'm just it's

2180
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:54,960
just you know the convention you know

2181
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,800
like it just it just helps if we all

2182
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,800
follow it right

2183
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,279
yeah i mean i like female first it makes

2184
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,279
sense to me

2185
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,000
so i mean the next question i wanted to

2186
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,239
ask was

2187
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,920
i'm sure it has happened but just to to

2188
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:11,599
really get the verdict on it have you

2189
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,840
ever done a certain cross like maybe

2190
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,560
you've taken a certain thing to the f2

2191
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,400
or the bx3 and you do it and you're like

2192
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,080
oh man i think i might need to go back

2193
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:21,920
and redo that a bit different like i

2194
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:23,439
didn't quite get what i was looking for

2195
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,199
does that does that happen or do you

2196
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,799
find you instead maybe just find

2197
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:28,319
something you weren't expecting but it's

2198
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,279
equally cool and you're like okay it

2199
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:31,519
looks like we're just going to go down

2200
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,479
this path

2201
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,960
so much unexpected always happens in

2202
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:38,559
life you know it's like you and

2203
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,600
you know and

2204
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:43,679
the thing is also

2205
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,360
because you know the generations you do

2206
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,960
know what to expect too

2207
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,079
um

2208
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,960
but

2209
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:53,600
i do find that

2210
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,679
quite often the plants fulfill my the

2211
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,600
expectations because i know their

2212
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,840
history but

2213
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,920
often i find

2214
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,719
that the things i think about first or

2215
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,359
like oh that's the one it so often it's

2216
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,719
a surprise at the end so often it's it's

2217
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:11,519
like

2218
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,960
yeah so you really don't know

2219
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,320
anything until you go through the full

2220
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,880
process

2221
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,000
as far as selection goes

2222
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,159
sure

2223
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,719
and so a question our viewers always

2224
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:25,198
love to hear our guest answer is are

2225
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:27,520
there any particular traits that you

2226
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:29,599
think are representative of a good male

2227
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,600
like i remember just the common one is

2228
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,840
like sub cool always used to say you

2229
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,600
want a male that you know it's not super

2230
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,679
quick flowering but also not the last

2231
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,280
one in the pack so he always kind of

2232
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,119
pitched it as though you know towards

2233
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,880
the later end of things are there any

2234
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,399
traits you think represent a good male

2235
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,920
or do you think it's just variable and

2236
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:48,238
it depends what you're looking for out

2237
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,279
of the map yeah all of them all of them

2238
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,119
um

2239
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,359
that's the thing it's like what are you

2240
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,319
going for i like to work backwards so

2241
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:55,920
like

2242
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:56,880
you know and i like to have a lot of

2243
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,600
males

2244
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,319
and

2245
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,079
um and be able to really

2246
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:04,319
choose what's going to make sense for

2247
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:06,960
something um but every but what i'm

2248
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:10,799
looking for is gonna be completely

2249
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:13,039
based off of kind of the end goal so

2250
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,119
it's not a blanket

2251
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:18,158
you know question like and and how do

2252
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,599
you do that search are you making a

2253
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:20,799
high cbd

2254
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,800
you know you're just making sure that

2255
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,159
it's a cbd rich you know then you're

2256
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,000
going to do analytics for your mail

2257
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,479
search are you looking for resistance

2258
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,760
then uh you might want to put them in a

2259
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:32,559
place that's

2260
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,199
you know uh gonna be

2261
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,760
the place that would bring out uh

2262
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:40,000
molds and disease and and see the the

2263
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,880
strongest ones um

2264
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
you might be just it's all about smell

2265
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:48,079
and just the stem rub is really gonna be

2266
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,760
what it's about um

2267
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,399
you know you really might really care

2268
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,719
about um flower structures so you might

2269
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:59,039
really look at like what how does that

2270
01:20:54,719 --> 01:21:01,760
that male flower look too um

2271
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:05,198
there's a lot of things to look at uh

2272
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:07,520
general health bigger um

2273
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:11,678
so it but normally you're putting all of

2274
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:13,600
these factors together a bit um and then

2275
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,600
paying attention to the things that you

2276
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,440
have already observed from the past you

2277
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,159
know if you if you know a certain stem

2278
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:22,319
rub is associated with an end flower

2279
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:24,000
like that's something you gain by just

2280
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:25,359
paying attention to plants for like 20

2281
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,640
years um

2282
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:28,479
yeah it

2283
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,880
it cracked me up at the it was one of

2284
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:34,079
the regen conferences and and mean gene

2285
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:36,159
was was talking on one of the panels and

2286
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,000
uh somebody kind of had asked that

2287
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:39,519
question you know and he just started

2288
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
talking about all this stuff and he was

2289
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,000
describing uh how you know if you smell

2290
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,719
pickles on that early stem rub you know

2291
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,880
that

2292
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:49,198
ends up being like your gassy ones and

2293
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,719
just all this like nuanced details of

2294
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,799
stuff that he'd been observing for like

2295
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,560
two decades and like at the end of it it

2296
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,639
was just like the dude was like looking

2297
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,480
for like you know a short answer you

2298
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,560
know like you know what's a good male or

2299
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:02,158
whatever and uh

2300
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,920
you know it was like the answer was like

2301
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,679
well you just pay attention for 20 years

2302
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,800
and then you start to get uh

2303
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,800
the beginning of an idea

2304
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,239
yeah it was kind of uh so yeah there's

2305
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:16,879
just a ton of things to to put all

2306
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:20,000
together and what your selection

2307
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,279
is gonna be for for what you're making

2308
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,039
um

2309
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:24,479
but you know i want them to be resist

2310
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,000
and i want them to be healthy i don't

2311
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,599
want people to

2312
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,279
struggle you know

2313
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,239
i don't want them to have to

2314
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:34,479
use things to deal with uh mildews and

2315
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,479
molten so like if i can have that be

2316
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,718
part of the male selection that's super

2317
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:40,959
great um but i'm not gonna do that at

2318
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:43,520
the detriment of like the quality and

2319
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,279
smell too like it's like still like

2320
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,960
there's nothing coming off that stem rub

2321
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:48,238
it doesn't matter how resistant it is

2322
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,279
necessarily

2323
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:50,479
um

2324
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:52,079
well hopefully there's a really good

2325
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,319
smelling one next to it that's resistant

2326
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:57,039
too you know

2327
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:58,880
yeah certainly certainly oh

2328
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,238
actually for the males too you know you

2329
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,000
brought up the like oh you just want the

2330
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:04,319
ones that are the right timing i really

2331
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,319
think that all the different

2332
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,279
timings are useful you know like i put

2333
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,119
some

2334
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:11,359
just to play with it see what happens i

2335
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,119
put some of like the most early mails

2336
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:16,079
that came out of a orange valley dog

2337
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,679
cherry lime dog cross uh onto some auto

2338
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:19,840
ogs

2339
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:21,679
just and see what that does next year

2340
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,079
you know i'll observe that and there's

2341
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,440
multiple ways i can go with that i could

2342
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,039
make more autos with it or i could just

2343
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:29,198
have an earlier flowering generation

2344
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,800
make selections off that um you know see

2345
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:32,719
a little mix of things

2346
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,560
but like what do you want to do and and

2347
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,880
where what's your environment like maybe

2348
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,440
you only do want to be those using those

2349
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:42,159
super early flowering males but like if

2350
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:44,719
you have a really nice full season maybe

2351
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:47,198
you super want that full stacking all

2352
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,359
august you know you don't want it to be

2353
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:51,519
you know wasting you know and flowering

2354
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:52,639
early uh instead of continuing to grow

2355
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,639
and stack

2356
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,800
um so

2357
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:59,039
it's really dependent on your your end

2358
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,039
goal and where you are um

2359
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,519
you know if you're closer to the coast

2360
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:04,319
[ __ ] use those earlier males maybe

2361
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,159
um

2362
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:08,559
but i think you should use them all too

2363
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:09,439
the other thing is i i like staggering

2364
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,960
of

2365
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,479
harvest times and being able to work

2366
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,719
with farmers to

2367
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:17,839
create kind of a genetic plan to do that

2368
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:19,439
so like if you want to be

2369
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,960
harvesting from

2370
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,399
you know

2371
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,198
mid late september until november

2372
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:26,319
you

2373
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:28,960
like

2374
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:30,238
then you get to do each week you know

2375
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,639
we'll take down this and then we'll take

2376
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:35,439
down that and we'll take down this um

2377
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,880
when it's all hey it's october 20th and

2378
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:39,919
it's all ready

2379
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,480
at the same time drying space is is

2380
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,920
difficult uh and then then quality goes

2381
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:45,279
down if you're trying to like pack

2382
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,840
everything in you're doing things

2383
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:49,759
quickly and all of that and you might

2384
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,480
not be able to save it all and

2385
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,199
um so i think you know really staggering

2386
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:56,079
um flowering times makes a lot of sense

2387
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:57,839
so

2388
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:59,840
you know making that notation which i

2389
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,239
like to do like i note those those first

2390
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,520
flowering males um and those later ones

2391
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,079
and note

2392
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,560
note that information so um

2393
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,399
i can have an idea of the next

2394
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,280
generation once i see that working then

2395
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:14,319
i can recommend that to a farmer for hey

2396
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,960
i know that

2397
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,559
this variety is going to be done

2398
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,920
on the first week of october this one

2399
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,600
will be the second this one will be the

2400
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,600
third

2401
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,199
and that helps stagger that kind of

2402
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,400
harvest and what i really like is for

2403
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:30,399
ice water hash varieties and some of the

2404
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:32,879
varieties like um

2405
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:35,839
the banana crosses the holy nana crack

2406
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:39,840
uh banana dog and the things are really

2407
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,800
voltron um which is uh athena holy crap

2408
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,679
times um sapphire scout black dog

2409
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,920
um those are incredibly resistant and

2410
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:50,639
later uh season you know it's like the

2411
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:53,279
end of october there and they look so

2412
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:55,279
mature and good and um

2413
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:56,880
uh actually you could see the voltron on

2414
01:25:55,279 --> 01:26:00,238
the calendar i think you might have got

2415
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:03,600
at the emerald cup um oh yeah on uh the

2416
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:06,079
october shot is a candid cush uh photo

2417
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,560
and from high water farms and it was dry

2418
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,238
farmed and just like

2419
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,440
just the maturity of the crystals and

2420
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:13,359
the size

2421
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:16,079
and this is a flower that really

2422
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:18,079
literally nothing was done like it was

2423
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,000
cover crop tilled correctly planted and

2424
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:22,399
then let the winds just rip through it

2425
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,479
and it was let to dry and to like

2426
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:26,079
get like ravaged by the environment and

2427
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,638
then it became hearty and strong and

2428
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,559
grew like flowers that would blow away

2429
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:34,319
any of the most cracked out indoor you

2430
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:38,960
you'll see like it's so freaking just

2431
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:41,198
frosted out dense and beautiful and um

2432
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,439
but so like that holy nana crack though

2433
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:46,399
is a great example for the really high

2434
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:48,000
resistance and it does a thing with the

2435
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,638
the flower structure where it separates

2436
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,639
each different

2437
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,600
nug just enough that

2438
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,560
you don't have

2439
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:01,600
air water being trapped

2440
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,400
that each one is just segmented enough

2441
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,199
that it that it has a good open air

2442
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,559
and it's already incredibly resistant to

2443
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,559
botrytis

2444
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,480
and it also doesn't grow

2445
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,520
in a in a shape that would trap that

2446
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:15,198
moisture

2447
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,639
and then that also lends better to ice

2448
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:18,638
water hash because each one of these

2449
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,400
nugs has more surface area and they have

2450
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:22,079
the perfect trichomes for it too just

2451
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:24,238
like um

2452
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:26,479
large large sized heads

2453
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,238
and heads first and not

2454
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:30,879
a whole lot of necks like all that

2455
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:33,359
energy is going to really nice heads

2456
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:36,159
and you can harvest those in november

2457
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:39,279
when it's like cold and not have any

2458
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:41,119
worry of any mold and um it's a really

2459
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:43,439
nice time to make fresh frozen after

2460
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,760
everything else is harvested

2461
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,960
yeah what an awesome answer there and

2462
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,440
something you brought up i'd love to

2463
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,079
talk a little more about is the role

2464
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:55,119
autos might play in the future

2465
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:57,198
do you see them potentially filling a

2466
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:59,198
niche in terms of maybe little windows

2467
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:01,599
where other cultivars aren't quite

2468
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:04,158
suitable or do you think it's kind of a

2469
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,320
different domain to what the farms will

2470
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,439
be working with long term in a certain

2471
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:08,960
respect

2472
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:10,719
yeah you know it's been slow at first

2473
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,800
but oh my god it's game on with autos

2474
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:14,480
right now holy [ __ ] they're [ __ ] nice

2475
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,920
they're freaking nice dude i have this

2476
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:19,279
beautiful garden over here that um yeah

2477
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,279
friend ryan had worked on with the

2478
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,639
humble seed organization and um these

2479
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,319
auto ogs

2480
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,960
fastest growing plants i've ever seen in

2481
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:28,799
my life like just stunning and i just

2482
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,679
direct sewed them they're feminized

2483
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,000
they're

2484
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:35,039
uh yeah it's a project we did locally

2485
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,319
and they are uh just phenomenal like i

2486
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:37,840
have

2487
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:39,679
um

2488
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,360
yeah they're some of them are above my

2489
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:43,359
shoulder almost as tall as me just

2490
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,759
filling out everywhere freaking

2491
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:47,679
smell amazing there's bubble gum there's

2492
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,679
fruit there's gas

2493
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,480
and um

2494
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:54,158
incredibly sturdy stalks

2495
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:56,319
and

2496
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:58,079
an incredible trichome production like i

2497
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:00,238
don't you know it's like it's not like

2498
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,920
how autos were um

2499
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,158
the work's been done

2500
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,079
and uh there's a lot that can be done

2501
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:08,000
and actually looking at these the just

2502
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,639
the stocks i'm like damn these would be

2503
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,279
amazing fiber plants too like if you're

2504
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:15,279
able to both harvest the flowers and the

2505
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,719
fibers because with autos you have so

2506
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:20,000
many close to each other that you're

2507
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:21,439
growing so many stocks you know that um

2508
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,198
i could see like

2509
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:25,519
there being kind of a cool

2510
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:27,359
combo of that uh

2511
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,600
because man they're they're thick and

2512
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:32,719
stocky a thing about autos that's really

2513
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:36,159
interesting too is um

2514
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:38,800
just how reactive they are to their

2515
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:41,759
environment they are metabolic machines

2516
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,920
they grow incredibly fast or they gr or

2517
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,239
they don't at all

2518
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,000
the conditions really mean a lot it's

2519
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:49,839
really easy to have them stunt out and

2520
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,600
be really small

2521
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,400
at different times a year like they

2522
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,679
don't want to be like cold or too wet

2523
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:57,279
they definitely don't want to be eaten

2524
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:00,079
by banana slugs all winter long like

2525
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:02,479
they were here um but the ones

2526
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:05,198
that i i just drex out at the perfect

2527
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:06,479
time for um to get them to be able to

2528
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:08,799
veg in this

2529
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:11,678
and and flower during the the mid of the

2530
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,279
summer um or just it's just game on and

2531
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:15,199
the ones that went right in the ground

2532
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:16,319
uh grew incredibly fast and i've never

2533
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:17,599
watered them

2534
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:19,840
um just

2535
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,199
and i think they really like that uh

2536
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,560
they don't want to be

2537
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:23,759
too wet there's

2538
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,760
obviously there's places where they

2539
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,159
would just dry out and die but this

2540
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,119
isn't one of them they can tap in and um

2541
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:32,079
the

2542
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:33,599
the soil biology is is rich and so it it

2543
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:36,399
holds onto moisture pretty well and i'm

2544
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,760
in an area that's relatively

2545
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:42,719
it's green and and it gets a

2546
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,840
uh the marine moisture it hasn't rained

2547
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,679
but

2548
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,360
they uh they really enjoy just being

2549
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,800
able to tap in they don't want much

2550
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,880
water but they do want to be able to eat

2551
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:53,679
so i did amend them ahead of time like

2552
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:56,560
um some fish bone and bokashi and kelp

2553
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,158
and um some trace mineral and that

2554
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,360
that's all

2555
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:01,198
uh and

2556
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:03,119
yeah they just do they just go the ones

2557
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:06,238
in pots are definitely considerably

2558
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:08,000
smaller um and any ones that had that

2559
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:08,718
were left in the four-inch pots like i

2560
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,679
did

2561
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,119
i planted a bunch and then i decided to

2562
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:15,760
fill in some of the gaps a little bit

2563
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:17,359
more with some plants that were weak uh

2564
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,400
that were in some four inch pots a week

2565
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,279
later

2566
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:23,279
and uh you know about half the size just

2567
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:25,679
in that time and that's how much like

2568
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,519
you lose every day that uh

2569
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,039
that they don't get to just go so

2570
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,760
they're just they're metabolic machines

2571
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:34,319
so when you you dial it in um and what

2572
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,679
works in your your place like

2573
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:37,119
super powerful what you can do with

2574
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,158
autos and

2575
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:40,479
um

2576
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,719
as we continue to like just

2577
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:45,198
cross in awesome flavors awesome

2578
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,079
attributes like you know autos will be

2579
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:47,759
doing

2580
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,079
all the different things that we'd want

2581
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,760
them to be doing you know whether it's

2582
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:53,679
for good hash whether it's for cbd

2583
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,920
whether it's just insanely good flowers

2584
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:57,119
and but i also think yeah fiber and all

2585
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,000
kinds of

2586
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:02,800
other aspects are very viable with with

2587
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,479
autos and um i'm just stunned with what

2588
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,159
i've seen with these ones this year it's

2589
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:07,839
a whole nother world the last two years

2590
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:10,238
in autos

2591
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,279
yeah certainly i mean you know the guys

2592
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:15,198
at mephisto certainly really done a lot

2593
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:16,960
of work in i think a lot of consumers

2594
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:18,559
eyes they made people realize you can do

2595
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,319
good stuff and now people recognize

2596
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,400
across the board there's there's good

2597
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:23,840
orders my question has been doing a lot

2598
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:26,559
of great work too

2599
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,480
yeah certainly there for that work

2600
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,960
well i was just going to ask can we

2601
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:33,359
expect a black dog auto down the line

2602
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,119
and if so would you want to just cross

2603
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:37,439
it to a root or alice and keep a black

2604
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:39,599
dog or more like cross it to like an og

2605
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:41,359
auto and have like a hybridy sort of

2606
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,360
thing

2607
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:44,639
uh yes that's being that's being figured

2608
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:46,639
out

2609
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,960
but but man these og autos are looking

2610
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:51,199
so nice with it too um i mean i'll be

2611
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,719
making the cross regardless but uh yeah

2612
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:54,799
we'll see we'll see what works out from

2613
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,399
there and there's definitely potential

2614
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,840
for that and i think it would actually

2615
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:00,238
lend really well to that because it's

2616
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,560
already got a very consistent quality

2617
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,399
that works well for lots grown uh

2618
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,320
smaller together

2619
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,119
and and high production so i think

2620
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:09,359
that's

2621
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:13,198
highly likely uh that would be a couple

2622
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:14,960
years probably um but highly likely

2623
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:16,399
yeah sure and the other thing you

2624
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,319
brought up which was really interesting

2625
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,079
to me was and you've said it a few times

2626
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:22,960
dry farming and the reason why i'm

2627
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,920
interested in this is because i feel

2628
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,239
like

2629
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,920
as the concept takes off more there's

2630
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:30,238
more of a demand for seed because

2631
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:33,440
obviously clones don't do very well in a

2632
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:35,519
dry farming situation do you think that

2633
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:36,399
is a possible situation where outdoor

2634
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,560
growers

2635
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,238
move away from clones almost entirely

2636
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,560
and are just using seed because of the

2637
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:44,399
benefits maybe in a dry farming context

2638
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,239
maybe in general but do you think that

2639
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:50,479
they're going to move more consistently

2640
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:52,158
to seed and a little away from clone

2641
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:53,439
um

2642
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:55,439
i mean the market's still going to

2643
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:56,879
demand certain clone varieties that's

2644
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:58,399
always going to be the case and there's

2645
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,679
certain dry farm areas that can still

2646
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:02,879
grow

2647
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:06,000
cultivars pretty pretty well um high

2648
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:08,400
water farms being one of them but um

2649
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,319
but in general they just grow all seed

2650
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:12,479
actually these dry farms um and they

2651
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,719
super prefer that uh the way they tap in

2652
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,799
and yeah the expression

2653
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,319
and um there are

2654
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,119
a few dry farms grow in some of these

2655
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:23,920
autos right now so um yeah we'll get to

2656
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:27,119
see exactly how they're expressing there

2657
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:29,440
i think uh that absolutely makes it like

2658
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:33,359
the dream of just uh direct sowing

2659
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:35,919
feminized autos and doing nothing um

2660
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:39,039
on dry farms yeah i think that's

2661
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:41,039
something that is very much uh

2662
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:43,359
probably i mean well happening on small

2663
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:45,359
scales this year and and we'll just grow

2664
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:47,279
i'm sure next year in the following

2665
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,439
years

2666
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:51,679
yeah awesome awesome

2667
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:53,839
so something i wanted to chat with you

2668
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,560
because we recently had him on the show

2669
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:59,199
was the legend himself irizan

2670
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,039
and i know that you've been working with

2671
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,879
some varieties and you guys are friends

2672
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:04,158
and have got some sort of work together

2673
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,319
would you be able to give us a little

2674
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:08,000
bit of an insight into what you're

2675
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:09,759
working with and what your hopes are to

2676
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,880
do with that

2677
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,719

just honestly like the world uh really

2684
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,960

2685
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:28,319
tremendously i think

2686
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:32,719
he's one of the most important people in

2687
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:34,479
cannabis and uh i love him for it uh to

2688
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:35,679
to be able to work with these things

2689
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,359
from

2690
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:40,079
all these different places where he's

2691
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:43,599
done the the documentation

2692
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:46,158
um not just of the plant which he does

2693
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:49,600
an amazing job of but of the terroir and

2694
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:51,198
the culture and the um the factors that

2695
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,920
led up to

2696
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:55,119
that you know that kind of variety

2697
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,480
existing

2698
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:58,399
um

2699
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:00,399
yeah it's just amazing so all these

2700
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,559
different parts of the world they get to

2701
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,638
to read about

2702
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,080
the culture what you know what they were

2703
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,840
producing um you know and are these

2704
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:11,359
hash

2705
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,400
multi-generational uh hash communities

2706
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,559
are they

2707
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:17,119
um

2708
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,800
specific farmers are they like

2709
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:21,599
totally

2710
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:24,239
true primordial land race and uh one of

2711
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,560
the the most amazing things that's to

2712
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:27,678
have in the garden right now is um

2713
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,400
seeds from

2714
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:31,679
sea plants from uh lolap valley in um

2715
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:35,119
cashmere

2716
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:37,679
and uh deepak razon had uh he had

2717
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:39,840
brought these um

2718
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,960
he was documenting the seeds out there

2719
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,920
and

2720
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,039
um

2721
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,158
these plants growing in the forest of of

2722
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:48,719
cashmere

2723
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:51,279
in the low lab valley and

2724
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:53,118
he paid attention to the pollination and

2725
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:56,559
the males coming out and then came back

2726
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:58,399
out uh to collect seeds and got just all

2727
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,760
these amazing pictures of them and these

2728
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:03,599
are true um true wolves basically like

2729
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,520
if you were to

2730
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,119
you put it in context of dogs you know

2731
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,719
like we have all our different hybrids

2732
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:10,880
and stuff and this these are wolves in

2733
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,679
their environment um and it's kind of

2734
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:17,279
like cannabis for the land before time

2735
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:20,399
because it's not affected by any other

2736
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,158
um feral varieties or cross-pollination

2737
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,399
it's not affected by human encroachment

2738
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:26,158
it's not affected by light pollution

2739
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:27,679
um they just are

2740
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:29,599
what they are and

2741
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,199
what's amazing about that is cannabis is

2742
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,520
cannabis man like these are still

2743
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:35,599
straight cannabis plants and

2744
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:39,280
uh they're incredibly

2745
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:41,119
interesting and unique and uh i love i

2746
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:43,039
have a time lapse on them right now and

2747
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:45,759
i like watching them at night and they

2748
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:48,158
like they just super tuck their leaves

2749
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,760
down real tight to the stem and then

2750
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:50,960
right at like four in the morning i mean

2751
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,800
all the plants do this a little bit but

2752
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,480
these do it really extreme they just

2753
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,719
start to like wake up and it's a total

2754
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:58,319
like morning yoga just like and they

2755
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,920
already know where the sun's gonna be

2756
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,599
wave you know like an hour before it

2757
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,639
gets there just getting into position

2758
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,280
and

2759
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:07,199
it's a beautiful dance to watch and um

2760
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,880
you know just right now i'm getting to

2761
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,638
see the first mail

2762
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,800
you know it's starting to show and the

2763
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:15,039
first females and there's even a pink

2764
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,920
pistol coming off of one of them um

2765
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:20,639
amazing um you know carotene and

2766
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,800
production and anthocyanin production

2767
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,039
and um

2768
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,639
like the um

2769
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:28,238
yeah they're just really interesting

2770
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,079
plants man uh

2771
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:31,439
they're ready to protect themselves you

2772
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:33,279
know from the environment the thing that

2773
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:35,599
i find really interesting about them was

2774
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:37,118
their seeds too um which are incredibly

2775
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,880
small they're probably about

2776
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:40,880
a tenth of the size of a normal like

2777
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,079
domesticated variety like black dog or

2778
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,760
something and

2779
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,600
um they

2780
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,840
they also take a while to germinate and

2781
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,039
not a whole lot of them germinate like

2782
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,360
quickly and

2783
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,198
a lot of this i think has to do with um

2784
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:55,759
you know what what works for

2785
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:56,799
survivability out there because nobody's

2786
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,520
um

2787
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:01,520
being like nobody's saving the seeds and

2788
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,760
then and then starting them like you

2789
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,360
would in uh in a variety that would

2790
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,199
start to be domesticated where

2791
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:08,399
somebody's like oh i like this flower

2792
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:09,678
and you're smelling it and then you keep

2793
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:12,238
it and then you start the seeds from

2794
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:15,039
that that's that's starting that work

2795
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:17,279
towards domestication pretty quickly um

2796
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:19,279
but these are because nobody's doing

2797
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:21,279
that they're wind dispersed more they're

2798
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,599
like small they're ready to like

2799
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:26,158
fall out of the plant easy and so

2800
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,600
they're kind of sharp lemon shaped uh

2801
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:29,519
teeny little seeds

2802
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,639
and then they don't want to germinate

2803
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,000
before

2804
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,679
the it's the right time of year

2805
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,399
otherwise they would just germinate and

2806
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:38,000
get killed by like snow or

2807
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:39,279
you know the wrong climate so they're

2808
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,800
just

2809
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:42,479
they're well adapted like we're a

2810
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,639
domesticated variety you add water to it

2811
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:46,158
it's like oh a germ didn't like you know

2812
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,239
within 24 hours you know and that's

2813
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,638
something to celebrate um

2814
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:52,399
but that would be death in the wild

2815
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,560
environment you know it's like if all

2816
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:56,559
those seeds germ this germinated the

2817
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,000
second they hit the ground and water hit

2818
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:01,840
them then they'd all just die that

2819
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:04,238
winter um so it's just interesting uh

2820
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,079
those quick changes that happen and and

2821
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:07,359
not just the plant but just

2822
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:09,439
right in the beginning with seed

2823
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:11,279
morphology and seed behavior

2824
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:12,638
um

2825
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:13,759
so that was really interesting just to

2826
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,000
learn from them and the way they

2827
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,679
germinate is so slow like it's like they

2828
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,198
don't just shoot out the radical it's

2829
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,399
like this slow

2830
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:23,359
goo of white radical that's kind of

2831
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:25,920
just

2832
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:28,238
over the course of days that starts to

2833
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,079
come out and then they grow all small

2834
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,678
and little and but when they go then

2835
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:34,238
they start to like reach a bit and they

2836
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:36,399
have like these amazing

2837
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:38,079
branches that kind of swing down low and

2838
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:40,079
come up and

2839
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:41,279
nice narrow leaves and i'm sure they're

2840
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:42,000
going to have a decent amount of color

2841
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,759
and

2842
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,359
well some will but yeah you see purple

2843
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,920
and green varieties you see full on

2844
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:50,479
trichome production you see

2845
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,840
cbd and thc production so

2846
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,000
it's just kind of interesting you know

2847
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,760
even from the early uh

2848
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,520
days cannabis had all this potential

2849
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,520
stored in it and that's kind of what i'm

2850
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,239
seeing in this too that it was all there

2851
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,600
but what what we see with our

2852
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:05,118
all the varieties and all the things

2853
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,600
that we have now is

2854
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:09,679
how that relationship has evolved you

2855
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,600
know that that mutualistic relationship

2856
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,560
that we entered into

2857
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,159
um

2858
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,679
with cannabis like that's what's

2859
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:17,439
different

2860
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,760
you know between

2861
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:21,359
uh a true primordial and these

2862
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,360
domesticated varieties is our

2863
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:24,960
relationship with them

2864
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:27,920
but i don't know it makes me think

2865
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,719
though that maybe low lab was like these

2866
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,359
the

2867
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:33,198
these early varieties

2868
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:35,759
still could produce all of these

2869
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:37,759
incredibly useful things for humans um

2870
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:42,239
and our medicine

2871
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:43,840
and i i think about dogs and how

2872
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:46,559
um

2873
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,960
you know like wolves are

2874
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,679
are adapted for a location for a forest

2875
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,760
for

2876
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,199
that place they're high you know they're

2877
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,440
ready to survive

2878
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:57,519
but they have no um

2879
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:59,839
relationship with humans the humans are

2880
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,440
something to be avoided and everything

2881
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,880
but a dog is like

2882
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:05,919
everything isn't they're engaged with

2883
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,679
how

2884
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,920
do we

2885
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,118
interact and

2886
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,719
bring

2887
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:14,238
benefit to a human they're always

2888
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,118
studying our face they're always wanting

2889
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:16,638
to know what we're feeling they're

2890
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:17,759
wanting to know what the next job that

2891
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,880
they can do

2892
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,880
um

2893
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,800
and that was like this mutualistic

2894
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,239
relationship that got entered into a

2895
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,719
long time ago and that became this

2896
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:27,678
evolutionary shift between a wolf and a

2897
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:30,399
dog

2898
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:31,920
and all of a sudden now like this wild

2899
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:33,279
animal will

2900
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,158
watch

2901
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:36,319
our

2902
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:37,920
livestock like it won't eat them it will

2903
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:40,000
guard them and protect them for us i

2904
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,880
mean that's a wild jump for

2905
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,600
an animal to do um they'll go to war for

2906
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,480
us they will watch our children they

2907
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,600
will

2908
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:52,000
um you know allow us to grow crops on

2909
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:54,560
our land without pigs like rooting it up

2910
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,800
they will hunt for us they'll in the

2911
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,760
case of like yeah the uh

2912
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,760
saluki in egypt like 3000 years ago

2913
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,880
they'll chase a rabbit down and grab it

2914
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,159
and bring it

2915
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,480
back to you

2916
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:08,158
like at 45 miles an hour highly

2917
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,959
specialized bred

2918
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,960
uh animals that that quickly adapt to

2919
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:14,719
whatever we want and like human envision

2920
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,118
something and creates a breeding program

2921
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:19,039
and makes selections just so quickly

2922
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:21,359
that stuff happens and it doesn't happen

2923
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:23,359
like that with other species and i think

2924
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:25,679
the difference is that

2925
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:28,639
there was a moment of mutualism

2926
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:30,639
um and an evolutionary strategy

2927
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,279
for that between humans and cannabis and

2928
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:35,679
humans and and dogs that that's it's

2929
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,920
super similar and i think that's why

2930
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:40,960
they're so similar in how we look at

2931
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:43,359
breeding with them too

2932
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,319
but yeah the low lab gets to teach me a

2933
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:46,319
lot about um

2934
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:52,960
about what was and and what is

2935
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:54,399
yeah what a phenomenal answer i mean you

2936
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,239
you actually answered the next question

2937
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:58,638
i was going to ask which was why do we

2938
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:00,000
see so many breeders also breed dogs but

2939
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,920
there you go

2940
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,198
you nailed it you nailed it well i did

2941
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,039
the same thing too i had a dog and

2942
01:44:03,198 --> 01:44:07,599
vision in my mind and i went like crazy

2943
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:10,639
for years and bred like the father the

2944
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:12,320
video had the grandmother and mom and

2945
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,239
like yeah all the generations and i did

2946
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:16,559
it i made the exact dog in my mind and

2947
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:18,638
it was so incredible but

2948
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,320
they all passed away now and

2949
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,239
and they're they're in the living soil

2950
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:24,319
here and um

2951
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,158
actually [ __ ] that make that brings me

2952
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:27,840
to a um

2953
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,439
another uh

2954
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,440
story uh

2955
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:33,359
involving irasin

2956
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:36,079
uh so he

2957
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:38,880
he had uh i had got the

2958
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:41,279
uh missouri sharif seeds from him he had

2959
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:44,800
uh the missouri which were um

2960
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:46,880
wildly they were labeled wild um i

2961
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,480
believe they have domestic feral

2962
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:51,118
influence because of

2963
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:52,399
um how nice they are and also like the

2964
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,359
way the seeds are

2965
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,479
um

2966
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:58,559
but they uh god just the biggest

2967
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,559
the most amazing fan leaves like you'd

2968
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,480
have like a plant that was like two feet

2969
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:05,039
tall that had a fan leaf that was like

2970

16 inches like long or something it was

2971
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:09,439
crazy um and so these were really

2972
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,760
beautiful plants to like have growing in

2973
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:15,198

her jaw that just grew a big cancerous

2978
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:27,039
tumor right in front of her face that

2979
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,719
was just it was really

2980
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:30,560
it was really tough you know just the

2981
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,158
but she was you know she was fine for so

2982
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,920
long you know we live in a beautiful

2983
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:35,839
place took her to the beach every day

2984
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,639
fed her fried chicken and

2985
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,880
um

2986
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:41,279
you know made every day you know great

2987
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,840
until um

2988
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:45,599
until it was

2989
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,639
time yeah awesome

2990
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,480
but um

2991
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:51,440
so

2992
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:55,359
when she passed though um

2993
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:57,599
we dug a grave and uh right next to her

2994
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:59,118
mom and dad and

2995
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:01,920
her dad has a beautiful tree that's

2996
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:03,359
growing above her and

2997
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,920
um she

2998
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:09,439
we laid her in the ground and inoculated

2999
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:13,279
her with uh you know good beneficial

3000
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:14,479
uh fungus and and compost and lots of

3001
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:16,719
worms and

3002
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:18,959
stropharia and oyster mushrooms and all

3003
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,920
that kind of stuff shiitakes and

3004
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,520
had her

3005
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,560
adorned with things

3006
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,880
ready to

3007
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,679
return her to the living soil but then

3008
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:30,239
um she liked to eat cannabis and she was

3009
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:33,440
actually particularly good at um

3010
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:35,599
identifying um she she liked uh full

3011
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,919
spectrum uh cannabinoids too so she'd

3012
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,719
get those like type twos almost always

3013
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,158
like i like a little cbd with my thc

3014
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:43,679
she was just

3015
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:46,399
anyway so we grabbed some of the like

3016
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,000
glass leaves that she was uh munching on

3017
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:50,079
and then i'm looking at these giant

3018
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,039
mazar leaves and i'm just like oh i

3019
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:52,880
gotta

3020
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:54,639
gotta add that to it and so there's a

3021
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,800
bouquet of flowers and cannabis leaves

3022
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:58,000
that were adorned and laid on top of her

3023
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,719
grave

3024
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,198
and uh this time of year her father's

3025
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:04,480
tree had had all these white beautiful

3026
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:06,559
flowers

3027
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:08,479
blossom on them and they were starting

3028
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:10,560
to they were in the

3029
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:13,198
tail end of the blossoming and ready for

3030
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,800
the petals to fall and i shook the tree

3031
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:16,799
and all these petals started raining

3032
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,199
down gently and and littered the grave

3033
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,679
in a very beautiful aesthetic way

3034
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:24,879
um with this nice bouquet on top of it

3035
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:26,158
and i had taken a picture of this um

3036
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:28,400
before we

3037
01:47:26,158 --> 01:47:31,839
buried her and had a fire and you know

3038
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:34,158
drank some tequila and cried and um

3039
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:36,880
and when i was talking to deepak i

3040
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:39,118
re-risen next um he

3041
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:42,400
had uh

3042
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:44,479
i i told him this story and you know i

3043
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:46,638
let him know that there was a mazar leaf

3044
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:48,559
on her grave and he's like do you know

3045
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:50,880
what mazar means

3046
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:53,440
i was like no

3047
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:56,239
he's like mazar means grave

3048
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:59,839
mazar e sharif is grave of the saint

3049
01:47:56,238 --> 01:47:59,839
and i'm like ashley was a saint

3050
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:03,359
so

3051
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:07,359
so i um i had already actually

3052
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:10,000
pollinated a uh

3053
01:48:07,359 --> 01:48:12,000
mazar uh with um

3054
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:15,279
a black dog pc6

3055
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,639
and so i put that on top of her grave to

3056
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:20,800
grow the seeds

3057
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:22,000
and so this year i'm growing some of the

3058
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:25,520
um

3059
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
st ashley mazar saint ashley's mazar

3060
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:30,800
wow what a beautiful story

3061
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,399
that's that's incredibly touching

3062
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:36,960
i uh i it makes me wonder do you think

3063
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:39,679
that the process of incorporating

3064
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,118
whether it be ashes whether it maybe if

3065
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,560
it's a dog you might be able to use the

3066
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:44,319
full thing do you think this is

3067
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,760
something which people could benefit

3068
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:47,679
from incorporating more because i

3069
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,159
remember i mentioned it to josh and

3070
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,560
kelly of dragonfly and i think she said

3071
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:54,879
her mom um has her she's got her

3072
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,400
mother's ashes in one of her greenhouses

3073
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,159
and i was like man that's that's what i

3074
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:59,439
want for me

3075
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:00,479
sure

3076
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:02,238
well

3077
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:04,319
i mean

3078
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:06,718
i mean from a science it's just it's

3079
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,319
impossible to say what's what or because

3080
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:12,158
there's so many variables but one thing

3081
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:14,719
i know that uh plants respond to love

3082
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:17,599
and uh if you put that into it it means

3083
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:17,600
something and

3084
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,600
and um

3085
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:23,839
and i mean the soil beneath that plant

3086
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:26,480
the soil that's that returned her body

3087
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:30,159
is is absolutely alive and all of the

3088
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:31,678
organisms returning her are um

3089
01:49:30,158 --> 01:49:33,118
yeah doing a process of love of

3090
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:36,319
returning

3091
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:38,000
that organic matter back to life back to

3092
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:40,960
rejuvenation so

3093
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:44,158
yeah i think that process is powerful

3094
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,960
certainly and and do you have any hopes

3095
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,719
for

3096
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:50,719
the long-term trajectory of the the the

3097
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:53,118
strain and the cross or is it just a

3098
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:54,639
like a gift holy crap is one of the most

3099
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:57,198
beautiful plants i've ever seen in my

3100
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,600
life it's so pretty so we'll see but oh

3101
01:49:57,198 --> 01:50:01,919
my god the leaves are just so

3102
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:05,039
dark and big and reptilian it's so

3103
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:08,560
healthy and it just i just love it it's

3104
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:09,679
just the plant just screams like love

3105
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,840
um

3106
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,279
and so i have one that like started

3107
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,920
early i had a whole bunch of slugs eat

3108
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:18,559
my first rounds uh this is a very

3109
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,079
intense area for slugs but um i started

3110
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:23,119
a whole another round of them too so i

3111
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:25,760
have a really good group right now to um

3112
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:27,679
to make the next generation with but um

3113
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:30,400
yeah there's a couple people growing

3114
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:33,039
some right now too um i think actually

3115
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:35,920
indigo farms up in oregon uh just let me

3116

01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:39,039
into their

3118
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:41,359

i'll be able to probably see

3123
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,960
see what she does in those places and um

3124
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:54,238
yeah we'll see what the future holds but

3125
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,158

when i was thinking of that and

3133
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:12,158
especially when you were talking about

3134
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:13,760
the mazar and some of the indian

3135
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:15,839
cultivars is

3136
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,159
do you think that the expression you're

3137
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,600
getting from this really nice natural

3138
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:21,118
expression you spoke about where you

3139
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,639
know they're almost given the sun

3140
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,960
salutations

3141
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:27,520
do you do you think that that might have

3142
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:30,800
been lost almost if you tried to take

3143
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,960
those same seeds and like grow them in a

3144
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,159
like a sort of a salt and cocoa

3145
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:36,239
environment like do you think that

3146
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:38,000
there's a synergy from that you're

3147
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:41,439
trying to grow them naturally in the way

3148
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,679
they were origin originally conceived

3149
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:45,359
well yeah absolutely um

3150
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,279
i mean i don't think they'd be doing the

3151
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:49,519
sun salutations if there wasn't the sun

3152
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:51,439
going up and down and you know it's like

3153
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,599
and they wouldn't be choosing the part

3154
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,439
of the sky to start aiming towards

3155
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:57,360
before because it's always the same

3156
01:51:55,439 --> 01:52:00,319
freaking thing right above them making

3157
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:02,399
that buzzing noise um yeah i don't know

3158
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:03,679
i think like do you how do you feel like

3159
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,158
when you're in a

3160
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:09,760
a desk with a bunch of like

3161
01:52:06,158 --> 01:52:11,519
noisy fluorescents in school like

3162
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,599
first like being out in the woods like

3163
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,400
at a botany tour or something you know

3164
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:18,480
it's like i think yeah of course of

3165
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:20,559
course it's different the

3166
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:21,919
it's a completely different experience

3167
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,119
for them um

3168
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,960
yeah i mean

3169
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:27,519
their environment everyone's environment

3170
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:32,560
affects everything and they're very

3171
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:35,520
alive and conscious and are constantly

3172
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,800
adapting thinking doing things and

3173
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,159
feeling things

3174
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,000
and they feel our love they feel our

3175
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:43,118
connection they feel the environment

3176
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,880
that they're in and it's definitely

3177
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:46,719
way different

3178
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,560
in an indoor environment

3179
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:49,920
than a natural one but i mean a natural

3180
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,840
one could be really rough on them too

3181
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,560
you know they won't they want to be

3182
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:57,199
drying out and dying in the sun or or in

3183
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,800
a whole cold harsh winter or neglected

3184
01:52:57,198 --> 01:52:59,598
in a greenhouse and forgot you know it's

3185
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,400
like

3186
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:04,800
they still gotta have their soils their

3187
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:06,719
their roots uh in a nice soil or some

3188
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,480
kind of nutrition

3189
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:09,760
yeah of course

3190
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:11,359
they're very efficient too that's the

3191
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:13,520
thing too that yeah that's neat with the

3192
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:15,598
low lab too like they you know you could

3193
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:17,520
tell that they would just make do with

3194
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:19,920
whatever they have you know they

3195
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,080
they don't need this like giant amount

3196
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:25,520
of resources put out in front of them

3197
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:27,599
like they could grow in a crack you know

3198
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,599
yeah i love that the hardy

3199
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,520
so a topic which comes up somewhat

3200
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:33,039
frequently on the show is the discussion

3201
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,599
around the idea of

3202
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:37,679
do you think seeds created in an organic

3203
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:38,719
or even better regenerative farming

3204
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,118
practice

3205
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:43,198
produce better seeds like maybe hearty

3206
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:44,719
things like that do you think that plays

3207
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:45,839
into it or would you be happy to buy

3208
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:48,399
seeds

3209
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:52,159
that were produced in salts compared to

3210
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:52,158
ones that were produced in soil

3211
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:56,238
um

3212
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,920
yeah so i mean there's definitely

3213
01:53:56,238 --> 01:54:00,079
difference i i mean

3214
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,079
obviously i have my feelings about you

3215
01:54:00,079 --> 01:54:04,319
know the intention and love that we put

3216
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:06,079
into things and so getting you know

3217
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:07,599
seeds from some of my favorite

3218
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:10,079
regenerative farmers who have been doing

3219
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:12,560
this work and been breeding and been

3220
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:15,359
putting love into their their land and

3221
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:17,199
into their projects um means a hell of a

3222
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:19,598
lot more to me than anything else and i

3223
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:21,519
don't really have like any extra space

3224
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:24,079
for anyone else's stuff but my own so

3225
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:25,760
like it's just like the really cool

3226
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:29,760
close people i really love what they're

3227
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:31,599
doing that that make it in um so

3228
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,679
uh

3229
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:35,599
but um

3230
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:37,840
there's a lot of ways to do things and

3231
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:40,079
there's really

3232
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:42,880
a lot of like you know let's say

3233
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:44,479
you're making some feminized autos like

3234
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,239
maybe that's the most efficient way to

3235
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:48,079
do them i'm not going to say

3236
01:54:46,238 --> 01:54:49,359
it's not and if you're doing the correct

3237
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:51,920
genetic work and you're doing the

3238
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:53,598
quality standards ahead of time then um

3239
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:56,000
yeah there's there's cases where those

3240
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:58,639
seeds might be uh

3241
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,920
desirable useful for me but the thing is

3242
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:02,480
if i'm going to do something like that

3243
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:04,000
there has to be the

3244
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:06,399
there has to be the work behind it and i

3245
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,560
have to know that like it is what it is

3246
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:11,598
and it has to be like super useful

3247
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:13,039
um and yeah so like and i think that's

3248
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,719
gonna be the you know a lot of large

3249
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:16,238
scale um

3250
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:18,079
farming and stuff like you know they're

3251
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:20,399
gonna need very consistent seeds

3252
01:55:18,079 --> 01:55:22,800
produced and you know the way

3253
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:25,279
that that's done um isn't always going

3254
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,960
to be you know a farmer pulling pouring

3255
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:28,719
all their love and heart into their

3256
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,158
living soil plants sometimes it's just

3257
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:32,639
going to be straight production and if

3258
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:34,799
the genetic work is is done correctly

3259
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,560
then um you know then those are going to

3260
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,480
be useful seeds

3261
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,599
yeah for sure

3262
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:42,000
so

3263
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,920
good point to bring it up i think how

3264
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,679
did you initially get into the

3265
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:48,000
regenerative farming movement was it

3266
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:50,639
just like a natural progression or did

3267
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,960
you meet someone and they really kind of

3268
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:54,079
changed your trajectory so to speak how

3269
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:56,239
did that happen

3270
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:58,840
it was being here

3271
01:55:56,238 --> 01:56:01,759
um during the time

3272
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:03,760
when um well there's a lot of indoor

3273
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,679
growing which was like you know it's not

3274
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:07,199
regenerative at all but it was mostly

3275
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:09,520
like kind of

3276
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:12,158
college-aged kids growing indoor the

3277
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:13,520
arcada area and just humbled in general

3278
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:15,198
and there was a lot of outdoor growing

3279
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,920
too but there was

3280
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:21,519
um you know the the high prices of

3281
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:24,760
purple and then bubba and then og uh

3282
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:27,199
drove this um incredible

3283
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:28,960
insanity of what was possible

3284
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:31,198
economically

3285
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:33,359
which ended up being very disastrous

3286
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:35,359
environmentally um

3287
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:37,279
so like all of a sudden like hey it

3288
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:38,960
makes sense to freaking make some giant

3289
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:40,960
underground

3290
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:43,279
you know several hundred light

3291
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:45,118
grow run by a diesel generator that you

3292
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:47,759
literally truck tankers out and fill

3293
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:49,519
next to a sensitive watershed and that

3294
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,599
was happening a lot and it was just like

3295
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,679
well this is insane and this is all

3296
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:55,360
based off of prohibition you know this

3297
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:56,639
is like they have to hide and we're

3298
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:58,960
destroying

3299
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:00,560
like our environment because of these

3300
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,719
incredibly

3301
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:05,760
high prices that are that shouldn't

3302
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:07,118
exist in a real you know uh

3303
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,920
economic

3304
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:10,559
uh

3305
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:12,880
reality that's not messed up by the

3306
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,639
government's war on drugs um

3307
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,159
it's just destroyed

3308
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,159
you know it makes inefficiencies it

3309
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:20,319
creates cancers it creates environmental

3310
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:21,439
issues when things like that happen

3311
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:23,679
and

3312
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:26,719
at this time too a lot of the

3313
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:28,719
indoor growers um that were more in town

3314
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:30,158
that were you know college age started

3315
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:32,639
going out to the hills and they were

3316
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:34,799
taking what they had indoor where they

3317
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:37,920
were making good money on these

3318
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,440
uh you know varieties grown inside and

3319
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:42,158
actually you know more varieties went

3320
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:44,319
back then too but then you know og

3321
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:45,839
started to become take over harder and

3322
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:47,118
harder of course bub always got good

3323
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,960
prices but there was a lot of great

3324
01:57:47,118 --> 01:57:50,960
varieties that still did pretty good

3325
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:53,359
um but it was the beginning one was that

3326
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,840
purple when l.a was just crazy about

3327
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:56,960
purple it just drove this huge

3328
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,279
um

3329
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:01,039
change in the economics of the whole

3330
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:02,479
thing and

3331
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:04,719
so when all these growers started going

3332
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:07,118
out with indoor tactics too and even how

3333
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,960
they're growing their outdoor flowers

3334
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:10,719
and depths and stuff where they're like

3335
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,158
going to the hydra store and buying all

3336
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:14,079
these expensive things that only really

3337
01:58:12,158 --> 01:58:16,799
make sense and small grows

3338
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:18,800
inside and bring it like large scale and

3339
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,800
just like wow you're spending so much

3340
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,599
money and you're actually [ __ ] [ __ ]

3341
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,840
up instead of you know cultivating the

3342
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:28,000
soil you're like bringing a bunch of you

3343
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:30,400
know

3344
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,840
engineered soil from freaking really far

3345
01:58:30,399 --> 01:58:33,839
away and bringing it up into the

3346
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:36,480
mountains and like you know all this

3347
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,079
stuff like mined in canada and sent down

3348
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:40,479
and then bringing all this perlite and

3349
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:42,238
bringing it out to these sensitive areas

3350
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:43,839
and then using pesticides and all of

3351
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:45,519
that and it was just like

3352
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:47,440
dude this is not

3353
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:49,840
this is not working this isn't how it

3354
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:51,359
should be um and it's totally out of

3355
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,239
balance

3356
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:54,238
and

3357
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,079
uh and and the thing is a lot of like

3358
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:57,279
good people are doing this too because

3359
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:58,800
it's just like what do you know you know

3360
01:58:57,279 --> 01:59:00,158
what you know from the grow shop you

3361
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,239
just take what you're doing small and

3362
01:59:00,158 --> 01:59:04,399
you apply it larger so it's like there's

3363
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:05,919
not it's not like anyone's like

3364
01:59:04,399 --> 01:59:07,118
out there evil oh i'm gonna [ __ ] up the

3365
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,719
environment and do this you know they're

3366
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:10,719
just trying to grow some good weed in

3367
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,560
the way that they know some people gave

3368
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:14,239
no [ __ ] and like you know we're total

3369
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:16,400
[ __ ] about it but

3370
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:18,718
i'm not saying not the case but you know

3371
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:20,638
some people just were ignorant to it or

3372
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:21,760
and just were and just for trying to do

3373
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,400
their thing

3374
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:27,199
um so i i just saw this moment where

3375
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:29,039
you know there's a lot of education that

3376
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:31,598
needed to happen and and change in the

3377
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,679
way people did things and what i loved

3378
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:35,599
about it is it made [ __ ] cheaper and so

3379
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,520
like going to like a grow where

3380
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:39,520
you know they were just grown with salts

3381
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,960
and you know using

3382
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:43,040
avid and

3383
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:46,000
maxi and

3384
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:48,479
whatever extra crazy salt stuff whether

3385
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:52,079
it's bushmaster or [ __ ] whatever

3386
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:54,238
insanity and uh you know and not really

3387
01:59:52,079 --> 01:59:55,519
getting the best results really you know

3388
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:57,678
it's like

3389
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,360
you're probably not gonna you know

3390
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:00,800
like look kind of cool but it's probably

3391
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:02,719
not tasting that great probably have

3392
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,440
some disease issues all that stuff and

3393
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,960
so

3394
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:06,079
there are certain farms we're like well

3395
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,039
how about we build a whole bunch of

3396
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:11,840
biodynamic compost right right here and

3397
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:13,760
or we just cover crop we mulch that in

3398
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,199
or we just do simple things amending

3399
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,960
with you know

3400
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:18,238
fish and kelp and bakashi and trace

3401
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:21,359
minerals and

3402
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:22,879
um and then

3403
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:24,559
there's one farm too where like the

3404
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,639
neighbors were

3405
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,840
cattle ranchers too and so

3406
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,679
and they had a bunch of equipment so

3407
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,880
they could just go and clean out their

3408
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:33,520
um

3409
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,560
their cattle bins and or their pens and

3410
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,920
um

3411
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,599
you know that was benefiting them and

3412
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,840
then we had this like nice resource to

3413
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:41,679
work with and i'd utilize all kinds of

3414
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:44,079
other stuff on the property to to

3415
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:45,760
compost that in and then they put that

3416
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:48,960
on and then saw the best year that

3417
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,560
they'd ever seen and had to use uh

3418
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,239
i think they said a ninth of the water

3419
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,239
that they were using before

3420
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:55,839
and didn't have to buy anything and had

3421
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:57,759
by far the best year that they ever saw

3422
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:59,599
so it's like when somebody all of a

3423
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:01,119
sudden sees that they're like wait i was

3424
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:02,400
spending a bunch of money [ __ ] [ __ ]

3425
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:04,319
up like

3426
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,960
not be doing the right things for the

3427
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:09,519
watershed or the the end patience and

3428
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:12,319
it's like all i have to do is just like

3429
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:14,159
do a few things thinking about the soil

3430
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:15,759
plant do nothing

3431
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:17,198
uh besides pull tarps or whatever

3432
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,960
they're doing and

3433
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:21,439
and uh

3434
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:23,840
and i get better results for literally

3435
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:24,879
like no money spent like

3436
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:26,719
so

3437
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,480
yeah yeah you know i just saw that as as

3438
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:30,719
something hey i think these ideas can

3439
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:30,718
spread

3440
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:36,319
and they did you know and i loved it

3441
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:39,118
when you know like more you know maybe a

3442
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:41,759
when a redneck is spreading this idea or

3443
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:44,158
a hippie spreading this idea or you know

3444
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,280
an environmentalist or a law officer you

3445
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:47,439
know all of a sudden like you know

3446
02:01:45,279 --> 02:01:50,079
became i ended up on a panel with like

3447
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:51,839
the ag commissioner and the sheriff you

3448
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:53,198
know and it was kind of funny it was

3449
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,279
like ag commissioner

3450
02:01:53,198 --> 02:01:57,439
uh sheriff biovortex it was like what

3451
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:58,880
the [ __ ] is a biovortex you know like we

3452
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:02,079
know what our commissioner is and the

3453
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:04,239
sheriff is this guy's a biovortex

3454
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:05,840
and it was you know super fun being on

3455
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:07,759
the panel and having this debate there

3456
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:09,760
you know they're not debate like they

3457
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:11,520
fully were you know just like hell yeah

3458
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,880
you know uh with all this stuff like

3459
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,760
this that's the kind of stuff we want to

3460
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,239
see

3461
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,000
um you know and as things become more

3462
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:18,959
open

3463
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,479
um

3464
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,158
it was kind of funny too like correcting

3465
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:23,839
the ad commissioner on the pronunciation

3466
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:26,158
of michael butinil because he kept

3467
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:27,920
saying michael button hall and it's like

3468
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:28,719
dude it's like one of the most important

3469
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,199
like

3470
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:33,198
issues with like cannabis and california

3471
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:35,839
at that time because it was uh

3472
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:38,879
um that's like the um active ingredient

3473
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:42,319
in eagle 20 and like other things that

3474
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:43,599
are designed for systemic powdery mildew

3475
02:02:42,319 --> 02:02:44,719
uh control

3476
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:46,400
and they're

3477
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:48,480
kind of nasty poisons

3478
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:50,638
that concentrate really well in in

3479
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:53,279
concentrated so they like so

3480
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:54,800
if you're making hash you're making uh

3481
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:56,479
bho or any of those kinds of

3482
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,719
concentrates the

3483
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:01,198
the microbutal concentrates would be

3484
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:03,118
very high um and they kind of would come

3485
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:04,479
out with the thc that it was hard to

3486
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:05,679
separate it from

3487
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:07,439
that and

3488
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:10,158
what was actually kind of cool about

3489
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:11,919
that is all of a sudden everyone started

3490
02:03:10,158 --> 02:03:14,158
failing that used that you know like

3491
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:16,719
like all these different extractors just

3492
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:19,359
started seeing fails everywhere

3493
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:20,960
and um and the thing is it's so systemic

3494
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:23,359
that someone might not

3495
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:25,359
even had to use it they got clones from

3496
02:03:23,359 --> 02:03:28,319
the someone who had used it

3497
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,079
and uh you know you might not see uh

3498
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:33,359
noticeable levels in the flower but once

3499
02:03:30,079 --> 02:03:35,359
you get the the concentrate uh you're

3500
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:38,880
you're actually at a fail level

3501
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:41,519
and um that was a huge economic uh

3502
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:44,400
driver for people to clean up their act

3503
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:46,480
uh having those um

3504
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:48,000
those standards and testing and seeing

3505
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:50,559
what was coming out in concentrates and

3506
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,760
just how pervasive certain things were

3507
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,400
um

3508
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:57,280
so yeah i mean sometimes you know like

3509
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:58,158
there's a lot of like shitty things that

3510
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:00,079
end up

3511
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:02,319
working out

3512
02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:03,920
the way it needs to you know like end up

3513
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:07,039
bringing more information or awareness

3514
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:10,239
to things you know um

3515
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:12,158
yeah yeah certainly and i mean you raise

3516
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:14,399
an interesting point there something

3517
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:16,158
i've heard a lot recently is this idea

3518
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:17,839
it's just anecdotal but i mean i think

3519
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:18,879
it might resonate with you as someone

3520
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,639
said to me

3521
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,480
you don't really see bud with pm these

3522
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:24,159
days you just you just see a lot of

3523
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:25,839
concentrates

3524
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:28,319
and i was like i was like yeah that's

3525
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:30,319
true isn't it like pm's just just you

3526
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:31,359
know it's just gone like as in obviously

3527
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:34,559
it's all just getting turned to

3528
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:36,238
concentrates um and so yeah it speaks to

3529
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:39,760
the point you mentioned and just to

3530
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:42,559
build on that what do you think is kind

3531
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:45,119
of the next step or the direction in

3532
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,000
which big ag is going to go do you think

3533
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:48,799
it's

3534
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,439
still this existential kind of threat to

3535
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:52,880
the the the people in the industry like

3536
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:54,399
what we initially thought or do you

3537
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:56,159
think there's going to be

3538
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:58,158
more of an even playing field kind of

3539
02:04:56,158 --> 02:05:00,079
like what we see in canada where the big

3540
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:02,158
firms are just really actually failing

3541
02:05:00,079 --> 02:05:03,439
quite miserably

3542
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:07,118
yeah

3543
02:05:03,439 --> 02:05:09,439
i i don't think uh like i know of any of

3544
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:11,920
the local or regen farms that are we're

3545
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:14,479
planning on going into the um

3546
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,279
large-scale phytochemical

3547
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:17,519
like

3548
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:19,198
business or into large-scale fiber

3549
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,639
production and stuff too you know it's

3550
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:23,198
like these are these are

3551
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:25,599
um people still want craft flowers uh

3552
02:05:23,198 --> 02:05:26,638
and i kind of think

3553
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,159
um

3554
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:29,920
that those

3555
02:05:28,158 --> 02:05:31,439
that the more educated the public is the

3556
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:33,440
more that they're gonna want stuff like

3557
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:34,879
that and i don't really think

3558
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:36,399
uh the large companies are gonna be able

3559
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,159
to

3560
02:05:36,399 --> 02:05:39,920
really

3561
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:42,960
take the place of that but they of

3562
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:45,760
course like as far as production for

3563
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:47,920
medicines for biomass for all of that um

3564
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,760
it's a big ag world

3565
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,000
but there's ways to adapt to that and

3566
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:55,280
hopefully um

3567
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,198
can get these ideas of how they can save

3568
02:05:55,279 --> 02:06:00,319
money in the way that they are growing

3569
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:02,399
and not just have like it be uh you know

3570
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:04,719
all these salts pesticides and all this

3571
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:06,158
plastic that's a big issue right now too

3572
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:07,118
there's all these hemp fields in oregon

3573
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:09,279
all over

3574
02:06:07,118 --> 02:06:12,399
it's just the use of these

3575
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:14,158
all the plastic mulching um and and then

3576
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:16,319
all the the

3577
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:19,039
the drip lines and just so much

3578
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:21,359
resources to grow

3579
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:24,238
uh plant and

3580
02:06:21,359 --> 02:06:25,598
you know that's one thing is is

3581
02:06:24,238 --> 02:06:27,279
people just gonna have to do it really

3582
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:28,880
cheap and with less resources and like

3583
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:30,158
all that stuff takes a lot of labor and

3584
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,359
you have to buy it and all that stuff

3585
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:32,960
and so i'm just

3586
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:35,118
hopeful that

3587
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:38,078
that those economic drivers will help

3588
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:39,279
the ecological

3589
02:06:38,078 --> 02:06:42,238
outcomes

3590
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:44,719
of farming practices on large scale when

3591
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:46,479
it comes to cannabis uh because i mean

3592
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:47,760
just think about that cost of like

3593
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:49,678
running drip lines to everything and

3594
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,039
putting that mulch out or the plastic

3595
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,359
running all the plastic all the time

3596
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:55,599
buying all of those things and then like

3597
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:56,639
all that [ __ ] just goes in the dump and

3598
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:59,679
it's like

3599
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:01,920
killing the soil and it's it's just yeah

3600
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:03,679
i don't know it's insane

3601
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,960
yeah but really like you know when i'm

3602
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:06,319
looking at these autos in the garden

3603
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,840
that are just were germinated and

3604
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:09,599
growing i haven't watered or done

3605
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:11,599
anything it's like to me that's the

3606
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:13,599
future of big ag like

3607
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:15,840
just the do nothing approach and it's

3608
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:17,360
just like and really it's it's it's

3609
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,039
actually the breeding and the genetics

3610
02:07:17,359 --> 02:07:21,198
and like you know getting quality stuff

3611
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:23,840
you know sovereign fields and uh you

3612
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:25,439
know done a great job like producing

3613
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,679
seeds with the right quality for those

3614
02:07:25,439 --> 02:07:30,319
large scale uh

3615
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:32,319
applications and having the feminized uh

3616
02:07:30,319 --> 02:07:33,840
with it which you know is like kind of

3617
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:36,078
interesting from

3618
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:38,239
because i really like all natural and

3619
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:40,479
regular breeding and regen but

3620
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:42,638
you know having feminists super useful

3621
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:43,919
for certain things it's also useful for

3622
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:45,359
selfing and understanding different

3623
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,399
things about plants and doing other

3624
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:48,559
things but

3625
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:50,879
um but being able to direct sow i mean

3626
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,800
[ __ ] that's a big deal for uh less

3627
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,480
resources if everyone if you have to pot

3628
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,400
every plant and veg it and then go it

3629
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:59,439
out and plant it and

3630
02:07:56,399 --> 02:08:02,399
every every step that you can take out

3631
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:03,678
work or resource being used and still

3632
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:06,559
get a

3633
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:09,279
a nice production i think is

3634
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:10,400
the way to go and and and in general

3635
02:08:09,279 --> 02:08:12,960
that's always going to be a more

3636
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:14,960
environmental way because um ecological

3637
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,920
is economical

3638
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:19,279
sure

3639
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:21,760
and what are your thoughts on genetic

3640
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:24,399
modification of cannabis because our

3641
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,639
buddies chimera and sam skunk man over

3642
02:08:24,399 --> 02:08:28,960
at molecular farms are certainly doing

3643
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:31,199
it do you feel like that's a bit of a

3644
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:33,359
step too far or do you feel like there

3645
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:35,519
might be value in that i think there's

3646
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:38,880
value in everything i just want i'm not

3647
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:41,840
a i yeah i want to learn

3648
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:44,000
everything and and if something

3649
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,760
makes sense then

3650
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,920
yeah i'm not like a

3651
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:49,679
i can't just say

3652
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:52,239
you know [ __ ] i mean you can just pull

3653
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:54,239
out like one thing and then lose an

3654
02:08:52,238 --> 02:08:56,238
expression that you didn't want like

3655
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:57,919
that's great like that could be super

3656
02:08:56,238 --> 02:09:00,559
useful um

3657
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:03,599
what i what i'm afraid of actually more

3658
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:05,360
than genetically modifying or

3659
02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:07,279
and how you want to define that can be

3660
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:09,118
different like is it are you talking

3661
02:09:07,279 --> 02:09:10,880
about crispr like or

3662
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:12,639
i mean really actually breeding is

3663
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,960
genetically modifying like what it just

3664
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,639
what i'm doing is genetically modifying

3665
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,039
it through

3666
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:21,279
the work that we're doing as a human um

3667
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:23,760
you know i might not be taking a segment

3668
02:09:21,279 --> 02:09:26,399
of dna and pulling it out or putting

3669
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,760
something else in um i think there's a

3670
02:09:26,399 --> 02:09:33,198
lot of use in pulling out something that

3671
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:35,440
might give an undesirable uh expression

3672
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:37,359
and why not see what we could do with

3673
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:39,519
that i i don't see why not

3674
02:09:37,359 --> 02:09:41,759
but i do have a fear that

3675
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:43,679
with patents um once you genetically

3676
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:46,400
modify something then

3677
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:49,599
that's like a really easy place to be

3678
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:50,960
like i own this or something and

3679
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:53,119
so

3680
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:55,198
making sure that we

3681
02:09:53,118 --> 02:09:57,759
don't

3682
02:09:55,198 --> 02:09:59,439
that we keep potential free

3683
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,599
with this plan medical and breeding

3684
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:03,839
potential for everyone to be able to

3685
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:04,880
work with it in any way that we want um

3686
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:07,199
so

3687
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:09,440
yeah my fear is more the legal

3688
02:10:07,198 --> 02:10:11,519
repercussions of people trying to

3689
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:14,479
own different things through genetically

3690
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:17,520
modified work than the actual uh process

3691
02:10:14,479 --> 02:10:19,039
because i'm super interested to

3692
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:20,960
see what we can do you know if you can

3693
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:22,880
just pull out a little segment not rpm

3694
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,719
like i don't know why not [ __ ] it let's

3695
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:26,800
do it

3696
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:27,520
hey yeah hell yeah so

3697
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,279
just

3698
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,599
but i would prefer doing it through

3699
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:33,279
natural selection and just observation

3700
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:34,000
and working with the plant that way i i

3701
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:36,399
do

3702
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,319
i feel more um

3703
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:41,279
hormone i don't know they're just that

3704
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:43,519
resonates with me better but um i'm not

3705
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:45,439
against anything really

3706
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:48,159
unless it hurts the environment or it

3707
02:10:45,439 --> 02:10:52,319
hurts people's humans rights

3708
02:10:48,158 --> 02:10:54,319
yeah yeah good good rules to to live by

3709
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:56,238
uh just to loot back to a topic before

3710
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:57,439
because we we commonly get asked this by

3711
02:10:56,238 --> 02:11:00,479
our listeners

3712
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:01,839
let's say that you totally in line with

3713
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:04,158
everything you've said and everything

3714
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:06,400
you believe but unfortunately maybe you

3715
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:07,920
live in the city maybe in an apartment

3716
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:09,679
or something like that you know and the

3717
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:12,399
goal is to get to a farm one day but

3718
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:14,399
just unfortunately that's not quite now

3719
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:17,359
do you think that there is like you can

3720
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:19,920
still do your best to you know do living

3721
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:21,920
organic soil indoors and like is there a

3722
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:23,359
compromise that you feel like you know

3723
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,520
you're doing the best for the situation

3724
02:11:23,359 --> 02:11:27,679
you've got or do you feel like unless

3725
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,840
you're outdoors it is really quite hard

3726
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:31,520
to try to you know get to the standard

3727
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:35,119
that you're at

3728
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:37,440
yeah no i mean i freaking i think that

3729
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:40,078
the the personal little indoor is just

3730
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:41,598
such a oasis and a beautiful thing to

3731
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:43,359
celebrate um

3732
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:44,639
i'm not against that at all you know i

3733
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:48,238
don't like the

3734
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:50,319
insane large-scale use of

3735
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:52,078
of lights like especially in areas where

3736
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:54,479
the sun's just beating it's just like an

3737
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:56,719
insane use of of resources and energy

3738
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:59,678
but like man to have a relationship with

3739
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:01,279
cannabis in your own apartment or

3740
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:03,199
uh if you're in a place where the

3741
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:04,399
growing conditions aren't that good or

3742
02:12:03,198 --> 02:12:07,598
just to be able to have cannabis

3743
02:12:04,399 --> 02:12:09,519
year-round like [ __ ] yeah i i think

3744
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:12,480
that's a wonderful thing to do and i

3745
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,920
think it is super doable with living

3746
02:12:12,479 --> 02:12:16,559
soil type

3747
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:18,158
production and i think people have a

3748
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:21,360
really good time you know doing those

3749
02:12:18,158 --> 02:12:22,719
multiple years of cultivating soils you

3750
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:24,479
know people are proud about how many

3751
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:26,158
runs they've done in the same

3752
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:27,839
living soil bed and you know they show

3753
02:12:26,158 --> 02:12:30,238
how they keep getting better when they

3754
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:32,800
understand certain ways of of giving

3755
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:34,158
back to it

3756
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:36,400
but yeah i mean it could be really

3757
02:12:34,158 --> 02:12:38,559
simple too like but just getting started

3758
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:40,719
off um

3759
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:42,480
you know i mean ideally like you could

3760
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:43,599
be doing a full living soil thing but if

3761
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:46,879
you just

3762
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:49,039
want to mix some amendments with some

3763
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:51,118
with uh some nice potting soil uh well

3764
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:52,238
one thing i like is is pumice instead of

3765
02:12:51,118 --> 02:12:53,920
perlite

3766
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:55,198
um

3767
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,880
and

3768
02:12:55,198 --> 02:13:00,000
uh you know getting some nice worm

3769
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:02,159
castings um or

3770
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,319
ideally making your own from your

3771
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:05,359
compost but making sure you don't let

3772
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:07,198
too many

3773
02:13:05,359 --> 02:13:09,839
uh unwanted

3774
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:11,279
critters get into the indoor situation

3775
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,960
that's the way the problem comes in it's

3776
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:15,439
just like i want to just like be able to

3777
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:17,679
use any compost or living soil in like

3778
02:13:15,439 --> 02:13:19,519
whatever cool way that you want outside

3779
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:21,920
everything stays in balance but second

3780
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,920
you go inside you know any little extra

3781
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:25,840
critters can get out of balance um

3782
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,279
there's nothing to regulate them and

3783
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:29,119
you know so you don't want your thrips

3784
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:31,519
and your spider mites and you don't want

3785
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:33,598
your fungus gnats and you don't want all

3786
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:34,719
those things

3787
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:36,560
that

3788
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:39,198
are yeah different flies that might like

3789
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:41,039
compost so being wary of how you avoid

3790
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:43,439
all that kind of stuff

3791
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:44,880
i think akashi is a super useful tool

3792
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:47,039
because if you just

3793
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:48,400
mix like an amendment let's say you're

3794
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:50,078
using um

3795
02:13:48,399 --> 02:13:52,479
well a really good one is like dragonfly

3796
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:54,238
earth medicine makes those nice

3797
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:56,718
products they're radiant green is a nice

3798
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:59,598
one to mix in um

3799
02:13:56,719 --> 02:14:01,760
and but like just inexpensive stuff is

3800
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:04,159
uh fish bone um

3801
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:05,360
azomite or just straight trace mineral

3802
02:14:04,158 --> 02:14:07,439
um

3803
02:14:05,359 --> 02:14:08,880
you know some kind of fish meal or kelp

3804
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:10,879
of course that's bringing stuff from the

3805
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,480
ocean and you gotta think about like how

3806
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:14,159
you feel about

3807
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:15,598
you know what's going on in the ocean

3808
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:17,759
but i guess you know we've polluted

3809
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,679
everywhere so um

3810
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,520
i don't know how you got to deal with it

3811
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:23,599
i love all the minerals that is stored

3812
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:26,480
in kelp and um

3813
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:28,639
and yeah this the nutritional quality of

3814
02:14:26,479 --> 02:14:30,238
fish bone and plants seem to really like

3815
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:31,599
it but kashi seems to eat it really

3816
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:33,198
quickly and

3817
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:35,599
um

3818
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:38,000
compost teas um you know just having a

3819
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:40,159
high quality compost some some good

3820
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,118
quality fish hydro hydroslate

3821
02:14:40,158 --> 02:14:42,399
and

3822
02:14:41,118 --> 02:14:44,078
and

3823
02:14:42,399 --> 02:14:46,479
you know good amount of air in a bucket

3824
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:48,399
it's real simple thing to do um

3825
02:14:46,479 --> 02:14:50,879
just and it's a fun thing to do like

3826
02:14:48,399 --> 02:14:52,479
looking under the microscope too

3827
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,760
and it becomes a whole another part of

3828
02:14:52,479 --> 02:14:54,799
the cultivation experience because

3829
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:57,199
you're like

3830
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:58,960
now you're actually thinking about the

3831
02:14:57,198 --> 02:15:01,359
microbes and um

3832
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:03,840
you know so just putting some good tea i

3833
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:05,839
mean some good compost and some clean

3834
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:07,840
water and i've been using rainwater

3835
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,440
because i have nice rainwater catchment

3836
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,199
system put in with

3837
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:12,479
dan of high tide permaculture a little

3838
02:15:11,198 --> 02:15:14,238
bit ago

3839
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:16,158
he's also the one that

3840
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:18,078
has been a big influence on developing

3841
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:19,519
the regenerative cannabis farm award and

3842
02:15:18,078 --> 02:15:21,118
and a lot of

3843
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,400
the permaculture

3844
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:23,839
um

3845
02:15:22,399 --> 02:15:24,719
techniques that we put forward and he's

3846
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,599
been

3847
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:27,920
working

3848
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:28,719
with compliant farms and helping people

3849
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:30,639
come

3850
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:32,399
into environmental and

3851
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:36,159
regulation and

3852
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:37,279
compliance in the cannabis world

3853
02:15:36,158 --> 02:15:39,598
um

3854
02:15:37,279 --> 02:15:40,960
sorry yeah a little tangent there but

3855
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:42,960
it's awesome to be able to work with the

3856
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:45,279
rain water because it's like it just

3857
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:46,960
comes from the sky it's like the ph is

3858
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:48,078
fine there's nothing in it and you get

3859
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:50,158
to

3860
02:15:48,078 --> 02:15:51,279
bubble up some really clean compost tea

3861
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:52,158
that way

3862
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:53,198
um

3863
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:56,638
and

3864
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:58,479
then after like 24 hours or so then it's

3865
02:15:56,639 --> 02:16:00,239
fun to look at it under the microscope

3866
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:02,479
and see what you got going on see if you

3867
02:16:00,238 --> 02:16:04,559
could uh you can see the fungal hyphae

3868
02:16:02,479 --> 02:16:06,479
growing you can see the clusters of

3869
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:09,520
bacteria you see like the four systems

3870
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:11,678
that are created uh from the the

3871
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:13,520
fungal networks that begin to

3872
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:15,840
develop the mycelial networks and you

3873
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:17,119
get to see the

3874
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,360
um

3875
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:21,118
the protozoa like roaming through these

3876
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:22,880
forests and going around and eating all

3877
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:24,880
kinds of stuff and like

3878
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,639
um you know when you start to like know

3879
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:28,560
what kind of life is is healthy and you

3880
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:30,719
know that it's an oxygenated environment

3881
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:32,639
then um it's a pretty simple and fun

3882
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:34,879
thing to do i mean it's just

3883
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:37,358
some food like caliper fish

3884
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:38,558
really good quality compost water and a

3885
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:40,559
bunch of air

3886
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:42,398
you want to have a good aerator and i

3887
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:45,039
don't go with stones just go with a

3888
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:45,039
straight pipe

3889
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:49,920
yeah just you just want it to bubble

3890
02:16:48,398 --> 02:16:50,959
there you go i didn't know that one

3891
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:54,558
there you go i'm gonna be getting rid of

3892
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:56,318
that air stone um my question it kind of

3893
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:58,558
relates to when i was chatting with josh

3894
02:16:56,318 --> 02:17:01,039
and kelly of dragonfly they said that

3895
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:03,679
when you get your property or your soil

3896
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:06,160
to like the level yours is obviously at

3897
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:08,558
you can even start to see different

3898
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:10,959
cannabinoid profile expressions when you

3899
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:12,799
know maybe your mate grows it out and

3900
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:14,239
he's like yes you know there's no cbd

3901
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:15,759
and then you grow and there's a little

3902
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:17,679
bit or like just just there's a

3903
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,599
different profile basically

3904
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,679
do you feel like when you really get

3905
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:24,398
your microbes working for you and you've

3906
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:26,239
got your own little environment churning

3907
02:17:24,398 --> 02:17:27,519
away that you can get that altered

3908
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:29,439
expression

3909
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:31,439
well again genetics is first you're not

3910
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:33,760
going to all of a sudden see a type 1

3911
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:35,920
variety like you know that's all thc

3912
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:38,239
just all of a sudden have some thc

3913
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:40,239
i mean some cbd in it if it if it never

3914
02:17:38,239 --> 02:17:42,638
has before that doesn't really happen

3915
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:45,119
um and you know vice versa with a few

3916
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:47,839
different things although but like

3917
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:50,240
you know something like cbg uh will be

3918
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:51,920
affected on harvest time or or

3919
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:54,159
environment potentially

3920
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,239
um but there's just certain things that

3921
02:17:54,159 --> 02:17:59,119
are just set into place with the

3922
02:17:56,239 --> 02:18:00,159
genetics um but certainly

3923
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:02,960
the

3924
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:05,359
the levels you know are going to be

3925
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:07,919
play you know it's like how much thc is

3926
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:12,239
in this one and you know maybe in type 2

3927
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,239
varieties there might be a play and

3928
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:16,079
the percentages but you're not going to

3929
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:17,519
just all of a sudden see thc or cbd out

3930
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:19,359
of nowhere where there wasn't any of

3931
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:20,159
that genetic to begin with

3932
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:21,679
um

3933
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:22,879
and then but with terpenes you are

3934
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:24,478
definitely going to see some different

3935
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:27,358
things happening

3936
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:29,920
and certainly stresses could bring out

3937
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:32,000
different um

3938
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:34,079
compounds being

3939
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,359
produced and

3940
02:18:34,079 --> 02:18:38,398
but another thing too though i mean

3941
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:40,559
genetics seem to kind of sh at least

3942
02:18:38,398 --> 02:18:42,558
dictate what dominant terpenes are going

3943
02:18:40,558 --> 02:18:43,759
to be and and the order

3944
02:18:42,558 --> 02:18:45,599
um

3945
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:47,040
a bit but like again the percentages

3946
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:48,079
could change so all of a sudden there's

3947
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,439
like

3948
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:50,718
you know there's

3949
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:52,159
instead of it producing two percent

3950
02:18:50,718 --> 02:18:53,518
terpenes the whole plants producing four

3951
02:18:52,159 --> 02:18:55,439
and a half percent terpenes and that's

3952
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:56,880
way different and maybe the order is a

3953
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:58,880
little shifted but

3954
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:01,039
um the genetics are going to dictate a

3955
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:02,718
lot of that so you're not going to see

3956
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:05,200
super wide

3957
02:19:02,718 --> 02:19:06,638
changes normally but

3958
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:08,479
but you do get different aromas

3959
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:10,398
different expressions you know

3960
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:12,239
different potencies different qualities

3961
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:13,599
a lot of the the the differences you're

3962
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:14,879
going to see are

3963
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:17,359
um

3964
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:19,039
in look too you know like what did it go

3965
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:21,599
dark because it was

3966
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:24,160
colder out or did it uh

3967
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:26,159
you know did it dry out more or was the

3968
02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:27,599
wind just like ripping it or like you

3969
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:28,558
know these environmental things are

3970
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:30,558
gonna

3971
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:32,879
mean a lot about the the end look and

3972
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:34,478
that also means something about um the

3973
02:19:32,879 --> 02:19:36,558
trichomes and then

3974
02:19:34,478 --> 02:19:38,718
the curing process is just massive

3975
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:40,239
though that's really gonna mean a lot

3976
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:42,079
too um

3977
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:44,718
you know like are all these trichomes

3978
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:47,519
damaged uh did it get too hot did it

3979
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:50,239
stay wet too long did it uh

3980
02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:51,680
did it dry too fast like that's gonna

3981
02:19:50,239 --> 02:19:53,920
just affect

3982
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,960
you know what terpenes are are

3983
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:56,159
are there

3984
02:19:54,959 --> 02:19:57,599
quite a bit

3985
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:00,318
um

3986
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:01,520
so yeah it all goes into it but like

3987
02:20:00,318 --> 02:20:03,760
there's certain things that just

3988
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:06,000
genetics lock into place and they're not

3989
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:07,760
going to change that much

3990
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,680
yeah of course of course but actually

3991
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:11,439
i'm really excited about looking into

3992
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:13,200
this a lot more and you know there are

3993
02:20:11,439 --> 02:20:14,639
cool things like the grow off that have

3994
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,399
done this with clonal varieties in

3995
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:17,760
different locations and

3996
02:20:16,398 --> 02:20:18,639
um

3997
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:20,239
uh

3998
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:22,559
you know they actually noticed one

3999
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:25,600
terpene that the

4000
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:27,279
hadn't been produced by any of the other

4001
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:29,520
of the plants

4002
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:31,920
it might have been the eagles

4003
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,600
but they um

4004
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:35,840
it was only two plants that that

4005
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:37,359
produced in both times it was a super

4006
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:38,799
stressed environment they're like you

4007
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:39,600
know when they asked the grower it was

4008
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:42,159
like

4009
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:44,079
so it could have been a terpene

4010
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:46,799
because it wasn't in any of the others

4011
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:48,719
like at all not no non-detect and then

4012
02:20:46,799 --> 02:20:50,959
there was like a considerable amount

4013
02:20:48,719 --> 02:20:53,199
like um

4014
02:20:50,959 --> 02:20:55,679
was that the uh near dial i think that

4015
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:59,120
was and uh yeah so there's a good chance

4016
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:00,559
that stress uh would affect that but

4017
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,319
being able to look at that kind of those

4018
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:03,840
kinds of analytics with control groups

4019
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:05,199
would be really useful and i'm looking

4020
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:07,120
forward to doing that this year i want

4021
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:08,960
to do that actually with not just clone

4022
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:10,079
varieties but with tissue culture too so

4023
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:12,079
it can make sure that i have more

4024
02:21:10,079 --> 02:21:14,318
control on that and you know see what

4025
02:21:12,079 --> 02:21:16,478
like a black dog or cherry lime dog does

4026
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:19,119
in a few of the different really cool

4027
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:20,799
um farms in our areas you know showcase

4028
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:23,520
like the difference of a dry farm or a

4029
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:25,438
forest or a mountain top with um some of

4030
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:27,280
the good farmers here i wanted you know

4031
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:30,639
doing that with time lapse too and

4032
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:32,319
having that linked up with the um

4033
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:34,559
the uh

4034
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:36,318
the weather uh data collection as well

4035
02:21:34,559 --> 02:21:37,600
which is happening with the appalachian

4036
02:21:36,318 --> 02:21:39,119
project

4037
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:40,640
there's like nine

4038
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:43,280
weather stations going in that are going

4039
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:44,159
to be collecting all this cool data

4040
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:45,600
and

4041
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:47,439
being able to put that all together you

4042
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,520
can do a time lapse of the plant growing

4043
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:51,040
throughout the whole year and look at

4044
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,399
all the different

4045
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:54,960
weather

4046
02:21:52,398 --> 02:21:57,039
data at that exact time and then you

4047
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:59,358
could take that all the way into

4048
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:01,840
the drying and curing process and then

4049
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:03,600
look at the end analytics of everything

4050
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:05,680
and you know learn a lot about those

4051
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:07,280
different spots and start to build um

4052
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:10,239
you know

4053
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:13,359
real real data on how genetics um are

4054
02:22:10,239 --> 02:22:14,959
affected by different uh locations

4055
02:22:13,359 --> 02:22:16,960
yeah i mean it certainly goes to show

4056
02:22:14,959 --> 02:22:18,879
that there's just so much work to be

4057
02:22:16,959 --> 02:22:20,398
done in the field isn't there

4058
02:22:18,879 --> 02:22:23,199
okay

4059
02:22:20,398 --> 02:22:25,039
yeah yeah because i always think i just

4060
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:26,240
my mind always goes to wine because i

4061
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:28,160
just think of like you know it's

4062
02:22:26,239 --> 02:22:29,280
established terroirs or even cheese

4063
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:30,639
stuff like that and it's like yeah

4064
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:33,040
they've been working on it for hundreds

4065
02:22:30,639 --> 02:22:35,358
of years and they're really getting it

4066
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:36,560
in place now so we got a while to go but

4067
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:38,159
um

4068
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:41,199
and then when you think of like the

4069
02:22:38,159 --> 02:22:44,079
example of like uh erasing you just had

4070
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,920
on like like those appellations like

4071
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:49,039
when we're talking about a variety

4072
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:51,040
that's just so adapted to growing you

4073
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,280
know close to the equator or so adapted

4074
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:54,960
to being in the mountains or being

4075
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:56,720
you know a certain place north or in the

4076
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:58,639
desert um

4077
02:22:56,719 --> 02:22:59,519
and the attributes that go with that

4078
02:22:58,639 --> 02:23:01,680
like

4079
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:03,359
that's like real like land appellations

4080
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:06,079
but then also the

4081
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:08,239
the rich human history of cannabis in

4082
02:23:06,079 --> 02:23:10,478
india and people in india is just

4083
02:23:08,239 --> 02:23:13,680
amazing you know with like

4084
02:23:10,478 --> 02:23:15,599
just so many multi-generational

4085
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:17,600
farms in just

4086
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:19,840
decades or centuries or thousands of

4087
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:22,318
years of relationships in certain areas

4088
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:24,079
growing this plant like that's like

4089
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:25,439
another level of appellation you know

4090
02:23:24,079 --> 02:23:27,200
when we're talking about well yeah we've

4091
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,800
been growing you know these hybrids and

4092
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:30,640
clones here for like a couple two

4093
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:33,199
decades or something or three decades or

4094
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:36,719
four uh it's like it's just a different

4095
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:38,079
thing um and a lot of the farms are like

4096
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:39,599
especially in the legal thing are like

4097
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:41,359
relatively new

4098
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:44,239
and there was a time when people were

4099
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:45,680
just only growing clones too um

4100
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:47,439
it was kind of funny it was like it was

4101
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,280
super weird that i had

4102
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:51,359
seed plants and males like it was like

4103
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,720
this totally crazy thing for a cannabis

4104
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:53,760
grower to have

4105
02:23:52,719 --> 02:23:54,639
like

4106
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:57,760
um

4107
02:23:54,639 --> 02:23:59,439
like for yeah it was just clones um

4108
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:01,600
so yeah i don't know i think we have a

4109
02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:03,120
lot of work to do to to define our area

4110
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:06,000
but at the same time

4111
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:08,720
california has been this freaking

4112
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,719
epicenter of

4113
02:24:08,719 --> 02:24:12,398
just being

4114
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:13,920
the

4115
02:24:12,398 --> 02:24:16,159
the current moment of cannabis like

4116
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,799
we've been you know as far as like

4117
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:20,318
innovations and breeding and the culture

4118
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:21,039
and the hash and all of the things it's

4119
02:24:20,318 --> 02:24:22,959
like

4120
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:26,000
i mean there's just so much of that work

4121
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:28,879
comes from the culture here and

4122
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,520
um it's it is a special

4123
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:32,239
thing to

4124
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:34,560
to

4125
02:24:32,239 --> 02:24:36,559
yeah honor and to acknowledge and you

4126
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:38,559
know be nice for these craft farmers to

4127
02:24:36,559 --> 02:24:41,600
be able to have um that kind of

4128
02:24:38,559 --> 02:24:44,000
recognition um like a you know a wine

4129
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:45,520
appellation um

4130
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,760
where it's like yeah you are from this

4131
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:49,680
place and you are doing these practices

4132
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:51,120
and you know

4133
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:53,200
and then the way that we mix that in

4134
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:54,399
with genetics too will be interesting of

4135
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:57,200
course we need to do it in a way that's

4136
02:24:54,398 --> 02:25:00,079
like super open um and that encourages

4137
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:02,479
uh you know farmers to do what makes

4138
02:25:00,079 --> 02:25:04,318
sense for their place um i don't want

4139
02:25:02,478 --> 02:25:06,879
anything like

4140
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:09,439
you know it's like we know what like

4141
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:11,199
apino is and we know what a

4142
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:12,720
cab is but like

4143
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:15,359
you know we know about those grapes and

4144
02:25:12,719 --> 02:25:17,519
those cultivars but um

4145
02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:18,960
we don't want monocultures in cannabis

4146
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,319
too we want the farms growing lots of

4147
02:25:18,959 --> 02:25:22,159
different varieties and we want them

4148
02:25:20,318 --> 02:25:24,398
breeding for it you know like

4149
02:25:22,159 --> 02:25:26,159
greens source gardens like

4150
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:29,199
uh you know breeding

4151
02:25:26,159 --> 02:25:30,318
those multi-generations uh on on that

4152
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,280
spot

4153
02:25:30,318 --> 02:25:33,119
um

4154
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:35,520
that's building towards an appellation

4155
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:37,120
and and year after year

4156
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,520
utilizing their forest and their

4157
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:42,000
barnyard waste to build soil fertility

4158
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:44,319
like that's the kind of stuff that we're

4159
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,478
you know we need to be talking about and

4160
02:25:44,318 --> 02:25:48,879
honoring um

4161
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:50,559
yeah it can't just be

4162
02:25:48,879 --> 02:25:53,358
oh you grow this one type of thing in

4163
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:56,000
this one place and anything goes it

4164
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:58,159
needs to be more more special than that

4165
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,439
um and it needs to be open for for

4166
02:25:58,159 --> 02:26:02,079
innovation

4167
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:03,200
but i super look forward to the way that

4168
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:04,879
that

4169
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:07,120
the genetics tie into that because like

4170
02:26:04,879 --> 02:26:09,199
if you do have some a special genetic

4171
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:10,560
you know that your farm becomes

4172
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:13,040
associated with or you work with the

4173
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:14,398
breeder to develop in that place like we

4174
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:16,080
should talk about it and celebrate it

4175
02:26:14,398 --> 02:26:18,879
and and you know also have some

4176
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:21,359
marketing power in and being able to say

4177
02:26:18,879 --> 02:26:23,279
that it is what it is and

4178
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:27,040
so yeah it's exciting

4179
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:29,760
how uh to see how farmers will be

4180
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:32,720
um promoted i guess and you know the way

4181
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,719
that it will hopefully

4182
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:37,920
um help help farmers to

4183
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:39,680
well as as things

4184
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:40,639
become more international i mean i feel

4185
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:43,920
like the

4186
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:46,478
the world will just open up um that full

4187
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:48,639
the cannabis prohibition is over just

4188
02:26:46,478 --> 02:26:50,639
how long it will take um

4189
02:26:48,639 --> 02:26:53,439
worldwide and hopefully we still see the

4190
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:55,279
entire end of the war on drugs but

4191
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:56,960
um

4192
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:59,040
but uh

4193
02:26:56,959 --> 02:27:00,879
as that happens you know being able to

4194
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:02,319
really because it already is special

4195
02:27:00,879 --> 02:27:04,639
everywhere in the world you see crazy

4196
02:27:02,318 --> 02:27:06,079
prices in the uk and spain and different

4197
02:27:04,639 --> 02:27:09,039
things for something that was grown in

4198
02:27:06,079 --> 02:27:11,840
california and as as as erasmus also uh

4199
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:16,000
mentioned too the the insane prices uh

4200
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:17,920
in india for really high quality uh or

4201
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:20,159
you know

4202
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:23,200
yeah i mean what you know dank weed or

4203
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:25,039
whatever yeah just going for uh just a

4204
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:27,520
tremendous amount of money it's just

4205
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:30,240
staggering really to think about and and

4206
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:31,359
how much cannabis is in india and how

4207
02:27:30,239 --> 02:27:33,840
having something that looks like it's

4208
02:27:31,359 --> 02:27:35,840
from california is worth that much money

4209
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:37,600
um so that's that yeah that's real

4210
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:39,280
perception those are real things and

4211
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:41,200
hopefully it gets backed by the best

4212
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:43,439
farmers and breeders and it is a real

4213
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:44,960
thing that the world gets to uh to know

4214
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:45,920
that they are

4215
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:48,239
you know

4216
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,719
getting that kind of quality um both in

4217
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:52,959
practices and genetics

4218
02:27:50,719 --> 02:27:55,679
yeah i mean that's that's so important

4219
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:57,438
right and i mean on that note you know

4220
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:59,280
as we approach the quickfire questions i

4221
02:27:57,439 --> 02:28:01,280
wanted to ask you

4222
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:03,359
it feels like historically the reason

4223
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:05,200
why these precedents sort of exist is

4224
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:07,280
because you've got you know your high

4225
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,960
times and your whatever which you know

4226
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:10,239
promotes certain types of cannabis and

4227
02:28:08,959 --> 02:28:13,119
you look at that you're like oh that's

4228
02:28:10,239 --> 02:28:15,920
the bee's knees however in recent years

4229
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:17,359
we've seen events like high times and

4230
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:20,159
some other notable ones even like the

4231
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:22,239
emerald cup have kind of shrunk in size

4232
02:28:20,159 --> 02:28:25,280
a little bit but we've seen on the other

4233
02:28:22,239 --> 02:28:27,199
hand the uprising of more kind of

4234
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:29,520
community-led things like the

4235
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:31,840
regenerative farm award and the

4236
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:33,439
regenerative farming conferences do you

4237
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:34,719
think this trend will continue in that

4238
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:37,439
we might see some of the bigger

4239
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:39,279
corporate ones get a little less popular

4240
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:41,120
and some of the more grassroots ones

4241
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,120
grow in size what's your kind of

4242
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:43,920
predictions for that

4243
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:45,840
well

4244
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,760
[ __ ] i mean i don't know if i have any

4245
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:49,359
predictions in covid world for events at

4246
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:52,639
the moment

4247
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:54,880
i think the way uh yeah some of the

4248
02:28:52,639 --> 02:28:56,000
you know award

4249
02:28:54,879 --> 02:28:58,159
based stuff

4250
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,200
yeah we'll just have to be creative this

4251
02:28:58,159 --> 02:29:01,520
this year

4252
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,520
um

4253
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:05,920
yeah i mean it's it's always my hope

4254
02:29:04,478 --> 02:29:07,599
that

4255
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:10,398
that it will continue in that direction

4256
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:12,079
and so far i feel that it has um you

4257
02:29:10,398 --> 02:29:14,000
know like every year

4258
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:16,639
at the emerald cup i just like i feel

4259
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,639
like yeah there's just amazing talks and

4260
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:19,599
there's amazing you know and it's

4261
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:23,079
um

4262
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:23,079
and more awareness

4263
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,479
but yeah yeah

4264
02:29:24,959 --> 02:29:28,559
i don't know what the future of the

4265
02:29:26,478 --> 02:29:31,358
larger events are in the really near

4266
02:29:28,559 --> 02:29:32,799
future right now um i do like the idea

4267
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:34,559
of

4268
02:29:32,799 --> 02:29:36,318
utilizing

4269
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:37,359
the fact that large events aren't really

4270
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:38,559
like

4271
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:39,920
the appropriate

4272
02:29:38,559 --> 02:29:41,600
thing to do

4273
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:45,040
at the moment um

4274
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:47,840
and getting creative with um

4275
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:48,840
in online ways of of getting this kind

4276
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:51,600
of

4277
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:53,760
information about cannabis medicine out

4278
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:56,720
through contests and stuff so

4279
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:58,398
um yeah i like playing around with the

4280
02:29:56,719 --> 02:29:59,840
different ways that we can really

4281
02:29:58,398 --> 02:30:02,959
explore

4282
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:05,520
something fully because we can

4283
02:30:02,959 --> 02:30:07,039
choose what we then curate to go online

4284
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:08,319
and to

4285
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,760
um

4286
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:11,519
it's

4287
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:12,960
and you can really dive into a lot of

4288
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:16,399
information am i uh do you know the

4289
02:30:12,959 --> 02:30:18,398
cultivation classic in um portland yeah

4290
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:21,039
yeah i've heard of it cool

4291
02:30:18,398 --> 02:30:22,959
it was an event that i helped uh

4292
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:24,640
start or start you know

4293
02:30:22,959 --> 02:30:26,159
i was working on from the beginning and

4294
02:30:24,639 --> 02:30:28,639
a lot of the con

4295
02:30:26,159 --> 02:30:30,639
concepts with it and it was a you know

4296
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:32,559
the regenerative cannabis farm award

4297
02:30:30,639 --> 02:30:34,000
also um

4298
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:35,760
was a part of that from the beginning

4299
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:39,200
too and

4300
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:40,478
um and kind of that idea towards

4301
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:41,600
living soil

4302
02:30:40,478 --> 02:30:44,318
production

4303
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:48,479
mixed with just really good science and

4304
02:30:44,318 --> 02:30:51,279
analytics and uh what was really cool is

4305
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:52,478
the last two years it's adapted its um

4306
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,399
contest

4307
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:57,279
into more of a

4308
02:30:54,398 --> 02:30:58,318
like a real patient study um

4309
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:02,319
and

4310
02:30:58,318 --> 02:31:04,000
dr addy ray of um smart cannabis and

4311
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:05,359
steph earnhardt they

4312
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,280
um

4313
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:09,120
had built this this platform of smart

4314
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:11,120
cannabis um

4315
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:13,280
where

4316
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:15,920
they get about a i think uh the year

4317
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:18,560
before it was 150 um

4318
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:20,159
patients or reviewers or

4319
02:31:18,559 --> 02:31:21,760
you know judges

4320
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:22,559
and

4321
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:25,439
that

4322
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:27,039
fulfilled actually a wide demographic um

4323
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:29,280
you know of

4324
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:33,920
different genders and backgrounds and

4325
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:36,479
ages and all of that and then um

4326
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:38,639
they each are trained in sampling each

4327
02:31:36,478 --> 02:31:41,358
one and there's space in between the

4328
02:31:38,639 --> 02:31:43,358
sampling and they can

4329
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:45,760
fill out you know the

4330
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:47,600
how they're feeling uh as they sample

4331
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:49,680
each different thing um

4332
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:51,680
and all that information and data is

4333
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:53,120
collected and

4334
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:54,639
put together and then of course the

4335
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:56,640
analytics are run on every flower and

4336
02:31:54,639 --> 02:31:59,199
they do these really nice posters

4337
02:31:56,639 --> 02:31:59,199
with um

4338
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:03,920
that

4339
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:05,599
include the terpenes as a full donut all

4340
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:07,040
divided up so you can immediately see

4341
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:08,840
the terpenes and the the different

4342
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:11,520
percentages that are

4343
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:12,799
um that are there and so you can quickly

4344
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:15,120
see okay it's a

4345
02:32:12,799 --> 02:32:17,679
you know mercy and dominant like beta

4346
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:19,439
karyophylline uh number two and then you

4347
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:21,359
can and then there's a line that shows

4348
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:22,720
all of the cannabinoids and it's a it's

4349
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:24,720
a really nice long panel it's got

4350
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:27,199
everything in there

4351
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:30,159
and then it's got also a intake picture

4352
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:32,800
of the flower and a

4353
02:32:30,159 --> 02:32:34,398
resource innovation score and a resource

4354
02:32:32,799 --> 02:32:36,318
innovation center started this power

4355
02:32:34,398 --> 02:32:39,760
tool that

4356
02:32:36,318 --> 02:32:42,799
basically gave a energy efficiency score

4357
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,600
to the to the operation to the farmer or

4358
02:32:42,799 --> 02:32:46,000
grow

4359
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:48,000
and then um it also had an aroma

4360
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,398
intensity score on that too

4361
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,398
and so you they there's a whole like

4362
02:32:50,398 --> 02:32:54,478
wall of our

4363
02:32:52,398 --> 02:32:56,478
hall of all these posters up and so you

4364
02:32:54,478 --> 02:32:58,398
can look and see all the type 1 and type

4365
02:32:56,478 --> 02:33:00,079
2 and type 3 and you can kind of see the

4366
02:32:58,398 --> 02:33:02,159
way the terpenes group and different

4367
02:33:00,079 --> 02:33:04,478
things and you can just get a lot of

4368
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:06,719
analytics like all laid out in front of

4369
02:33:04,478 --> 02:33:08,239
you all quick and then you get to hear

4370
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:10,239
about how the different varieties

4371
02:33:08,239 --> 02:33:12,239
affected the different uh people in the

4372
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:13,280
group and they have different

4373
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:14,799
um

4374
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:17,280
awards that are kind of interesting like

4375
02:33:14,799 --> 02:33:18,639
one would be the nose nose and so

4376
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:20,720
everyone that

4377
02:33:18,639 --> 02:33:23,279
said that they really liked the aroma of

4378
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:25,599
something uh also really liked the

4379
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:27,680
effect um and the one that was most

4380
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,120
consistent for that i got that one i

4381
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:30,960
think that was tropicana cookies or

4382
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:32,960
something um

4383
02:33:30,959 --> 02:33:34,318
and then uh there was you know there's

4384
02:33:32,959 --> 02:33:36,639
other things too like the most

4385
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:38,799
consistent cultivar so like if everyone

4386
02:33:36,639 --> 02:33:41,358
says yeah it made me sleepy and happy

4387
02:33:38,799 --> 02:33:42,559
and described like the same terms uh of

4388
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:43,920
the effects

4389
02:33:42,559 --> 02:33:45,119
then that would be really consistent

4390
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,639
where maybe something else like

4391
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:49,120
somebody's super energetic and somebody

4392
02:33:46,639 --> 02:33:50,719
got couch locked you know like um so

4393
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:52,720
there's a lot of different ways to look

4394
02:33:50,719 --> 02:33:55,760
at um

4395
02:33:52,719 --> 02:33:57,438
you know awards and and you know what is

4396
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:59,600
the best and what are we looking at and

4397
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:01,200
best for who and for what you know what

4398
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:02,559
was women's choice you know that's

4399
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:04,240
another category

4400
02:34:02,559 --> 02:34:07,119
um and these are all really useful

4401
02:34:04,239 --> 02:34:09,199
demographics uh for retail but also for

4402
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:11,200
medicine and and also for people just to

4403
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:12,960
kind of start to begin to know like

4404
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:14,720
where they want to start with a cannabis

4405
02:34:12,959 --> 02:34:16,639
variety if they're working with a

4406
02:34:14,719 --> 02:34:18,239
certain issue or

4407
02:34:16,639 --> 02:34:19,680
um

4408
02:34:18,239 --> 02:34:20,719
so i see

4409
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:24,239
that

4410
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:28,000
curating different um

4411
02:34:24,239 --> 02:34:31,520
science driven and also quality and uh

4412
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,280
experience driven um events like online

4413
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:35,040
could be really useful i've been having

4414
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:36,479
some fun ones with uh

4415
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:39,040
different ideas with

4416
02:34:36,478 --> 02:34:42,799
um yeah enjoying hash and different

4417
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:44,399
flowers and really diving into

4418
02:34:42,799 --> 02:34:46,879
both the science and then just the

4419
02:34:44,398 --> 02:34:48,959
gourmet aspects um putting that all

4420
02:34:46,879 --> 02:34:51,358
together i think there's a cool future

4421
02:34:48,959 --> 02:34:53,519
for it but uh it's gonna adapt and

4422
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:56,079
change this year

4423
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:58,159
yeah certainly and i mean you raise a

4424
02:34:56,079 --> 02:35:00,879
brilliant point there if someone was

4425
02:34:58,159 --> 02:35:04,000
just looking for not anything in

4426
02:35:00,879 --> 02:35:05,920
specific just good stuff in general what

4427
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,520
of your lines are you currently really

4428
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:09,439
vibing with that you would just

4429
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:10,880
recommend across the board people being

4430
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:12,559
like you'll be you'll be pretty happy

4431
02:35:10,879 --> 02:35:14,398
with this

4432
02:35:12,559 --> 02:35:15,760
yeah so that's i always have trouble

4433
02:35:14,398 --> 02:35:17,039
with that question normally when i work

4434
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:18,559
with someone it's like okay we're gonna

4435
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,399
sit down for four hours and we're gonna

4436
02:35:18,559 --> 02:35:22,318
run through your farm and we're gonna

4437
02:35:20,398 --> 02:35:24,159
work backwards on each thing and you

4438
02:35:22,318 --> 02:35:26,559
know i'm gonna

4439
02:35:24,159 --> 02:35:28,719
overwhelm you and then we're gonna work

4440
02:35:26,559 --> 02:35:31,279
it all out at the end um

4441
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:33,438
so no it's like for what you know uh no

4442
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:36,399
i don't but

4443
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:39,439
yeah um i mean for ice water for just

4444
02:35:36,398 --> 02:35:41,358
really beautiful flowers um

4445
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:43,120
yeah okay i'll just list them off let's

4446
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:43,920

02:47:20,159 --> 02:47:24,799
options to select for

4779
02:47:22,159 --> 02:47:27,600
oh god yeah oh yeah i go i went a little

4780
02:47:24,799 --> 02:47:29,278
crazy with it uh so

4781
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:31,120
next year i'm going to do a few less and

4782
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:32,399
do larger population groups but i just

4783
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:35,200
kind of wanted to see everything because

4784
02:47:32,398 --> 02:47:37,680
i'm so excited but yeah no i think it's

4785
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:40,159
great i love it i love all the info

4786
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:41,600
um so i think that brings us to our

4787
02:47:40,159 --> 02:47:44,079
quickfire questions which i've been

4788
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:46,640
excited to get to because i i feel like

4789
02:47:44,079 --> 02:47:48,398
these have just gotten better over time

4790
02:47:46,639 --> 02:47:49,760
so my first question

4791
02:47:48,398 --> 02:47:51,760
for you is

4792
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:54,800
what's the most memorable cannabis

4793
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:58,318
you've ever smoked in your life

4794
02:47:54,799 --> 02:48:00,719
or it could be could be hash either

4795
02:47:58,318 --> 02:48:00,719
um

4796
02:48:01,359 --> 02:48:05,200
well actually i kind of mentioned a few

4797
02:48:03,439 --> 02:48:07,920
of them

4798
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:09,600
already um

4799
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:11,680
so the crackhead

4800
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:13,600
that i mentioned back when i was in high

4801
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:17,840
school [ __ ] that still think of that

4802
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:19,680
smell it had this like musty mango a

4803
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:21,760
little bit of that cat piss like linger

4804
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:23,200
in the air and just like and just the

4805
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:24,800
second you smelled it you were already

4806
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:27,600
stimulated in the brain

4807
02:48:24,799 --> 02:48:31,119
um so super yeah memorable yeah i'll

4808
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:33,359
never forget that that aroma and effect

4809
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:35,520
um and yeah it was just such a shared

4810
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:37,439
experience like all the friends just

4811
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:38,880
like oh my god like

4812

golden indica that i mentioned too which

4817
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:51,439

4818
02:48:50,239 --> 02:48:53,039
getting a purple variety and which i

4819
02:48:51,439 --> 02:48:54,559
just called purple indica and like that

4820
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:57,520

4821
02:48:54,559 --> 02:49:01,039
thick beautiful earth cushy but with

4822
02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:03,200
cotton candy and i can just think of

4823

4826
02:49:06,398 --> 02:49:10,318
backpack and that cotton candy smell in

4827
02:49:08,639 --> 02:49:11,519
the air when it's all fresh and gooey

4828
02:49:10,318 --> 02:49:14,079
and

4829
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:17,359

4837
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,879
garden to grease it was one of my

4838
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:37,279
favorite

4839
02:49:34,879 --> 02:49:39,839
experiences of this year and

4840
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:43,600
honestly like the first time uh

4841
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:45,600
hitting actually the athena sour kush um

4842
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:47,520
the first time adam washed the fresh

4843
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:49,760
frozen of that simply adam

4844
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:52,560
um

4845
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:54,639
that was uh yeah

4846
02:49:52,559 --> 02:49:56,398
it was like

4847
02:49:54,639 --> 02:49:58,639
feeling like you won the universe and

4848
02:49:56,398 --> 02:50:00,478
got kicked in the face with like a lemon

4849
02:49:58,639 --> 02:50:02,879
golden boot at the same time it was just

4850
02:50:00,478 --> 02:50:05,119
like i don't know it was just so good

4851
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:08,079
just pepper and earth and butter and

4852
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:10,319
lemon and just insane potency and then

4853
02:50:08,079 --> 02:50:11,680
the cleanliness and of his wash it was

4854
02:50:10,318 --> 02:50:13,920
just like

4855
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:16,720
uh it just didn't even look possible how

4856
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:18,719
clean it was like in the way it melted

4857
02:50:16,719 --> 02:50:21,519
uh it's still like yeah

4858
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:23,438
surreal that it because that was like it

4859
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:25,520
was still like that's bubble hash like

4860
02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:27,120
that's possible you know it was at that

4861
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:28,000
time too so

4862
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:29,920
um

4863
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:31,439
that one still sticks out to me it was

4864
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:33,439
really cool is actually that was like

4865
02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:34,639
really expensive at the emerald cup one

4866
02:50:33,439 --> 02:50:36,479
year and

4867
02:50:34,639 --> 02:50:38,559
um maybe the most expensive out of

4868
02:50:36,478 --> 02:50:41,358
anything and it's sold out so quickly

4869
02:50:38,559 --> 02:50:42,799
and i remember one person like had wrote

4870
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:44,479
a um

4871
02:50:42,799 --> 02:50:47,039
uh

4872
02:50:44,478 --> 02:50:48,639
a post about how they went to that i was

4873
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:50,319
tagged in they went to the emerald cup

4874
02:50:48,639 --> 02:50:51,199
on their birthday like drove nine hours

4875
02:50:50,318 --> 02:50:53,278
to

4876
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:55,520
uh on my birthday to go buy the most

4877
02:50:53,279 --> 02:50:56,880
expensive hash i've ever seen or like

4878
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:58,880
the most expensive hashtag i ever had

4879
02:50:56,879 --> 02:51:00,799
and then drove nine hours back home and

4880
02:50:58,879 --> 02:51:03,679
then like tasted it and he was like best

4881
02:51:00,799 --> 02:51:05,679
birthday ever like and then two years

4882
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:07,439
later he made another post where he

4883
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:09,040
pulled he'd bought two

4884
02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:11,920
and he pulled the other one out of the

4885
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:14,000
fridge like and uh

4886
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:18,960
and it had cured it just looked unreal

4887
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:20,398
just the golden jewel of uh just perfect

4888
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:22,000
cure of

4889
02:51:20,398 --> 02:51:25,039
yeah i mean it was just it was such a

4890
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:27,279
pure um

4891
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:29,040
pure expression of what what trichomes

4892
02:51:27,279 --> 02:51:31,680
can be when you separate them perfectly

4893
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:34,800
i mean what adam did with that was art

4894
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:36,239
um and the way it was grown too but

4895
02:51:34,799 --> 02:51:38,000
uh yeah so it's really cool to see him

4896
02:51:36,239 --> 02:51:40,559
like pulling that out two years later

4897
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:42,318
like like a fine bottle of wine and you

4898
02:51:40,559 --> 02:51:43,920
know that's how it is it's like and it

4899
02:51:42,318 --> 02:51:45,519
was like at that time it was like damn

4900
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:47,680
i'd buy that back for you for like three

4901
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:50,239
times as much right now because that's

4902
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:52,159
special you know so yeah

4903
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:54,639
well there you go that all sounds

4904
02:51:52,159 --> 02:51:57,039
phenomenal i guess on the other end of

4905
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:58,799
the spectrum what's a strain in which

4906
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:00,560
everyone else was really into it and so

4907
02:51:58,799 --> 02:52:01,840
you were like looking forward to it and

4908
02:52:00,559 --> 02:52:04,799
then when you tried it you were like

4909
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:06,719
this doesn't really do it for me

4910
02:52:04,799 --> 02:52:08,559
you know actually i mean i i like the

4911
02:52:06,719 --> 02:52:10,559
flavor profiles of most the popular

4912
02:52:08,559 --> 02:52:12,239
varieties and stuff um you know i like

4913
02:52:10,559 --> 02:52:14,398
the candies i like the gas though i mean

4914
02:52:12,239 --> 02:52:16,559
those those um you know cookies and

4915
02:52:14,398 --> 02:52:18,000
skittles and og i like all those flavor

4916
02:52:16,559 --> 02:52:20,239
profiles are great

4917
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,239
uh

4918
02:52:20,478 --> 02:52:22,799
i mean

4919
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:25,120
but it also really depends how it's

4920
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:27,679
grown i mean cookies can be so terrible

4921
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:30,160
like in cardboard and dance and and

4922
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:30,880
skittles is a weak plant you know it's

4923
02:52:30,159 --> 02:52:32,959
like

4924
02:52:30,879 --> 02:52:34,398
you know it's not always super exciting

4925
02:52:32,959 --> 02:52:36,559
to grow but when you get it going in

4926
02:52:34,398 --> 02:52:38,000
living soil really good it looks good i

4927
02:52:36,559 --> 02:52:40,079
have it crossed with the black dog right

4928
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:41,600
now some z dog that like actually right

4929
02:52:40,079 --> 02:52:43,840
right behind me if you look in the thing

4930
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:46,000
and yeah yeah so healthy and well

4931
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:46,639
structured and beautiful and so i don't

4932
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:49,200
know

4933
02:52:46,639 --> 02:52:51,039
excited to see um

4934
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:52,640
yeah i mean what what happens from that

4935
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:53,680
because i love that flavor profile but

4936
02:52:52,639 --> 02:52:55,599
um

4937
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:58,079
yeah i think certain things could be

4938
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:59,920
better about the plant um but i also

4939
02:52:58,079 --> 02:53:02,318
think a lot of these clone varieties do

4940
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:04,960
get viruses over time i'm pretty darn

4941
02:53:02,318 --> 02:53:05,760
sure of that that the hoplaton virus is

4942
02:53:04,959 --> 02:53:08,159
pretty

4943
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:09,680
prolific and people like you know

4944
02:53:08,159 --> 02:53:11,760
cut from one plant then they cut to the

4945
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:13,279
next plant and um you know don't really

4946
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:15,359
have protocol like

4947
02:53:13,279 --> 02:53:16,640
um you know even like you probably

4948
02:53:15,359 --> 02:53:18,318
should be using bleach in between

4949
02:53:16,639 --> 02:53:20,559
everything and um

4950
02:53:18,318 --> 02:53:22,559
you know keeping your clones clean and

4951
02:53:20,559 --> 02:53:23,920
knowing your source and all that kind of

4952
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:25,359
stuff

4953
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:26,559
but you know so some of those things

4954
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:28,720
that you know that's where tissue

4955
02:53:26,559 --> 02:53:30,398
culture makes sense but it's expensive

4956
02:53:28,719 --> 02:53:31,840
and it takes a lot of time so you want

4957
02:53:30,398 --> 02:53:34,719
to do that with those

4958
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:35,920
flavors that are really worth preserving

4959
02:53:34,719 --> 02:53:37,599
um

4960
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:39,040
i don't know yeah i mean if a lot of

4961
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:42,318
people like a flavor i probably like it

4962
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:44,560
too as long as it was grown well um

4963
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:47,119
so like if if there was something like

4964
02:53:44,559 --> 02:53:48,799
that i'd probably blame it on the

4965
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:51,040
the grower first you know if everyone

4966
02:53:48,799 --> 02:53:52,398
liked the certain flavor but you know

4967
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:54,800
everyone has the things that they like

4968
02:53:52,398 --> 02:53:56,079
more too and it's like um you know i'm

4969
02:53:54,799 --> 02:53:58,559
not super

4970
02:53:56,079 --> 02:54:02,079
i'm not smoking hazes on a regular basis

4971
02:53:58,559 --> 02:54:03,920
but i i appreciate their quality um

4972
02:54:02,079 --> 02:54:05,840
a lot you know and i

4973
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:08,079
enjoy that i love celebrating all the

4974
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:10,719
variety but certain things that you know

4975
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:12,639
click with other people more and uh

4976
02:54:10,719 --> 02:54:15,920
and a lot of times like what i find

4977
02:54:12,639 --> 02:54:17,599
myself smoking a lot will be um

4978
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:19,279
the

4979
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:20,960
well i really like the complex and

4980
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:22,800
savory flavors that where it's like

4981
02:54:20,959 --> 02:54:24,239
you're getting a meal um and you get

4982
02:54:22,799 --> 02:54:25,599
that with like

4983
02:54:24,239 --> 02:54:26,799
some of the athena's and the banana

4984
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:28,399
crosses and the black dog crusts

4985
02:54:26,799 --> 02:54:29,278
sometimes um

4986
02:54:28,398 --> 02:54:31,119
but

4987
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:31,840
like the voltron and stuff too where you

4988
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:34,399
get

4989
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:36,719
butter and dough with lemon and pepper

4990
02:54:34,398 --> 02:54:38,719
and stuff i like those a lot but i want

4991
02:54:36,719 --> 02:54:40,879
i want gas and i want citrus and i want

4992
02:54:38,719 --> 02:54:43,039
candy um

4993
02:54:40,879 --> 02:54:44,559
as well because those are like

4994
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:46,000
really addictive through the day you

4995
02:54:44,559 --> 02:54:47,519
know it's like there's a certain like

4996
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:49,279
you take a quick snapper and it like the

4997
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:50,079
way it hits your tongue and it just sits

4998
02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:52,399
there

4999
02:54:50,079 --> 02:54:54,079
um you know the first time you hit

5000
02:54:52,398 --> 02:54:56,398
oh i remember you know first time

5001
02:54:54,079 --> 02:54:58,000
hitting og and be like okay yeah i like

5002
02:54:56,398 --> 02:54:59,439
that like

5003
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,840
might as well cross that in with a lot

5004
02:54:59,439 --> 02:55:02,639
of things

5005
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:04,559
um

5006
02:55:02,639 --> 02:55:06,000
because like yeah and also like if

5007
02:55:04,559 --> 02:55:08,318
you're you know spliff smokers two

5008
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,719
certain things um stand above the

5009
02:55:08,318 --> 02:55:12,959
tobacco and work really well and also

5010
02:55:10,719 --> 02:55:14,159
like you know become the flavor that you

5011
02:55:12,959 --> 02:55:16,318
want

5012
02:55:14,159 --> 02:55:18,559
to sing over something and to be on your

5013
02:55:16,318 --> 02:55:20,318
tongue and um and you keep reaching for

5014
02:55:18,559 --> 02:55:22,318
it and it's always interesting to see

5015
02:55:20,318 --> 02:55:23,519
like what jar like just

5016
02:55:22,318 --> 02:55:26,398
goes

5017
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:27,920
first you know and you know it might not

5018
02:55:26,398 --> 02:55:29,920
yeah there's a certain certain flavor

5019
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:31,200
profiles where it might be something

5020
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:32,879
that's like oh this is so good and i

5021
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:34,319
like it so much but you don't want it

5022
02:55:32,879 --> 02:55:36,159
all the time and other ones you're just

5023
02:55:34,318 --> 02:55:37,039
like i want to smoke this all day

5024
02:55:36,159 --> 02:55:40,000
um

5025
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:41,439
yeah it's all different

5026
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:43,359
so are there well how about you are

5027
02:55:41,439 --> 02:55:45,040
there any that stood out for you or

5028
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:47,200
you're like excited about trying

5029
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:51,920
something and then didn't like it

5030
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:54,000
yeah good question i think that

5031
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:56,398
gosh that i guess

5032
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:59,359
i think that i've had some ogs that were

5033
02:55:56,398 --> 02:56:01,119
so good that it made others seem not as

5034
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:03,120
impressive and

5035
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:04,319
um so yeah i think that's interesting

5036
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:05,840
yeah because i think the most memorable

5037
02:56:04,318 --> 02:56:09,119
weed i've ever had in my life was just

5038
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:10,639
this random og i got one time and um

5039
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:13,279
yeah i don't think i'll ever find out

5040
02:56:10,639 --> 02:56:14,799
what cut it was sadly it was just really

5041
02:56:13,279 --> 02:56:16,800
special

5042
02:56:14,799 --> 02:56:18,318
nice well yeah i mean like i was saying

5043
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:21,119
earlier too it was just like we had a

5044
02:56:18,318 --> 02:56:24,239
lot of cuts of og but so many of them

5045
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:25,279
are so similar uh and i just honestly

5046
02:56:24,239 --> 02:56:26,879
like

5047
02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:28,319
but it was the practices that really

5048
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:31,278
mattered because it's it's powdery

5049
02:56:28,318 --> 02:56:32,879
mildew susceptible and like like and so

5050
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:34,800
like the people really knew how to grow

5051
02:56:32,879 --> 02:56:37,438
og and make them work in the depths and

5052
02:56:34,799 --> 02:56:39,519
like knew the timing and the trellis and

5053
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:41,840
like and you know what they needed for

5054
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:43,439
their health and stuff like

5055
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:45,359
it's just it's just night and day

5056
02:56:43,439 --> 02:56:46,800
because it's a lot of people [ __ ] up you

5057
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:48,880
know could [ __ ] up og and you'd still

5058
02:56:46,799 --> 02:56:50,000
get that gas like singing over and they

5059
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:52,799
could still

5060
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,879
you know sell it okay you know if it as

5061
02:56:52,799 --> 02:56:56,239
long as it had that gas smell or flavor

5062
02:56:54,879 --> 02:56:57,438
but it would be like dang dude that

5063
02:56:56,239 --> 02:56:59,680
looks a little

5064
02:56:57,439 --> 02:57:00,559
small and discolored and little pm and

5065
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:02,079
like

5066
02:57:00,559 --> 02:57:03,519
actually i'd like to see a little pm on

5067
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:04,799
og because

5068
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:08,319
at least you know they didn't use

5069
02:57:04,799 --> 02:57:09,840
microbutal on it

5070
02:57:08,318 --> 02:57:11,119
yeah that's a good one i like that i

5071
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:13,200
like that

5072
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:14,960
first of all if you had to go live on a

5073
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:16,800
desert island and you can only take

5074
02:57:14,959 --> 02:57:20,199
three strains with you what three are

5075
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:20,199
you gonna take

5076
02:57:22,079 --> 02:57:27,920
oh man

5077
02:57:24,879 --> 02:57:27,920
really good og cut

5078
02:57:30,398 --> 02:57:36,519
cherry lime dog and um

5079
02:57:33,279 --> 02:57:36,520
it probably

5080
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:42,000
yeah uh i would

5081
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:45,359
i would take one of the either canada

5082
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:47,359
dog or sapphire sue selections um for

5083
02:57:45,359 --> 02:57:49,120
like a nice two to one that has tons of

5084
02:57:47,359 --> 02:57:51,200
flavor

5085
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:53,359
lovely that's a nice little well-rounded

5086
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:55,840
pick there so the next question which i

5087
02:57:53,359 --> 02:57:57,920
i really enjoy is opposite end

5088
02:57:55,840 --> 02:57:59,680
someone who you're not particularly fond

5089
02:57:57,920 --> 02:58:01,680
of you've got to drop them off on an

5090
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:02,960
island and leave them with three strains

5091
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:05,840
what three strains you're gonna leave

5092
02:58:02,959 --> 02:58:05,839
them with

5093
02:58:08,239 --> 02:58:10,959
the same

5094
02:58:09,439 --> 02:58:13,279
because they need to admit

5095
02:58:10,959 --> 02:58:15,119
[Music]

5096
02:58:13,279 --> 02:58:15,600
yeah they need all the help they can get

5097
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:16,960
so

5098
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,800
[Music]

5099
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:20,719
i love that that's a very diplomatic

5100
02:58:18,799 --> 02:58:23,039
answer i respect that maybe black dog

5101
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:24,239
too because it's good for yeah

5102
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:27,359
you know getting their mind in the right

5103
02:58:24,239 --> 02:58:29,119
place yeah it makes people cooler

5104
02:58:27,359 --> 02:58:31,040
um so what's your prediction for the

5105
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:34,079
next big flavor to take the scene by

5106
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:36,880
storm cherry lime dog

5107
02:58:34,079 --> 02:58:38,478
for sure i love it confident

5108
02:58:36,879 --> 02:58:40,239
alrighty so

5109
02:58:38,478 --> 02:58:41,679
it brings us to our last question and

5110
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:43,439
i'm really interested to know what it's

5111
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:46,318
going to be for you if you could go

5112
02:58:43,439 --> 02:58:48,639
anywhere in around the world any time in

5113
02:58:46,318 --> 02:58:50,559
history to presumably collect seeds or

5114
02:58:48,639 --> 02:58:53,358
clones where would you go and what would

5115
02:58:50,559 --> 02:58:53,359
you be trying to grab

5116
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:57,200
um

5117
02:58:55,279 --> 02:58:58,800
oh any any time

5118
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:01,279
yeah [ __ ]

5119
02:58:58,799 --> 02:59:04,879
i go run around with with deep hockey

5120
02:59:01,279 --> 02:59:06,000
rosin from just last year

5121
02:59:04,879 --> 02:59:07,679
looks like he

5122
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,520
a lot a lot of cool pictures from his

5123
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:15,318
trip

5124
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:15,319
yeah um i agree but you know yeah huh

5125
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:19,279
who would be i also would be interested

5126
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:20,639
to just

5127
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:23,120
be in

5128
02:59:20,639 --> 02:59:26,478
you know humble or santa cruz

5129
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:28,880
um at the moment when like the first

5130
02:59:26,478 --> 02:59:31,199
hybrids were kind of happening between

5131
02:59:28,879 --> 02:59:33,599
you know something like a mazar or

5132
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:34,960
afghani with um some of the stuff that

5133
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:36,640
was coming from

5134
02:59:34,959 --> 02:59:37,438
south america

5135
02:59:36,639 --> 02:59:38,478
um

5136
02:59:37,439 --> 02:59:40,639
yeah just

5137
02:59:38,478 --> 02:59:42,559
it would be interesting to to be a fly

5138
02:59:40,639 --> 02:59:44,239
on the wall those those couple years and

5139
02:59:42,559 --> 02:59:46,959
see what actually

5140
02:59:44,239 --> 02:59:48,639
what did take place between uh that

5141
02:59:46,959 --> 02:59:50,959
beginning because a lot happened from

5142
02:59:48,639 --> 02:59:53,680
that moment

5143
02:59:50,959 --> 02:59:57,438
yeah it's a combination of surfers and

5144
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:58,398
back to the landers and you know

5145
02:59:57,439 --> 03:00:01,439
um

5146
02:59:58,398 --> 03:00:04,398
yeah both people

5147
03:00:01,439 --> 03:00:06,479
who whether vets or peace activists

5148
03:00:04,398 --> 03:00:08,000
avoiding the war or

5149
03:00:06,478 --> 03:00:09,278
trying to get out of you know just

5150
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:11,359
trying to get back to the land and

5151
03:00:09,279 --> 03:00:13,120
relate to growing their own food and

5152
03:00:11,359 --> 03:00:14,880
connection

5153
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:16,720
with nature and

5154
03:00:14,879 --> 03:00:18,559
and uh and then also the surfers

5155
03:00:16,719 --> 03:00:20,398
traveling around and bringing stuff back

5156
03:00:18,559 --> 03:00:22,398
and like that where those kinds of

5157
03:00:20,398 --> 03:00:23,760
things met uh

5158
03:00:22,398 --> 03:00:25,199
yeah i think something really special

5159
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:27,359
came from that so it would be

5160
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:30,000
interesting to see those those first

5161
03:00:27,359 --> 03:00:32,239
those first hybrids who did them and

5162
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:35,279
what happened

5163
03:00:32,239 --> 03:00:36,799
yeah i can certainly get behind that so

5164
03:00:35,279 --> 03:00:38,560
just from you know being being

5165
03:00:36,799 --> 03:00:40,079
california you know northern california

5166
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:42,079
based growing up in santa cruz hills

5167
03:00:40,079 --> 03:00:43,520
that's an interest to me but

5168
03:00:42,079 --> 03:00:45,279
i'm sure there's a lot of better answers

5169
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:48,239
too

5170
03:00:45,279 --> 03:00:50,079
but i would love to see so much

5171
03:00:48,239 --> 03:00:53,039
no it's a brilliant one

5172
03:00:50,079 --> 03:00:54,559
and uh so with that in mind i think that

5173
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:56,479
just about brings us to the end of

5174
03:00:54,559 --> 03:00:59,199
things did you have any comments or

5175

composting uh

5251
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:48,639

this this incredible reference book

5253
03:03:48,639 --> 03:03:52,719
about organic um

5254
03:03:50,959 --> 03:03:55,679
cultivation and they turned it into a

5255
03:03:52,719 --> 03:03:58,159
comic book and it's like a super cool

5256

03:04:04,318 --> 03:04:08,639
what's happening with living soil and

5260
03:04:06,478 --> 03:04:11,760
the relationships between

5261
03:04:08,639 --> 03:04:13,278
plant roots and the environment and um

5262
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:15,520
and then goes into all these different

5263
03:04:13,279 --> 03:04:18,000
practices like yeah fermentation and

5264
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:20,239
biodynamics and natural farming and

5265
