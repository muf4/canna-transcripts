84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,159
um mainly so we um

85
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,079

gelato with us and things like this and

88
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:48,000
a few different moroccan hashes to show

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,280
the farmers there and that so

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,719
um yeah but the the charis

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,400
up up in that like altitude and smoking

92
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,479
from the chillin

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
um yeah it's a

94
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,878
total different height really really

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,319
um

96
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,598
enjoyable

97
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,479
um

98
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,000
like

99
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,000
everybody's sort of like you're smoking

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
the chilling and everybody's talking

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,959
there's like a really nice energy from

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
the from smoking the hash as well

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
yeah beautiful

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
so do you feel like it's it's almost

105
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,120
kind of like more satiri like it kind of

106
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,840
sounds like you're saying like it's kind

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,478
of social and energetic

108
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,679
well this is the thing right like

109
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:32,399
yes okay the more fresher stuff seems to

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,199
be like more energetic but anything

111
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,159
that's been cured for a while especially

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,759
the previous year's charis that they've

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,280
cured

114
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,439
yeah when i was smoking that i i

115
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,679
couldn't help but just fall to sleep

116
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,918
like so one day i think i had two naps

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,439
after smoking it so

118
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:54,159
it was that that stuff was super strong

119
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,680
so i think it depends on the curing

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,080
process a lot and even from field to

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,959
field and farmer to farmer there was a

122
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,800
difference in in um

123
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,079
the

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
the

125
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,758
heirloom varieties that they were

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
cultivating there

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,160
so

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
yeah there was definitely a different so

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
um

130
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,719
depending on who you got the hash from

131
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,959
um

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
there would be a difference in height

133
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,359
and flavor how it smoked how it burnt

134
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,159
everything so

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,319
yeah and were they all growing alien

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,759
varieties or did you see like some kind

137
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,759
of random stuff in the mix

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,199
no i didn't notice any sort of modern

139
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,198
hybrids um

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,520
maybe like in

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,439
closer to the cities and stuff like that

142
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,120
maybe you'd see

143
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,160
more things like this speaking to other

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
people

145
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
they seem some stuff like that but

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,199
right up where we were going

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
it was just all stuff that

148
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,080
they've been

149
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,959
farming for yeah generations really

150
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,079
um

151
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,680
the smells really unusual in some fields

152
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,120
um but you have this underlining

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
um

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,038
standard smell

155
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,680
that you found a lot everywhere

156
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,439
but then you had variations from that

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,600
and then the odd unique one when you got

158
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,279
to the fields and could really go into

159
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
the fields

160
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,879
and what was that standard smell kind of

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
like

162
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,560
like a spice

163
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,279
um

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,038
maybe slight aniseed smell

165
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,918
um and

166
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,399
a slight berry smell they were the main

167
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,680
ones and like in the fields you were

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,799
finding

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,879
i'd say about 20 were purple

170
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,520
and the purple ones had a slight more

171
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,918
berry smell but even some of them still

172
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,519
had that spicy underlying spicy smell

173
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,680
going on

174
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,799
but the most unique ones

175
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,038
were the one that smelt like watermelon

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,680
yeah but watermelon sweets

177
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,240
okay but it was just one plant

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,280
just one plant out of the whole field it

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,000
was just really really strange and then

180
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,598
i found one that was straight grapefruit

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,519
pomelo

182
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,199
and i just kept trying to look for more

183
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,639
of it there was only that one plant i

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,280
could find

185
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,360
and we're talking like out of a field of

186
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,719
thousands of thousands so i was just

187
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,560
going around but the

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,400
the dominant smell was the spice smell

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
spice berries i think that's the best

190
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,239
way to describe it like raisins raisins

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
there you go

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,038
like raisins

193
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,560
yeah okay and so

194
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,800
were you looking to collect seeds and

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,598
were you successful

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,038
yeah

197
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,038
yeah so

198
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,399
i collected like i've labeled them as

199
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,079
like what they smelled like mainly um

200
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,038
um because that's what i was trying to

201
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,079
find

202
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,800
um

203
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,478
the growth and other things i i'd broke

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
down but the main things for me were

205
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:58,719
like

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
there was one that smelt like vic's

207
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
vapour rub

208
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
um there was one that's more like the

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,478
grapefruit

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,918
then i did a selection for

211
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,878
purple types

212
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,639
um

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,120
purple calyx

214
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,199
purple leaf um

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
ones for red stems

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,120
um

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,960
and a few other ones that were like

218
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
green varieties

219
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,758
but with that typical sort of spiced

220
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,840
smell that the usual ones um but like

221
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
you could see a big difference even even

222
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,000
in the growth of the plants as you were

223
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
going up much much higher

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,679
like when you're going from

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,599
like a thousand

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
uh

227
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
feet

228
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,799
higher up and then you took another 500

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
and like you were seeing a big

230
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,838
difference in the growth

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,920
you know things were getting smaller as

232
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,519
you were getting a higher up

233
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,159
okay so kind of becoming like more squat

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,480
not squat as such but smaller in in in

235
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,919
structure in in height and stuff like

236
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,560
that yeah yeah

237
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,039
um but they they weren't

238
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,838
um like anything like an indica even

239
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,480
though they're a hash plan

240
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,600
um

241
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
but then

242
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,639
once i've seen the seeds being grown out

243
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,278
back

244
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,159
here they look more indica

245
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,919
okay

246
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,439
so i think

247
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,799
um

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,399
the way that they grow the plants so

249
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,479
close together

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,159
and when they're in full flower the

251
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,480
leaves tend to go a little bit more

252
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,879
thinner and i see this outdoors anyway

253
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,120
you can grow the same thing indoors and

254
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,559
outdoors and you see the more

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,399
true true growth pattern of it outdoors

256
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,639
so if i grow say orange soda inside

257
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,799
it doesn't have super thin leaves but

258
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,080
then when you grow it outside the leaves

259
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,519
always come out

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
thinner and you can see it's a real

261
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,720
sativa and it looks like a sativa like

262
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,120
that christmas tree type of structure

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,600
the growth conditions and how they farm

264
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,120
them and all of this really yeah plays a

265
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,879
big role on how the plant looks as well

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,959
what was the highest you went up to

267
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,919
eventually

268
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,159
uh

269
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,078
two and a half thousand i think that's

270
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,000
what we went up to

271
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,759
i'd have to double check on my notes and

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,159
stuff like that because where as we were

273
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,240
going up i was you know writing down the

274
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,159
altitude and things like that at certain

275
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
points where getting the seeds and stuff

276
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,600
like this

277
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,838
that's that's the good thing about these

278
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,278
um smartphones one of my friends had a

279
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,959
smartphone so we could like just keep

280
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,559
checking everything where we were and

281
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,199
stuff like this it was really good we

282
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,439
can even dot it down on the gps if you

283
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,519
really wanted to you could

284
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,399
got the locations where you exactly

285
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,039
found them yeah yeah just dreams

286
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,039
that's sick

287
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
yeah okay so what's the end goal with

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,879
these landry seeds obviously probably do

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
a seed increase but what do you want to

290
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,120
work it into

291
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,078
yeah okay so um

292
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,320
the also while we were there the guy

293
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,439
from afghanistan he brought some afghan

294
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,399
seeds with him

295
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
okay

296
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,320
um no i don't know if you've checked his

297
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,159
page have you seen his page this uh

298
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,278
afghan kush black honey yeah boy

299
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,759
yeah okay he's got some amazing amazing

300
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,600
plants there so i've just been growing

301
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,559
some of those seeds out

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,639
and

303
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,119
i found a really nice mail and i've

304
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,399
pollinated it with the bubba kush

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,639
the cherry cookie the sour neo mandarina

306
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,078
so

307
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,078
that's what i'm going to be doing next

308
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,120
is

309
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,599
sorry

310
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,959
um testing them out

311
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,959
and seeing how they come out

312
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,278
um

313
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,039
and

314
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,639
working that afghan into some maybe some

315
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,719
other lines i'd like to do some

316
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,879
selections from the indian thing and

317
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,639
stuff i've collected

318
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,439
and worked the afghan into some of them

319
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,679
as well

320
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,519
so i think that's going to be

321
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,439
a lot of testing and

322
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,078
it's going to be really interesting yeah

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,720
just just learning always

324
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:04,319
this plant teaches me so much

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,200
this is like truly like a teacher plan

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
um

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
i've learned so much from it you know

328
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,959
from

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,879
electrics and photography and

330
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,719
growing plants nutrition everything you

331
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,559
can possibly imagine i think so many

332
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
people forget this

333
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,799
and just see the money nowadays

334
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,359
instead of like

335
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,240
having that real passion

336
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
to learn about this plant

337
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,000
yeah right well i mean the adventure you

338
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,838
described there's a lot of passion

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,759
involved in that but i just wanted to

340
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,839
quickly ask

341
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,838
like how do you feel having had these

342
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
kind of worldly experiences with

343
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,360
cannabis how does it make you perceive

344
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
just everyday cannabis now does it just

345
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,959
hammer home that feeling of like the

346
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,039
whole poly hybrid thing or is it just

347
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,319
refreshing

348
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,958
um

349
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
i still love poly hybrids but i think

350
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,958
when you're talking about real breeding

351
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,799
um

352
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,719
it's like

353
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,958
look at the scene nowadays it's like

354
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
loads of people trying to breed from

355
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,919
mongrel dogs

356
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,439
and

357
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,039
expecting

358
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
something

359
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,439
um

360
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,480
like coming out like totally stable and

361
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,600
when i say stable i i mean like coming

362
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,000
out uniform all looking exactly the same

363
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,240
yeah we've got like so much variation in

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,078
in our gene pool

365
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,759
um

366
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,278
which is a good thing as well but i

367
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,799
think we really do need to go back

368
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,879
towards these um

369
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,439
land race things and create maybe like a

370
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,399
new skunk number one or something like

371
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,800
this

372
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,000
so i'd like to definitely work with the

373
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,919
indica lines and then maybe one that

374
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,759
they've worked work those lines a little

375
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,799
bit more out into the city but to create

376
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,919
something

377
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,359
that's all totally from land race

378
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,879
um

379
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
and that

380
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,958
comes out like

381
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,040
a breeding line should come out but i

382
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,799
still love poly hybrids and i love the

383
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,958
variation and i love using all these

384
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,359
different things even cookies and

385
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,838
some cherry pie and things like this

386
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,039
they're all really nice unique

387
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,959
um terpene profiles so

388
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,039
yeah i think i love them all really to

389
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,919
be honest

390
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,759
yeah i agree but let's talk making the

391
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,360
new skunk i've tried to bring this up in

392
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,519
the past and no one wants to go there

393
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,000
with me we're doing it what genetics

394
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,120
would be involved in quote the new skunk

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,120
what do you think it's going to be

396
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,879
well from there was two ways i was

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,759
looking at it basically using two sativa

398
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,399
lines and then adding the afghan to it

399
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,278
um but now i'm looking towards more to

400
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,839
hash

401
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,320
line two hash plant lines so like a

402
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,600
milano hash plant and i've got a hash

403
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
plant

404
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,240
i'm working that line

405
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
and then adding the sativa to it

406
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,120
just to

407
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,440
add that

408
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,320
i don't know about that bigger structure

409
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
the the budge structure the uh

410
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
um

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,839
calyx to leaf ratio and things like this

412
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,120
so it could be interesting but this is

413
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,720
all going to be told like it's all going

414
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
to be experimental

415
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
at first

416
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
because

417
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,638
really don't know what the outcome is

418
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,319
going to be i might cross them together

419
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,079
and then just totally be like i really

420
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,278
don't like it i'm going to have to start

421
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,159
again

422
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,198
so

423
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,078
but it's all going to be really

424
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,000
interesting i think i'd either use

425
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,559
the afghan's got to go in there i think

426
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,799
that's that's a key main key to so many

427
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,758
things from the past

428
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,958
and then maybe some of the sativa i'd

429
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,680
use would be probably something from

430
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:41,599
south america

431
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:44,319
yeah like a walking type of thing

432
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,959
uh yeah like

433
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,720
something like a maybe acapulco gold

434
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,439
type of strain

435
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,278
does it exist anymore

436
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,680
does it exist

437
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,240
i think i think things could be found

438
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,078
from the areas and we could things can

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,240
be found in them i think it can be it

440
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,198
can be done the one thing i have got

441
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,440
from really old seeds are my malawi

442
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,278
seeds a friend collected from for me

443
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,680
from malawi

444
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,078
so that'd be another interesting one

445
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,758
african sativa

446
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,679
um

447
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,680
yeah again i i just really need a nice

448
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,679
big

449
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,919
greenhouse and

450
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,319
one two years to just grow out the

451
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,559
suitcase of seeds i've got of all the

452
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,839
different things

453
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,919
so that that's going to be the next plan

454
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,440
the next plan maybe caribbean the

455
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:42,559
caribbean is looking good at the moment

456
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,399
yeah okay cool cool so out of uh the

457
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,919
genetics we haven't spoken about you

458
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,360
know non-land race stuff what's some of

459
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,198
the new stuff you're excited to work

460
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,879
with

461
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,799
um

462
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,799
my some of the new things i'm working

463
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,639
with the sour neo is gonna be something

464
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,039
really special that's gonna be the next

465
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,879
sort of new release but from what i

466
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,000
released from

467
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,679
last year and that is the lil everyone's

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,199
really loving that and the cherry spice

469
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,079
um

470
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,160
they're just both absolutely amazing

471
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,399
cherry spice is probably my favorite

472
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,519
after the sour near

473
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,038
and the lil is just so unusual

474
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,558
but the little like people have been

475
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,000
asking a lot like what's in the lilt and

476
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,519
stuff like that

477
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,480
and the the father was a jungle kush

478
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,798
and the mother was a cross of

479
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
pineapple and something else

480
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,240
so

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,319
that come from sonic and that

482
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,798
and that's something i didn't mention

483
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,159
too much about in the last one actually

484
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,639
like you were asking about some of the

485
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,240
uk clones and stuff like that uk

486
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,080
pineapple was a real special uk clone

487
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,079
but after like so many years it lost

488
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,960
something it was like

489
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,279
um some sort of genetic drift happened

490
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,038
or something i think tissue culture

491
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,200
might have been able to bring that back

492
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,200
though so i've been looking into that a

493
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
lot lately

494
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,960
that's interesting have you heard of the

495
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,679
concept of like a plant being dotted

496
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
yes this is what sonic told me about no

497
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,200
i was that's where i said to him maybe

498
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,279
the tissue culture can help this out

499
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,240
because then if it's some sort of

500
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,918
illness that someone's got

501
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,120
in their plants

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,720
it it can be removed with tissue culture

503
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,079
so

504
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,160
i don't know if the dud-in thing can

505
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,720
happen i think he was telling me bodhi

506
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
was talking to him about it

507
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,240
yeah dude but he was the one who told me

508
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
about it it's like

509
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,558
it's you can look it up because so the

510
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,759
back story is that

511
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,240
a lab today uh or yesterday i think it

512
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,640
was put up a post saying that um

513
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,038
they've got like this patent-pending

514
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
process where it's basically you know

515
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,480
meristem culturing

516
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,879
but they reckon that yeah they can

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,200
definitely undo a plant that's dotted

518
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,679
and and what dotting is is like

519
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,558
there's this actual um i think it's a

520
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
bacteria might be a virus it's or even a

521
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,440
fungi i don't know i'll just cover all

522
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,360
my bases um it's it's one of them and

523
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,400
and the government like literally was

524
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,000
spraying it over california for a while

525
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,160
and if it gets in your plant it just

526
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,880
gets in the systemic system

527
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,279
and the plants just [ __ ] forever

528
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,360
and like they just won't really flower

529
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,119
they've got no vigor it's like an actual

530
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,199
virus you can look it up

531
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,879
so that's great you said that right

532
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
about the government right because there

533
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,720
was one show i can't remember the show

534
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,200
but there was talking about

535
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,679
the government releasing

536
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,360
broad mites or another type of mite up

537
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,400
next to the roads

538
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,399
so they

539
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,759
kill the weeds

540
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,640
and that that way they don't have to

541
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,839
spray pesticides that harm the bees

542
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
okay

543
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:56,240
yeah but they've been releasing these in

544
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,160
places where people grow weed in america

545
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,319
and then now all of a sudden they're

546
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,720
having big problems with broad mics and

547
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,319
stuff like and it just like

548
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,679
just seems like

549
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,519
it's just crazy that they would even

550
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,840
release them like that do you see what i

551
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,440
mean like you said

552
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,279
they definitely did it and what they

553
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,640
would also do is i think i read a little

554
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,798
bit about this and

555
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,360
they would go along every so often and

556
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,200
spray some pesticides on the mites like

557
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,879
to kind of fight them at bay and so they

558
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,679
just bred like the borg themselves

559
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,440
yeah yeah yeah yeah this is it

560
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,038
just resistant you see it you see it

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,400
like even in holland and places like

562
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,319
this where the mites

563
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,320
built a resistance to so many different

564
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,200
sprays

565
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,240
um

566
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,360
and yeah this is what what will happen

567
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,159
so

568
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,599
yeah

569
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,840
all right we better pull it back in

570
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,678
before we go to alex jones on this so

571
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,959
the lilt seems to be extremely popular

572
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
you know and you mentioned the unique

573
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,960
terpene profile how would you describe

574
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,440
the terpene profile and are you going to

575
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,319
kind of find a mail and work it forward

576
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,798
um

577
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,359
yeah well i'm going to definitely work

578
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,679
the line um but at the moment i'm

579
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,079
getting really high percentages of that

580
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,519
female so i'm i was really happy with

581
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,038
that release

582
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,240
um

583
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:15,279
and everybody seems to be getting

584
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,038
um from a 10 pack they'll be getting

585
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,558
at least

586
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,240
four of the finos like the mother

587
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,038
and the other things are maybe like a

588
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,798
slight water down virgin tropical thing

589
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,119
some people are finding like a slight

590
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,798
fruity tropical cushy thing

591
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,599
that one was really nice

592
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,079
i

593
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,678
found that one was almost better than

594
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,879
the actual mother because it had this

595
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,440
like cushy

596
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,640
with the tropical taste which was really

597
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
really nice

598
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,840
but the main flavor from

599
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,600
the lil is like

600
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,720
if you get a tropical juice which has

601
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,519
got passion flower and pineapple in it

602
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,679
that's the dominant smell that i smell

603
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,879
off the plant and while the plant is

604
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
growing

605
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
it's by far the smelliest planter that

606
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,158
you'll come across in your room

607
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,440
but in a sweet

608
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,400
gentle sort of not like a strong stinky

609
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,840
way it's such a beautiful smell i just

610
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,600
love going into the room literally just

611
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:18,558
smelling it it's just so unique

612
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,678
um and then when it comes out as a dried

613
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,359
bud

614
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,798
the smell is

615
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,639
um

616
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,519
less in your face and a little bit more

617
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,440
subtle but when you smoke it you're left

618
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,319
with this like tropical taste on the

619
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,320
tongue like a tropical juice sonic says

620
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,639
it's like tin tropical fruits that's how

621
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,439
he describes it and i describe it like a

622
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
tropical juice

623
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,759
interesting and so do you have any kind

624
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,798
of plans in the works with sonics or are

625
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,319
you guys just kind of trading clones

626
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,679
no yeah we're definitely going to be

627
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,798
doing um

628
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,120
more work together in the future um

629
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,519
and he's going to be definitely bringing

630
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,558
out more pineapple crosses

631
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,119
looking at the cali schnapple

632
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,119
um the purse sang so yeah there's going

633
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,719
to be a lot of sonic stuff coming out of

634
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,199
the next year

635
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,200
sweet and so do you plan to continue

636
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
working with the mandarina or is that

637
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,798
kind of doing its thing on the back

638
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
burner while you do some little and

639
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,519
other things

640
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,400
um yeah um

641
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,720
everything takes so much time and

642
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
space and stuff like this so

643
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,919
yeah sometimes you have to just put

644
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,440
something aside for the time being but

645
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,640
the mandarina

646
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,279
will be

647
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,960
the next slot will be a feminized cross

648
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,879
um to bring back like the orange soda

649
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,919
the gingerbread

650
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,440
um

651
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,720
what else was there the mandarina kush

652
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,240
and i think maybe i can imagine a lot of

653
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
them being grown out in morocco and

654
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,679
places like this

655
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
so because they they loved all the hash

656
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,400
coming from that

657
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,798
um

658
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,000
so yeah they're great for the hash

659
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,000
production and stuff like this

660
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,960
hell yeah

661
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,359
so

662
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,600
the jungle kush hybrids in general

663
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,199
appear to be going pretty well received

664
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,719
what's your overall impression of them

665
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,038
in retrospect like if you could only

666
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
kind of recommend one to me which one

667
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,480
would you recommend besides the little

668
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
obvious choice

669
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,798
cherry spice that would be the one i

670
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
should put a caveat and ruled that out

671
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,038
as well

672
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,720
okay something else um

673
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,640
what am i really liking i've already

674
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,519
said about the sauna i'll go into more

675
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,038
deal about the sauna and a sour neo

676
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,558
that's something really special um

677
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,200
okay so

678
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:42,798
that was made using

679
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,840
um hortylabs sour power

680
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,038
um

681
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,519
clone and the sour diesel

682
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,879
which was selected by karma from

683
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,440
rezdog's

684
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,000
uh ibl sour diesel oh that's the one

685
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,120
he's done that bx2 with

686
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,079
yes

687
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,959
so

688
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,558
um

689
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
at the time when we were working

690
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,399
together that's when those seeds were

691
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,839
made and they were like a little limited

692
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,038
release

693
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,759
um

694
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,200
so i did a selection from those seeds

695
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,519
but they were all coming out very like

696
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,679
sour but then there was one

697
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,038
very unique one

698
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,038
um

699
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,720
which had this like sour twang but it

700
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,720
smells like grapefruit slightly when

701
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
it's growing but then when it finishes

702
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
off

703
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,599
you can't really smell the grapefruit in

704
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,919
it anymore and it turns into this like

705
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,278
sour antiseptic smell

706
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,880
which is like

707
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,519
it's absolutely amazing that's what i'm

708
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,360
smoking some of the outdoor from last

709
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,119
year of this

710
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,678
and

711
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,079
that's probably my favorite

712
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,159
it's not the prettiest plant to look at

713
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,839
like structure wise

714
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,000
but the flavor

715
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,639
like is amazing

716
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,519
and the extract made from it's amazing

717
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
the high is so strong um

718
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,720
like you smoke a few joints of that in

719
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,399
the evening and you're having the best

720
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
sleep of your life

721
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,919
like um

722
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,840
yeah all round

723
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,759
uh great plant

724
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,720
um and i've crossed that with my jungle

725
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,960
cush

726
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,640
to make the sour neo

727
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,038
um so

728
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,120
that that's a a real special one the

729
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:20,480
jungle kush mail as well is

730
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,239
just not very dominant in the crosses

731
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,640
so you get

732
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,480
mainly the phenos from the mother side

733
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
of things so when i crossed it with a

734
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
passion

735
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,679
uh flower everything comes out like

736
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,278
smelling like that tropical passion

737
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,159
flower sort of smell

738
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,880
the

739
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,559
when i crossed it with the cherry cookie

740
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,278
everything comes out like that cherry

741
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,319
cookie type of thing so it's it's it's

742
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,679
it's a really good mail to use

743
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,079
um

744
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,759
like i i've used it to cross with a few

745
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:56,720
other things to make like um the

746
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:59,440
um this was like a so the first line was

747
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,839
rose water cookie that's what rihanna is

748
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,320
that was crossed with the jungle push to

749
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,720
make the hundred hand slap

750
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,038
and then a male from 100 hand slapped

751
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,319
was used to go back to the reaction back

752
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,519
cross

753
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,278
and um

754
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,519
that's that's that's like a new line

755
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,159
that i'm just releasing i've also got a

756
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,278
clone that i selected which is the rhian

757
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,440
clone

758
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,679
and that's been passed around as well so

759
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,320
you should see a lot more of that around

760
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,759
this this coming year

761
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,839
oh yeah and how would you describe the

762
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,000
profile on that

763
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,119
um

764
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,519
like

765
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,519
okay

766
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,079
some people say it's like the mac

767
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,038
but with a bit more terps okay

768
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,119
but

769
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,480
like how i would describe it is like

770
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,678
slight

771
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,200
berry

772
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,480
but with like this cookie thing in the

773
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,798
background

774
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,159
um but you can definitely taste that

775
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,918
there's like there's something like

776
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,360
almost cushion there

777
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,759
it's it's it's a it's a nice

778
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,158
um

779
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,720
nice but it's not dominant in any one

780
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,480
one thing like it's not just pure gas or

781
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,200
it's not just pure cush you can taste

782
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,000
all these different undernotes with it

783
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,679
um so yeah it's it's a great one and i

784
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,278
named that after my mother

785
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,360
because you just when you grow it in the

786
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,440
room it just it just stands out from

787
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,439
everything else the growth pattern on it

788
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,278
is a little bit more unusual

789
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,960
all the branches sort of all come up to

790
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,278
a set sort of

791
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,360
uh place and it stays

792
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,359
um doesn't branch outwards it doesn't

793
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,879
like to grow wide

794
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:41,359
quite a sort of slender type plant

795
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,679
very interesting and so

796
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,519
the question i always have to ask what

797
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,278
kind of techniques you're using to kind

798
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,278
of identify your breeding males

799
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,200
um

800
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,440
i think

801
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,640
one of the main things with i think

802
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,720
selecting the males especially over time

803
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,880
yeah because you've grown so many

804
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,038
different plants over the years like

805
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,278
i've probably got thousands of different

806
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,519
plants and different smells and

807
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,798
structures and stuff like so you get to

808
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,278
see so much

809
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,319
so i think a lot of it just comes from

810
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,480
past

811
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,439
um experience past knowledge um feeling

812
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,440
um

813
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,600
and then obviously after all of that the

814
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,798
stem rub the structure at the time what

815
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,959
i'm looking for if if i'm looking for a

816
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,200
short structure and i want to make

817
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,720
something with a short structure then

818
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,519
i'm going to select the male with that

819
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,159
more

820
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,038
shorter structure so like little simple

821
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,960
things like this

822
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,759
but i think um

823
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,720
genetically is one of the main things

824
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,019
i that the male has to have come

825
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
from

826
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:53,359
[Music]

827
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,240
um plants that the females are all very

828
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,000
stable and that they're all very similar

829
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,079
so then you know that the male is going

830
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,240
to be very similar to the females if

831
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,480
you're picking a male from a pack of

832
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,919
seeds that has got

833
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,360
so many different

834
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,159
variations and phenos um

835
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,599
then

836
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,360
it's going to be harder to select

837
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,558
especially a terpene profile from that

838
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,798
male

839
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,639
so i think a terpene profile is one of

840
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,319
my main things with my last lots of

841
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,278
breeding that i've been doing

842
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,759
so

843
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,519
i'm trying to get if it something is is

844
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,359
like little then i want them all to be

845
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,720
like little and smelling tropical if i

846
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,719
want uh

847
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,839
the cherry spice i want them all with

848
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,880
that cherry spiced gas sort of smell

849
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,720
so

850
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
that's the lines i sort of go down

851
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,360
yeah okay so how many seeds do you like

852
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,918
to pop when you're looking to find your

853
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,918
new mail

854
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,960
it varies um

855
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,079
so i i can select a male from

856
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,319
one one packet of seeds because i'm

857
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,480
usually picking a male from something

858
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,278
that i've created myself

859
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
so

860
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,038
i already know both parents that have

861
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,879
been grown out from

862
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,398
many generate like

863
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,679
yeah many years

864
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,719
and

865
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,559
um

866
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,558
i know those plants like like the back

867
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,240
of my hand i know how they've worked

868
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,440
previously so

869
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,120
um

870
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
when when

871
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,678
i'm using stuff it's normally stuff that

872
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,519
i've already made myself

873
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,679
so i think that that's that's a big

874
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,679
thing

875
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,759
so

876
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,360
what about if you're going to use

877
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,839
someone else's stock how many packs

878
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,359
would you want to

879
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,558
grab well at least a couple of packets

880
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:39,839
but then if i'm not finding really good

881
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,839
um females from one packet

882
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,158
do i really want to use a male from that

883
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,480
packet to see what i'm saying

884
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,559
but obviously as if you're gonna do a

885
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,640
nice selection i'd be like 30 plants

886
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,319
to do a nice selection

887
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,960
okay and then as like a bit of a

888
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,278
follow-up to that how many seeds of each

889
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,919
strain if you had to guess would you say

890
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,919
generally get pop before you would say

891
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,320
australian is ready for market

892
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,840
okay yeah once once

893
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,240
i've i've grown it out and two or three

894
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,199
friends have said they really like it

895
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,200
then

896
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,558
that's that's like

897
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
ready to go

898
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,278
um

899
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,839
like the

900
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,398
last ones all them were really just

901
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,359
tested by me and one friend

902
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,359
um

903
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,798
the previous ones they were done by a

904
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,000
lot more people

905
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,240
um but i'm finding when i do actually

906
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,640
ask people to test things some people

907
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,038
can be quite slow so i'm literally just

908
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,320
quicker to test things myself

909
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,798
um

910
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,558
so as long as i'm getting

911
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,000
i test a couple of packets and i'm

912
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,200
getting really nice things from a couple

913
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,079
of packets

914
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,440
um

915
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,960
i'm happy with that but then

916
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,960
when i want to start writing down

917
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,038
percentages of phenotypes and stuff like

918
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,159
that that's only going to come with

919
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,119
more time

920
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,240
um

921
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,639
i'm really limited by space to be honest

922
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,640
um otherwise i would like to be

923
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,799
starting a lot more seeds yeah

924
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,080
you raise a really interesting point

925
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,240
there because

926
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:17,199
a lot of breeders seem to be doing

927
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,919
pretty much exclusively in-house testing

928
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,919
much to the same reason you gave that

929
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,799
testers are kind of inconsistent these

930
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,399
days

931
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,158
how do you feel about the idea that you

932
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,158
know a lot of packs that get sent out to

933
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,640
be tested just end up being added to

934
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
someone's seed bank

935
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
yeah um

936
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,918
i'm not going to say how much how much

937
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,120
i've sent out of like test seats and

938
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,840
free seats but we're talking like a lot

939
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,439
a lot a lot and a small fraction of the

940
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,759
percentage actually get grown out and

941
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,600
stuff it's it's quite sad

942
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,679
um i find

943
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,959
spanish guys are really good they'll get

944
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,000
a packet of seeds and they'll grow them

945
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,880
out yeah um in the uk if they get

946
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,558
something for free you know

947
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,440
that goes in their sea draw but if they

948
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,599
paid 500 for that packet that's getting

949
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,720
popped straight away

950
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,599
so

951
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,519
um

952
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,398
i'm definitely going to be doing

953
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,760
a different way of testing when i do

954
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,000
to the public i'm going to be using

955
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,240
breed bay in the future a lot more which

956
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,800
is a forum that we used to use

957
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,398
um i think i think it's now is the sort

958
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,560
of time to maybe

959
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,559
push that a little bit more and start

960
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,519
spending a bit more time on there i

961
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,878
think people are trying to grow from

962
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,119
instagram

963
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,639
and places like this where there's not

964
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,519
enough knowledge and

965
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,838
like

966
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,878
they need a place where people are

967
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,398
happy to share knowledge um

968
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,598
not going to

969
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,440
like

970
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,679
be horrible to the person if they ask a

971
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,320
silly question because

972
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,760
we were all young we were all learning

973
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,559
at one point

974
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,560
so you know um

975
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,159
i think a place like that's needed right

976
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,199
now so

977
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,800
for expert growers and new growers so

978
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:05,759
everybody can learn from each other and

979
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,599
a place where i can offer like

980
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
little limited releases to people to

981
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,200
test out

982
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,880
um

983
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,159
new um

984
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
lines

985
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,319
that i'm about to release and i want

986
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,399
them to just grow them out even if i've

987
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,720
tested them already it's good for other

988
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,320
people to see it and see what they think

989
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,000
so i think

990
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,359
breed bay is going to be the place where

991
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,199
a lot more of this is going to be done

992
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,358
and it'll be good to see people grow

993
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,519
them out and do little grow logs that's

994
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,838
what we used to do a lot more

995
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:39,119
um years ago you'd see people grow them

996
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,880
out they'd be talking about what ph

997
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
their um

998
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
their feeding amount how many

999
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,119
milliliters of this nutrient how many

1000
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,679
meals of that nutrient exactly their

1001
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,000
temperatures and they show it every week

1002
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,960
they'd update and i think that's needed

1003
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,119
now

1004
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
um especially for anybody that's serious

1005
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,480
about growing

1006
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,199
serious about

1007
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,960
um even breeding in the future once

1008
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,199
they've collected a really nice library

1009
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,639
and tested all their stuff out

1010
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,679
um

1011
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,118
and and to share knowledge like

1012
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,799
there's so many things i've learned over

1013
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,960
the years and

1014
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,079
yeah i'm i'm happy to share all of this

1015
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,159
with people

1016
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,960
so i think breed bay is going to be the

1017
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,960
new place for this

1018
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,760
yeah i don't know i feel like it's hard

1019
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,440
to get people back on forums because

1020
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,880
it's like the idea's been thrown around

1021
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,039
a lot but

1022
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,720
it seems like you need more than just

1023
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,320
the forum to get people on there do you

1024
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,159
think there'll be like

1025
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,880
other breeders kind of getting on there

1026
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,399
which would incentivize it well okay

1027
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,640
body's already on there he's got his own

1028
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,960
little uh page a lot of people don't

1029
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,239
even know this and professor p from

1030
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,880
dynasty

1031
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,679
he's beyond there he he's still got his

1032
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,838
own section so all these guys will be

1033
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,399
posting a lot more on there i'm gonna be

1034
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,440
going back there sonic's gonna be there

1035
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,760
um

1036
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,400
so i think it's gonna be

1037
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,280
um yeah an interesting little place a

1038
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,440
little community let's see if it can

1039
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,519
get it going like it used to be i think

1040
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,838
there's enough new growers and people

1041
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,159
that are serious about growing

1042
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,599
that would like to join and

1043
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,440
yeah

1044
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,359
yeah and it's got a little chat even got

1045
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,720
a little chat room on there so every day

1046
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,119
people come in

1047
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,358
have a chat in the little room any

1048
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,680
questions they can see who's online they

1049
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,000
can ask a little question and get get

1050
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,879
the answer without anybody else coming

1051
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,039
on and

1052
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,280
being horrible or

1053
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,039
missing the post because you post a post

1054
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,560
on instagram but

1055
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,400
nobody really looks past a couple of

1056
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,799
posts and things like people just

1057
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,039
flicking nowadays whereas people want to

1058
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,039
be able to go back somewhere look at it

1059
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,880
and learn something i think this is

1060
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,599
missing i think people need to be

1061
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,640
learning more reading more

1062
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,480
yeah

1063
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:58,000
so i think

1064
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,280
it's time we we shall see

1065
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,719
yeah okay

1066
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,960
sounds g

1067
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,118
kind of on that topic do you have any

1068
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,199
plans to try to get your genetics out

1069
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,000
kind of more into the international

1070
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,719
distribution streams

1071
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,119
yeah um well benson elvis which is like

1072
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,799
a big farm in america

1073
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,160
and they already grow

1074
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,079
the orange soda mandarina kush um

1075
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,719
they're doing the lilt now they're gonna

1076
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,640
be doing more of the jungle juice

1077
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,399
and they're popping the cherry spice and

1078
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,078
things like that next

1079
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,880
and they've been getting

1080
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,720
um their product it made into extract

1081
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,559
and yeah they're all loving over there i

1082
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,439
think just more people need to try it i

1083
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,799
think once more people try it

1084
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,838
then we're gonna see this um

1085
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,839
um

1086
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:50,320
burst of uh trichome jungle tips

1087
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,159
there's there's been a lot more people

1088
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,838
growing out the lilt lately so there's

1089
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,078
been some nice uh

1090
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,239
batch of batches of it available in some

1091
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,000
of the social clubs in barcelona and

1092
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,118
stuff like that so that's been really

1093
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,039
good to see

1094
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,280
um i've even seen mandarina cush on

1095
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,960
their menu in amsterdam

1096
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,160
and they said that luke will be there

1097
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,760
soon so that's really nice as well yeah

1098
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,639
these are the little things that make me

1099
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,720
smile

1100
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,719
like when people um

1101
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
uh

1102
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,960
enjoy

1103
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,838
the love and work i put into everything

1104
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,079
so

1105
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,759
yeah

1106
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
oh yeah so

1107
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
kind of

1108
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,119
in that same vein this is one i've been

1109
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,119
pondering a bit myself lately do you

1110
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,358
believe like a breeder's responsibility

1111
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,519
over their genetics extends past the

1112
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,279
wholesaler like for example if someone

1113
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,960
has an issue with your seeds is it kind

1114
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,119
of your job or the whole settler's job

1115
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
to fix that one

1116
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,200
no i always tell

1117
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,680
the wholesaler to tell them to

1118
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,799
send me a message direct on instagram or

1119
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,078
my email

1120
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,119
um

1121
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,480
because

1122
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,760
um that way like i i i try to answer

1123
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,358
every single message that i get because

1124
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,440
um

1125
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,279
i know what it was like when i was a

1126
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,039
much younger and stuff like if i was

1127
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,440
able to speak to breeder i think that it

1128
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,599
would have been an amazing thing

1129
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,639
so someone's growing

1130
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,680
out my seeds and they've paid money to

1131
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,400
to buy those seeds and support me

1132
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,399
i think it's a little bit part of my job

1133
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,920
to try my best to answer as many

1134
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,358
questions as i can

1135
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,880
but if someone is going to write me a

1136
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,400
question i prefer to actually if they

1137
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
write me a question

1138
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,838
not just like hi how are you

1139
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,519
like

1140
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:36,960
it's hard to go through so many messages

1141
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,800
but if there's a question there that i

1142
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,199
can look read it through

1143
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,880
a couple days later okay that's it

1144
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,199
answer that question

1145
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,160
that that's much easier for me

1146
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,719
um but yeah um i enjoy doing it as well

1147
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,598
especially if i have the extra time yeah

1148
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,358
i don't mind doing it at all

1149
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,280
yeah okay so how do you handle

1150
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,279
complaints by customers like if someone

1151
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,960
were to contact you and said they'd

1152
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,640
grown your gear out and they'd have some

1153
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,159
sort of issue maybe let's say it's like

1154
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:05,679
hermed out or whatever

1155
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,519
is your first response to kind of like

1156
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,838
you know see if maybe something's up

1157
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,159
with the garden

1158
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,159
um

1159
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,199
okay um

1160
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,078
yeah i don't really

1161
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,759
get too many but let's see somebody

1162
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,160
might message me saying about

1163
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,160
germination okay i get this a lot

1164
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,000
germination now

1165
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,318
all my seeds are fully

1166
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,920
tested i test them like on a regular

1167
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:32,719
basis as well

1168
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,400
and

1169
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,439
they they there's no problem with

1170
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,039
germination now i will ask the person

1171
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,639
like you know try and figure out what

1172
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,159
their problem was i see in winter time

1173
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,078
we we get a lot more problems with

1174
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,838
germination so

1175
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,760
it just shows that it is environment

1176
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,920
stuff but i will try to send them a

1177
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,920
couple of extra seeds to try and make up

1178
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,680
for that just so

1179
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,559
they're happy i want everybody to be

1180
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,480
happy

1181
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,159
um if someone said to me something

1182
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,960
hermed and they sent me some pictures

1183
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,318
and all of this um

1184
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,358
i might be inclined to send them a

1185
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:10,559
packet so they are happy at the end but

1186
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,920
um i think a lot of things comes down to

1187
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,039
environment

1188
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,119
um

1189
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,759
we grow out so many

1190
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,160
uh different varieties ourselves you

1191
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,480
must come across this yourself even in

1192
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,039
packs that have been you've grown out

1193
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,920
grown out and then maybe you might find

1194
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:30,000
one that hurts or puts out some bananas

1195
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,519
it does happen especially if you're

1196
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,199
using things like

1197
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,079
sour diesel

1198
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,480
um

1199
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,240
cherry pie things like that which have a

1200
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,280
tendency to do it

1201
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:40,318
so

1202
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,800
um

1203
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,480
yeah it happens

1204
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,200
and if i can send him a packet of c to

1205
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,119
make him happy then i i will do this

1206
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:52,960
yeah

1207
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,160
yep cheers grandma but uh anyway um what

1208
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,480
type of lighting are you using at the

1209
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,480
moment

1210
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,920
um good eaters

1211
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,240
um

1212
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,800
just because um i got them a couple of

1213
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,838
years ago um i'm just still using them

1214
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
at the moment

1215
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,599
um

1216
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,800
when i get my new place that will

1217
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,280
they'll be changed um i've been looking

1218
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,160
into some leds at the moment as well

1219
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,680
and

1220
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,598
because i'm seeing some quite good

1221
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,358
results for them i'd like to just try

1222
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,640
them out myself just just as a little

1223
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,639
test

1224
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,279
um i think that could be something good

1225
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,598
for the future with the energy

1226
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,960
consumption and stuff like this

1227
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,440
but um

1228
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,838
outdoors is um

1229
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,720
is the way using the sun

1230
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:38,639
yeah

1231
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,639
so how are things in spain at the moment

1232
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,400
is the laws evolving to kind of cater

1233
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,679
more to breeders or is it still a case

1234
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,519
of like you know out of sight out of

1235
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,559
mind type of thing

1236
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:50,880
yeah like that basically um i've had a

1237
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,199
few little run-ins and yeah not the best

1238
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,039
of luck to be honest um

1239
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,199
but uh

1240
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,838
yeah they're still far from being legal

1241
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,838
out here so far from it but it's like

1242
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,759
amsterdam isn't it like

1243
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,559
they have all that in the coffee shops

1244
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,160
but how it's produced is all the gray

1245
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,679
area isn't it so hmm so

1246
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,000
what country would you recommend

1247
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,519
aspiring breeders to look to if they

1248
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,920
were going to relocate because people

1249
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,159
often talk about spain

1250
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,159
um

1251
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,679
spain is it is definitely going to be uh

1252
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,039
the future i i can see it

1253
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,239
but

1254
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,838
for

1255
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,000
at the moment

1256
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:32,880
yeah i think there's still a long way to

1257
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,199
go

1258
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,280
but then you look to america and they've

1259
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,000
gone legal there and everyone's like oh

1260
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,960
no they've gone legal now so it

1261
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,440
i think

1262
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,240
how spain's got it with

1263
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,000
the

1264
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,118
clubs i think they just need to be

1265
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,838
accepted

1266
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,760
if they can be

1267
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,279
um accepted by a

1268
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,319
court of law

1269
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,560
and

1270
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,679
uh the production for the clubs can be

1271
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,599
accepted

1272
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,598
some papers can be brought in

1273
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,640
so it's almost like

1274
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,079
decriminalizing it to some extent

1275
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,078
um i think that could really work

1276
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,440
yeah okay

1277
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:16,480
so with that being said do you see a

1278
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,960
viable future for a person from like a

1279
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,199
currently illegal country

1280
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,800
to move to spain try to set themselves

1281
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,239
up create themselves a job in the

1282
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,280
industry over there or do you just think

1283
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,598
it's too prohibitive to just do that

1284
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,599
um

1285
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,399
i think anybody should come out to spain

1286
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,559
first

1287
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,119
and then check it out and see

1288
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,000
how they feel about it spend a few weeks

1289
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,680
here

1290
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,400
um

1291
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,799
see

1292
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,400
the clubs speak to the people and i

1293
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
think you you can

1294
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,680
most people would be able to judge it

1295
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,318
themselves and how they feel about the

1296
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,318
situation

1297
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,880
so do you approach it with the view of

1298
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,039
like

1299
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,800
a producer or a breeder because in my

1300
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,800
mind it seems like you could just kind

1301
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,480
of be off in the background doing your

1302
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,599
own thing and hopefully no one bothers

1303
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,639
you right

1304
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,760
yeah that's what i try to do but then

1305
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,159
um

1306
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
i live really out in the country so it's

1307
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,639
a tiny little place

1308
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:14,559
and

1309
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,679
i stand out a little bit

1310
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,199
and

1311
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,000
um

1312
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:19,838
yeah

1313
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,519
i've drawn attention to myself and the

1314
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,799
police have asked questions and stuff

1315
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,440
like this and

1316
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,519
so i had to pack things down and move

1317
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,480
them and it's been a lot of hassle for

1318
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,920
me

1319
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,280
but

1320
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,519
it's it's worked out good in the end

1321
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,960
but yeah it's a lot of

1322
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,199
a lot of work

1323
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,679
um how it's portrayed on the internet

1324
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,759
like spain's is totally legal place and

1325
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,799
you can grow weed here and stuff that

1326
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,119
was uh

1327
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,800
was how it was portrayed to me when i

1328
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,960
first moved here

1329
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,680
and i found out very quickly that it

1330
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,679
wasn't like that

1331
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,118
yeah okay so i want to play devil's

1332
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:01,519
advocate for a moment here if for some

1333
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,200
reason you had to leave spain and move

1334
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,119
to another country which one would you

1335
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,679
move to

1336
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,680
canada

1337
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,199
you say that like you're ready to do it

1338
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,519
right now

1339
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,519
um

1340
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,720
i don't know like i think canada

1341
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,400
sort of does appeal to me i can't see

1342
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,439
myself going there to live though to be

1343
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,920
honest

1344
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,119
um i like the sunshine in spain i like

1345
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,280
the weather

1346
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,039
the people are really nice

1347
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,400
um

1348
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,759
yeah so i can't see myself moving moving

1349
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,480
to canada

1350
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,720
but i think if anybody is free to do

1351
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,358
what they they want and they're looking

1352
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,598
at moving to a country

1353
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:46,239
i think canada there could be a lot of

1354
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,400
opportunities in canada coming up

1355
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,039
so i mean given you are a breeder in

1356
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,200
spain a little bit unrelated but kind of

1357
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,440
is there the same explosion of breeders

1358
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,879
over there in the same sense that we see

1359
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,079
in america and the rest of the world

1360
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,640
um

1361
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,480
yeah there has been a little bit um but

1362
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,960
i'm seeing

1363
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,119
some people they're

1364
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,039
getting like as many sort of clones as

1365
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,480
they come together

1366
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,318
um

1367
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,000
or even just plants that other people

1368
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,199
have selected

1369
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,159
and then

1370
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,598
um

1371
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,519
pollinate them

1372
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,039
with a male

1373
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,960
and

1374
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,960
or reversing a plant and pollinating

1375
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,400
them and then selling the seeds

1376
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
not tested

1377
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,358
never growing out any of the parents and

1378
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,160
i'm just like it's just for real so yeah

1379
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,400
like it's there's a lot of

1380
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,519
people making seeds now

1381
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,840
um

1382
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,039
and

1383
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,119
[Music]

1384
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,639
putting any

1385
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,800
any names and

1386
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,639
yeah it's all gone a bit crazy to be

1387
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,920
honest

1388
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,679
um

1389
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,079
is that what you sort of mean like lots

1390
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,719
of slight seed companies popping up with

1391
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,240
no tech real testing and stuff like this

1392
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,318
yeah i mean that's definitely one part

1393
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:02,639
of it but i was also curious

1394
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:03,920
sometimes you hear about like big seed

1395
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,679
producers over there like i think

1396
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,960
dynafem does something over there or

1397
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,960
something like that like do you know

1398
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,960
anything about that

1399
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,880
yeah no i don't know too much about that

1400
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,039
but i i can imagine yeah there's a lot

1401
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,280
of people over here producing seeds for

1402
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,279
their companies and stuff like this so

1403
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,040
yeah

1404
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,200
yeah interesting there's the horror

1405
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,800
stories always relate back to spain

1406
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,480
somehow

1407
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:31,440
yeah yeah no there's a lot of um

1408
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,719
people use spanish guys uh to make their

1409
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,079
seeds

1410
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,159
um

1411
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,839
yeah many many of the big companies yeah

1412
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,838
that's it

1413
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,318
so while we're on the topic of

1414
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,078
going through seeds making parents how

1415
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,639
many plants do you tend to cull before

1416
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,200
you find like a keep a female and when

1417
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,279
you find your kind of clone onlys

1418
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:54,879
does it happen often from a 10 pack or

1419
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,640
given you're at like you know the higher

1420
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,640
breeder level do you do these larger

1421
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,039
scale searches

1422
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,318
now you can do all your selection from a

1423
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,079
10 pack

1424
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,079
um

1425
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,800
it all depends on what you're using it

1426
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,720
so

1427
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,839
like i said before if you're not finding

1428
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,519
really great things from a tent pack

1429
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,440
like

1430
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,559
yeah you want to be finding some real

1431
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,720
nice stuff

1432
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,319
um obviously if you start and then

1433
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,239
from

1434
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:23,679
uh you find something special and you

1435
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,519
really want to look

1436
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:26,558
down that line more

1437
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,679
starting

1438
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,359
another 500 seeds of that one type is

1439
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,480
worth doing to find something really

1440
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,799
special again and work that line

1441
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,838
um i'm going to be doing a lot more work

1442
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,000
with the

1443
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,000
a lil mail soon so there'll be a lot of

1444
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,079
little hybrids i've just done

1445
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,318
the little with the

1446
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,160
jungle kush but then

1447
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,719
this is more like a little bit of like a

1448
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,039
back cross so it's more watered down you

1449
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,879
get like this fruity crush thing coming

1450
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:59,279
out so i definitely want to add

1451
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,599
the lil with a few different things i've

1452
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,640
got planned

1453
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,039
and then

1454
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,719
from them do some selection and work the

1455
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:07,440
lines the same as i'm going to do with

1456
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:09,118
the

1457
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,960
afghan hybrids

1458
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,119
we'll see how they come out in the first

1459
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,720
generation but each line is going to

1460
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,960
really need to be worked

1461
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,879
to find something um to get something

1462
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,800
that you can release

1463
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,720
i forgot to ask what were the females of

1464
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,640
the afghan lion like

1465
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,159
okay um

1466
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,920
okay the male smelt much better than

1467
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,799
females

1468
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,838
the male had this like uh grapefruit

1469
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,720
smell going on but the females were more

1470
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:36,880
on

1471
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,399
like how i said about the indian spiced

1472
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,318
aniseed smell

1473
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,039
it had this thing i could smell it in

1474
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,960
the afghans as well

1475
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,880
so it's like this

1476
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,960
it just reminds me of like a lot of old

1477
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,358
school stuff i've had before

1478
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,358
even my nap that i had in the past which

1479
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,598
made the mantis

1480
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:59,119
that had that aniseed

1481
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,240
like hindu kush type smell going on

1482
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,200
so

1483
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:02,959
um

1484
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,480
yeah it's definitely definitely along

1485
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,240
those lines

1486
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,119
and do you have any information about

1487
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,838
what area the afghans came from

1488
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,800
yeah they're from bulk province

1489
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,440
and

1490
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,640
near mazar sharif

1491
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,679
but we've got

1492
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,078
like

1493
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,318
i've got some here but then between all

1494
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,760
of us now he sent a lot more so we've

1495
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:28,880
literally got seeds from

1496
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:32,000
every province and place in afghanistan

1497
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,920
and which one excites you the most the

1498
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,880
ones i've got at the moment to be honest

1499
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,200
but then

1500
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,920
i'm going to be getting a few different

1501
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,000
uh

1502
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,280
different ones so we'll see like some

1503
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,358
people are getting ones that are like a

1504
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,200
lot more cabbage looking like the leaves

1505
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:48,799
like really really fat so and those ones

1506
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:50,318
were the

1507
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,839
you know i'd have to go and look because

1508
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:53,039
i can't remember right now

1509
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,279
but there's somebody else that was

1510
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,119
growing them that i seen on instagram

1511
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,519
but from the same

1512
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,400
farmer that he collected from another

1513
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,759
farm

1514
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,720
in another uh area

1515
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,520
so

1516
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,439
yeah

1517
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,800
i think this year's gonna be the year of

1518
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,880
the afghan there's gonna be a lot of

1519
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,960
afghan seeds being grown out from

1520
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,880
different areas so it's gonna be really

1521
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,119
interesting to see i'm already seeing so

1522
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,119
many different variations from the

1523
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,079
different people growing them

1524
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,000
so

1525
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,480
have you ever thought of like rounding

1526
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,159
up a whole bunch of afghan clones kind

1527
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,760
of doing like what bodhi did with like

1528
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,440
the deep line alchemy and like just

1529
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,160
hitting all these afghans with like this

1530
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,559
cool afghan male

1531
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,639
yeah i think there could be a a lot of

1532
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,240
different things going on and people

1533
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,159
sharing a little bit pollen so they can

1534
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,598
hit this one and things like this yeah

1535
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:45,679
this is this will be happening

1536
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,200
cool cool and so what type of satives do

1537
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,519
you want to hit with the afghan

1538
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,480
eventually

1539
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,199
um

1540
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,440
yeah the malawi seeds i'm definitely

1541
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,558
going to pop them

1542
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,280
and

1543
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,200
some of the south american stuff we'll

1544
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,599
see how they come out

1545
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:05,919
but i think malawi's i don't know

1546
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,000
there's just something about that pack

1547
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,639
of malawi that's just

1548
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,880
crying to me to pop them so

1549
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,480
we'll see what happens with them

1550
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,960
and i don't think ever asked what would

1551
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,280
you use as the final sativa component

1552
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,440
for your skunk

1553
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,559
um

1554
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,720
i don't

1555
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,400
i don't know that may maybe something

1556
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:30,399
south american again

1557
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,760
or a thai it all depends it all depends

1558
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,599
um

1559
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,960
but we've got so many different things

1560
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,640
to go through

1561
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,119
um

1562
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:39,920
like on on the trip to india there was

1563
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,160
like

1564
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,318
not just me sonic there was a guy hit

1565
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,519
from himalayan connection some other

1566
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:46,798
guys

1567
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,280
um

1568
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:52,480
so they've also got some real nice stuff

1569
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,079
in their collection things like this so

1570
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,000
the

1571
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,079
we we've got so many different things to

1572
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
pick from we've got like some real nice

1573
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,440
sativas even from india and stuff like

1574
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,400
that so

1575
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,000
yeah

1576
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,760
um

1577
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,920
the library is uh

1578
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,920
is very vague at the moment between all

1579
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,000
of us

1580
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,599
okay so just to kind of play devil's

1581
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,440
advocate then again

1582
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,838
what type of genetics would you like to

1583
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,280
see come back into kind of the community

1584
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,440
that kind of aren't really around at the

1585
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,120
moment

1586
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,240
um

1587
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:27,279
[Music]

1588
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:29,439

1590
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,159
uh

1591
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,838
something a little bit more unusual

1592
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,078
turkey and profile

1593
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,759
um i don't think there's any like

1594
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,760

1595
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,040
line i'd like to bring back i'd like to

1596
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,839
see a lot more

1597
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,679
uh maybe some of sonic's

1598
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:48,558
pineapple hybrids

1599
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:50,879
he had one called pine queen which was

1600
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,200
absolutely amazing if he brings that

1601
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,680
back it'll blow people's minds it was

1602
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,919
such a beautiful plant

1603
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,919
so um

1604
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,000
yeah i'd like to see some of them

1605
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,240
from the old school i'd like to see some

1606
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,280
hash plants coming back that's why i'd

1607
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,719
like to

1608
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,640
work with the

1609
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,199
afghans and their

1610
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,879
uh milana plants

1611
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,078
so we can uh

1612
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,960
make a nice

1613
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,519
hush plant

1614
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,358
yeah definitely and so do you feel like

1615
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,759
it's inherently a part of those plants

1616
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:27,679
that you get kind of that more cbn more

1617
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,280
sedative type of high or not necessarily

1618
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,879
yeah no that's what i'm looking for in

1619
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,960
in this hash pan type thing something

1620
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,559
that literally you you get halfway down

1621
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,960
that spliff and it just

1622
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,359
knocks you out you want to go to sleep

1623
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,960
that's what i'm looking for

1624
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,239
and that's why i think it's going to be

1625
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,679
interesting with the bubba kush because

1626
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,279
the bubba kush

1627
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,239
has got that

1628
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,519
more

1629
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,318
medicinal

1630
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:52,880
sedative type of height to it especially

1631
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,679
if you just flow it out that extra week

1632
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,640
like

1633
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:59,440
it's such a beautiful smoke and i've

1634
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:04,400
crossed that with the afghan so

1635
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,000
um span abysses is is next week so um

1636
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,798
a week after so

1637
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,239
um

1638
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,079
i might take a few of those seeds with

1639
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:11,519
me to give out to a couple of people to

1640
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,400
test out

1641
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:14,318
um

1642
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,318
gonna do like uh

1643
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:19,199
release of the little again there

1644
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:22,000
because they just sold out so fast

1645
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:25,199
everybody went crazy for them

1646
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,400
so doing another release of them

1647
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:28,000
and then um

1648
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,079
i'll probably be working the line a lot

1649
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,239
more then and doing some nice little

1650
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,440

00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,000
so i'll try and see as many people as

1702
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,599
possible there's a few clubs that have

1703
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,358
got some lilt and stuff like that in

1704
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,400
there so they told me to come by have a

1705
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:19,358
look at it

1706
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,680
so

1707
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,960
yeah it'll be interesting it'll be nice

1708
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:23,919
to

1709
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,760
um

1710
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,240
see what people have produced from the

1711
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,760
seeds from last year and stuff like this

1712
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,358
yeah

1713
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,280
are there people like

1714
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:35,759
like selling clones there and stuff like

1715
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,798
in the states or not really

1716
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,920
no nothing like this

1717
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:44,559
so just like flower and concentrate

1718
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,079
yeah you go go to

1719
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,760
just one of the social clubs you could

1720
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,720
be a member of the clubs and then you

1721
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,400
can

1722
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,480
get access to that

1723
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,240
but most people sort of like bring their

1724
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,440
own little bit of smoke and

1725
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,399
smoking everyone's smoking quite openly

1726
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,000
and quite a relaxed environment

1727
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,000
but i've heard high times have just

1728
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,838
brought it out

1729
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,519
so span a base now he's been bought by

1730
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:10,159
high times

1731
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,358
so from this year on is going to be

1732
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,279
high times

1733
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,558
or span of this high times whatever i

1734
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,559
don't know what they'll call it

1735
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:21,598
but yeah i can see it probably changing

1736
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,839
a little bit after this year

1737
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,079
and so how do you feel about high time

1738
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,838
zoning and you think like whatever or

1739
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,480
not

1740
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:32,440
good

1741
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,240
whatever but i can't see it being um

1742
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,318
[Applause]

1743
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,439
well previous things it's just it all

1744
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,920
changes isn't it and then it all

1745
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,358
everybody is just all about whoever

1746
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,798
pays the most gets gets the cup and all

1747
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:45,838
of this sort of stuff it's just all

1748
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:47,039
changes

1749
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:51,519
so

1750
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,759
um for 2020 spanner this time and a few

1751
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:54,880
people i know are gonna put a nice

1752
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,720
little

1753
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,720
cup upon at the same sort of time so

1754
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,000
that's going to be a nice like

1755
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,159
um

1756
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,159
more transparent cup anyway you'll get

1757
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,679
to see all the votes and everything so

1758
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,598
that'll be quite good

1759
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:09,919
um and during spamabis anyway there's

1760
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,960
always other little cups on like they've

1761
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,960
got the

1762
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,159
masters of rosin

1763
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,519
and

1764
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,318
uh

1765
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:20,400
what's that um legends of hash

1766
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,079
that bubble man and them always put on

1767
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,599
so there's always little other events

1768
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,880
going on so

1769
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,519
should be good for

1770
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,559
this year next year

1771
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,239
do you ever

1772
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,839
get sick of any of the egos

1773
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,199
yeah there's always egos and it's

1774
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:39,119
getting worse but yeah i just laugh

1775
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:40,480
it's good makes me smile and laughing's

1776
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,440
good for your body

1777
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,838
so

1778
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,880
if people make me laugh yeah it's

1779
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:46,880
beneficial to me

1780
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,719
yeah i can imagine you'd have a blast at

1781
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:53,838
one of those events

1782
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,838
i'm always smiling

1783
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:58,159
um

1784
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,680
so

1785
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,318
how important do you think it is to

1786
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,719
produce kind of medically potent strains

1787
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,798
you know i'm not just talking about cbd

1788
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,279
i mean kind of like the example that's

1789
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:12,639
been weighing in my mind is um my good

1790
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:15,599
buddy stray fox he pointed out that

1791
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,279
although the pre-98 bubba is arguably a

1792
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,039
better smoke you know probably no one

1793
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,680
will distribute that

1794
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,920
the katsu cut it's far more medicinal

1795
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,440
you know so with that in mind do you

1796
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,960
think it's important that we like try to

1797
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,480
breed with these types of things like

1798
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,639
for the medicinal value or do you think

1799
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:34,079
it's just of kind of inconsequential

1800
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:35,759
because the markets just mostly wreck

1801
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,839
um

1802
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,359
yeah i think because like i go down more

1803
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:41,279
the flavor and stuff like that because

1804
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,480
it's the

1805
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,480
like that's what i like about it so much

1806
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,960
but the high really does come into it

1807
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,318
and the bubba is

1808
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,519
such a medicinal strain that whenever i

1809
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:55,358
um

1810
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,880
crossed it into things in the past i'd

1811
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:58,239
always sort of

1812
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,960
um

1813
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:03,759
put that in the description because

1814
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,720
every time you added bubba into things

1815
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,079
the height of the the the offspring

1816
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:11,038
would always come out with that

1817
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,359
beautiful bubba type high added to it

1818
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,400
and it was it was definitely felt in the

1819
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,519
legs

1820
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,200
like such a relaxing type of smoke and

1821
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,838
people with back pain and things like

1822
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,719
this yeah enjoy it so much

1823
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:24,639
so

1824
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,879
i think so many people do use it

1825
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:29,440
medicinally but don't realize it we say

1826
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,519
recreational but if it makes you feel

1827
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,639
happy and your well-being

1828
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,119
is good

1829
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,279
that's medicinal if it helps your stiff

1830
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,838
joints or you've got a little bit of

1831
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,000
pain in the neck or it helps you to

1832
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:43,759
relax your body after work

1833
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,280
this is all medicinal

1834
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,039
so i think

1835
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,599
so many people do actually use it in a

1836
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,680
medicinal way but don't actually realize

1837
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,680
it

1838
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,318
yeah okay and so do you think there

1839
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,039
should be any distinction or do you

1840
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:02,400
think just greater education

1841
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:05,039
greater education yeah um i think that's

1842
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,838
the main thing because we even know even

1843
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,839
with

1844
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,838
you're growing something from seed it's

1845
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:12,159
it's not always going to be exactly

1846
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:14,880
how you imagine it you get different

1847
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:19,038
variations in the seeds

1848
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,079
um so i think educating people about

1849
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,440
um

1850
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,720
all these different

1851
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,639
compounds

1852
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:27,679
genetics

1853
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,960
the terpenes i think that's that's

1854
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,598
that's uh

1855
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,599
a big thing yeah

1856
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,519
and so what field of research would you

1857
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,720
like to see cannabis expand more into

1858
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:38,159
then

1859
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,279
um

1860
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,960
testing

1861
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,400
like it like just testing for

1862
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,599
terpenes

1863
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,039
and

1864
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,318
uh all the other chemicals

1865
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,680
in the plants

1866
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,279
um

1867
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,558
and like there's just so many things

1868
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,240
that we come to conclusions but we can

1869
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:02,160
never really

1870
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:05,519
um fully back them up unless we test

1871
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:07,279
so i think seeing a lot more

1872
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,759
testing and

1873
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,519
tissue culture i'd like to see

1874
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,280
how things go with the tissue culture

1875
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,199
and like we were talking about

1876
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:19,200
getting rid of

1877
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:19,199
genetic diseases or getting rid of

1878
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,679
just normal diseases you know with the

1879
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,240
tissue culture you're producing

1880
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:28,078
a totally clean

1881
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:29,439
um

1882
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,839
clump

1883
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,760
of of the mother

1884
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:36,159
so i think that's one good thing i see

1885
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:39,119
so many people passing clones and that's

1886
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:43,279
how you pass disease so

1887
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,880
one thing i do not take in his clones

1888
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,240
yeah so

1889
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,960
do you just

1890
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:51,358
everything's from seed more or less

1891
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,559
everything's from cd so i could actually

1892
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:56,798
i like all everything that i i use

1893
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,798
now the only clone that i have in my

1894
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:00,719
library right now

1895
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,318
is the bubba kush

1896
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,798
um

1897
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,239
everything else is clones i've selected

1898
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,480
myself

1899
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:09,519
from seed originally

1900
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,000
or

1901
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:14,960
new things i've selected from seeds

1902
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,480
and yeah so i only do things i've

1903
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,480
selected from seeds

1904
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,240
from now on

1905
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,440
it's the best way yeah you know you're

1906
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:26,239
you're you're clean from any other

1907
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,240
external influences

1908
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,239
so how long will it take you on average

1909
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,399
before you find a new keeper like for

1910
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,078
example if you're doing a crop every you

1911
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,639
know let's just say three months to be

1912
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,798
on easy number side you finally won each

1913
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,038
cycle you're finding two you're finding

1914
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:42,880
one every two cycles what's your numbers

1915
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:48,160
like

1916
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,160
all depends on on what i'm starting um

1917
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:52,000
so

1918
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,359
from if i'm starting

1919
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,719
10 different varieties okay

1920
01:06:55,358 --> 01:07:00,078
um

1921
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:01,279
i'll find three or four nice keepers but

1922
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,359
then

1923
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,359
the other things are still nice i'm

1924
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,199
finding because then i'll i'll pass them

1925
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:07,920
out to people

1926
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,519
and

1927
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,519
they'll be like i can't believe you're

1928
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,280
getting rid of this and i'm like well

1929
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,480
yeah just it's not something i'm going

1930
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,760
to use

1931
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,039
so

1932
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,640
um

1933
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,920
yeah

1934
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:24,798
there's so many keepers like i'm finding

1935
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:27,200
the more different breeders that you pop

1936
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:30,000
things from as well you find so much

1937
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:31,598
different flavors and smells

1938
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,960
um

1939
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,920
so

1940
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,159
yeah

1941
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,318
um

1942
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:38,318
so

1943
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:44,078
so which breeders work are you most

1944
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,358
excited to look into

1945
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,280
um

1946
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,000
would you know what i had got some stuff

1947
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,880
from mad farmer he sent me some nice

1948
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,760
seeds over and i haven't had the chance

1949
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,838
because they literally came at the time

1950
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,160
when i had all the

1951
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:01,679
um problems just after that where to

1952
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,358
move everything

1953
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:06,399
and then

1954
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:08,719
after that i was about to pop them but i

1955
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,880
had to just give them a back seat for a

1956
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:12,798
little bit um

1957
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,720
because i was i had to just pop all my

1958
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:16,238
own stuff because things just needed

1959
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,639
testing but

1960
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:22,079
really um i would have liked to pop some

1961
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:25,199
of his seats so they're next on the list

1962
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:27,039
but i've got um a few things that i've

1963
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:28,559
picked out for the next room

1964
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,880
and

1965
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,319
i didn't i did uh

1966
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,199
they were picked out with some other

1967
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,880
things for a run but yeah i just

1968
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,838
had to test all the other stuff all the

1969
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,838
things i've been making

1970
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,920
yeah definitely okay not a bad selection

1971
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,119
so

1972
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,520
um

1973
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:50,559
i've noticed on your ig that you've been

1974
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,319
playing around with some kind of cell

1975
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,480
culturing yourself some along those

1976
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,798
lines what you've been doing

1977
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,439
yeah it's i classic more like micro

1978
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:01,759
cloning really okay

1979
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:04,000
but um

1980
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:07,600
yeah you're basically taking

1981
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,000
um a small amount of the plant tissue

1982
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,838
and then you grow it in a

1983
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,679
sugar solution

1984
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:15,759
so the plants

1985
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,600
making instead of it doing the

1986
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,838
photosynthesis and the

1987
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,759
getting the sugar from the light you

1988
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:23,439
it's getting the sugar from the solution

1989
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,119
as long as you've got no bacteria in

1990
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:27,358
there

1991
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:29,519
then the bacteria can't grow on the

1992
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,359
sugar and eat the sugar so everything

1993
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,640
has to be super sterile

1994
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:37,199
that's the main thing with it um

1995
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,679
and then i'll grow it to

1996
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:42,079
tissue stage where it starts to grow

1997
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,199
leaf tissue

1998
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:44,798
and

1999
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:47,678
the

2000
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:50,079
the root will calyx up

2001
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,319
but then i'll transfer to another

2002
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:53,759
solution which will be then for the root

2003
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,640
growth

2004
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,960
um

2005
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,719
but the reason i got into the tissue

2006
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,760
culture was because i had to move

2007
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,158
everything

2008
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,440
so when i moved everything i thought

2009
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,198
okay if i'm going to do this i'm going

2010
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:06,719
to get a tissue culture

2011
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,000
kit and

2012
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,000
i'm going to

2013
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,039
do this as an extra backup

2014
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,279
so

2015
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,198
there i did two extra backups of tissue

2016
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:18,000
culture and

2017
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,759
moved my mothers to a safe location

2018
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,039
so um

2019
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,960
yeah so it all worked out and i i

2020
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:27,279
learned something new and i've been

2021
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,719
experimenting with that a little bit

2022
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:30,639
um

2023
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:33,359
there's a couple of guys that i'm

2024
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,679
speaking to on instagram and one of them

2025
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:38,319
so knowledgeable in this field

2026
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,239
and he's bringing out a kit

2027
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,158
very soon

2028
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:43,439
and um

2029
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:44,559
i think that's going to be something

2030
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,839
that

2031
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:49,920
um a lot of people will really enjoy um

2032
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,400
using an experiment in

2033
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,640
um same again like

2034
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,479
people looking

2035
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,199
beyond

2036
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:02,158
just the money and want to learn more

2037
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:04,079
about the plant or plants in general the

2038
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:05,599
science behind them

2039
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,079
and um i think these kits are going to

2040
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,440
be amazing for them and he's got he's

2041
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:10,319
done them so they're in like a little

2042
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,238
bag

2043
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,840
and the bag is like a sterile

2044
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:14,959
environment which is going to really

2045
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,360
help

2046
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,119
people at the beginning stage of doing

2047
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:21,279
tissue culture

2048
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:24,399
so um i'll be doing a post on my

2049
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:26,559
instagram page about that and um

2050
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,399
i'm sure he'll be have putting some

2051
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,920
links up about the the kits and stuff

2052
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,198
like that so

2053
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,119
um

2054
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,039
maybe you can get him to send you one so

2055
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,198
you can try it out if you've never tried

2056
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:40,399
it out yourself

2057
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,678
what's the success rate on it like well

2058
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,119
okay

2059
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,440
well i've been getting pretty much

2060
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:48,158
hundred percent yeah okay

2061
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:50,799
um the only time i haven't is where i've

2062
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:53,119
done little tests so

2063
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,279
i've got one out and i've breathed into

2064
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,679
the pot okay

2065
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:59,119
and closed the lid just simple things

2066
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,719
like this are going to contaminate it so

2067
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:01,760
you've got to wear a mask and stuff like

2068
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,719
this so

2069
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,960
so the first batch

2070
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:10,480
10 got contaminated

2071
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,880
okay the second second time

2072
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:16,079
maybe five percent and then after that

2073
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,159
really i don't have any problems

2074
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,079
but i've seen even seen in labs where

2075
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,399
they've got total sterile environment

2076
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,039
they still have five percent sometimes

2077
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:27,039
losses and stuff like this

2078
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:29,039
yeah no

2079
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,198
so it happens in the cleanness of

2080
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,359
environments

2081
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,719
so um

2082
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:36,158
yeah but

2083
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,000
as long as you're you're doing

2084
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,198
everything super clean and that's why

2085
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,399
these kits are going to be really good

2086
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:41,678
with the bag

2087
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:42,960
so you've got a sterile environment

2088
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,319
inside the bag i think that's going to

2089
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,480
be really good

2090
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,238
yeah that sounds cool sounds like you're

2091
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:49,678
kind of getting down to the point where

2092
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:51,439
you're almost doing the meristem

2093
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,359
culturing yourself do you ever plan to

2094
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:55,599
do that type of thing or go to labs for

2095
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,559
it well no this is what this other guy

2096
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,400
is um he's like been experimenting with

2097
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,400
all of this stuff so

2098
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,759
and he's even so doing like talking

2099
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,759
about literally

2100
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,960
cells um

2101
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:11,760
just floating in the solution and even

2102
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,000
to the point where maybe even um

2103
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,360
breeding in uh

2104
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,279
in um

2105
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:18,000
test tubes so

2106
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:19,679
we

2107
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,600
will see where it all leads in the

2108
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:26,800
future

2109
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,800
breeding in a test tube geez ibf seeds

2110
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:32,719
it's more and for me it's more just

2111
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,760
educating myself and learning these

2112
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,198
things

2113
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,719
um

2114
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:38,399
um

2115
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,399
same again like this plant's just

2116
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,799
teaching me so much now we're going down

2117
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:44,079
the lines of like a total new line of

2118
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,440
genetics

2119
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:46,559
so

2120
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:47,599
yeah

2121
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,440
all um

2122
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,840
very interesting stuff

2123
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:53,439
learning something new every day

2124
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,199
that's another thing i've been really

2125
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,960
getting into my a little bit more

2126
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:57,759
creative side

2127
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,359
so

2128
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,119
you know spending a little bit more time

2129
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:02,960
doing that

2130
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,640
um

2131
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,960
and i don't know if you've seen in the

2132
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,280
new mahakala just like a little limited

2133
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,198
thing i've done for spannabis so like a

2134
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,880
little limited seed packet all like

2135
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,039
little handmade so

2136
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,359
they were quite good doing them

2137
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:20,560
oh yeah yeah i've seen you've been

2138
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:23,439
getting your little micro carpentry on

2139
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,719
yeah that's it yeah yeah keeping busy

2140
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:28,319
being creative keeping the mind busy so

2141
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,719
it's good with the plants and stuff like

2142
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:33,439
that but sometimes we need to

2143
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,239
express ourselves in other ways and

2144
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,079
learn

2145
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:37,599
learning i think it's good to learn

2146
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:39,279
something new every day

2147
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,159
that's it

2148
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,039
yeah i did i love it man i love learning

2149
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:45,198
so

2150
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:47,519
i got some weird questions but i want to

2151
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,839
bang them out so first one when will we

2152
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,560
see a cbd project from you i'm

2153
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,319
interested it's due

2154
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,520
um

2155
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:59,920
maybe when things change in spain and

2156
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,120
um

2157
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,600
i can

2158
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:05,760
yeah i find a location to start doing a

2159
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,600
lot more growing and breeding like the

2160
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,800
cbd you can actually do out here and

2161
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:14,000
stuff like that and i had some friends

2162
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,199
that uh grow legal cbd

2163
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,158
and

2164
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:17,599
so

2165
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:19,679
it might be something in the future that

2166
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,440
i could work with them but

2167
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,480
thc and

2168
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:26,639
is one of my main things it's the high

2169
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,759
that these plants produce and

2170
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:31,600
that that thc and the terpenes is just

2171
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,880
so special for me

2172
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,280
um

2173
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,800
the cbd i think there's other people in

2174
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,800
other fields

2175
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,600
that um

2176
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,320
make good cbd i can continue with that

2177
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:48,800
i'll stick with my

2178
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:51,840
terpene rich thc plants

2179
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:54,079
so i mean in a similar idea how do you

2180
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,560
think we as a community can cater to the

2181
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:58,238
casual smokers and i mean like

2182
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,159
this is kind of stemming from the fact

2183
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:03,759
how i was saying you know like i've cut

2184
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:05,599
my consumption down and god just like

2185
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,840
i can't even have more than one hit and

2186
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,280
i'm just gone like i need that

2187
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,520
i'm like i feel like that old person

2188
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,759
who's like weeds too strong these days

2189
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,080
so like i'm trying to figure out like

2190
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,840
how can you make kind of like more tangy

2191
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,238
type of strains where it like tastes

2192
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,920
good but doesn't destroy yeah

2193
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:24,238
well you you'd like the little yeah the

2194
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,760
looks like this so there are some

2195
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,399
females that you smoke and they just

2196
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,719
like knock you out but i'd say the

2197
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:34,319
majority of the tropical ones

2198
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,719
um have this like beautiful euphoric

2199
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:38,319
higher people will be smoking and people

2200
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,000
will be giggling and that

2201
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:40,799
i just i think i think this is going to

2202
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
be the

2203
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,400
the perfect strain for summer and how

2204
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,800
we've got spring coming soon

2205
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:50,639
and somewhere just around the corner i

2206
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,640
think it's going to be a

2207
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,480
perfect strain for those

2208
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,360
sunny days and

2209
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,599
summer activities yeah i think this is

2210
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:00,960
what's needed

2211
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,960
yeah okay

2212
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,319
so a bit of a weird one but i wanted to

2213
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,880
ask your opinion because i think we've

2214
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,559
spoken about this in kind of the dms but

2215
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,600
there was like a scientific paper which

2216
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,080
came out the other day and it's like

2217
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,000
actually detailing how you can use

2218
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:16,399
cannabis to help people wean off harder

2219
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,479
drugs like meth and opioids

2220
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,479
is that any surprise to you at all

2221
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:27,679
no no because i've seen so many people

2222
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,800
that have been in the cannabis community

2223
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,279
and

2224
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,199
ended up growing

2225
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:36,479
and this plant again teaching them so

2226
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:38,000
much and they changed their way of life

2227
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,759
here and

2228
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,800
the cannabis has given them something

2229
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,440
else to keep their mind occupied

2230
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,440
to give them a feeling that they can

2231
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,678
relax

2232
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:52,719
and stuff like this so i i see i've seen

2233
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:54,239
it a lot where people have had previous

2234
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:56,560
uh

2235
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:59,678
drug addictions and they turn to

2236
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,440
cannabis and it's helped them through

2237
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,119
even just growing the plant never mind

2238
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,559
taking a plant

2239
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,640
the plant taking the plant has helped

2240
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,640
them amazingly but growing it the whole

2241
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,960
thing the therapeutic

2242
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,840
use and the therapeutic property you get

2243
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,840
from just gardening

2244
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:19,759
yeah changing the lifestyle

2245
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:20,479
yeah okay

2246
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,159
so

2247
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:24,839
what type of growth style have you been

2248
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:27,599
using lately

2249
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,279
um okay so

2250
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,159
with the

2251
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,559
um

2252
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:34,799
last batch these are all bio tabs with

2253
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,000
the seeds i'm doing

2254
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,239
and

2255
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,079
the ones before that were all on coco

2256
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:42,000
because i was running some tests with ph

2257
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:43,679
and stuff like this

2258
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,679
um

2259
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,359
the afghan is definitely like the a much

2260
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,319
higher ph

2261
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:49,679
so

2262
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,279
um

2263
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,440
this is a handy thing with instagram

2264
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:54,399
both the guy from milan village is on

2265
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,359
instagram

2266
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:59,359
the farmer and the guy from afghanistan

2267
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,960
so i could actually like message him or

2268
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,039
get my other mate to message the other

2269
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,800
guy in

2270
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,399
because he can speak to him

2271
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,400
in his language

2272
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:09,599
and get some answers and that and stuff

2273
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:11,359
like this so that's been quite

2274
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,960
interesting

2275
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,039
but it's not something that they really

2276
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,198
check is the ph and stuff like that but

2277
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:19,679
from a little bit more discussion i

2278
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,198
found that is much higher ph there and i

2279
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,679
found that with growing them here they

2280
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:26,399
just really reacted better with a much

2281
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:28,560
higher ph

2282
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,879
yeah okay cool and what other little

2283
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,960
interesting nicks or quirks have you

2284
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,880
found about them which you kind of

2285
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,359
helped cater to like they like a higher

2286
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,560
soil temperature or like medium i should

2287
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:40,238
say

2288
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,320
okay another thing that i would do with

2289
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,158
them i started some of the seeds

2290
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:47,039
okay

2291
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:48,479
left in low low level light above the to

2292
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,359
below the canopy

2293
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,479
okay just to see how they react

2294
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,079
and

2295
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:56,319
plucked a few out

2296
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:59,359
of the soil stripped the roots down and

2297
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,399
replanted them and they still grew it

2298
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:03,599
okay

2299
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:05,920
so it just shows how hardy these plants

2300
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,239
are you can pull a plant out of the soil

2301
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,480
break all the small tiny roots off where

2302
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:13,039
you're just leaving the main tape room

2303
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,559
replant it and the plant

2304
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,800
carries on growing

2305
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,080
okay so this is just little tests to

2306
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,320
show how i see how hardly some of these

2307
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:25,279
genetics are that are grown

2308
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,439
in these places at these altitudes and i

2309
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:30,079
think adding them into some of my

2310
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:32,399
genetics and growing them outdoors

2311
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:35,198
i think this is where i'm going to see i

2312
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:37,119
didn't see one bit of powdery mildew in

2313
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:39,839
all of their fields i've seen powdery

2314
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:43,279
mildew on other plants around them

2315
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:46,239
but not on the cannabis not one spot

2316
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:47,039
anywhere which was absolutely crazy i

2317
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:48,718
thought

2318
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,238
whereas when people go to morocco it's

2319
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,359
everywhere there

2320
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:51,829
so

2321
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:53,359
um

2322
01:20:51,829 --> 01:20:55,760
[Music]

2323
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:59,039
these hybrids that people grow

2324
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,719
in places have problems whereas the

2325
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,238
natural

2326
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,560
um

2327
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:05,919
varieties from from that area don't have

2328
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,199
the problems

2329
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,359
so i think this is going to be something

2330
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:11,439
to look into resistance range for the

2331
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,759
future

2332
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,839
yeah definitely something of huge

2333
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,199
interest to a lot of people i want to

2334
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,400
pull you back to something you said

2335
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:22,319
there the moroccan valley two questions

2336
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,920
one do you think a lot of the hash that

2337
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,399
comes out of there

2338
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,920
has become from plants with pm and like

2339
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,359
you know i guess we should be worried

2340
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,840
and the other thing is

2341
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:33,599
have you seen that photo from the dna

2342
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,920
guys how they got like

2343
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,600
that valley and the roof full of like

2344
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,760
kosher tangy or something like how do

2345
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,840
you feel about that

2346
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,639
yeah see well they had a load of

2347
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:47,440
mandarina things uh gingerbread out

2348
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:49,199
there at one point and mandarina kush

2349
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:50,960
and stuff like this

2350
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,198
it's been happening for so long it was

2351
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,119
amnesia not long ago before that it was

2352
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:57,439
some pakistani strains that they were

2353
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,359
growing and mexican strains and people

2354
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,198
were also saying

2355
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,960
cheese they were growing loads of cheese

2356
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:06,238
out there so things have been grown out

2357
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,840
there for a long time um

2358
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,000
so i think

2359
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:13,039
that's just how it is after the whole

2360
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,719
hashish thing in in morocco isn't

2361
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:16,000
like it goes back generation after

2362
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,079
generation

2363
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,079
it is it's a

2364
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:22,238
it's a new thing that was started from

2365
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:24,000
people bringing seeds back from other

2366
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,439
hash producing countries and stuff like

2367
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,960
this so

2368
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,719
um

2369
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,639
yeah it's just a

2370
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,480
progression i think and that's what's

2371
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,039
going to happen they want to produce

2372
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,000
more hash and these hybrids do it

2373
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:38,639
so

2374
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,119
yeah it's happening you go to jamaica

2375
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,159
it's all hybrids in jamaica

2376
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,359
um

2377
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,679
so

2378
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:48,238
yeah this happens

2379
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:50,239
how accountable do you hold dutch

2380
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:53,479
genetics and the dutch breeders for

2381
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,479
these issues

2382
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,199
well the the dutch seed market was a big

2383
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,280
part of the market and at one time it

2384
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,119
was only dutch seeds there wasn't really

2385
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:07,840
any american companies or anybody else

2386
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:10,399
around to buy seeds from

2387
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,319
so you could say dna are they american

2388
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:14,719
or are they dutch

2389
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:16,960
yeah they're american but their company

2390
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,760
was in holland so

2391
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,079
yeah

2392
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,520
um

2393
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,639
yeah they bought seeds where they could

2394
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,159
buy seeds

2395
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,319
it doesn't matter if they're from dutch

2396
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,319
or from spanish people or

2397
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,439
they'll buy the seeds i think to grow

2398
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:31,119
that

2399
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:33,439
and what i've even heard that they grow

2400
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:35,920
the seeds out one year

2401
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,919
and the second year they grow the seeds

2402
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,480
from those seeds but the third year they

2403
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,560
don't do it

2404
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:43,839
so

2405
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,520
yeah

2406
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,880
and that's getting promised by anything

2407
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,400
so

2408
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,079
um

2409
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:51,920
yeah it's all about it it's just hash

2410
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:53,439
production isn't it absolutely that's

2411
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,679
that's another thing i suppose when you

2412
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:59,759
start going legal

2413
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,760
we move away from that sort of thing

2414
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,800
yeah it's a bit crazy so

2415
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,280
unrelated

2416
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,440
oh no kind of related i don't know

2417
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:12,960
do you plan to make a variety of other

2418
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:14,559
feminized seeds or just kind of the the

2419
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,119
one-off clone here and there that really

2420
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,840
proves itself yeah no i want to make

2421
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:23,359
some more feminized seeds um because

2422
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:26,239
people want those um orange turps sort

2423
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:27,759
of mandarine turps and feminized seeds

2424
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:30,000
and like i said before

2425
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:32,880
i can probably see them grow being grown

2426
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,760
out in morocco and things like this

2427
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,600
like

2428
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,440
um

2429
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,600
like you said tanji there's something

2430
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:41,839
tanji over there and stuff like this

2431
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,840
so

2432
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:46,799
another little indoor type of question

2433
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,039
what's your prediction for the future of

2434
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,279
the lighting technology

2435
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:52,560
um i can see a lot more people going

2436
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,238
over towards uh

2437
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,000
leds

2438
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:57,919
i think um

2439
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,279
just for power consumption and stuff

2440
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,279
like this

2441
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:02,319
um

2442
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:03,198
but

2443
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:04,559
yeah

2444
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:07,759
like i said before though i've been

2445
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,639
using gavitas but i'll probably change

2446
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,960
um

2447
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,359
soon i'm looking into a few different

2448
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,198
ones myself at the moment

2449
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:20,000
uh lumitec things like that so we'll see

2450
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:21,919
see what i go for in the end

2451
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,600
okay so a bit of a hot topic at the

2452
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,359
moment in the community but how do you

2453
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,760
feel about the idea of patenting

2454
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,559
genetics and strains within the industry

2455
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,960
and

2456
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,520
how do you kind of think this would work

2457
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,359
in regards to your own work

2458
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,920
i think

2459
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:41,519
patenting anything

2460
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,239
in this day and age

2461
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,040
is all [ __ ] to be honest

2462
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,039
but

2463
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:50,079
that's just my opinion

2464
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:51,279
yeah it's a plan at the end of the day

2465
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:52,960
so

2466
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,119
if someone buy

2467
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,399
buy the seeds off you

2468
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:58,639
um

2469
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,319
or if we're talking clones and it all

2470
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,600
depends what you're talking but yeah i

2471
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:03,119
think it's going to be a very hard thing

2472
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,079
what you're going to have a court case

2473
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:05,840
over it

2474
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,519
it's just yes

2475
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,560
just more

2476
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:12,560
i needed stress i think

2477
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,800
yeah i just wanted to ask you one other

2478
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,880
question about when you're in india did

2479
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,639
you at any point kind of think of any

2480
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,000
modern hybrids or you thought this would

2481
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,920
do well here

2482
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,359
yeah but i think if we

2483
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,239
yeah i wouldn't want to take anything

2484
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:25,439
there

2485
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:27,039
and then

2486
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:28,960
you know that they would start growing

2487
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:30,719
here and you know they would save the

2488
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,760
seeds from here so

2489
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,279
i think

2490
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,360
taking anything there would sort of

2491
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:37,679
destroy their genetics i think keeping

2492
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:40,639
it as it is is the best way

2493
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:42,639
um and not to take anything there

2494
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:45,359
um but i think a lot of things would do

2495
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:47,119
well then yeah

2496
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:48,960
oh yeah i meant more like theoretically

2497
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,880
like is there any clones in your library

2498
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,399
that you like just could off the top of

2499
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,440
your head be like yeah that'll do well

2500
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,960
there

2501
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:58,000
person hates the person hayes from sonic

2502
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,960
i think

2503
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,359
um

2504
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,439
i worked with that line a bit and

2505
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:06,799
it's a field full of that update would

2506
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:06,799
be absolutely amazing

2507
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,960
yeah wow

2508
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:11,279
[Music]

2509
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,600
so what do you feel about the idea of

2510
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:16,000
kind of these genetically modified

2511
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,840
strains to have like specific

2512
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,840
cannabinoid and terpene profiles

2513
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:25,119
um

2514
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,639
in what way genetically modified like

2515
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:29,840
proper genetically modified you're

2516
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,840
talking about yeah

2517
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,560
um i don't know i don't think there's

2518
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,440
any need for it i think

2519
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,360
we could we can do it all with selection

2520
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,719
time and space

2521
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,799
yeah

2522
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,279
it's already happening

2523
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,600
yeah yeah it's not something that i i i

2524
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,359
would uh agree with it

2525
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,480
yeah

2526
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:54,238
yeah binting to see how it all plays out

2527
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,799
um

2528
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,879
so i did want to ask one question about

2529
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,800
the cup i should have asked that earlier

2530
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,159
you know how we kind of implied like

2531
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,719
some cubs

2532
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,399
it's kind of pay to play or pay to win

2533
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,079
how would you feel if at one of those

2534
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:09,359
cups that you really thought was kind of

2535
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:10,559
like you know you got to pay to get

2536
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:13,039
somewhere

2537
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,400
like you just won like would it restore

2538
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:16,479
your faith in the competition we'd be

2539
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:18,799
like i guess it's not rigged yeah it

2540
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:20,559
would probably change my opinion what i

2541
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,639
tend to see is like

2542
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,239
third place tends to be the real sort of

2543
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,159
like the winner and the first two are

2544
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:27,359
the people that have like paid the most

2545
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:30,319
for

2546
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:33,519
um sponsorship or whatever

2547
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:35,439
but yeah if if that happened

2548
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,719
yeah i'd be uh

2549
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:38,879
i thought i would have to look a little

2550
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,319
bit differently

2551
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:44,000
something i wanted to ask you what's the

2552
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:45,679
weirdest plant mutation you've ever seen

2553
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
um

2554
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:49,920
i think one that i see a lot is like um

2555
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,479
you know the flat stem thing

2556
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,399
yeah yeah plant fasciation yeah that's

2557
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:56,638
it yeah um

2558
01:28:54,399 --> 01:29:00,158
that way you get like the almost like

2559
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:02,319
the mohawk style bud at the top or like

2560
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,599
four stems where there should be two and

2561
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:05,198
stuff like this

2562
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,560
but i've seen a lot of like where you

2563
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,000
get the bud growing from the middle of

2564
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,520
the leaf

2565
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,679
yeah um

2566
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,400
the i've seen one recently i think it

2567
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:17,039
was dna genetics put it up

2568
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:19,920
and it was like a leaf with like

2569
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:22,399
actually on the actual leaves not in the

2570
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,440
center of the leaf on the leaves itself

2571
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:27,920
there was little buddlers coming out

2572
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:29,039
so little calyx is growing from that so

2573
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,800
um

2574
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:32,639
i've i have recently had a male with a

2575
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,760
male parts grown from the center of the

2576
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,520
leaf

2577
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,840
and

2578
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,719
there was some guys in

2579
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,480
uh

2580
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:44,079
one line i can't remember a freak show

2581
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,678
okay it was called freak show i don't

2582
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:48,238
know if you've seen this one

2583
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:50,960
yeah yeah i seen that one yeah that one

2584
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:53,439
was absolutely crazy but i've never come

2585
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,679
across anything like that myself

2586
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,119
um i've had things come out similar to

2587
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,880
like the duck spot

2588
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:00,479
where they have that like webbing almost

2589
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,760
on the leaves

2590
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:04,319
um

2591
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,920
and yeah i think they're the sort of

2592
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:09,920
main mutations that i've come across

2593
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,840
yeah definitely just in case anyone

2594
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,359
wasn't aware of that freak show thing

2595
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,440
you can go look it up but what i found

2596
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:17,599
most interesting was it actually that

2597
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,839
plant and i think there was a male or

2598
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,079
two that also had similar traits it

2599
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,760
actually came from a pack of coastal

2600
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:25,600
seeds shout out bob

2601
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,320
and the crew over there and it was like

2602
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,719
a

2603
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:30,559
uh what was it big sir

2604
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,920
hybrid so i was like oh that's

2605
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,280
interesting because big sur is like a

2606
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,960
weird one already like some people think

2607
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,359
it's kind of auto flowering even though

2608
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,560
it's like a photo period one so maybe we

2609
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:40,559
need to push some of these weird

2610
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,280
genetics a bit harder

2611
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,600
yeah um i spoke to those guys with the

2612
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:47,920
freak show but they're working that line

2613
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,840
themselves um doing some stuff so it'd

2614
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,800
be interesting to pop some of those

2615
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,880
seeds

2616
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,480
um i think definitely people need to

2617
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,800
when they find that maybe work it a

2618
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:59,039
little bit more so they

2619
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,679
so it actually becomes a little bit of a

2620
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:04,079
unusual line

2621
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,880
i think that's just more for like

2622
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,439
just

2623
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,039
the fun and educational side of things i

2624
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,119
would like to do that

2625
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,439
maybe it can have a place where it could

2626
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,960
be grown where people don't want the

2627
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:19,198
typical leaves to be seen i think maybe

2628
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,039
that's the only i think

2629
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:23,198
uh purpose that

2630
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:25,119
it could be used for really

2631
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:27,119
yeah like a better version of australian

2632
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,880
bastard cannabis the abc because i'm

2633
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:30,960
pretty confident this uh freak show

2634
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,719
one's probably got a better high

2635
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,639
yeah they were saying it's got some nice

2636
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:36,239
terps to it as well so but i can see a

2637
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,319
lot of people wanting to buy that still

2638
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:40,000
you know just to grow out

2639
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:43,439
yeah it's something something that uh

2640
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,359
inspector from csi has taught me is that

2641
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,519
as little commercial value as some of

2642
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:49,359
these mutations may have they're still

2643
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,040
very interesting and worth preserving

2644
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,880
and trying to progress because who knows

2645
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,238
what's locked inside and which may be of

2646
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,560
use later on

2647
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,799
yeah yeah exactly exactly

2648
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:00,639
anybody that collects seeds i'm sure

2649
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,440
they'd want to buy a packet maybe to put

2650
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,359
in their library or something like this

2651
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:06,479
yeah or as we're talking it last time

2652
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:08,238
they uh

2653
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,638
collect a packed test and it ends up in

2654
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:12,959
the library

2655
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:15,920
yeah yeah exactly

2656
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:18,079
oh gosh okay so do you feel like viruses

2657
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,760
specific to cannabis are going to

2658
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,639
increase given you know the large-scale

2659
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:25,199
commercialization that's going to occur

2660
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:27,039
throughout the world in the coming years

2661
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:28,319
yes that will happen

2662
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:29,519
um

2663
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:32,158
i think

2664
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,600
breeding maybe more resistant strains

2665
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:35,359
and stuff like that one thing i've been

2666
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,199
even looking into is like

2667
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,479
breeding a line

2668
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:40,559
that's uh

2669
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:42,638
uh can produce

2670
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,679
the same amount

2671
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,600
and same growth rates on less water and

2672
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:50,319
less nutrients

2673
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,679
so like almost like an eco weed i think

2674
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:53,279
that'll be maybe something for the

2675
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,279
future

2676
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:57,679
yeah right it was almost like trying to

2677
01:32:55,279 --> 01:33:00,960
get that uh trait out of hemp and put it

2678
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:03,119
back into the medicinal cultivar

2679
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,279
yeah that's it yeah that's it

2680
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,198
yeah so there's always like i think um

2681
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:09,599
like you said the commercial thing is

2682
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,559
always going to bring more uh

2683
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:15,920
problems and those problems will become

2684
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:18,639
resistant to things that people use

2685
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,920
and yeah stronger so harder to get rid

2686
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:21,920
of in the end

2687
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,600
which is a which will be a big problem i

2688
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,199
can see

2689
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,360
so with that being said if you were

2690
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:30,000
given the opportunity to grow a field of

2691
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:32,000
say lil or mandarina

2692
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,600
in the moroccan roof valley would you

2693
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,600
capitalize on it or would it be a hard

2694
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,600
pass

2695
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:40,879
i think people are gonna buy the seeds

2696
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,920
anyway

2697
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,199
um

2698
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,239
so

2699
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:45,198
uh

2700
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:48,079
whether

2701
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:51,279
they buy them from morocco or spain the

2702
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:53,359
seeds get sold um

2703
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:55,920
i've yeah they've already done some

2704
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:58,880
mandarina cush out there and

2705
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,039
what else was it orange soda and

2706
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,960
uh i'm trying to think what else uh

2707
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:04,399
gingerbread so

2708
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,239
there's been a few things growing out

2709
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,799
there and people send me photos and

2710
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:10,799
stuff like this so yeah

2711
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,119
interesting and how would you predict

2712
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,639
that it would change the uh the overall

2713
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:16,158
effect of those plants because earlier

2714
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:19,279
on you mentioned that

2715
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:20,879
um you know when you got some seeds from

2716
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:22,880
the uh the mountains and grew them back

2717
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,400
here they're much more kind of squat and

2718
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,319
indica like compared to when they're in

2719
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:28,879
the mountains so in the reverse

2720
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:30,399
situation how do you think your plants

2721
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,639
would come out when grown there do you

2722
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:34,079
think they'd be more sativa or yeah give

2723
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,079
us your ideas

2724
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,279
yeah a little bit but they they

2725
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:38,800
the gingerbread's a little bit more

2726
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:40,880
indica in structure anyway the other

2727
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,239
ones are a bit more sativa

2728
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,199
but the

2729
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:47,279
terpenes um

2730
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:48,799
yeah they retain terpenes so well with

2731
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,319
the conditions that they grow them and

2732
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,360
dry them and all of this sort of stuff

2733
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:54,479
so

2734
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:56,719
it uh puts up with those conditions and

2735
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,399
makes some of the best hash that's come

2736
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,198
out of that like

2737
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:01,439
yeah

2738
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:03,519
i think one of the guys got the first

2739
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:05,519
place in the monsters cup in the span

2740
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,480
abyss last year

2741
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,719
so

2742
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:11,118
yeah amazing hatch amazing hunch gets

2743
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:13,439
produced from there

2744
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:16,639
so what strain so far that you've been

2745
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:19,439
able to experience makes the best hash

2746
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,760
the gingerbread and the orange soda the

2747
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,638
orange soda from the colada

2748
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,840
they it was some amazing hash amazing

2749
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:30,000
hush i really enjoyed

2750
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,760
that yeah wow and then so what are kind

2751
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,439
of some of the old school strains of

2752
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,440
yesteryear that you'd like to see come

2753
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:37,919
back

2754
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:39,599
the afghanis they're coming back already

2755
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,840
i'm seeing so many people growing them

2756
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,840
so um we're going to see a lot more

2757
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,639
old-school hash plants i've been coming

2758
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,560
back

2759
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,679
these coming years

2760
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,119
um

2761
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:51,118
and i even can see some of the old

2762
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:53,279
sativas coming back just because of the

2763
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,799
high that they produce

2764
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:57,359
because uh

2765
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,400
yeah something special in them so i can

2766
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:00,719
see

2767
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,719
the sativas coming back some maybe like

2768
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,639
old african stuff

2769
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,800
do you think that it's arguably

2770
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:09,440
inevitable that we do move towards a

2771
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,840
more sativa orientated customer base

2772
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:14,000
within the community given that of

2773
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,679
course depressants in general alcohol

2774
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
opioids there's a huge market for them

2775
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:20,158
but when i look at things globally seems

2776
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,520
like overall more people worldwide are

2777
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:24,638
kind of into stimulants than

2778
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,239
antidepressants yeah i think a lot of

2779
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:29,039
people that i know

2780
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:31,039
like the more indicas just because they

2781
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:33,519
use it to relax

2782
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:34,880
and they use it to chill out

2783
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,840
um

2784
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,000
maybe

2785
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,840
get into like artwork and stuff like

2786
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,920
that it puts you into like a mum sort of

2787
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:46,319
meditative sort of state

2788
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:49,279
um but i really like the sativas as well

2789
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:51,359
like i just enjoy them for the daytime

2790
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:54,319
and i find that i can like really get

2791
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:56,559
into anything that i'm doing whether it

2792
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:58,399
be in the garden or in the house

2793
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,840
creating something or

2794
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:05,039
cooking or anything i'll just really get

2795
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,119
fully into it with this with the sativas

2796
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:09,840
so what's your favorite sativa

2797
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:12,479
from from my lines at the moment like i

2798
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,920
like the the high from the lil it's such

2799
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:15,359
a sort of

2800
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,880
beautiful

2801
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:21,759
up high um really sort of gets mind

2802
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,199
mind-blowing creative

2803
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,119
um

2804
01:37:23,198 --> 01:37:28,960
yeah but from the past

2805
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:31,198
um i i like sonic's per sang haze that

2806
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,719
for me sort of just

2807
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,399
was such a

2808
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,840
beautiful smoker

2809
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:37,039
enjoyable

2810
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,480
um

2811
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:39,920
such like

2812
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,118
uh pie again

2813
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,960
sort of gets

2814
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:44,319
the mind thinking

2815
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,639
yeah

2816
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:48,559
really really nice one

2817
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,520
yeah cool so i wanted to talk to you

2818
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,280
about hazes like what like the term haze

2819
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,520
is used as a general term because

2820
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:57,359
obviously not every haze has the

2821
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,199
original haze or even necessarily a

2822
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:00,960
derivative haze in it do you just feel

2823
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:03,039
like haze is kind of a term for like a

2824
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,520
few land race sativas kind of doing

2825
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:06,479
their thing together

2826
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,119
um

2827
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,959
yeah i think haze now is

2828
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:14,158
seems to be

2829
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:17,198
any sativa that smells a certain way

2830
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:17,920
with this like hazy spicy sort of smell

2831
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,638
that

2832
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,079
people sort of associated with

2833
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,639
um

2834
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,479
but yeah i find

2835
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,760
um

2836
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:29,439
like

2837
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,000
a lot of things have that similar sort

2838
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:33,678
of spice but they're more on that dry

2839
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,479
side and so

2840
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,118
yeah

2841
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:39,279
they vary

2842
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:41,279
yeah that that terpene profile is so

2843
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:44,800
common isn't it that haze one and i

2844
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:47,840
remember being able to smoke some of uh

2845
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,360
what was it the c5 haze with bodhi and

2846
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,639
the first thing that came to mind when i

2847
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,719
exhaled i was like who would have

2848
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:55,118
thought you know c5 haze tastes like

2849
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,118
haze

2850
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,198
yeah this is a it's um what was the one

2851
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:02,638
i was smoking a bit of uh c4 i think it

2852
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:04,479
was

2853
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,880
is there a c4

2854
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,959
i'm not sure it could could well be but

2855
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,679
yeah there's quite a few different ones

2856
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,118
but like they all have that

2857
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,440
underlining

2858
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,519
yeah haze terpene it's almost like a

2859
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:18,719
spiced thing that's how i would describe

2860
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,960
it

2861
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:23,198
yeah yeah more more spice than just a

2862
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,198
pure mango thing but when you smell it

2863
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:27,919
you immediately kind of go yeah this is

2864
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:28,879
where it all delineates from right

2865
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,639
yeah

2866
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:33,199
you see that smelling there's so many

2867
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,079
like different land races as well

2868
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:35,118
yeah

2869
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:37,198
um

2870
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:38,639
i've come across that in in so many

2871
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:42,719
different lines

2872
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:45,279
uh from like caribbean and colombian a

2873
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:47,600
lot of colombian stuff over that way and

2874
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,960
south american stuff i've smelled it

2875
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,960
from

2876
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,359
yeah okay south american that's one that

2877
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,719
hasn't really been too delved into is

2878
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:56,000
that something you're looking to explore

2879
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,480
at all

2880
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,639
what a little trip to south america yeah

2881
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:02,238
if it needs to happen it gotta happen

2882
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,679
right yeah

2883
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:05,198
we'll be talking about our trip to

2884
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:06,079
afghanistan

2885
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:07,118
so

2886
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,000
um

2887
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:12,319
afghan black honey black yeah he's he's

2888
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,359
saying come out there alex want is well

2889
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:16,399
up for it from landry's legacy

2890
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,079
so

2891
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:20,960
yeah there might be a little

2892
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:22,800
afghanistan mission going on

2893
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,399
yeah true that's right because like when

2894
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,400
when we're at the emerald cup and i was

2895
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:29,759
talking to a few different people along

2896
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:31,439
with alex from land race legacies um

2897
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,880
it was interesting because they were i

2898
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:34,479
think it was actually cagey who was

2899
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,760
saying to me oh you know this guy's got

2900
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:37,839
a british passport he can go to

2901
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,679
afghanistan he kind of made the point

2902
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,600
you know it's a lot harder for us guys

2903
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:43,600
to go there so maybe we need to get our

2904
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,600
butts over there and make it happen

2905
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,679
yeah and

2906
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:51,119
i think i'll stand out quite a bit over

2907
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:54,000
there this is my only worry um

2908
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:56,349
and uh speaking to my daddy his first uh

2909
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,600
reaction was uh no no no no no

2910
01:40:56,350 --> 01:41:01,760
[Laughter]

2911
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,159
yeah for anyone who's not aware banana

2912
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,800
man's got a pretty comprehensive amount

2913
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:06,799
of tattoos

2914
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,039
okay

2915
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:12,479
so what's the kind of one of the more

2916
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:14,560
old school breeders whose work you

2917
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,638
really admire

2918
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:19,199
i like the work that um

2919
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:20,480
dj shorts has done with the all of his

2920
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:23,198
like stuff

2921
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:25,279
um i like the fact that like

2922
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:27,279
all the sort of like the flow the

2923
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,719
blueberry stuff like this they were all

2924
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:30,880
really good lines

2925
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,480
and his breathing

2926
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:36,239
style i think

2927
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:38,718
was was quite um

2928
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:40,000
interesting to read about especially a

2929
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,920
younger age

2930
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,359
did you ever read any of the articles

2931
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,639
where he spoke about

2932
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:49,118
selecting males while on psychedelics

2933
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:50,880
no i haven't actually that no that one

2934
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:53,118
that would be quite interesting because

2935
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,600
i think this is a big thing for me like

2936
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:57,118
on on mushrooms and

2937
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,039
even on like

2938
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:02,158
um small amounts of

2939
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:04,238
dmt and but repeatedly smoking and going

2940
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:05,118
in like yeah

2941
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:07,198
they

2942
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:09,599
it's almost like the plants speak to you

2943
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:11,759
yeah and these uh

2944
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,719
substances guide you

2945
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,079
so

2946
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,520
yeah it's going to be interesting to

2947
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:16,880
have a read on them you'll have to send

2948
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,480
me some links

2949
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,800
yeah man i'll dig it up for you but i

2950
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:23,519
guess a pertinent question to ask is our

2951
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:25,600
friend um afghan black honey kush he's

2952
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,600
come up a few times do you know if he

2953
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:31,039
plans to do seed increases or is more of

2954
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,039
just like an awesome contact

2955
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:36,158
no i can imagine they're going to be

2956
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:39,679
some seed releases going on and i can

2957
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:41,519
imagine um himalayan connection

2958
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:42,800
um

2959
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,480
he's going to be

2960
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,320
probably doing some

2961
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,399
nice seed releases i think he's got one

2962
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:49,279
going on right at the moment which

2963
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:51,279
a lot of

2964
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:52,800
some of the afghan seeds and

2965
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:53,599
stuff like this

2966
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,639
so

2967
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,760
yeah

2968
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:59,760
they're going on now at the moment

2969
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,600
yeah awesome and how do you feel that'll

2970
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,400
affect the community having access to

2971
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:07,039
these pure land races

2972
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:09,439
um i think it's gonna really help the

2973
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:12,880
community i think it's gonna be a really

2974
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:14,158
good educational tool for for people

2975
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,279
um

2976
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:17,359
and

2977
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:20,880
yeah uh

2978
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:21,920
it's just like a dream almost so like if

2979
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,359
i had

2980
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,560
access to some

2981
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:26,880
real

2982
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,000
afghan genetics when i was younger

2983
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:33,600
direct from the farmer from afghanistan

2984
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,840
like that's pretty an amazing thing so

2985
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,840
yeah

2986
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:40,000
yeah

2987
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:42,000
i feel ya so you mentioned bubba kush

2988
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,920
already as you know one of kind of the

2989
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,679
old school clones you're a fan of what

2990
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,440
other old-school clones struck a chord

2991
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,960
with you whether you have them or not

2992
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:51,198
the sfv

2993
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,439
i really enjoyed that one

2994
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:54,319
crowberry that's something that we used

2995
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:56,719
to have

2996
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,399
it was just some seeds that came over it

2997
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,000
was on the forum

2998
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:01,920
uh days

2999
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,118
and a guy called monkey had done a

3000
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,920
selection

3001
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:06,000
and

3002
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,440
that was a real special plant the

3003
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,479
crowberry

3004
01:44:07,439 --> 01:44:10,879
um

3005
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,718
what else do i have

3006
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:16,159
some real nice things

3007
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:18,079
the lemon larry lemon lario g that was a

3008
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:20,799
real nice special one

3009
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:24,079
and the east coast sour diesel

3010
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:25,920
always always such an amazing plant and

3011
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:27,359
flavor yeah

3012
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,359
so i think

3013
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,399
lozenge from

3014
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:32,399
from uh

3015
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:34,638
back in the day of the clones on the

3016
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:36,879
forum times

3017
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:38,079
yeah crowberry i've never heard of that

3018
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,920
what's what's inside that one

3019
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:42,000
genetically

3020
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:45,920
okay it's um

3021
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,279
a grand daddy purple crossed with

3022
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,000
blackberry

3023
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:50,960
i'm sure i'd have to double check that

3024
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,639
but

3025
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:55,520
um

3026
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:58,239
i ended up using it see look memory it

3027
01:44:55,520 --> 01:45:01,600
goes as you get older and i used it for

3028
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:02,638
the smurfberry cross

3029
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,880
and

3030
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:05,679
yeah just such an amazing plan to grow

3031
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,719
and

3032
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,639
like it would taste absolutely amazing

3033
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,719
down to the roach

3034
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,159
with this like sort of

3035
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,198
berry smell

3036
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:18,000
with that

3037
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:20,638
typical purple sort of

3038
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,118
um taste in the background like purple

3039
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,880
weed has a certain sort of

3040
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:28,479
serpent almost

3041
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:30,560
so it was like with that with this more

3042
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:32,959
berry tone going on

3043
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:35,679
but yeah so many people drew that album

3044
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,840
it was such a good plan

3045
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:40,880
so what do you think will be

3046
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:45,000
basically the next major flavor profile

3047
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,000
to take a hold on the scene

3048
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:50,639
i think people fruity stuff

3049
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:53,519
um people seem to really be liking the

3050
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,520
lil at the moment

3051
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:58,880
and i'm seeing more people bringing out

3052
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:01,359
pineappley sort of things so i can see

3053
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:03,440
maybe that the pineapple turp coming up

3054
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:05,359
coming back

3055
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:07,279
um

3056
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,359
yeah i think that might be a new one to

3057
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:12,639
come back round i see everything coming

3058
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:15,198
back around in circles it seems

3059
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:18,319
it's like fashion right like i remember

3060
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:20,079
it seems like gas strains have like kind

3061
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:21,679
of snuck back in but also kind of

3062
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:23,359
sneaking out and i'm waiting for the

3063
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,960
fruity stuff to come back i love that

3064
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:27,599
i've got to agree with gooey breeder on

3065
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,600
that one that's where i think it's at

3066
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,440
yeah yeah freebie definitely that's

3067
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,360
where i'm at as well i think the fruity

3068
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:36,319
stuff's coming back

3069
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:38,559
um i think like everybody that's growing

3070
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:40,960
this lil at the moment

3071
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:44,719
like i was so surprised with the smell

3072
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:46,800
myself when i found that that that fino

3073
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:49,198
like i was literally just dancing in the

3074
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:51,600
room i was just like wow this is amazing

3075
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:52,799
and i just kept going back smelling it

3076
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,560
and like

3077
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,400
it's so nice to get those messages off

3078
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,320
people they're just like wow i've never

3079
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:01,279
smelled anything like this or

3080
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:03,599
this is like just pure tropical juice

3081
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:05,920
papaya people are saying one person was

3082
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:08,719
saying he smells like cream

3083
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,639
and strawberries with pineapple and i'm

3084
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:12,880
just like wow this is yeah

3085
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:15,359
this is that's this is this is the tip

3086
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:17,279
that people are loving

3087
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,000
yeah definitely okay

3088
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:20,319
so

3089
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,399
what do you think about the rise of the

3090
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:24,639
vape pens you know we've seen that

3091
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:27,039
glorious south park episode calling it

3092
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,639
the [ __ ] sticks um

3093
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:30,880
how do you feel it seems to me like it's

3094
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:33,279
the bridge between the everyday joe

3095
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,199
who's not really a consumer and our

3096
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:38,158
community so to speak do you feel like

3097
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:38,158
it's a good or a bad thing

3098
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:42,718
yeah i think um there's a it's

3099
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,679
a lot of people are going to use them

3100
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:48,239
just because it's just so easy to use um

3101
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:50,960
for the normal everyday person

3102
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:52,959
um yes but

3103
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,520
i think a lot of

3104
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,960
shitty materials being used

3105
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,840
for them

3106
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,439
um

3107
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,920
because i'm seeing if anything's really

3108
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,759
nice in flower form it's being sold as

3109
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:06,239
flower or

3110
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:08,639
maybe make it into extract or the really

3111
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:10,559
nice extract they're using really nice

3112
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:13,440
flour and then the lower grade extract

3113
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,119
they're using not so good flour and then

3114
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:16,879
it just goes down

3115
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,639
down and down and then

3116
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:21,039
it seems to be like the shittier stuff

3117
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:22,159
is being used for edibles

3118
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:24,639
and

3119
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:26,399
these are carts and stuff like that and

3120
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,880
i'm seeing so many of the carts just not

3121
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:30,839
passing tests in america

3122
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:34,480
so

3123
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:37,039
yeah education again education

3124
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:38,718
so i think a lot of the issues stemming

3125
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:41,439
from those carts relates to people

3126
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:44,480
buying the actual uh housing units the

3127
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:46,079
plastic and the um the little cartridges

3128
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:48,479
themselves from china and there's you

3129
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:50,079
know a plethora of associated issues

3130
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:51,919
with that do you think that essentially

3131
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,519
this is inevitable given that people

3132
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:56,560
selling these carts are looking to make

3133
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:58,159
money their game is profits despite the

3134
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,800
fact they may try to claim it's all

3135
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:04,000
about the patience how do you think you

3136
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,520
deal with this conundrum

3137
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,679
um

3138
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:10,080
yeah um

3139
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,079
i think

3140
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:16,960
more testing and stuff like that um like

3141
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:19,359
you're saying then if they're buying the

3142
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:22,239
carts from china and they're releasing

3143
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:24,479
all those toxins into the stuff

3144
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:25,678
yeah

3145
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:28,319
like

3146
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:30,560
yeah people just it's more education

3147
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,960
more research into these things

3148
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:35,280
and maybe some more guidelines that

3149
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,359
people need to be like sticking to when

3150
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:40,559
they are making these products

3151
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:40,559
for a legal market

3152
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,000
how do you feel people can ascertain

3153
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,760
whether the person they're buying off

3154
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,960
really has their best interests in mind

3155
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,679
do you think it's just like you have to

3156
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:51,599
know someone for a while

3157
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,480
yeah this is where like it goes back to

3158
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,960
the whole thing of um

3159
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:58,158
going to a farmer's market or go into a

3160
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,158
shop

3161
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:02,000
um

3162
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:03,920
like

3163
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,279
big companies are only interested in

3164
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,440
profit

3165
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:09,679
uh most of these carts are being made

3166
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:10,960
just for pure profit

3167
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:12,158
so

3168
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,920
i think

3169
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:16,799
there you go

3170
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,560
it says it there basically so most of

3171
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:22,079
these companies are more interested in

3172
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:23,520
profit than the people themselves

3173
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:25,599
um

3174
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,480
so yeah talking about it more i think

3175
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:28,480
with

3176
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:29,919
other people this is where like forums

3177
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:30,718
come into thing

3178
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,719
again

3179
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,920
it's a place that we can discuss these

3180
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:36,399
topics

3181
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,359
openly with lots of people maybe get

3182
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:41,519
somewhere from that

3183
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:42,559
yeah okay

3184
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,960
so

3185
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,880
kind of an extension of that idea of the

3186
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:49,198
vape pens and whatnot how do you feel

3187
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:52,159
about the introduction of non-cannabis

3188
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:54,079
derived terpenes to cannabis or even the

3189
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,319
reintroduction do you feel like this

3190
01:50:54,079 --> 01:51:00,158
idea of removing and then adding back is

3191
01:50:56,319 --> 01:51:00,158
deleterious to the overall effect

3192
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,959
yeah it's not something that um i've

3193
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,960
really looked into at all

3194
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,520
um but

3195
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,920
yeah i don't think it's something that

3196
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,000
we should be doing i don't think there's

3197
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:16,639
any need for using

3198
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,960
non-cannabis derived terpenes

3199
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:21,199
um or if you are

3200
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,198
what is the reason is it just for the

3201
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:25,598
flavor or is it because those terpenes

3202
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:26,719
have a medicinal use as well

3203
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:29,199
so

3204
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:31,439
like i think a lot more research needs

3205
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:32,399
to be done in this area

3206
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:34,879
um

3207
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:36,399
especially about terpenes i think that's

3208
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,239
going to be something for the future

3209
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:41,039
like um

3210
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:42,238
i think they play a massive role

3211
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:43,679
in

3212
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:44,799
healing

3213
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,199
in

3214
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,199
um

3215
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:53,039
many other forms the high it creates so

3216
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:55,118
yeah more testing needs to be done

3217
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:57,439
definitely

3218
01:51:55,118 --> 01:52:00,000
yeah i mean something which kind of

3219
01:51:57,439 --> 01:52:02,158
opened my eyes a little bit is that

3220
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,079
everyone always knows that terpenes play

3221
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:06,000
some sort of modulatory role with

3222
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:08,719
cannabis you know because a weed with

3223
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,639
terpenes gets you really high that same

3224
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:12,560
weed that's been in a cupboard for

3225
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:15,760
months and it's lost all the terpenes

3226
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,199
it's just not the same and you know the

3227
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,960
implication is that you know the

3228
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:21,439
terpenes are the thing which is causing

3229
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,480
the main change and then you realize

3230
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:25,039
that

3231
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:27,519
thc itself is actually a terpene by

3232
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:29,198
definition and to me that really linked

3233
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:30,560
it all together a whole lot more you

3234
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:33,279
know and i don't think many people are

3235
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,280
aware of that

3236
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,719
yeah

3237
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,639
um

3238
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:42,800
no this is it like

3239
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:42,800
education on this subject

3240
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:48,158
and sharing all this knowledge needs to

3241
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,280
be done on a more sort of like regular

3242
01:52:48,158 --> 01:52:51,279
basis

3243
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:54,479
and because there's so much to learn

3244
01:52:51,279 --> 01:52:55,439
about this plan and it's only the start

3245
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:57,759
because

3246
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:59,519
we're only now being able to do the

3247
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,199
things that

3248
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,239
we want to do

3249
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:05,198
um

3250
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:07,118
i'm still struggling where i am um but

3251
01:53:05,198 --> 01:53:08,879
still there are places that we can have

3252
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:10,000
things tested

3253
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,840
um

3254
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,399
but

3255
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:14,239
america uh

3256
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:16,799
they're gonna be able to

3257
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:19,678
do so many different things now

3258
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:22,480
now that it's opened up how it has

3259
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,199
yeah of course of course

3260
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:24,759
so

3261
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:26,559
do you think that with the

3262
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:28,079
commercialization of things we've been

3263
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,480
talking about that there's going to be

3264
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:32,880
this increasing tendency to kind of

3265
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:35,118
intellectualize breathing and that the

3266
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,279
idea of using a lab to do it will just

3267
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:38,960
become the common and people using first

3268
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,840
principles to select a male is just

3269
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,198
going to go out the window

3270
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,960
um

3271
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:46,319
yeah um

3272
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,158
i think

3273
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:50,238
a lot of the maybe some of the other

3274
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:52,000
companies will maybe go down this line

3275
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:53,839
or like

3276
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,158
i don't know if it was you on one of the

3277
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:57,360
europa interviews was talking about uh a

3278
01:53:56,158 --> 01:53:59,598
computer

3279
01:53:57,359 --> 01:54:00,960
generated breeding program

3280
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,840
yep

3281
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,840
yeah yeah i can see it going down those

3282
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:09,840
lines and stuff but

3283
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,719
we'll see how how how they do

3284
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,639
um

3285
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,158
and what they make

3286
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:15,679
from doing it that way

3287
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:17,039
um i think it's all going to be very

3288
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:19,118
interesting

3289
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,158
but um

3290
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:22,079
yeah

3291
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:24,399
i don't know if they can i think his

3292
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:26,880
breathing's a little bit of art as well

3293
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:28,559
as science

3294
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,279
you know with that being said about the

3295
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,360
old ways of breeding you know using your

3296
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:34,479
nose and not so much relying on the uh

3297
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:36,319
the labs

3298
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:38,799
how long would you be willing to work a

3299
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:40,399
line before you call it quits let's just

3300
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,159
say you made lil and there was something

3301
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:43,118
about it you weren't happy with and

3302
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:44,559
you're like all right i'll just i'll

3303
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:46,399
just work it for a generation or two

3304
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:48,080
i'll fix that up and it kind of doesn't

3305
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:49,598
come you know at least not in one or two

3306
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:51,439
generations at what point would you be

3307
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:54,159
like look this has just been too much of

3308
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:54,158
a time sink

3309
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:57,840
um

3310
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,080
um

3311
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:02,800
yeah if it's not doing what i wanted to

3312
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:05,679
after a couple of generations

3313
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,560
then i'd probably scrap that line

3314
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:07,760
if

3315
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,280
um

3316
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,800
if it was like

3317
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:11,439
um

3318
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,159
a

3319
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:16,000
certain taste say i was looking for

3320
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:17,439
and i was only getting a certain

3321
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,439
percentage

3322
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,678
i could maybe still release it but

3323
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,158
explain that you're only going to get 50

3324
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:26,480
percent of this type of fino

3325
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:30,000
um and this one and you might get this

3326
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:32,158
one or maybe we used to do this on on on

3327
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,840
breed bay anyway like we'd fill out a

3328
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:36,000
little form and explain like how many

3329
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:38,319
phenos of this type and stuff like that

3330
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,279
so maybe like a little bit more of that

3331
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:41,279
should be done anyway

3332
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,040
yeah no i i understand so

3333
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:47,039
um

3334
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:49,439
do you feel like this plays into the

3335
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:52,079
idea of why people have this tendency to

3336
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:54,158
release f1s like it seems like not many

3337
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:56,079
people are working lines further and

3338
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:57,279
there's obviously a commercial reason

3339
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:59,039
for that because

3340
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:01,599
it takes time and money and you're not

3341
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:02,800
exactly evenly compensated like a strain

3342
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,199
that goes through

3343
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,800
several generations of work doesn't go

3344
01:56:05,198 --> 01:56:08,719
necessarily for

3345
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,719
like three or four times the cost of an

3346
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:12,800
f1 how do you think we combat that

3347
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:14,158
because there seems to be a like a want

3348
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,920
for people to like you know the

3349
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:17,679
consumers want breeders to work the

3350
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,840
lines to stabilize them more but at the

3351
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:23,039
same time if the financial compensation

3352
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,920
isn't there how do we encourage it

3353
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:25,599
yeah

3354
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,880
um

3355
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:32,159
yeah this is a hard one like um

3356
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:34,639
for me yeah it's it's time so i've been

3357
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:35,839
making a lot more f ones and releasing

3358
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:36,880
them

3359
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,440
um

3360
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:42,000
but during that i will work

3361
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:43,279
some other lines and yeah takes the time

3362
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,719
to do it

3363
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:49,920
but i i'm not i don't get any more

3364
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:52,639
uh price on the seeds if anything

3365
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,800
my more work lines are cheaper than my

3366
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:55,599
f1 lines

3367
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,039
so

3368
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:59,039
yeah

3369
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:01,679
yeah okay so do you feel like maybe the

3370
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:04,399
introduction of a standardized

3371
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:06,239
seed pricing model would be a benefit to

3372
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:08,879
the community and that you know everyone

3373
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:11,678
sells f1s for around this price everyone

3374
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:14,400
sells f2s for around this price and it

3375
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:16,719
enforces like both a floor and a ceiling

3376
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:19,679
to the pricing

3377
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:20,960
yeah it'd be interesting but um

3378
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:23,760
i think

3379
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,198
the seed market the pricing is so varied

3380
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,239
at the moment

3381
01:57:25,198 --> 01:57:28,879
um

3382
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:31,279
i've increased some prices like the

3383
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,920
cherry spice because

3384
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:36,319
the amount of the seeds that it produces

3385
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:38,560
is just like so little compared to other

3386
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:39,359
other things i pollinate

3387
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,199
so

3388
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,559
um

3389
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:44,799
like

3390
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:46,880
i think that i've done it like this so

3391
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:49,920
i've tried to work out which lines sort

3392
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:53,199
of cost me more to make or have done and

3393
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,560
i've tried to do it like this but

3394
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,479
um

3395
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:58,639
yeah it varies so much then you've got

3396
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,479
other people just charging

3397
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:03,520
500

3398
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:05,279
600 for a packet that's just built on

3399
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,400
hype

3400
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:08,399
so

3401
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:09,679
a pricing would be interesting to see

3402
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:12,238
what people

3403
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,319
um come up with

3404
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:16,799
yeah right let's let's delve into this

3405
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:18,960
let's get a little bit feisty so cookie

3406
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,039
fam with that candy rain they still

3407
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,960
haven't fixed anyone up for those issues

3408
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:25,599
they had and i'm sure you're well aware

3409
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:28,079
of this given the uk is pretty well in

3410
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:30,319
the grips of the hype market how do you

3411
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:32,479
feel about that sich

3412
01:58:30,319 --> 01:58:33,920
yeah okay so you may have to explain a

3413
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:37,039
little bit to me as well who made the

3414
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:39,359
candy rain exactly was that [ __ ]

3415
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:41,840
yeah see i don't know i heard rumors

3416
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:43,759
that it was colorado

3417
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,119
right okay okay

3418
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:46,880
okay

3419
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:49,920
at least he got dragged into it when

3420
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:51,279
people were asking for refunds

3421
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,079
right okay

3422
01:58:51,279 --> 01:58:54,000
yeah

3423
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:55,920
yeah i'm not too sure but that's all

3424
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,198
just crazy again isn't it it's all built

3425
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,279
on hype

3426
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:01,519
and they've totally released something

3427
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:02,559
without testing it

3428
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:05,760
and

3429
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,760
yeah people have been

3430
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:11,760
left a bit very disappointed i suppose

3431
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:15,439
yeah okay so do you feel there's an onus

3432
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,599
on 500 f1 packs to replace seats if they

3433
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:20,399
don't germinate

3434
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:22,319
yeah i think i think um things have

3435
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:25,439
happened in the past when we were online

3436
01:59:22,319 --> 01:59:27,840
i think it was a ic mag this was on

3437
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:28,960
or maybe one of the other forums

3438
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,199
um

3439
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,880
but somebody had made a line i won't go

3440
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,719
into like who it was and stuff like but

3441
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,960
somebody made line and they were auto

3442
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:39,039
flowering for some reason because when

3443
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,359
they were testing them they they tested

3444
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:44,238
them as seeds and just put them into

3445
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:45,359
flour without vegging them too much

3446
01:59:44,238 --> 01:59:46,319
so

3447
01:59:45,359 --> 01:59:48,960
um

3448
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:52,319
and that guy replaced people's seeds and

3449
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:54,639
made the effort to do that so i think

3450
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:57,599
i think yeah it's

3451
01:59:54,639 --> 02:00:01,760
you need to stick by your product

3452
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:03,360
so if if you made a mistake try to um

3453
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:06,000
give something back to the people that

3454
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:08,639
put money in your pocket

3455
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,319
yeah for sure so i mean i feel like i've

3456
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,239
already dug this hole so i may as well

3457
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:14,960
keep digging would you ever buy some

3458
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:16,959
cookie farm seeds

3459
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:19,359
no

3460
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:21,359
i could never pay for that price

3461
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:24,719
if they gave me a pack for free i might

3462
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:27,519
pop them just see what they were like

3463
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:30,079
and so how do you feel about the idea of

3464
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:33,520
these crews who can't even necessarily

3465
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:35,519
prove the uh the clear lineation of them

3466
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,880
creating the seeds having parental stock

3467
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,560
etc

3468
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:41,039
releasing seeds because from my

3469
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:42,639
perspective you know and and i'll caveat

3470
02:00:41,039 --> 02:00:44,238
this by saying any anyone from cookie

3471
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:47,039
family wants to come on the show hit me

3472
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:49,279
up dude but um but with that being said

3473
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:51,519
you know there's no clear evidence to me

3474
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:53,519
that like this wasn't a mistake so the

3475
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,360
idea that they're now releasing seeds

3476
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:58,000
under the guise of like oh well we made

3477
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,198
this it's like did you really and the

3478
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,960
seeds you're releasing are they going to

3479
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:01,839
be any good even

3480
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,599
yeah

3481
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,560
um i think

3482
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:06,159
it's just

3483
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,560
some i i know

3484
02:01:06,158 --> 02:01:10,158
people personally that bought a packet

3485
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,280
and stuff like this

3486
02:01:10,158 --> 02:01:12,879
like

3487
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:14,880
um

3488
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,000
it was it's just unbelievable and it's

3489
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:17,440
just all

3490
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,198
built on that

3491
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:19,919
that hype again

3492
02:01:19,198 --> 02:01:22,879
and

3493
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:24,560
people get sucked into it we see it with

3494
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,560
so many other things

3495
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,400
um

3496
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,800
with other products that you buy that

3497
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:32,638
you it's not a superior product but

3498
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,400
you're buying it because of the name on

3499
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:36,480
it

3500
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:37,519
if you know what i mean yeah no i feel

3501
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:38,559
you

3502
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:41,040
so

3503
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,639
just to kind of uh get ourselves out of

3504
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:44,719
this hole quickly

3505
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:47,039
but equally kind of controversial how

3506
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:49,118
would you react and how would you feel

3507
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:52,238
if someone you know kind of put a post

3508
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:55,519
up on instagram and it was like oh i've

3509
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:58,079
got s-ones for sale soon of mandarina of

3510
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,520
lilt of her saying hey you know all of

3511
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:01,519
these strains like how would that make

3512
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:03,040
you react

3513
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:05,920
um

3514
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:07,279
yeah like an s one um

3515
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:09,920
yeah it's a little i think that would be

3516
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:10,800
a little bit too much but to be totally

3517
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:13,359
honest

3518
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:16,320
i don't even think it'd bother me i i i

3519
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,439
don't like too much bother me nowadays

3520
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:18,399
um

3521
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:21,359
so

3522
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:24,079
um but i can understand like

3523
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:25,920
if someone's saying my mandarina

3524
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:28,479
someone's s wand it

3525
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,399
um i'm sure they did that in morocco to

3526
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:31,919
be honest you know and grew up the seeds

3527
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:33,279
and grew out the seeds and grew up the

3528
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:34,079
seeds

3529
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:36,079
so

3530
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:37,679
and someone asked me the other day could

3531
02:02:36,079 --> 02:02:41,118
they um

3532
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:44,000
feminize and make an orange soda

3533
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:46,639
for somebody that wants the seeds and

3534
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,639
i'm just like well to be honest with you

3535
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:51,039
it's probably something i'm gonna remake

3536
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:53,679
myself for some time

3537
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,920
i've had a few people make things that

3538
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,440
i might was thinking of sort of making

3539
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,599
and they've done the cross from seeds

3540
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:01,519
that they bought and stuff like that

3541
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:03,119
but it's not going to be like how i

3542
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:04,320
would make it anyway because of my

3543
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,238
selections

3544
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:08,238
like you can give someone the same

3545
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:09,598
ingredients but will they sort of cook

3546
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:10,399
the same meal

3547
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:12,159
like

3548
02:03:10,399 --> 02:03:14,479
yeah so it doesn't really matter too

3549
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:16,399
much but then i like to see that as well

3550
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:18,479
i like to see people use my genetics and

3551
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:20,559
maybe make something

3552
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:22,079
of their own from them by crossing

3553
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:23,199
something together

3554
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:24,079
so

3555
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:25,759
um

3556
02:03:24,079 --> 02:03:28,479
yeah i've seen a lot of two people have

3557
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:30,079
been using the cherry spice a few people

3558
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:31,439
have started using the lil with some

3559
02:03:30,079 --> 02:03:32,238
crosses

3560
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:33,598
so

3561
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:35,839
yeah um

3562
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:37,920
it's it's nice to see them being used

3563
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:39,920
and that they they think they're good

3564
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:41,599
enough to use compared to everything

3565
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:43,440
else that they've been growing which is

3566
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:45,840
really good but they've grown them out

3567
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:47,919
it's like i see people just crossing

3568
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:50,239
stuff wanting to cross stuff together

3569
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,158
before they've even grown them out

3570
02:03:50,238 --> 02:03:55,359
which just doesn't even make sense to me

3571
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:56,799
so at least they're doing some selection

3572
02:03:55,359 --> 02:03:58,799
yeah it's weird people not doing that

3573
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,800
selection but just to link back to your

3574
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,639
other point our our mutual body

3575
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:04,560
organically enhanced he he made some

3576
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,319
crosses with his cherry spice keeper he

3577
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:07,440
found i think he even used some mac

3578
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:08,399
pollen which

3579
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:10,719
definitely going to create an

3580
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:12,319
interesting cross but perfect segue to

3581
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:14,480
my next question thanks for bringing it

3582
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:16,960
up save me a bunch of effort how do you

3583
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:19,359
feel about other companies using your

3584
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:21,039
work in their crosses like do you feel

3585
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:23,279
overall it's a positive or sometimes it

3586
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:24,719
can be detrimental

3587
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:25,920
yeah it's not it's never really been a

3588
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:27,118
problem for me

3589
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,199
um

3590
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:30,960
like saying now somebody uses the

3591
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:32,638
mandarina in the cross

3592
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,480
and someone does grow that out and they

3593
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:36,078
like that terp

3594
02:04:34,479 --> 02:04:37,839
then they'll want to grow out the real

3595
02:04:36,078 --> 02:04:39,679
mandarina because you find so many

3596
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:42,239
different phenos in the mandarina like

3597
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:44,719
that but some better some some like more

3598
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:47,759
sweet some more sour so

3599
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:50,719
like i think people are always gonna go

3600
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:53,520
to the original once they find something

3601
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:54,960
that they like from the crosses

3602
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:57,520
um

3603
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,399
so yeah it's never really been a problem

3604
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,719
for me

3605
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:00,719
um

3606
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,440
but

3607
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,760
yeah it all depends if you're if you're

3608
02:05:03,439 --> 02:05:06,479
worried about them taking business from

3609
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,800
you

3610
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:10,238
yeah i think that's gonna happen anyway

3611
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,560
people are gonna buy seeds from

3612
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:13,598
elsewhere that tastes like orange

3613
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,400
yeah

3614
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:18,639
but if it's got mandarina in it or it

3615
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:19,679
hasn't got mandarina in it

3616
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:20,960
so

3617
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,319
yeah

3618
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,520
yeah okay

3619
02:05:22,319 --> 02:05:25,840
so

3620
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:27,280
what is the end goal of trichome jungle

3621
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:29,119
seeds i know it's a bit of a broad

3622
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:30,880
question but i mean do you kind of plan

3623
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:32,399
to do like a bit of a body and start

3624
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,400
another seed company for kind of

3625
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:35,839
alternative releases that wouldn't maybe

3626
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:37,759
otherwise fit under the banner of

3627
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:39,599
trichome jungles or is it just to kind

3628
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:40,960
of stick to what you've already got and

3629
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:42,880
you just kind of do whatever you want

3630
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:45,039
within that context there might be

3631
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,800
another company working with some other

3632
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:49,439
people um

3633
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:50,880
which will be um maybe based in the

3634
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:51,919
caribbean

3635
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,639
um

3636
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,279
but

3637
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:57,039
myself i'll do like different lines like

3638
02:05:55,279 --> 02:05:59,519
the cherry spice and little part of the

3639
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:01,599
finest selections

3640
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:04,239
um

3641
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:05,119
i've got a few other new things coming

3642
02:06:04,238 --> 02:06:08,319
up

3643
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:10,399
um so like i'll definitely make

3644
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:11,840
new like my standard lines would be i

3645
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:15,759
would say

3646
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:17,199
um mandarina jungle push mantis things

3647
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:19,840
like this

3648
02:06:17,198 --> 02:06:22,238
and then i had a bunch of lines that

3649
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:24,400
were like a feminized line

3650
02:06:22,238 --> 02:06:26,879
and then i stopped making them then i

3651
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:29,118
did the rose water cookie line

3652
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,039
i stopped making them

3653
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:32,799
i'll work the rose water cookie by

3654
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:34,078
itself now which is the which is the

3655
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,960
realm

3656
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:38,479
um

3657
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:40,078
and then i did define the selection line

3658
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:42,158
um i've

3659
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:44,639
dropped one of them i might drop a

3660
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:46,319
couple more we'll see

3661
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:48,800
the cherry spice and a little are just

3662
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:51,039
becoming very popular so i probably will

3663
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:53,520
continue to make them

3664
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:55,920
um and then i'll look for something else

3665
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:58,320
i just there's so many things i need to

3666
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:01,359
work through and so many different

3667
02:06:58,319 --> 02:07:02,238
flavors and things like

3668
02:07:01,359 --> 02:07:05,118
uh

3669
02:07:02,238 --> 02:07:06,319
it's just time again i need a big big

3670
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:08,479
space

3671
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:10,078
and a couple of years

3672
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,238
and yeah

3673
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:14,719
um

3674
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:17,519
be blowing some minds with

3675
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:18,960
the flavors and things

3676
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,320
yeah okay

3677
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,639
so

3678
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:23,920
i've got a random question i wanted to

3679
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:27,359
ask

3680
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:28,480
so what's your favorite food

3681
02:07:27,359 --> 02:07:29,759
food

3682
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:30,718
um

3683
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,920
okay

3684
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,560
uh

3685
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:36,319
i'll eat a lot of avocados

3686
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,840
um

3687
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:40,799

3688
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:44,000
papaya um

3689
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:46,560
but like here where i am you you can get

3690
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,319
lots of papaya that's grown here lots of

3691
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:49,599
avocados

3692
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:52,639
um

3693
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:57,039
yeah so it's absolutely amazing for that

3694
02:07:52,639 --> 02:07:58,560
um but my diet is a vegan-based sort of

3695
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,078
diet yeah

3696
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:01,119
or plants

3697
02:08:00,078 --> 02:08:02,799
um

3698
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:05,039
so yeah

3699
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:06,719

3714
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:43,919
uh

3715
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:46,639
mantras and

3716
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:51,359
buddhist chants and

3717
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:54,078
i don't know rock music to hip-hop there

3718
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:55,920
you go that's that's that's how varied

3719
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:57,519
my music is

3720
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:00,560
oh dude i'm gonna have to send you a

3721
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,639
link to the the dj mix boat he gave me

3722
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:04,800
it's [ __ ] great

3723
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:07,279
okay yeah definitely definitely

3724
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:09,760
i'll be well up for listening to that

3725
02:09:07,279 --> 02:09:13,118
hell yeah so get us back on topic for a

3726
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:15,760
minute um do you have any plans to do

3727
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:18,639
any kind of specific feminized releases

3728
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:20,480
so like a range of f1 feminized seeds or

3729
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:22,800
not overly

3730
02:09:20,479 --> 02:09:25,039
yes there will be some more feminized

3731
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,960
seeds being released at some point um

3732
02:09:25,039 --> 02:09:28,719
i'm going to try and make a feminized

3733
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:30,480
little

3734
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:33,439
and a few other lines

3735
02:09:30,479 --> 02:09:34,559
just so they can people other people can

3736
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:36,799
try them

3737
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:38,639
so many people want them in ics and i'd

3738
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,480
love them to be able to try this like

3739
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:41,199
the little and the tropical

3740
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:43,678
so

3741
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:45,519
yeah definitely a few more feminized

3742
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:48,078
lines in the works

3743
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:49,840
yeah cool and do you feel like when you

3744
02:09:48,078 --> 02:09:51,519
feminize things you want to kind of

3745
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,199
reserve it for the things that really

3746
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:55,520
prove themselves or would you be willing

3747
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:57,279
to do like an initial cross and release

3748
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:58,560
as a feminized line or do you as i said

3749
02:09:57,279 --> 02:10:01,519
do you feel like it's reserved for stuff

3750
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:04,239
that's proven itself

3751
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:05,599
yeah it all depends in how it comes out

3752
02:10:04,238 --> 02:10:06,718
in the testing

3753
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:08,000
um

3754
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:09,760
and um

3755
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,039
like

3756
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:14,880
i couldn't i couldn't release the

3757
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:15,679
feminized mandarina that i made um

3758
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,840
so

3759
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:18,639
they were just producing

3760
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:20,480
um

3761
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:22,239
hermaphrodites and stuff like this so i

3762
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:23,118
wasn't happy with them

3763
02:10:22,238 --> 02:10:25,439
um

3764
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:26,238
but that was an s1

3765
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:28,559
so

3766
02:10:26,238 --> 02:10:31,039
i think if i use the two mandarinas i

3767
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:33,360
have instead of just using the one on

3768
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:34,479
one on itself

3769
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:36,559
um

3770
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:39,039
that would have worked out better

3771
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,360
but yeah i think um

3772
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:43,359
some things just don't work and just

3773
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:44,158
yeah other things

3774
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:47,279
uh

3775
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:47,279
we see how it works and

3776
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:51,439
yeah okay so how would you feel if you

3777
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:52,960
had a project you really wanted to

3778
02:10:51,439 --> 02:10:54,719
release it you're getting some awesome

3779
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:57,279
results from the seeds but like let's

3780
02:10:54,719 --> 02:11:00,158
just say one in every 30 or maybe one in

3781
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:02,719
every 40 seeds was like just a horrific

3782
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:04,559
hermaphrodite is that is that at the

3783
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:07,359
point where you'd be like nah i got a

3784
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:08,400
you know 86 this or do you feel like

3785
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:09,679
it's the type of thing where you would

3786
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:11,039
just kind of want to be upfront with

3787
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:12,719
that information and be like it's still

3788
02:11:11,039 --> 02:11:14,880
worth it but you know just keeping it

3789
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:18,239
keep an eye out for that

3790
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:20,480
yeah i think if if you're gonna get like

3791
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:21,598
one hermaphrodite

3792
02:11:20,479 --> 02:11:23,598
um

3793
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:25,279
in 100

3794
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:27,679
seeds

3795
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:28,559
i don't see that as a major thing

3796
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:31,359
um

3797
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:32,880
especially if you're using certain

3798
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:34,158
things like

3799
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:35,199
we'll say

3800
02:11:34,158 --> 02:11:36,078
cherry

3801
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:36,839
pie

3802
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:41,920
for

3803
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:42,880
instance um i see a lot with crosses of

3804
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,000
um

3805
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:45,679
cherry pie

3806
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,920
uh strains

3807
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:49,279
um but i find like they'll pre it's not

3808
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:51,039
even like a proper hermaphrodite

3809
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:52,960
sometimes it'll be just like a male bit

3810
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:54,960
that you pick off and you don't see any

3811
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,840
more after that

3812
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,260
so

3813
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,440
um

3814
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:59,280
[Music]

3815
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:01,279
i think it's going to be something that

3816
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:03,118
you see i think things with sour diesel

3817
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:05,359
in it is another thing

3818
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:06,719
that you'll spring up

3819
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:08,158
um

3820
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:09,599
so

3821
02:12:08,158 --> 02:12:11,519
but the cherry pie has been an

3822
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:14,400
interesting one i'm seeing like almost

3823
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:16,159
like bubba kush like laffy type traits

3824
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:18,479
coming out from a lot of these like

3825
02:12:16,158 --> 02:12:21,198
cherry pie crosses

3826
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:23,919
and stuff like this

3827
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:25,198
yeah okay and so i mean cherry pie is a

3828
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:26,800
great example because it's one of those

3829
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:28,238
ones where even when people are growing

3830
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,400
it just for the bud

3831
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:32,479
um people will comment you know you get

3832
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:34,000
a few little nanas on the lower branches

3833
02:12:32,479 --> 02:12:35,919
maybe they're not getting enough light

3834
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,198
maybe there's something else at play do

3835
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:39,118
you feel like these clones are still

3836
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:40,799
worth while breeding with or kind of

3837
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:42,238
that issue i mentioned is a bit

3838
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:44,000
problematic in the grand scheme of

3839
02:12:42,238 --> 02:12:46,078
things

3840
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:49,520
um it can be problematic in the grand

3841
02:12:46,078 --> 02:12:51,519
scheme of things um it can mess up

3842
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:51,990
someone's whole growl really

3843
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,119

[Music]

3845
02:12:53,118 --> 02:12:58,000
but i think if people are

3846
02:12:55,118 --> 02:13:00,839
aware that these genetics sort of there

3847
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,000
is that chance of them doing it

3848
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:06,400
um yeah

3849
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,719
i don't know see some of them are just

3850
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:09,679
like what i tend to do is try and find a

3851
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:11,439
cherry

3852
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:14,078
pie cross

3853
02:13:11,439 --> 02:13:16,158
and select from ma which don't have the

3854
02:13:14,078 --> 02:13:18,000
hermaphrodite tendencies and then work

3855
02:13:16,158 --> 02:13:19,759
from there so i do a lot of my stuff

3856
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,078
from seeds and not the original clones

3857
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:24,800
so i'll make sure that

3858
02:13:22,078 --> 02:13:27,198
like cherry pie and girl scout cookies

3859
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:29,679
is the the parents

3860
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:31,839
and then from the selection find a plant

3861
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:33,118
that doesn't show any of those traits

3862
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,679
that you don't want

3863
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:37,759
and work from that

3864
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:40,239
so that's where i would go down the line

3865
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:43,039
of doing try and find the terpene that

3866
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:45,759
you want without the other traits

3867
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:48,399
for sure okay so we're on to our last

3868
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:50,079
little quickfire question so

3869
02:13:48,399 --> 02:13:51,519
hopefully we're not doubling up too much

3870
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:54,238
but maybe some things have changed since

3871
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:55,679
we last talked but first off what is the

3872
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:56,839
best smoke you've had recently that

3873
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:59,039
comes to

3874
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:00,880
mind um

3875
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:03,760
sour neo and

3876
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:05,760
cherry spice which i'm really enjoying

3877
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:07,760
at the moment yeah

3878
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:10,239
do you try many stuff outside of your

3879
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:11,520
own or not often

3880
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:14,718
um

3881
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:16,960
yes out of some of the new stuff so uh

3882
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:19,118
the skittles i've got to try all the new

3883
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:22,000
like american elite stuff

3884
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:23,118
and the skittles the gelato

3885
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,279
um

3886
02:14:23,118 --> 02:14:28,719
runts um few other different ones lemon

3887
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:31,279
tree all of these

3888
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:33,118
so yeah um i've got to troll them and

3889
02:14:31,279 --> 02:14:36,078
really enjoyed the skittles

3890
02:14:33,118 --> 02:14:37,439
um that was a real nice

3891
02:14:36,078 --> 02:14:40,000
um

3892
02:14:37,439 --> 02:14:42,078
flavor to it so i'd like to work that

3893
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,399
line maybe into some of my things that

3894
02:14:42,078 --> 02:14:45,279
would be quite interesting i think

3895
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:46,238
okay

3896
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:48,078
and

3897
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:49,519
i'm sure you probably copped a wind of

3898
02:14:48,078 --> 02:14:51,759
it you know a few months back just

3899
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:54,480
before december we had a big kind of

3900
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:55,599
kerfuffle in the industry about how the

3901
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:58,158
big al

3902
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:59,760
mac 100.8 were selling and people

3903
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:01,439
weren't too happy about that how do you

3904
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:04,239
feel about that and the emergence of

3905
02:15:01,439 --> 02:15:06,479
this premium cannabis market

3906
02:15:04,238 --> 02:15:08,959
yeah well it's the same in in barcelona

3907
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:10,718
to be honest like i think that's what

3908
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:12,319
skittles and stuff like that sells for

3909
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:15,760
like basically

3910
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:18,158
um it's like 100 euros and

3911
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:21,119
for three grams or something like this

3912
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:23,279
[ __ ] even more than america

3913
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:25,679
yeah yeah it's coming from

3914
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:26,880
probably places like that so

3915
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:28,480
there you go

3916
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,560
so um

3917
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:31,919
yeah crazy prices absolutely crazy

3918
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:33,280
prices

3919
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:35,679
okay

3920
02:15:33,279 --> 02:15:37,679
so i've even seen in amsterdam you go to

3921
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:41,599
amsterdam and they've got it on the menu

3922
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:43,920
there for like 40 euros a gram and stuff

3923
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:45,679
and how do you feel about the culture of

3924
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:48,239
import cali you know do you feel like

3925
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:51,520
it's destructive to the local producers

3926
02:15:48,238 --> 02:15:54,078
so to speak no i think if if something's

3927
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:56,320
coming at that higher price selling flat

3928
02:15:54,078 --> 02:15:58,000
higher price then maybe

3929
02:15:56,319 --> 02:16:01,439
local growers get a little bit better

3930
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,760
price i think it's when um people start

3931
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:05,598
coming in and selling like really like

3932
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:08,079
[ __ ] extract because there's so much

3933
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:09,760
extract in america now made from like

3934
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:11,118
just crap and

3935
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:13,679
stuff like this

3936
02:16:11,118 --> 02:16:16,479
that's going for so cheap

3937
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:19,199
like then that comes over to

3938
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:21,598
places like spain and that brings the

3939
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:24,158
prices right down i think that can

3940
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:26,239
affect things maybe

3941
02:16:24,158 --> 02:16:28,078
yeah okay and then just to kind of wrap

3942
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:30,479
up our little hype section what's the

3943
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:32,799
most over-hyped strain that gets sold

3944
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:35,519
for lots of money

3945
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:37,039
the most overhyped strain

3946
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:38,880
like i've heard i haven't had it myself

3947
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,200
so i'll give that caveat but i've heard

3948
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:44,159
like runts and grunts and all that

3949
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:47,439
stuff's like not that great um

3950
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:48,879
runts itself the one that i tried was

3951
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:51,280
was quite nice

3952
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:54,239
um but then i suppose it's batch

3953
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:56,399
dependent the purple punch that i tried

3954
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:58,239
was was very lacking

3955
02:16:56,398 --> 02:17:01,519
yeah purple punch

3956
02:16:58,239 --> 02:17:04,159
um not all that some of the gelatos some

3957
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:06,719
of them weren't even that that nice old

3958
02:17:04,159 --> 02:17:09,599
but then it all depends you know

3959
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:12,159
who who's grown it and stuff like this

3960
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:15,599
but i think anything that's that sort of

3961
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:18,398
price is overpriced uh i tried some mac

3962
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:21,120
that was that was nice but then i had

3963
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:23,439
another one that wasn't that good so it

3964
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:26,000
all depends again who grows it or if

3965
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:28,559
it's from the seed or if it's a clone

3966
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,799
yeah definitely right i remember the

3967
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:33,920
2017

3968
02:17:30,799 --> 02:17:36,159
emerald cup cappulator gave me some mac

3969
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:37,599
phenomenal probably standout weed of

3970
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:40,239
that emerald cup

3971
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:43,200
and then yeah i had some grown by a good

3972
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:45,599
grower admittedly it was outdoors but um

3973
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,880
looked amazing organic sungrown just

3974
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:48,799
ticked all the boxes but then when i

3975
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:50,478
tried it it just wasn't anywhere near as

3976
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:52,318
good at all so maybe it comes down to

3977
02:17:50,478 --> 02:17:55,519
like the grower i mean obviously cap's

3978
02:17:52,318 --> 02:17:57,920
gonna grow some pretty darn good mac

3979
02:17:55,519 --> 02:18:00,000
yeah i think that that's going to play a

3980
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:02,318
big role um

3981
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,920
like you said then i i wasn't impressed

3982
02:18:02,318 --> 02:18:05,920
with it but then i've spoke to other

3983
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:07,679
people and they're like nice

3984
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:08,719
it's absolutely amazing

3985
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:09,599
so

3986
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:13,039
um

3987
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:14,079
yeah i must must depend

3988
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:17,200
yeah okay

3989
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:19,039
so outside of the hype strains what's

3990
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:21,599
one of the you know

3991
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:24,920
most lackluster samples you've tried in

3992
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:24,920
recent memory

3993
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:29,599
something i've joined enjoyed in spain

3994
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:32,079
oh something you haven't enjoyed like

3995
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:34,000
for example what's kind of the worst

3996
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:35,760
yeah what's what's the worst strain

3997
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,519
you've ever had

3998
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:40,800
okay okay okay sorry um

3999
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:42,478
worst one

4000
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:44,079
it's recently

4001
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:46,000
i'm gonna say that purple punch was

4002
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:49,359
really lacking because i expected it to

4003
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,478
be much nicer with the hype

4004
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:52,318
yeah

4005
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:54,079
there's lots of things like that i've

4006
02:18:52,318 --> 02:18:57,119
been lacking from a lot of the like

4007
02:18:54,079 --> 02:18:59,120
spanish seed companies i've seen

4008
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,160
but yeah

4009
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:00,880
yeah okay

4010
02:19:00,159 --> 02:19:03,039
so

4011
02:19:00,879 --> 02:19:05,279
one of my favorite ones desert island

4012
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:07,120
question you can take three strains with

4013
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:08,319
you and you've got an infinite supply of

4014
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:09,599
you don't have to worry about growing

4015
02:19:08,318 --> 02:19:12,079
them or anything like that so which

4016
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:14,960
three strains you're taking with you

4017
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:17,599
um lilt

4018
02:19:14,959 --> 02:19:19,119
sour neo

4019
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:21,040
and

4020
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:22,960
the cherry spice

4021
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:24,399
bows free from mine so i've got

4022
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:26,159
something sour

4023
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:28,398
something gassy

4024
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:30,318
something fruity and i'd probably miss

4025
02:19:28,398 --> 02:19:32,318
the mandarina

4026
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:34,638
oh poor mandarina it's still got a spot

4027
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:36,558
in our hearts yeah it's cause i've

4028
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:39,199
smoked too much of it now i think but

4029
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:42,398
i'd miss after a few weeks

4030
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:44,240
almost a little bit of tangy syndrome

4031
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:45,599
yeah that's it

4032
02:19:44,239 --> 02:19:48,558
alrighty so

4033
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:50,799
final question for the interview

4034
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:53,679
what is your next strain coming out that

4035
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:56,239
you're most excited about

4036
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:58,000
um salinia there you go i've mentioned

4037
02:19:56,239 --> 02:20:00,840
it quite a few times now

4038
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,559
um yeah really enjoying that one

4039
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:04,559
and um

4040
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:07,840
looking forward to see what comes from

4041
02:20:04,559 --> 02:20:09,439
the afghan crosses i've just done

4042
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,359
yeah actually now let's slide an extra

4043
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:13,600
question in for good measure now that

4044
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:15,520
you've got your afghan land race seeds i

4045
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:16,800
believe last time we spoke i asked you

4046
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:18,239
you know if you could go anywhere

4047
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:20,000
collect some landry seeds what would you

4048
02:20:18,239 --> 02:20:21,439
do and i think you said afghan so now

4049
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,040
that you've got them what's next on the

4050
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:25,600
list of stuff that you don't have that

4051
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:27,600
you'd love to get

4052
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:29,280
yeah um

4053
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:31,760
it's crazy how that happened actually

4054
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:34,640
how you asked that question and then

4055
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:36,239
we were going to india and mate called

4056
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:37,680
me and he's like there's a guy from

4057
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:40,159
afghanistan he's coming and he's

4058
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:42,559
bringing some real afghan seeds with him

4059
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:45,039
it was just so crazy how it happened

4060
02:20:42,559 --> 02:20:47,119
so let me see let's see if i can put it

4061
