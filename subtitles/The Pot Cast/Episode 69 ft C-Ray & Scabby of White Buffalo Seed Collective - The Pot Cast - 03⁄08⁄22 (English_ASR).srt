hey guys hey everyone how's it going

77
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,799
nice to be here

78
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,419
the first question we love to ask all

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,519
our guests what are you guys been

80
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,399
smoking on today

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,099
oh we're just generally smoking some

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
stuff that we just grew um

83
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,598
we're just testing out some of our new

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,900
uh hybrids uh one of them is Irene cross

85
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,098
original Haze it's a really nice one

86
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,519
and another one is the Congolese cross

87
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,518
Iraqi pilgrim

88
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,840
um and some other stuff that we just

89
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,239
harvested uh like Angola red

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,239
what else have you been smoking on uh I

91
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,980
just rolled up uh Angola red and Irene

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,200
Hayes and I was peeking a little bit

93
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,359
there but we're we're coming into the

94
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,500
zone or flying kind of land read in

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,060
there

96
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,339
yeah

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,738
I am thoroughly jealous right now

98
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,659
because as someone who loves sativas but

99
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,399
uh like most people doesn't have a ton

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,040
of them hanging around to smoke that

101
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,478
sounds like exactly where I want to be I

102
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,620
was interested I mean I'm probably going

103
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,879
to ask you a bunch of questions about

104
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,500
all those varieties because they all

105
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,959
sound great but the first one would be

106
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,220
the Irene couldn't cross the Hays it

107
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,959
sounds like it's more leaning to the

108
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,060
haze side is it

109
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,579
that one's pretty uh

110
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,519
pretty balanced I would say because

111
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:48,240
um apparently the Irene is is a self

112
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:51,959
like it's a self uh progeny

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,379
so self progenies in in crosses tend to

114
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:58,258
be um tend to be you know reasonably uh

115
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,699
consistent in the uh now in The

116
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,740
Offspring

117
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,360
so yeah they that one actually turned

118
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,300
out really well like as far as

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,360
uniformity from plant to plant to plant

120
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,160
um we grew about

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,560
uh 16 females

122
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,380
um a pretty good sample and

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,418
we ended up keeping about uh probably a

124
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,500
dozen of them to check out again you

125
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,599
grow again

126
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,160
lovely I'm gonna have to ask you some

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,360
more questions about your finger hunting

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,520
but just to confirm for everyone

129
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,759
listening are we talking about the the

130
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,918
Irene OG or a different Irene yeah it's

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,840
uh well I don't know if it's an OG per

132
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:38,120
se but it's like a

133
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:41,099
it's a OG ish plant but it's like a kush

134
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,079
yeah does it have the weird buds growing

135
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,439
from like the internode

136
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,240
uh I've only grown it one like twice

137
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,339
um and I didn't experience that yet but

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,160
you mean like little but let's set grow

139
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,319
off the stems or something yeah I've

140
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,180
just heard people saying that you get

141
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,560
like these weird little buds growing at

142
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,060
the internodes on Irene I was just

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,579
curious if you'd experienced that at all

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,560
uh not yet I think that's like a

145
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,719
phosphorous thing if I remember no like

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,079
a potassium or potassium high potassium

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,199
yeah you know it gets you can you can go

148
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,319
buds right off the uh the stock if you

149
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,460
hit the hit them with uh the right type

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,899
of potassium at the right time

151
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,239
apparently

152
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,638
there you go that's some cool info I

153
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,319
wasn't aware of I like that what was it

154
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,660
about the Irene that Drew it to you

155
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,580
because I think if we look at your work

156
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,560
um there's often sort of an older World

157
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,779
strain and sometimes a newer World

158
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,899
strain and I'd be interested in hearing

159
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,519
like what sort of characteristics of the

160
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,138
modern strain attract you like you know

161
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,719
I haven't seen you grow a cookies hybrid

162
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,620
but the Irene is pretty modern what what

163
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,620
do you like about it

164
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,620
um well it's I mean we've only grown it

165
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,538
a couple times it's just one of those

166
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,399
things you grow it and you like you

167
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,399
taste it and it's like this is the good

168
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,859
[ __ ] yeah definitely the terpenes are

169
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,079
what was most interesting um this is and

170
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,919
it's got a good high like yeah for being

171
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,859
um

172
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,560
we we're kind of uh critical about

173
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,080
um more of the Indica commercial Indica

174
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,660
push type stuff

175
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,240
um and that were because we're really uh

176
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,520
like we're really sativa connoisseurs so

177
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,340
we want we want to we expect all our

178
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,620
plants to have like you know some some

179
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,119
sort of profound profundity in the in

180
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,060
the stone you know like that's what

181
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,579
we're that's what our goal is you know

182
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,780
um so this uh the Irene's actually got a

183
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,800
little bit of a

184
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:37,859
got a decent uh you know heavy heavy uh

185
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,598
effect to it yeah it's like an easy man

186
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,220
high you know after you get up the

187
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,740
little rocket boost there for a minute

188
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,460
or two and then it's nice and easy right

189
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,860
you're you're grooving down the street

190
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,079
yeah I love the sounds of that and you

191
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,360
know what just based on hearing that I'm

192
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,500
confident it's the uh the Irene cut I'm

193
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,598
thinking of because that's what everyone

194
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,418
says they were like above all like the

195
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:04,439
high on this plant is exquisite so that

196
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:07,159
all makes sense I think the bud shape is

197
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,418
like not very like uh

198
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,660
alluring to most people and I think the

199
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:14,939
Iraqi kind of sorry the Hayes kind of

200
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,660
stepped that up a bit in that cross for

201
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,418
sure

202
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,879
yeah beautiful beautiful stuff there and

203
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:23,399
I mean while we're on the topic of Hayes

204
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,379
I had a few different questions I guess

205
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,939
I'd be interested in asking I know that

206
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,699
you guys have worked with many different

207
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,560
hazes over the years both you know some

208
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,899
of Neville's work with like the haze a

209
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,278
and Haze C progeny and I think you guys

210
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,519
have even worked with some of the

211
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,918
original stuff from Sam himself I'd be

212
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,199
interested to hear like is does that all

213
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,059
check out and is there one sort of stock

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,940
of haze that you think is better to the

215
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,639
other or it's all just like a family

216
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,000
uh well as far as I'm concerned it all

217
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,039
came from uh skunkman stock like I mean

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,299
what everyone's growing you know there's

219
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,599
obviously

220
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,979
stuff that uh people I say predates that

221
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,080
but um

222
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,300
I mean would everyone refers to as

223
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,540
original Haze came through

224
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,838
uh the seedsman well not all of it but I

225
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,980
think he sold a bunch like privately

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,620
skunkman sold a bunch of seeds privately

227
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,399
before that but a lot of this stuff came

228
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,039
through

229
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,500
um the seedsman

230
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,759
um seedsman company seed company or

231
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,440
whatever

232
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,958
um like if you look if you go on to

233
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,839
Archive

234
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:33,659
archive.org and look up seedsman.com

235
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,180
and go back to

236
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,100
uh it's like I don't know what it's like

237
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,559
a couple years after the earliest

238
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,700
centuries you'll see the original

239
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:47,458
um release of the sea like the

240
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,200
skunkman's uh you know uh breed that he

241
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,639
did at that time which is like a bunch

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,180
of uh

243
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,220
original Haze and there was some

244
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,620
a few land races and then there is a

245
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,540
bunch of uh crosses and there's uh I

246
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,659
think some

247
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:06,319
Afghani South Indiana Afghani Durban

248
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,319
Durban

249
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,458
um yeah I think that's it probably more

250
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,319
yeah anyways you'll find it on

251
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,659
archive.org

252
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,800
it's pretty uh interesting to go back

253
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,259
and look at that

254
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,059
yeah not and when you say seedsman are

255
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,519
you talking about like the the generic

256
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:29,879
label that the seed bank offers or like

257
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,560
Sam's that's right no I mean I'm talking

258
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,120
um the original like the seed bank

259
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,759
seedsman

260
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,980
I believe like I don't know the story

261
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,439
but I've heard you know bits of the

262
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,860
story that it was like a collab between

263
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,839
either it was a collab or it was started

264
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,120
with basically it was started with uh

265
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,980
skunkman seeds like that's what was got

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,159
it going

267
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,320
um and he had like uh kilo he had like

268
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,439
that guy bought like a kilo of all the

269
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,220
different varieties I think is the story

270
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,260
um

271
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,060
and I don't think it lasted very long

272
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,360
because if you look at archive.org you

273
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:08,458
can kind of see where like it was like a

274
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,399
couple years of skunkman stuff and then

275
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,799
it kind of transitioned to uh Dutch a

276
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,139
bunch of Dutch stuff

277
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,120
yeah interesting stuff I do think I

278
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,759
remembered hearing that story from Todd

279
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,679
so that that all sort of checks out I'd

280
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,720
be interested to hear in terms of your

281
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:28,019
experience with the hazes

282
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,700
have you seen stuff come out of it that

283
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,159
is similar to some of the well-known

284
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,379
stuff like you know the the black Cuban

285
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,539
Hayes you know a really famous nl5 Haze

286
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,578
cutting do you ever see any of the

287
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,620
characteristics in the haze you've

288
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,838
worked with that seems similar to the

289
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,179
other famous Haze work or it all seems

290
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,600
like quite unique

291
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,699
uh well every like we've grown the

292
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,500
original Haze stock from a few different

293
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,300
sources now like four or five different

294
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,100
sources

295
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,319
um and everyone you dip into is

296
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,959
different it's all depends on because

297
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,899
everyone started with a little a small

298
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,479
Subs you know a sub selection of

299
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,500
original Haze you know they got 10 10

300
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,000
seeds or whatever so based on on uh luck

301
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,919
of the draw you know everyone got a

302
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,480
little bit and then they selected you

303
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,819
know certain things

304
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,959
um so there there's quite a bit of

305
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,879
variation

306
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,278
um in our experience

307
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,799
and like most of them are most of them

308
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,620
are not worth growing you know

309
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:33,479
in our opinion like uh you really have

310
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:36,179
to find the right uh bag of seeds

311
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,579
um and to get the they get the really

312
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:42,059
good ones that are worth growing like

313
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:44,638
most of them like 99 of them uh most

314
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,500
people would not want to grow

315
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,839
okay yeah that's that's brilliant

316
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,980
because it sort of parlays into the next

317
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,839
part of the question that I was going to

318
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,940
ask which was that the impression I

319
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,399
always got from the work that came from

320
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,440
Neville's Hayes stuff was that although

321
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,839
he got like a small number of seeds or

322
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,579
males or whatever it was from Sam it

323
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,700
seemed like the males he got ended up

324
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:08,099
being pretty bloody good is that like

325
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,860
your perspective on it

326
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,959
that's a good question like um

327
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,940
I mean I haven't grown I've grown a few

328
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,939
of uh Neville sings um

329
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,838
but uh

330
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,940
I mean obviously they were good because

331
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,100
they stood the test of time time and we

332
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,720
and we grow we grow some of that stuff

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,139
like we have some

334
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,600
in all Hayes uh

335
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:35,700
seeds that are good so

336
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,278
um I don't know I can't I don't know if

337
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,620
like like I don't really know

338
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,360
um the difference I mean I can figure it

339
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,060
out the difference between the A and

340
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,980
this email just because we've grown

341
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,799
a little bit of both like we haven't

342
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,700
grown the C5 or the A5 cutting but we've

343
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:56,099
grown

344
00:13:50,700 --> 00:14:01,560
uh C5 f2s and we've grown um the A5

345
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:04,019
BX from Karma bx1 I guess it was yep

346
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,278
um so you know we have a rough idea

347
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,820
um

348
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,700
there's definitely uh they're definitely

349
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,740
very different males like the A5 is

350
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,720
really savory

351
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,000
um and kind of charcoaly that's what I

352
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,060
get out of it like charcoal and like

353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,500
uh Woody incense whereas the uh the C5

354
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,500
side is uh sweet

355
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:29,120
um flowery like perfumey

356
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,360
well pencil shavings

357
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,179
on the C5 yeah

358
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,820
yeah that checks out I uh I've been

359
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:41,219
lucky enough to try both of those and

360
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,480
your descriptions fairly perfectly fit

361
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,519
it

362
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,339
smoked I smoked a bunch of the stuff of

363
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,500
the uh of like a bunch of haze like what

364
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,180
they call Haze in um

365
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,559
Amsterdam

366
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,198
um so

367
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,179
I probably have smoked both of those

368
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,639
when I was there because I was smoking

369
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:03,120
stuff from like uh

370
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:07,799
uh Neville's buddy the uh Steve

371
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,320
um he had some something something and a

372
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,399
bunch of dispensaries at that time

373
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,379
um

374
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,120
like I don't know I I assume some of

375
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,458
them had the real deal you know like

376
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,639
real deal whatever

377
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,439
uh that they were just marketing as NL

378
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,759
Hayes at the time

379
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,920
sure

380
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,360
so I don't know I can't I can't confirm

381
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,719
without going back in the time machine

382
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,720
but

383
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,260
I mean out of curiosity I've always

384
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,059
found that people tend to fall on one

385
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,338
side of the fence they're either like I

386
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,439
love the Hayes C or I love the haze a

387
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,480
and notably a lot of the Breeders I

388
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,820
speak to they all say the haze a they're

389
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,220
like yeah that Colombian sort of vibe

390
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,860
whereas I myself I love to how you see

391
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,680
that more Thai floral sort of thing do

392
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,019
you have one useful more preference wise

393
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,278
I think I'm in this the seaside of

394
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,120
things

395
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:02,578
yeah I like both qualities but yeah see

396
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,360
yeah that makes sense and actually you

397
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:10,319
know the the BC uh sweets cutting the

398
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,839
breeder Steve cut um that one is very C5

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,620
dominant very C5 dominant like after

400
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,540
growing those C5 f2s and then like

401
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:21,179
revisiting that cutting it's really

402
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:23,219
obvious that like originally when the

403
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,919
sweet skunk was sold

404
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,339
um by Mark Emery um

405
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,259
he marketed as snc seeds big skunk cross

406
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,139
grapefruit but

407
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:37,379
um the original story was that he uh

408
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:39,899
Steve got a tray of cuttings and there

409
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,820
was a male and they weren't like yeah it

410
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,379
ended up being males instead of females

411
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,240
and stuff like that that's where that

412
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,939
male came yeah and it was they figured

413
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,778
out uh later on it was a nanole haze

414
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,000
mail

415
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:53,039
that made the sweets go

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,440
yeah that's that's definitely the story

417
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,120
he told me and it checks out I I sadly

418
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,820
haven't been able to try sweet skunk but

419
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,740
it looks like n05 Hayes doesn't it oh

420
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,019
yeah it's very and it's very uh an

421
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,359
offline based on like you'll like it

422
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:08,338
it's a good smoker we have way better

423
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,918
ones I think now as we've worked down

424
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,659
the lines in terms of qualities that are

425
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,839
better for growing like hardiness

426
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,779
powdery mildew ease of growth flowering

427
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,838
time stuff like that but it's definitely

428
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:24,359
a good one got your teeth on another uh

429
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,759
another plant we grew that was what I

430
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,279
would think would be like the A5 is the

431
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,140
Band-Aid Haze number seven

432
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,879
what was your thoughts on that one it's

433
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,000
pretty popular

434
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,919
it's it's all right but it's um like we

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,558
have better stuff in our collection that

436
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,360
we like personally more so

437
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,160
um it's it's a good plant a lot of

438
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,719
people like it so there was a newer

439
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,840
fennel that I tried that I like way

440
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,419
better uh to an appendages too yeah our

441
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,839
friend uh down the road here we got a

442
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,700
pack of 10 original Band-Aid Haze f1s I

443
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,139
believe they were yeah I think so and he

444
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,500
just screws it like he just screw them

445
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,120
out and uh he must have got two packs oh

446
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,099
no maybe there was there must have been

447
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,279
like more than a pack there or something

448
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:10,500
anyways the number 12 uh was really nice

449
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,918
like better than for us it was better

450
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,380
than the number seven was it two yeah I

451
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,538
think it was two wasn't it I can't

452
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,559
remember yeah it doesn't matter I got it

453
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:24,298
on a jar back there I think yeah

454
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,700
that makes sense right like it must have

455
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,160
been um two packs if it was number 12

456
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,900
and I I think I've seen people posting

457
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,120
did you know did he give that out at all

458
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,559
that might be a like a cutting that gets

459
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,979
passed around now

460
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,139
no he just he just uh popped those uh

461
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,000
recently yeah it was more recent kind of

462
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,160
thing the high on the new one is like

463
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,740
very uh you smoke it and then it's like

464
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,259
very immediate up and you're like holy

465
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,380
[ __ ] and then you know it comes into a

466
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:54,298
better relaxed high but I find it's uh

467
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,059
much better higher than than the seven

468
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:59,038
people junk around

469
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:01,079
I'd be interested to hear because you

470
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,700
mentioned that uh you said yeah look

471
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,038
it's good but we've got some better

472
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,620
stuff I was actually looking at some

473
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,140
Band-Aid Haze crosses going is this the

474
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,879
sativa I've been searching for it sounds

475
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,740
like you guys have got other ones that

476
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,320
might be more up my Lane if I'm looking

477
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,120
for that racy sativa sort of thing what

478
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,798
might be some recommendations from your

479
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,839
catalog for someone like me who wants

480
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,259
that sort of effect

481
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,359
uh well everything yeah we really try to

482
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,058
like we really sample everything we

483
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,379
really go by the highs and the smells

484
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,058
you know that sort of those are the

485
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,760
things that we really go by because and

486
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:38,339
we smoke we like to smoke so

487
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,519
um yeah that's something that we really

488
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:44,939
try to you know involve in everything we

489
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,759
do uh personally I enjoy the Columbia or

490
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,279
the Angola red uh Colombian black Haze

491
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,200
some of those were really awesome but

492
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,058
you find it in lots of different stuff

493
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,880
that we have you know various pictures

494
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:59,940
yeah everything we have is uh been well

495
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,679
tested and uh like we've gone through

496
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,120
and made sure that it was

497
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,160
um up to

498
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,099
well it's basically what we're looking

499
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,419
for in in a smoke and

500
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,759
um yeah

501
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,220
interesting look I know our listeners

502
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,200
are going to Heckle me if I don't get

503
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,880
some more sort of indoor friendly ones

504
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,440
out of you what like for someone who's

505
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,000
because that's the complaint I hear like

506
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,460
I'm I'm like you guys right like I'm

507
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,259
trying to get people to grow sativas and

508
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,058
they always say you know it's I'm

509
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:28,440
growing indoor it's tough do you have

510
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:31,079
something that's like quite indoor

511
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,038
friendly or manageable oh yeah

512
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:39,058
like uh we have uh Congolese cross Iraqi

513
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:41,940
is actually uh sativa Dom but uh it's

514
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:46,259
very manageable our um Iraqi Pilgrim we

515
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,200
grew out uh three packs to like 36 seeds

516
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,599
and uh

517
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,240
there is two males in there that were

518
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,579
semi-auto

519
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,079
that uh there's a few more that were

520
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:01,678
semi-auto but there was two good

521
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,439
semi-auto males that I specifically used

522
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,440
in the pollination of those crosses so

523
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,779
they're very uh

524
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,179
like they're a lot faster

525
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,519
um yeah I kicked down on everything for

526
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,220
sure and uh pass on Uber good qualities

527
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,099
to everything it touches a lot that

528
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,740
Congo clone is really easy for a sativa

529
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,839
you know nine or ten weeks and uh you're

530
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,819
good to go so it satisfies most of the

531
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,399
guys who are you know looking for

532
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:31,558
something newer to try that's not so so

533
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,620
long crazy

534
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,779
yeah yeah the count the Congolese is a

535
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:39,058
very good um commercial plant

536
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,099
and most of the most of the guys that

537
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:43,379
grow it commercially they cut it at nine

538
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,538
or ten weeks even though you can like

539
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,880
there's a whole range of you know you

540
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,079
can cut it early uh or you can let it go

541
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,720
a little bit later

542
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:54,839
um but it is it's actually better

543
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,880
turpwise in the early part like most

544
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,678
people would prefer it as nine or ten

545
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,860
weeks because it has uh

546
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,380
as more of the lemon peel Terps at the

547
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:06,139
beginning yeah the Blue Polish lemon

548
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,400
boot polish yeah

549
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,740
we're gonna get to the Congo later

550
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,080
because I I love that cutting thank you

551
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,579
guys so much for that but uh I just want

552
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,158
to look back quickly to the Iraqi

553
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:19,319
Pilgrim stuff you were talking about and

554
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,780
you you mentioned um that it was

555
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,240
semi-auto flowering is do you mean that

556
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,859
in sort of the way that some like I know

557
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,419
that for example blueberries a bit like

558
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,339
that where it's like once it gets root

559
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,720
bound it just tries to flower is that

560
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,579
sort of what you're talking about or do

561
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,140
you mean like in a true sense it's a bit

562
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:37,259
autoflowery

563
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,640
uh I have a very basic definition of

564
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:40,919
semi-auto

565
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,559
it's semi-auto is something that that

566
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,679
triggers and that it'll start flowering

567
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:49,440
but you can re-vege it

568
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,240
so if it's Auto basically you can't

569
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,120
revege it you can't you can re-vege Auto

570
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,140
stuff like with a bunch of techniques

571
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,119
um

572
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,580
but semi-auto

573
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,319
like semi-auto you can re-betch with uh

574
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:04,740
like pretty normal

575
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,058
techniques yeah time and size of bucket

576
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,359
you know

577
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:11,639
yeah like uh or just take cuttings

578
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,558
Revenge cuttings

579
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,659
okay cool yeah that sounds like sort of

580
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,700
what I was thinking like just I I guess

581
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,440
some strains I'm familiar with fall

582
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,538
under that category I just call them a

583
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,960
bit temperamental but worth keeping

584
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:28,440
around but um the uh the Iraqi Pilgrim

585
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,779
is uh it's what I would call a pseudo

586
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,159
land race well it's not even really a

587
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,500
pseudo land roof but it could be a

588
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,140
pseudo land race because if you look at

589
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,940
the description for it on seed Heaven

590
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,740
um

591
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,740
the the guy that collected the seeds he

592
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,120
just he went on a tour of Iraq and uh he

593
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,919
just collected seeds from everywhere

594
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,019
that that was that were good and put

595
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,120
them in a bag so it's like it's got a

596
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:54,058
little bit of everything so yeah when we

597
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,918
grew them um most of them weren't they

598
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,019
were they're okay but most of them were

599
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,080
not things we would grow again

600
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,538
um unfortunately we found a good female

601
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,980
and a good male and and the rest is

602
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,440
history

603
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,298
and we made up twos out of those so we

604
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,400
got what we needed

605
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:13,798
that's awesome I was gonna specifically

606
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,900
ask I noticed on the website that you

607
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,759
did after it and I was wondering was

608
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,740
that just to have like a bigger pool to

609
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,599
select from or was there like a specific

610
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,940
reason you did that

611
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,158
well it was because it was good that's

612
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,019
the main reason to make more seeds when

613
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,940
you come across something good sorry

614
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,500
maybe I should be more specific was

615
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,900
there was there a reason you didn't just

616
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,640
use like an F1 mail and you went for the

617
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,120
F2 mail instead

618
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,640
well the more in bread something is the

619
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,579
more uh you're able to predict what the

620
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,520
outcome is so I'm always trying to you

621
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:49,918
know increase the predictability in the

622
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,859
in the hybridization

623
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,320
so my goal is always to um

624
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:58,139
if I have a choice between uh inbred

625
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,298
male and a nodding not inbred male I'm

626
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,480
always gonna choose the inbred male

627
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,980
unless there's some specific reason that

628
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,240
uh you know you want to choose the other

629
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,659
one but

630
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,659
yeah it's always preferable to uh

631
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:15,360
um the male side of of your hybrid

632
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:17,520
equation is always the one that has the

633
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,379
most questions so

634
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,179
um I'd like to use something that's

635
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,500
inbred because then we have like we can

636
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,480
you know if we have something that's

637
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,759
inbred we've grown it before

638
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,038
um and it's relatively consistent from

639
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,140
plant to plant then we have like an idea

640
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,298
of what that male is going to be like

641
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,580
more of an idea basically

642
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,500
yeah phenomenal and I guess one of the

643
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,240
sentiments you hear commonly expressed

644
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,240
when people are talking about using

645
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,220
inbred males is that the more inbred a

646
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,740
line is the more it tends to dominate

647
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,298
The Cross do you find that to be the

648
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,558
case or is it more like what you just

649
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,298
said before where it's just more

650
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:53,158
predictable but not necessarily

651
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,918
dominating

652
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,140
I think it depends on what it is it

653
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,659
really depends on what it is because it

654
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,900
like some things that are like that are

655
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:06,120
Blueberry Blueberry is super dominant in

656
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,820
hybrids

657
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,579
um yeah definitely yeah the blueberry

658
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,980
Vision was very when we grew that out

659
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,778
yeah you could see the dominance like

660
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,179
kicking down halfway or more all the

661
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:20,819
time and something I didn't like

662
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,820
preferably but yeah

663
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,839
definitely a dumb one

664
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:28,678
um but

665
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:31,379
um some things are are not non-dominant

666
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,559
and actually uh for breeding sometimes

667
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,240
you want a non-dominant male

668
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,720
um because like let's say you're doing

669
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,400
uh a shotgun breed where you have a male

670
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,319
and you're bringing in

671
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,640
you're loading your room up with uh

672
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,019
everything that you can get your hands

673
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,159
on

674
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,558
then

675
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,940
uh by having a non-dominant male then

676
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,619
you you're allowing all those other

677
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,298
things to express themselves in the

678
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,158
hybrids and you're not ending up with a

679
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:57,960
bunch of stuff that's you know really

680
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,460
similar

681
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,460
or more

682
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,440
I think that's such a valid and valuable

683
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,159
point because I always try to say to

684
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,278
people

685
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:11,460
I think probably upwards of 90 of the

686
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,019
time when the average person buys a seed

687
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,120
they're buying it for the mother like

688
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,158
they want that clone only sort of mother

689
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,199
like most of the time of course there's

690
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,880
some variation but that's and that's why

691
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,558
what you just said is perfect right like

692
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,080
if you've got a father that just allows

693
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,240
the mum to shine through then you can

694
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,699
give people sort of the Clone only could

695
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,859
that they can't get their hands on

696
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,840
well that's that's a tricky question

697
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,219
because clone only these are often like

698
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,959
poly hybrids

699
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,940
they're just weird things that are not

700
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,679
gonna ever pop up again

701
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,058
like sweet skunks the plant we were

702
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,460
talking about for instance

703
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:46,918
um we've tried breeding without so many

704
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,000
times and uh what comes out of it is

705
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,120
never

706
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,400
as good as the original cut so we've

707
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,199
just eliminated that from our breeding

708
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,200
program at all uh you know completely

709
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,419
yeah a long time ago so

710
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,240
yeah that's that's really interesting to

711
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,820
hear so I guess that ultimately you you

712
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,740
refine your females you work with over

713
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,259
the years to be ones that work well in

714
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,940
the breeding sense not just like it's a

715
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,500
popular cultivar

716
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,320
yeah that's where we're always looking

717
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,038
for stuff that um works well as breeding

718
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,700
like in in hybridization

719
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,558
um

720
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,620
like

721
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,440
a good trait in a hybrid you know in

722
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:31,678
hybridization is a plant that

723
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,159
the hybrids are better than the original

724
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,140
and one plant that uh is like that is

725
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,120
very reliable like that for us is the

726
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,440
the grapefruit cutting the BC grape

727
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,239
cutting

728
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,259
pretty much anything that you put onto

729
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,440
it

730
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:48,900
um if it's you know half decent you'll

731
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,700
end up with something cool that's that's

732
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,360
going to be more fun to grow than than

733
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,360
the grapefruit

734
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,900
and how do you find the grapefruit is in

735
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:01,079
general because obviously it's like this

736
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,120
popular strain it's been around ages

737
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,980
um do you think that the smoke itself is

738
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,719
good or it's more what you said that

739
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,679
it's like it's a good tool for the next

740
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,380
step

741
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,259
it's all right it's uh

742
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,600
like it's not uh super

743
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:18,359
um potent or anything but it's really

744
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,798
nice it's got a nice flavor it's it's

745
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,778
the kind of weed that a lot of people

746
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,179
like to smoke because it's just it's

747
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:26,519
like Savor weed you know it's weed that

748
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,919
you just smoke to savor it it's not like

749
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,359
super potent so you know from what

750
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,220
there's a lot of people that they don't

751
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,778
want to get whacked out of their head

752
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,940
you know they just want to smoke

753
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:38,460
something that's really nice it's got a

754
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,259
bit of a relaxing High to it and uh it

755
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,000
yields well too is the other thing yeah

756
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,640
it's a really big yielder

757
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,200
um and it's fast yeah like they used to

758
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,240
harvest it at six weeks wow yeah I

759
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,778
remember I used to be skeptical of the

760
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,538
49 day Cindy 99 but you got that beat

761
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,500
well it wasn't it wasn't necessarily you

762
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:59,419
know

763
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,259
um

764
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,259
or South Asian Brothers

765
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,579
uh it's the same in Australia um out of

766
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,778
curiosity I I've spoken to Steve in the

767
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:11,460
past and I said what do you think

768
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:13,619
grapefruit was and he said I think it's

769
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,419
just an Afghani what do you think and

770
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:17,398
are you friends with Steve because yeah

771
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,140
I noticed you had the grapefruit cut and

772
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,759
I was like I don't think even he has it

773
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,419
anymore

774
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,859
I my opinion is it's an NL hybrid

775
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,200
okay

776
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:30,839
yep yeah we've known Steve a long time

777
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,460
he's a real good guy

778
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,859
um Lots he's broad lots to the table

779
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,720
over the years and uh he loves to talk

780
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,699
he's got that big boom and noise and

781
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,200
people like to listen to you know that

782
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,899
is the best description of his voice

783
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,058
isn't it very booming yeah he's one of

784
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:47,459
the uh grandfathers yeah he's like in

785
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,339
the grandfather category for sure you

786
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,278
better respect

787
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:55,139
so I just want to link back for a moment

788
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,640
you were talking about the Iraqi Pilgrim

789
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,200
and you you answered this in the

790
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,240
question that I think you sort of said

791
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,000
you got it off a website but our

792
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,798
listeners are always curious to know

793
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,778
where do you Source your land race seed

794
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,879
from is it always sort of just haphazard

795
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:10,919
or is do you have like a go-to method of

796
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,500
trying to get new stock like or is it

797
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:16,559
just sort of opportunistic

798
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,579
a lot of it is just random very random

799
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:18,599
yeah

800
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:21,839
um

801
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,939
some like I I actually like uh buying

802
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,000
seeds personally like when I see uh land

803
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,580
races on on um

804
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,619
uh the real Seed Company I like to buy a

805
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,960
lot of stuff from them and uh like

806
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:35,639
everything I buy I'll buy three packs

807
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,220
minimum because

808
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,840
there's so much variation in that stuff

809
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,000
um that you really need

810
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,240
you really need to dig through multiple

811
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,558
packs to find stuff that uh like to get

812
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
a really good idea of what's going on

813
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,918
there to you know and to figure out what

814
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,899
you're looking for

815
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,278
um are you either that or you're really

816
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:55,379
lucky

817
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,419
yeah but yeah I like the real Team

818
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,940
company I'm a big fan of those guys and

819
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,700
uh like all the guys in India the Indian

820
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,100
Land race guys I was just gonna ask you

821
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,840
beat me to it yeah

822
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:08,639
um we've got some stuff from them

823
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,959
through other people that other people

824
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
have sent us

825
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,519
um that we're going to be dipping into

826
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,440
at some point yeah

827
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,918
um and a lot of people like random

828
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,558

that have lived there just get a hold of

832

us see our stuff you know send us a

833
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,278
bunch of seeds to try and uh yeah like

834
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,619
lots of sharing back in the CW days you

835
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,740
know lots of sharing back then you know

836
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:42,778
yeah and lots and some of our friends uh

837
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,000
have been traveling around and now

838
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,079
bring back seeds like our one of our

839
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,898
friends

840
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,119
was in Kenya and he he took the last

841
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:53,398
plane out before they shut down uh like

842
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,798
the cover yeah after covid and he had a

843
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,019
bunch of seeds from he said yeah I got

844
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:00,918
some seeds from some Rasta

845
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,918
um in Kenya

846
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,038
yeah that's that's great to hear and I

847
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,079
think that that's sort of the way most

848
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,058
breeders I speak to get their seeds you

849
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,460
know it's sort of just like where you

850
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:13,139
can you mentioned the Angola and we

851
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,778
actually had a listener submitted

852
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,519
question and they were just curious they

853
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:19,679
said what's the difference between the

854
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,019
two different angolas you use I think

855
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,519
one's the number 13 one's the number A10

856
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,019
from memory

857
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:31,859
uh yeah uh well uh well smell and high

858
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:34,319
for one and uh varying rate of intersex

859
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:37,079
traits you know you want to explain how

860
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,538
they how how where they came from uh

861
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,960
yeah they they came from they were sent

862
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:44,819
to me from La Mano Negros collection his

863
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,620
wife Katarina

864
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:53,639
and it was given to him from a guy who

865
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:56,479
uh sailed ships up the coast to uh what

866
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,480
was the name of that Island

867
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,538
so like a sea captain from Capo Verde I

868
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,120
guess gave him the seeds and they were

869
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:08,579
sent out to us after he passed and um

870
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,398
and that guy was like getting seeds at

871
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:14,519
uh like uh um

872
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,618
places where they were like oil refined

873
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,239
yeah like a big oil refineries going up

874
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,399
and down the coast you know and just

875
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,098
collecting things that he had liked yeah

876
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,739
he wasn't like he was just buying he'd

877
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,720
buy weed and get the seeds from postal

878
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:30,000
ports you know so he wasn't like uh you

879
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,299
know in the bush so I'm playing all the

880
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,219
plants no no and uh most of it was like

881
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,300
garbage like a lot of it was garbage

882
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:42,838
very uh heavily intersex and uh the 13

883
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:46,379
was more Earth EP kind of smells I I

884
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:50,579
liked and very little in her sex and uh

885
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:52,858
the uh 18 was more of a citrus thing

886
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,259
like I had a higher Citrus like you get

887
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:58,980
that Citrus out of the 13 too but it's

888
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,859
like muted a bit it stands out a little

889
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,900
more in the 18 so yeah I just decided to

890
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:05,039
keep most of those smells around for

891
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,900
future

892
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,199
uh projects

893
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,139
yeah nice and like is there a certain

894
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,639
variety that the like the strength the

895
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:15,960
effect is similar to like you know if

896
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,699
you were to say like oh I feel like

897
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,440
super silver haze you'll like this

898
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,539
obviously super silver has bad example

899
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,280
but you know what I mean

900
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,500
um yeah like I put it in a category

901
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,619
called the spiritual eye

902
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,739
I guess not to get too like Wavy Gravy

903
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,599
or anything but uh different people have

904
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:35,639
different experiences with cannabis and

905
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,619
one of them is definitely spiritual I'd

906
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,598
say in the way you can connect to

907
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,720
yourself to that inner voice right kind

908
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,838
of thing and I'd say that those uh

909
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,879
angolas and like the Malawi's and the

910
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,239
stuff like that it seemed to have that

911
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,480
really uh up high that's introspective

912
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,219
and friendly you know not too racy

913
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,320
yeah we're always we're looking for

914
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:02,098
stuff that's not necessarily racy but

915
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,980
more like a creative high uh a creative

916
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,500
and like positive you know it opens up

917
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,500
your uh heart chakra kind of stuff

918
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,119
like your heart chakra and your throat

919
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,760
chakra and your

920
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,140
third eye chakra Etc

921
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,660
um

922
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,879
yeah beautiful I I've always felt like

923
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:24,719
they're a really underrepresented sort

924
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,400
of sativa most often sativa and I I like

925
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,439
I think I probably haven't thought about

926
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,639
this enough really but I always sort of

927
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,380
would tell my friends like I feel like

928
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,019
there's two types of sativas there's

929
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,119
like the the one that annihilates you

930
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:37,800
and makes you paranoid and just like oh

931
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,960
what am I doing and then there's like

932
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,039
the real clear-headed one that's sort of

933
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,079
more like what you're talking about

934
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,059
where it's like you're not riddled with

935
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,339
anxiety and you're like actually upbeat

936
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:48,900
and having a good time and feeling like

937
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,400
hey I'm really connecting with this

938
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,858
actually

939
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,900
um yeah definitely an underserved strain

940
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,699
in a sort of a type of strain in our

941
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,220
community I think

942
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,719
take turns the music up in my head like

943
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,159
those are the kinds of things I look

944
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,259
forward to you know the beat that's

945
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,858
going it kind of takes it

946
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,920
yeah I like to um I like to count the

947
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:13,039
the number of different uh ringing

948
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,720
sounds in my head

949
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,980
if you get more like more than two or

950
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,980
three different sounds you know you're

951
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,500
on to a good one yeah

952
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,659
that's interesting I mean

953
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,940
um I think Gabby just mentioned the

954
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,739
Malawi I mean I did want to ask you

955
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,720
about that quickly just because you

956
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,879
don't really see people outside of say

957
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,219
like yourself and maybe like ice or

958
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,858
canobiage and really playing around with

959
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:40,319
the Malawi where'd you get yours from

960
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:43,139
and how would you describe it to people

961
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,000
is it like a haze or more like a

962
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:47,759
different sort of sativa

963
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,980
there's the African yeah those Africans

964
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,079
they're not like long flowering sativa

965
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,019
types they're like in the shorter like

966
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,140
10-12 range you know uh so it's a bit

967
00:37:55,019 --> 00:38:00,480
more manageable in terms of uh the

968
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:02,639
timely and uh yeah you can find some

969
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,139
really really interesting things in

970
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,838
there but you've got to look through a

971
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:08,639
bunch of seed and make some f2s but uh

972
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,400
to further answer your question oh yeah

973
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,259
we got the seed from uh lemono Negra

974
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,059
yeah yeah so the same stock is what

975
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,640
those guys use yeah

976
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:20,159
I would send a big package when after he

977
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,559
passed that his wife made up for me and

978
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,679
there's there there still is a bunch of

979
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,659
uh his old stuff in there you know we've

980
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,419
grown through quite a bit of it but uh

981
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:33,838
yeah he had a really good touch you know

982
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,119
in the hit with plants and uh yeah I

983
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,799
definitely respect his collection and

984
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,039
I'm glad that we can share some things

985
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,320
you know with the world

986
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,259
yeah nice okay so yeah it's up there

987
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,599
with that same proven sort of stock that

988
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:52,859
the other guys have played with

989
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,140
yeah there's um uh what was that guy the

990
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:57,719
the guy that was selling African seeds

991
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:59,879
out of the UK that passed away like

992
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:02,159
seven years ago

993
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,220
um afro Clips oh yeah yeah I feel good

he had in Malawi as well but I I haven't

995
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:09,899
uh experienced that and it's like it's

996
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,880
like all things um

997
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,559
when you get into those those types of

998
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,320
seeds you have to grow a bunch of them

999
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,000
or be lucky

1000
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,338
to get the you know to get the really

1001
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,719
experience what what it is you want to

1002
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:24,299
experience you know to get to find the

1003
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:26,098
really good Malawi or whatever yeah so

1004
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,539
if you're like a cash proper this is

1005
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,700
that's not the kind of thing you're

1006
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,199
going to want to like enjoy it all but

1007
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,838
you know if you're someone who loves

1008
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:36,000
cannabis these are important lessons to

1009
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,119
learn and important things to share and

1010
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,820
pass on you know or do you

1011
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,500
yeah definitely definitely

1012
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,039
all right so

1013
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,079
take me back guys what was we might have

1014
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:53,039
to get two independent stories here what

1015
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:57,300
was your first experience with cannabis

1016
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:59,639
um well my first experience of wondering

1017
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,820
what cannabis was was

1018
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:04,559
um in the late 80s

1019
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,380
um I was in something called the Navy

1020
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,199
League Cadets

1021
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,720
um which was like uh basically like Cub

1022
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:17,578
Scouts with a navy theme

1023
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:20,399
um and uh I was in uh the band and uh

1024
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,780
one of the officers one day we're up

1025
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,000
there about we're up there with the band

1026
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,820
and he's for some reason he's talking

1027
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,400
about hempro and he's and he said uh

1028
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,800
yeah this hemp rope is uh

1029
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,599
it's made of made from the same plant as

1030
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,320
marijuana and then he had this really

1031
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,900
goofy smile on his face when he said it

1032
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,660
and my uh I was I'm I think I was like

1033
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,760
10 or 11 years old and

1034
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:47,219
um just the way like the way he said

1035
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,859
this is like this is from the same plant

1036
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:51,719
as marijuana and had this big smile on

1037
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:53,940
my face I I knew there was something

1038
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:55,078
something about that

1039
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,260
um

1040
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,599
but it wasn't it wasn't until

1041
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,720
uh I was in my uh

1042
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,280
like I'm I'm kind of late to the scene

1043
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,919
um

1044
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,859
yeah basically when I was around uh 19

1045
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,260
or 20 is when I is when I finally smoked

1046
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:15,659
it for the first time and and actually

1047
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,920
the first few times I smoked it I was it

1048
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:18,838
was um

1049
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,599
it was probably just the particular type

1050
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:25,199
of weed that it just was not you know it

1051
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,980
wasn't that wasn't for me but um

1052
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,179
uh once I S once I um

1053
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,579
found

1054
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:36,239
like I made a new friend

1055
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:39,180
um who is a big pothead and uh

1056
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:42,419
he properly introduced it introduced me

1057
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:45,118
to it when I was about 21 in uh in

1058
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,220
Vancouver when I when I moved there for

1059
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,358
uh for the second time

1060
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:51,358
so yeah

1061
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:53,519
uh yeah okay well when I was younger I

1062
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,819
lived in uh fishing Village on the east

1063
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,219
coast and we would get uh bricks of hash

1064
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,619
that would wash up on the shore or out

1065
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:03,598
in from the fishing boat boats that from

1066
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,220
Runners that would go by so we would go

1067
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,859
up in our little camps in the woods and

1068
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:10,739
get some hot knives going and we we do

1069
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:12,779
these saltwater hash dabs right and uh

1070
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,819
they were pretty gross now that I look

1071
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,099
back on it and they used to call us

1072
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,800
animals and stuff like that but I know

1073
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:23,760
it was really fun and uh one of the

1074
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,140
first weeds I ever really loved was um a

1075
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,880
guy that was on my Island had been

1076
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:29,098
growing for a long time and he had been

1077
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,680
inbreeding this Maui Wowie that was

1078
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:34,260
finishing and it would just get you

1079
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,239
[ __ ] lit you know and uh

1080
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,220
unfortunately you died in a car accident

1081
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,039
and I never got to as I got older I

1082
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:43,559
never got to get those seeds from them

1083
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,420
but uh I grew with them a year or two

1084
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,719
and learned some things and he he put me

1085
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,400
on my way I think it was maybe 14 or 15.

1086
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,199
but yeah I knew that weed would be a

1087
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,420
part of my life you know like you have

1088
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,980
the drinkers and the weeders and as soon

1089
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,700
as you experience

1090
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,460
um some of those uh awesome highs yeah I

1091
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,679
knew it would be a part of my life

1092
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,679
wow that's that's that's cool you got

1093
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:10,019
that sort of mentoring so early on and I

1094
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,699
think my new phrase is gonna be like

1095
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:15,019
don't tell me you're heady unless you've

1096
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:17,578
done a saltwater hot knife

1097
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:19,380
that's great that's cool and it's one of

1098
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,539
those ones where it's like

1099
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,400
people will hear that in front of funny

1100
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:24,960
but it's like it would have given you

1101
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,000
this type of high that you just don't

1102
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,619
experience anywhere else you know like

1103
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,440
as well as the set and setting I'm sure

1104
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:33,960
yeah yeah definitely and we were really

1105
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,119
close to Montreal too so you you have a

1106
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,639
lot of different Ashes coming like the

1107
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,858
east coast of Canada it was all hash

1108
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,480
right so guys would go to work in the

1109
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:43,980
factories and they buy their quarter

1110
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,480
ounce or half ounce of hash for the week

1111
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,818
and mix it with their tobacco or

1112
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,099
whatever you know weed wasn't really a

1113
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:52,079
big thing on the East Coast like it was

1114
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:54,300
on the west coast when I came to the

1115
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,039
West Coast you know and that's changed

1116
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,680
over the years now but that's just the

1117
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,079
smuggling Roots I suppose yeah

1118
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,719
yeah like hash's hash was traditionally

1119
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,579
not very popular in western Canada

1120
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,219
except for places that you couldn't get

1121
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,539
good weed like I grew up in the Prairies

1122
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:10,919
and uh

1123
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:13,440
there was

1124
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,019
like I never saw weed when I grew up I

1125
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,960
only saw uh people doing hot knives

1126
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:20,579
that was my only experience of like or I

1127
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,380
I would sometimes I would smell people

1128
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:27,000
smoking really rough uh joints on the

1129
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,980
street like

1130
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,179
and wondering what you know I was I

1131
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,559
would smell that stuff and wondering

1132
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:33,179
what the heck was going on there because

1133
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:34,500
I didn't quite smell like a cigarette

1134
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:37,139
but

1135
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,980
I never like where I grew up

1136
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:42,420
um I grew up with uh the uh motor like

1137
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,619
the

1138
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,480
um

1139
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,700
muscle car crowd

1140
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,019
and we weren't really big into smoking

1141
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:51,480
weed

1142
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:55,818
we were into uh heavy metal and uh

1143
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,818
drinking booze more or less

1144
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,739
and so I'd be interested to hear Siri

1145
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,358
what was the moment that you realized

1146
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,159
cannabis because it sounds like it

1147
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:08,159
wasn't until a bit later on so what was

1148
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,719
the the Eureka light bulb turning on

1149
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,679
moment for you where you were like this

1150
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:12,679
is what I gotta do

1151
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:16,980
um

1152
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:21,419
well initially it was just

1153
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:23,400
I was working as a machinist so

1154
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,900
um it was for me initially it was just

1155
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,260
the Curiosity

1156
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:31,260
um and uh I just started growing like my

1157
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,300
first grow was under some step under

1158
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,400
some stair like a stairwell

1159
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,060
and I made my own

1160
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,400
uh fluorescent uh fixture with like

1161
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:42,358
six little two foot long fluorescent

1162
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,400
bulbs

1163
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:46,679
and I was like two foot by two foot

1164
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,639
square and maybe like two foot tall you

1165
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:49,739
know just

1166
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,199
hardly any space

1167
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:55,259
um so yeah I was just more I was more

1168
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:56,759
Curious with uh like I I come from a a

1169
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,280
line of farmers

1170
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,680
um on my mom's side of the family so

1171
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,380
I'm I'm kind of like a gardener farmer

1172
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,659
by Nature so I was just curious about

1173
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,760
growing it and the fact that you could

1174
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:09,598
grow your own was pretty cool

1175
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,980
um

1176
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,980
but it wasn't really until

1177
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:20,279
uh until maybe like 90 1998 I met a

1178
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:21,960
friend of mine who was

1179
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,140
I was going to

1180
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,599
um school learning machine like uh tool

1181
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:31,618
and die I was learning two on die uh the

1182
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,599
trade and uh I ran like uh I was at the

1183
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:36,059
school and they had this environmental

1184
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,900
kind of like uh

1185
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:43,380
one day environmental conference

1186
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,280
and this one guy was there talking about

1187
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,960
him

1188
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,599
and uh

1189
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,800
he just said like you know he had all

1190
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,599
sorts of different things that you could

1191
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,240
make out of him and things that were

1192
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,338
made out of him and uh this kind of blew

1193
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,739
my mind at that point I was like whoa

1194
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:00,838
this is pretty wild like that was that

1195
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,118
was that was a point where I was I

1196
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:05,759
started um you know

1197
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,838
thinking about how it could be a part of

1198
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,839
my life basically

1199
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,858
wow that's like that's like quite a

1200
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,560
unique one like I think most people

1201
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:19,858
including myself it's like after a

1202
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,858
really good hit but you're at like a

1203
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:25,259
fair or something that's pretty cool

1204
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:26,519
um okay okay cool cool well we were

1205
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,700
getting we were getting high the whole

1206
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,679
time too but okay well that adds to it

1207
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:34,078
that adds to it so what were some of the

1208
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,639
first strains you guys were growing when

1209
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,260
you started growing and was this at the

1210
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,480
time when strains had names or it was

1211
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,900
like just the kind or whatever

1212
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:46,800
super sativa seed club like lots of that

1213
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,480
stuff goes around yeah uh freeze land uh

1214
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,920
the old old trees land with some of the

1215
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,079
first stuff some of my buddies Maui

1216
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,780
Wowie and uh like we would just order

1217
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,000
whatever we could off Mark Emery site or

1218
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,940
whoever's you know the Dutch scene the

1219
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,858
gray area wherever you know uh yeah grew

1220
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,780
everything just lots of different stuff

1221
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:06,539
but that freezeland really finished

1222
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,300
outdoor in the east coast so you'd see

1223
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:11,400
that a lot a lot around yeah yeah scabby

1224
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,460
grew up on the east coast and I grew up

1225
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,880
on the west coast so our experiences are

1226
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,880
a little different

1227
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:22,259
um I got I actually got to be I actually

1228
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,799
got to go into uh Mark Emery's uh little

1229
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,619
grow shop and buy seeds so um

1230
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,359
I knew all the varieties I was a bit of

1231
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:32,700
a seed nerd at that time

1232
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:35,338
but the first seeds that I grew were

1233
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:38,460
sweet skunk from readership uh spicy

1234
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:41,519
life seed company and they were very

1235
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,240
different from the select cutting they

1236
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,500
were

1237
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,358
uh

1238
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,579
very

1239
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,338
a lot similar to a lot more similar to

1240
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:52,560
grapefruit they were like Indica hybrids

1241
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:55,980
more or less

1242
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,559
so I think that um I think the mail that

1243
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:01,440
got used in that cross looking back was

1244
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,299
probably enough possibly an F1 or it had

1245
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,159
variation in it

1246
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,160
um and it was probably selected for

1247
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:10,739
Indica traits but it's spat out a little

1248
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,838
sativa fennel every so often because

1249
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,739
like would I experi what I got out of it

1250
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:15,900
was

1251
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:17,899
uh very

1252
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,338
um

1253
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:24,119
thick kind of NL

1254
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:25,318
uh like and I'll uh flavors

1255
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:28,019
um

1256
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,420
mixed with like Savory thick Canal

1257
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:33,318
flavors mixed with uh very citrusy

1258
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,318
grapefruit flavors

1259
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,858
which is pretty different than what the

1260
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,619
the

1261
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:42,900
reader Steve Cutters like

1262
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:44,880
and did you get the cutting like around

1263
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,318
that time or it was much lighter you got

1264
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,160
it and you were like oh this is pretty

1265
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:48,960
different

1266
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:51,960
yeah I didn't grow it until the cutting

1267
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,659
until the early 2000s

1268
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,000
uh okay I don't I don't think that that

1269
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:59,578
cutting didn't uh merge till later right

1270
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,579
no well yeah it was a later thing like I

1271
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:04,800
think the I don't know if you told the

1272
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:08,818
story pretty excuse told the story but I

1273
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:12,060
think I uh something along the lines of

1274
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:14,579
they they it's like they uh older like

1275
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:18,059
it was some leftover stocks that they uh

1276
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:20,640
Mark Emery yeah Mark Emery had that they

1277
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,980
grew and found that particular cutting

1278
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,539
in is there a story like one in 500 or

1279
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,099
something but I don't know I've heard a

1280
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:29,219
couple things that's best for Steve to

1281
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:30,720
like billion on that yeah

1282
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:33,719
uh yeah look I can't remember

1283
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,719
specifically but um

1284
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:39,299
um I'm sure it was a special plan

1285
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,338
yeah that's it right yeah yeah uh the

1286
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,720
cowboy maybe something like that if I

1287
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,039
remember correctly I don't know it's

1288
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,618
been a long time

1289
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:48,779
yeah okay and as a follow-up for you

1290
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:52,619
scabby I'd be interested to hear out of

1291
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,540
all the sssc you grew which was the one

1292
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:57,660
you missed the most

1293
00:50:54,539 --> 00:51:01,259
oh Jesus [ __ ] uh

1294
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:03,779
honestly that trees land uh was some of

1295
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,059
my favorite stuff ever because there was

1296
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:09,119
uh fennels like I've tried fennels now

1297
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:11,040
in the future like uh and uh they just

1298
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,480
hit harder there was like something I

1299
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,579
don't know what the [ __ ] happened but

1300
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,760
something happened in their genetics

1301
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:20,280
like the stuff I'm getting nowadays the

1302
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,900
pink uh Pink freeze and stuff the all

1303
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,700
the other cuts that are around they

1304
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,900
don't hit quite as hard as that old

1305
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:30,480
freeze land like it was a very narcotic

1306
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,579
uh Buzz right and the weed was uh so

1307
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,679
potent like it'd be drying in your house

1308
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:36,660
and you like come out of here you know

1309
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:40,139
you can't even stay in the house it

1310
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:42,598
would make you sick right so uh yeah and

1311
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:45,239
uh I don't know why it changed but

1312
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,519
something definitely happened

1313
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:49,979
and you grew a bunch of that right oh

1314
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:53,099
yeah yeah for sure and we grew it in the

1315
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:56,579
future too uh like in the future uh like

1316
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:59,900
around 2003 and stuff we got a bunch of

1317
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:02,280
uh M39 M36

1318
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:06,180
uh M38

1319
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,819
uh and uh it was uh reproduction stuff I

1320
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:13,019
I bet but it was all very uniform and

1321
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:15,300
the same but no real Punch Yeah the

1322
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:16,980
original was probably an F1 yeah that's

1323
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,519
that's probably what was happening and

1324
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,559
uh like yeah that same time uh when we

1325
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:25,318
first grew the uh

1326
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:28,099
ah what was that one by Steve that was

1327
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:31,400
so nice the first seed latiana

1328
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:34,619
no uh

1329
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:37,380
yeah yeah that first seeds of shishka

1330
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:39,720
berry that we grew I it was just really

1331
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,880
powerful and beautiful and everything I

1332
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:45,480
ever tried after that it just didn't

1333
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,858
didn't uh stand up to it but now that I

1334
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,838
look back that's probably what it was

1335
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:51,598
that's the F1 yeah

1336
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:53,539
yeah I think that you have certainly

1337
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,300
nailed that shishka bear one on the head

1338
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:59,039
I think it was either Steve or DJ I

1339
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,559
can't remember which one because we've

1340
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,420
spoken to them both in the past and they

1341
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,099
said that it was like the mail they used

1342
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,960
it's going down and he like there are

1343
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,180
like fans who can quote this male too

1344
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,119
it's like

1345
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:14,460
B150 something but it's got like a label

1346
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,200
and people know it and it's like yeah it

1347
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,139
made some incredible stuff it was like

1348
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:21,058
that first shishka Berry as well as the

1349
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:23,159
other stuff when they were doing that

1350
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:25,619
when DJ and Steve were doing that work

1351
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,480
together it's it's uh it's kind of

1352
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:30,358
impressive I guess that like your

1353
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,639
palette picked up on that on its own

1354
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,759
well yeah that's one of the fun things

1355
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,199
about wheat is we're uh bio essaying all

1356
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,119
this stuff and we're building a little

1357
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,879
computer in our brains you know and

1358
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,760
that's the real fun thing to me like we

1359
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,680
have all these uh THC limits and you

1360
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,920
know this terpene and that turbine but

1361
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:51,598
to me and I I think the funnest thing is

1362
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,940
just building your own library in your

1363
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,280
brain you know and the smells the

1364
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,039
memories that the smells kick out you

1365
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,260
know uh they take you back or in your

1366
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,400
therapy in myotheric brain yeah

1367
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:05,640
definitely

1368
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,519
so moving forward what was the first

1369
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:11,039
cross you guys made individually all

1370
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:13,500
together but I also want to know tell me

1371
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,960
about the cross was it intentional or

1372
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,599
was it like a happy accident

1373
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,480
uh I my Original Seed set I ever made

1374
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:24,300
were actually just sweet scum captures

1375
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,280
just the only reason I did it was to see

1376
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,318
if I could do it

1377
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,599
and I actually I don't and I grew I

1378
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,338
agree actually grew some out but

1379
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,200
I like I don't even remember I don't

1380
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:36,299
even know because I was so inexperienced

1381
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,879
at the time like

1382
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:41,280
some of the stuff I was doing I was just

1383
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,780
I would laugh at I would laugh my ass

1384
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,240
off with some of the [ __ ] I was doing

1385
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,940
back there

1386
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:50,098
but I mean I was only uh 20 years old or

1387
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,358
whatever 21 or whatever

1388
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:55,200
um

1389
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:56,818
and I I was uh I kept to myself so I

1390
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,639
wasn't um

1391
00:54:56,818 --> 00:55:01,558
like I wasn't in the scene learning uh

1392
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:03,118
cannabis uh cultivation techniques from

1393
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,980
other guys that could have taught me

1394
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,059
some good [ __ ] I was like uh just

1395
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,059
reading gardening books

1396
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:12,838
because I wasn't I wasn't that serious

1397
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,839
about it at that point but I was um

1398
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:18,599
yeah it was just a curiosity for me

1399
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:21,000
uh some of the first ones for me excuse

1400
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:22,559
me uh would be like uh unintentional

1401
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,480
stuff almost we were doing a lot of

1402
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,000
Gorilla growing at the time I was in the

1403
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,579
wilderness and uh like uh it was very

1404
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,920
cold back there so I would come back in

1405
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,780
the springtime and oh my God I had some

1406
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,300
seeds that were growing up you know from

1407
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,800
the old holes or whatever right those

1408
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,318
were some of the first crosses so they

1409
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,660
were like inbred Maui Wowie things that

1410
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,519
had been inbred for shortness over and

1411
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:48,659
over and over again in the in that

1412
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:52,679
season to get something to work uh yeah

1413
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:56,578
nice nice and as a follow-up what was

1414
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:59,219
the first cross you did where as like I

1415
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:01,500
guess it's what was the cross you did

1416
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:03,838
where you looked at the end results and

1417
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,239
you were like this is really good like I

1418
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,799
need to sell this and like was that the

1419
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,219
first cross you brought to Market or was

1420
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,220
it just what

1421
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,079
it was great it was it we came through a

1422
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,179
weird time like with prohibition and

1423
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,280
stuff you know we it was like a war zone

1424
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,919
right like people were getting arrested

1425
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,960
everywhere and going to jail and

1426
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,940
um it was just fun to make seeds and

1427
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,039
share seeds and get it out there and you

1428
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,900
know stick one up to the man kind of

1429
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:32,940
thing but uh

1430
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,980
I think it just grows into a lifestyle

1431
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,960
the more you do it in your aptitude for

1432
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,358
it like you know he's really into

1433
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,220
gardening and stuff like that so it's

1434
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,838
just it's kind of a natural thing that

1435
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:43,919
comes about I think for both of us

1436
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:46,019
really

1437
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,180
yeah I don't even remember like I can't

1438
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:51,059
even honestly answer that question to be

1439
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:52,379
honest because I I was young and I was

1440
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,839
just so uh

1441
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,700
so stoned like when anything anything

1442
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:58,858
that I can think about related to

1443
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:59,639
cannabis I was just so stoned at that

1444
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:01,078
time

1445
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:03,058
like

1446
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:05,339
um there's such a difference between

1447
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:07,440
um the reasons I was smoking weed for

1448
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:12,000
back then and like my experiences of it

1449
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:16,318
back then and uh and now I'm like or you

1450
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,880
know in the present uh era so

1451
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,900
um

1452
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:25,559
yeah I was just uh just doing like this

1453
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:27,180
making a bunch of random stuff

1454
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:29,339
um but yeah when

1455
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:30,659
um when I started working with uh when I

1456
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:32,519
worked with reefer Mountain that's when

1457
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,219
uh like I made a whole bunch of crosses

1458
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:37,858
and invariably some of that stuff worked

1459
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:40,078
out even though I was you know still

1460
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:42,179
not really really understanding what I

1461
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,500
was doing learning on the job kind of

1462
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:46,318
thing

1463
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,900
we've heard many people get such work

1464
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,519
experience and I'd be interested to

1465
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,920
delve into that a little more like I

1466
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:55,079
know that you got your start with uh

1467
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,039
sort of the prairie fire and reefer man

1468
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:58,260
days

1469
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,119
what what sort of genetics were you

1470
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,800
working where then

1471
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:05,099
um as you sort of just alluded to were

1472
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,960
you aware of sort of the popularity the

1473
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:09,420
work was going to go on to receive or

1474
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,280
was it all quite a surprise to you

1475
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,220
uh well I didn't like I didn't really

1476
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,559
know like reeferment or a reefer man

1477
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:18,719
um I just met him randomly

1478
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,579
I was living on the Sunshine Coast

1479
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:21,659
um yeah and I just met him one day and

1480
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:24,240
he's

1481
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:25,500
we clicked and uh he said come work with

1482
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,719
me and uh

1483
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,239
the rest is history

1484
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:31,980
and I just uh I was just a guy and I

1485
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,779
knew a little bit about growing weed and

1486
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,358
making seeds um

1487
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,519
enough to get by and uh

1488
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,558
he basically you know set the agenda

1489
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:44,338
like uh you know like I you know I I

1490
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:47,700
hadn't I was not part of that world of

1491
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:51,358
making seeds and selling seeds

1492
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:54,058
so yeah I just uh just learned about all

1493
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,058
that stuff on the job and uh you know

1494
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:59,099
figure things out uh just through trial

1495
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,200
and error

1496
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:05,539
um and eventually I'm you know we would

1497
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:08,159
get feedback uh like from the seeds and

1498
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:10,259
somewhat of a good idea of what worked

1499
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:13,759
and what didn't work

1500
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:16,140
but uh I didn't get to grow old

1501
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,960
you know all that stuff so I don't know

1502
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:20,879
exactly what worked what didn't but you

1503
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,740
can like get an idea of some stuff that

1504
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,818
works because people are still growing

1505
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:26,479
it so

1506
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:29,699
you know some things I know are good

1507
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,798
so what sort of parents were you working

1508
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:33,598
with and did any of them leave a lasting

1509
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:37,619
impression on you or you were like oh

1510
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:39,059
you know that tie was really good

1511
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,099
um he had a

1512
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:42,540
he had his own seeds and he had some

1513
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:44,099
seeds from

1514
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:47,159
Steve tuck

1515
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:48,838
um hair wall the harijuana guy yeah he

1516
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:50,578
got a he traded a bunch of seeds with

1517
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:54,298
Steve tuck so he had some cool things

1518
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:55,740
from him he got like Nepalese and uh a

1519
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:58,259
bunch of random he had a bunch of random

1520
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,598
ibls he had like pass plants uh Steve

1521
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,040
tuck that he traded with us um the

1522
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:03,780
jackassani

1523
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:05,699
Uzbekistan

1524
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,380
there's like four of those uh Middle

1525
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:09,298
Eastern house plants so I got to grow

1526
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:12,960
some of those

1527
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:13,798
um I mean a lot of it was uh he was uh

1528
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,318
more

1529
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:19,380
commercially oriented like uh like cash

1530
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:23,460
pawns and stuff so like that era

1531
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:26,220
for me the like the early BC days was uh

1532
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,838
it was all about commercial plants like

1533
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:30,899
wood plants

1534
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:34,558
look good in a bag uh smell good in a

1535
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:37,740
bag and uh yield really big

1536
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,200
that was that was basically the

1537
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:42,479
like a lot of the plants that were

1538
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:43,199
mass produced at that time

1539
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,500
um

1540
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:50,219
there was a plant called Romulan or like

1541
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:52,260
uh Joe Romulan that people are familiar

1542
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:56,039
with uh Tom

1543
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:58,920
that uh it uh it's not around anymore

1544
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:00,179
because it was not a fun plant to grow

1545
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,880
and it was

1546
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:05,219
it made a lot of small buds

1547
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,619
like it was like a like a sativa frame

1548
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:09,598
uh with in the little Indica buds on it

1549
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:10,858
so it probably was pain in the ass to

1550
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,079
trim

1551
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:14,940
um and probably not

1552
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:17,700
they're probably just not a good sea of

1553
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:20,220
green plant I imagine based on the

1554
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:22,139
description that I've heard of it

1555
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:26,279
um but yeah it wasn't like like you see

1556
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:28,858
a lot of uh Romulan stuff around and um

1557
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,420
her friends I grew Romulan say that uh

1558
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:32,338
like none of that stuff looks like the

1559
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:35,519
original rum like the original Ramen

1560
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:38,219
that they grew back then was um

1561
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:41,159
Little Rock rock hard buds that didn't

1562
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:43,379
get uh any bigger than uh than a like a

1563
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:45,960
jawbreaker like really small round Buds

1564
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,099
and I remember getting the uh like we

1565
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,559
bought some

1566
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,019
some jars from Joe when he was bringing

1567
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:54,960
them into Vancouver and they came in

1568
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:57,838
half size jars what we call salmon jars

1569
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,699
the ounces came in house sorry Stars

1570
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,798
so it was super dense

1571
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:04,199
it's like uh

1572
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:07,920
form cookies you can get it pretty dense

1573
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:09,239
too like it'll fit in a smaller jar

1574
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,579
um

1575
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,500
so yeah it was really raw card stuff but

1576
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:14,760
um where am I going with this it's about

1577
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,900
like Pine

1578
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,180
yeah Pine and uh meat really meaty yeah

1579
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:24,599
and kind of like uh

1580
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:26,338
Curry uh lemon Curry

1581
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,500
um sounds delicious yeah it was really

1582
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:30,599
nice really nice read

1583
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,239
yeah I never got to try it so I'm a

1584
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:34,680
little bit jealous right

1585
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,479
I'm there with you man I didn't get to

1586
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:37,919
try it either but there's so many things

1587
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,659
we're gonna have to loop back on but

1588
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,280
seeing as we're talking about Romulan

1589
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:43,980
let's let's smash a few out of the park

1590
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,079
do you have any idea or just any general

1591
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:48,298
guesses as to what the genetics are you

1592
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,818
know it's one that's so up in the air

1593
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:51,960
and I just I don't think like there's a

1594
01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:54,480
lot of things we don't know about right

1595
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,858
like chem dog and OG but like a lot of

1596
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,380
those things we have an idea but with

1597
01:02:55,858 --> 01:03:01,259
Romulan I'm like I just don't know

1598
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:04,019
I think that's one that uh the story

1599
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,839
went to bed with uh the last like the

1600
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:08,460
people that have passed away yeah kinda

1601
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:10,380
I think so too because it seems like

1602
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:12,059
there's a lot like we've seen a lot of

1603
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,798
weird stories

1604
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:16,079
um come out of stuff that we know the

1605
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:17,940
real story of so it's one of those

1606
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,380
things where the story is so ridiculous

1607
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,900
that I just don't believe it you know

1608
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,539
like I don't I'm highly skeptical of the

1609
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,960
different stories out there so I think

1610
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:32,099
uh what is it Leafly says that Romulan

1611
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:35,099
is derived from a Korean land rice yeah

1612
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:37,019
it could be but uh like big big uh Big

1613
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:39,119
Stone big Korean skunk no I know it's

1614
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:41,280
like Korean and then they they added in

1615
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,680
Colombia yeah yeah that's right way back

1616
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,420
in the 60s yeah okay yeah and then they

1617
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,399
added in well that's the story it

1618
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,539
started off with Korean and Thai and

1619
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,280
Colombian or something like that every

1620
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:51,779
so often they would add in some stuff

1621
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,260
that was coming around that was good

1622
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:57,240
right yeah and then they added in uh uh

1623
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,339
Afghani in the story

1624
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:01,139
um and then they didn't no no that's not

1625
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:03,358
the end no they didn't like the

1626
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:04,618
direction oh yeah that's right yeah so

1627
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:06,179
they added in more Colombian or

1628
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:08,400
something that's right yeah but yeah

1629
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:11,578
apparently it came from Romulan

1630
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,280
according to the story we heard from

1631
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:18,019
Ernie raised yourself came from a hydro

1632
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:21,119
store yeah foreign

1633
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:23,338
it came from the original hydro store on

1634
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,980
Vancouver Island in uh well it was one

1635
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:28,679
of the original early hydro stores in

1636
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:30,179
Port Alberni and so I don't know who

1637
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:33,000
called it Romulan but it was a plant

1638
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:34,798
that was circulating in that that

1639
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,480
Community which is uh

1640
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,759
it's on the west coast of Vancouver

1641
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,858
Island so most of the population of

1642
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,500
Vancouver Island lives on the East Coast

1643
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:45,539
so I guess it's a little bit uh off the

1644
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:48,298
Beaten Track Joe would have been working

1645
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:52,380
at this Hydro shop at that time is that

1646
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:55,318
right yeah yeah so do you think the

1647
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:58,619
people who had Romulan back in the day

1648
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:00,719
did have the real Romulan oh yeah yeah

1649
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:04,079
yeah yeah definitely I talked to Robbie

1650
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,639
about it uh a vision Creator uh he grew

1651
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,619
lots of it when he was living down there

1652
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:10,440
in the city in the early days you know

1653
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:12,599
he had a couple houses of it and uh they

1654
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,480
had cut houses it was one of the major

1655
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:17,160
cuts at that time that was circulated

1656
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,960
and it just kind of disappeared it's

1657
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:20,399
like the era of pink Kush it's

1658
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,858
disappearing in front of our feet right

1659
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,480
now right it just happens people get

1660
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:27,358
bored and move on with stuff right

1661
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,000
better stuff yeah like there was uh in

1662
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,980
back in those days there's eras based on

1663
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,940
the predominant cuttings yeah that were

1664
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,219
circulating

1665
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,858
it was the cuttings that the cutting uh

1666
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:40,618
houses were choosing to propagate and

1667
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:42,719
sell that determine what was ultimately

1668
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:44,338
ending up in the market yeah definitely

1669
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:46,379
because yeah the cutting those cutting

1670
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:48,420
houses were rocking up

1671
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,059
that's interesting and and like I mean

1672
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:53,039
you often hear a lot of people talk

1673
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:56,040
about the cuts in circulation at the

1674
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,779
moment not being real and I guess let's

1675
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,119
put that aside for the moment and

1676
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:01,859
instead talk about how there's like

1677
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:04,920
these alternative lines like I think

1678
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:07,019
like famously there was Federation seeds

1679
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,599
which crossed like white rhino and then

1680
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:11,759
did like this whole BX thing on it have

1681
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,318
you ever tried those alternative Romulan

1682
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,540
cuts that like aren't the real ones but

1683
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:16,858
are still out there oh yeah yeah do you

1684
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:18,179
think do you think they're good or

1685
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:19,858
they're not like it's not the same

1686
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:21,659
they're okay but it's not it's totally

1687
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:23,639
not the same yeah they're okay but

1688
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:26,279
totally not the same for sure yeah like

1689
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:28,440
the Romulan I mean what I could believe

1690
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,720
about the Romulan story is that it was

1691
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,599
there was a crew of guys that were

1692
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:36,000
not had seeds like back in those days

1693
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,798
you know you gotta imagine that just to

1694
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,719
be able to get seeds that were like were

1695
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:41,338
something worth you know possibly worth

1696
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:43,259
growing those would have been like

1697
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:46,019
hugely valuable

1698
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:47,579
at the time so yeah there was seeds that

1699
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:48,780
would have come from Oregon and

1700
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:49,559
California

1701
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,859
um

1702
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:56,519
I made it up to Vancouver Island it was

1703
01:06:52,858 --> 01:07:00,058
a lot of um Americans in BC back in

1704
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:01,559
those days so draft Dodgers yeah so I

1705
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:04,079
could see that part of the story where

1706
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:05,940
there was guys mixing up genetics trying

1707
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,220
to find some stuff that would work

1708
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:11,240
um but yeah I don't know about the

1709
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:14,399
validity of uh but yeah okay to

1710
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:16,439
to uh elaborate more on those new

1711
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,160
romulans

1712
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,099
um

1713
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:23,940
there's a cutting that's circulating as

1714
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:26,880
a 7 79 Romulan

1715
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:28,798
um we've kind of figured out just by

1716
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,260
looking back and you can look at on

1717
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,838
archive

1718
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:37,319
.org Emery seeds.com

1719
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:39,960
if you go back into next Generation in

1720
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:41,699
whatever whatever year like 2000 early

1721
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,358
2000s

1722
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:46,439
um they had a Romulan seven of nine so

1723
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,318
that was

1724
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,420
I think it was uh like I can't remember

1725
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:53,338
the description but it was like a

1726
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:55,798
seven times black cross or something

1727
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:59,099
yeah something like that yeah

1728
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:01,199
so that's just an example of how like uh

1729
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:02,700
stories can kind of get out of whack you

1730
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:05,219
know like they're

1731
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:08,639
they're just cutting being circulated as

1732
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:11,699
as 79 Romulan but it's actually seven of

1733
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:13,920
nine see how it got misplayed right all

1734
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:16,798
of a sudden now it's pre-98 right but

1735
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,838
it's just it was seven of nine uh just

1736
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,679
the word playing telephone how it works

1737
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:22,318
right

1738
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,259
yeah definitely look it sounds quite

1739
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,779
plausible I'd be interested to hear have

1740
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:29,939
you tried any of the other related cuts

1741
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:31,980
to sort of Romulan like these are just

1742
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:35,399
some fan submitted ones so like the

1743
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:37,500
Alberni Pine bud or the Romney yep yep

1744
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,798
do they stand up to Romulan or not

1745
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,500
really no no it's like we were always

1746
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:46,259
like looking for that [ __ ] whacker

1747
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,759
and uh yeah there's a uh there's a

1748
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:49,500
cutting I got from an old-timer friend

1749
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,779
of mine that came from Salt Spring

1750
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,838
Island um but it turns out it was one of

1751
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:57,060
those uh Next Generation or Federation

1752
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:59,579
seed line uh cuttings that they just

1753
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,259
selected out but they've been growing

1754
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:04,380
for years and years but it wasn't the

1755
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:06,600
same like this the cutting height the

1756
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:10,020
um Salt Spring Brown million cut that I

1757
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,420
grew um it was very uh single Cola

1758
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:15,120
dominant whereas like the original this

1759
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:18,179
supposedly uh lots of bugs like yeah

1760
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:21,119
like a big mess of branches and buds

1761
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:23,640
little buds popcorny maybe what's that a

1762
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:27,000
word well they're not really popcorn

1763
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:29,600
because they were yeah yeah hard yeah

1764
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,460
yeah okay and I just want to loop back

1765
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,679
you were talking earlier about some hash

1766
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,179
plants and we we got a number of really

1767
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:38,779
good questions from some of our

1768
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:41,159
listeners and one of them sort of asked

1769
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:43,440
uh that specifically there's like a

1770
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:45,238
number of the BC hash plants and cushes

1771
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,979
that were associated with facilities on

1772
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:51,059
the Vancouver Island back in like the

1773
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:53,039
late 90s uh sorry late 80s early 90s and

1774
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,080
the Rumor was that like they came from

1775
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:57,179
seed that was brought in with hash like

1776
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:59,819
maybe like King hash or queen or

1777
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:02,640
champagne or something notably White

1778
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:05,340
Buffalo has worked with most of if not

1779
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,340
all of them do you know the back story

1780
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,900
on any of these cushes or hash plants

1781
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,699
um and do you think they stand up to the

1782
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:14,039
stuff we see today

1783
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:17,099
oh yeah they're good

1784
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:18,840
um do I know the story about them no I

1785
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:22,620
don't know the story about them I just

1786
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:25,679
know that they uh came out of the the uh

1787
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:27,359
motorcycle guy motorcycle club breeding

1788
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,140
Collective

1789
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,599
um

1790
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:34,380
like Nanaimo the Nanaimo motorcycle club

1791
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:38,400
they were the predominant importers of

1792
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:40,920
of uh of Central Asian Ash in Canada

1793
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:42,479
probably in like possibly in North

1794
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,719
America at that time

1795
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,039
so yeah there's probably more Afghani

1796
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:49,079
coming through the west coast and the

1797
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,760
East Coast right yeah definitely yeah in

1798
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:53,640
that way yeah so those I mean I could

1799
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,800
believe it like apparently they pulled

1800
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,780
seeds out of uh blocks and past was the

1801
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,100
story but I don't know about that like I

1802
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:01,500
don't know if I believe those stories

1803
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,960
just because I um some of those seem

1804
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,039
like poly hybrids to me so I don't I

1805
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,739
don't know if I believe this story

1806
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:10,619
they're just they're pretty nice so I

1807
01:11:07,738 --> 01:11:12,238
would tend to like my in my mind

1808
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:14,399
um if I didn't know anything about it I

1809
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,039
would say they're probably like a lot of

1810
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,819
stuff in like uh early Canadian stuff

1811
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,899
was

1812
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:21,719
that

1813
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:24,839
um that early Canadian stuff came out of

1814
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:27,420
was from Holland hauling seats I think

1815
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,940
my favorite like cushy thing from back

1816
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,679
then is like the Special K that's

1817
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:34,139
probably one of my favorites that stood

1818
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,760
the test of time but that's that's even

1819
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:38,340
later than that yeah yeah that's even

1820
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,619
later than that stuff definitely yeah

1821
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:42,360
but uh yeah so those

1822
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:44,640
when I was working with reefer Mountain

1823
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:47,099
he got three hash plant cuts

1824
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,820
and uh two of them were related one was

1825
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:54,360
called it was called Purple King

1826
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:57,719
and then he uh like renamed it to Pink

1827
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:59,579
Kush because it had nice pink stigmas

1828
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,560
and the other one was called they just

1829
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:04,019
called it the king and

1830
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,940
like at that time I just knew their you

1831
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:09,000
know they're related possibly related

1832
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:10,500
because they're both named King yeah but

1833
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,779
then we we've done a bunch of breeding

1834
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,000
with them over the years so we've hit

1835
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:16,679
them with all sorts of things and grown

1836
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,219
out the progeny

1837
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:21,840
um and actually just by uh like growing

1838
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:23,939
out this stuff I would tend to think

1839
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,260
that they're not land racy things

1840
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,000
because

1841
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:29,820
the stuff that comes out of them is

1842
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,158
really like uh it seemed like they're

1843
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:34,079
poly hybrids yeah they're less than of

1844
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,599
the whole some of the whole a lot of the

1845
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,519
time right and uh yeah

1846
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,280
but they're really the the thing about

1847
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,500
them is they make really awesome uh

1848
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:44,759
bubble hash bubble hash yeah definitely

1849
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,100
they definitely there's something

1850
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,640
special about those two plants

1851
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:53,460
that they make a type of hash that you

1852
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,340
very rarely see in commercial or like in

1853
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:59,219
any weed plants that when you go to push

1854
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:01,860
the house together it doesn't stick

1855
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:04,739
together it pushes apart yeah weird dry

1856
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:07,079
Chrome yeah almost like there's like

1857
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:09,059
static when you apply pressure and it

1858
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:10,859
just pushes it apart or something that's

1859
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,560
really interesting yeah it's like

1860
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:15,000
they're really hard to push into uh when

1861
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,340
they're when they're really fresh like

1862
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,420
when you're um you know not cured or

1863
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:21,000
anything

1864
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,980
um they're kind of like just the Terps I

1865
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,619
guess or whatever compounds are in there

1866
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:30,419
but um they're really um it's really

1867
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:32,698
really nice hash uh yeah like the the

1868
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:34,739
flower is not like uber potent or

1869
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:37,559
anything but the hash is really nice

1870
01:13:34,738 --> 01:13:40,619
candy yeah yeah those two particular

1871
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:43,020
plants the king and the pinkish yeah

1872
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:44,640
look that's great because as you might

1873
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,380
have imagined we got a number of

1874
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,940
questions from the fans about the pink

1875
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,760
cush because you know like it's so

1876
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:52,559
prevalent and popular over the past you

1877
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,380
know decade or two and yet there also is

1878
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,080
so much sort of mystery around it just

1879
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,600
to confirm are you saying that um pink

1880
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:02,100
Kush comes from a cutting that was

1881
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,199
originally called King and then he

1882
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:06,120
renamed it to Pink Kush and then there

1883
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:08,099
was another cutting and he called that

1884
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:11,340
King thereafter

1885
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:13,199
well no it's what they were they were

1886
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,760
called they were already called Purple

1887
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,500
King and

1888
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,420
the king

1889
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:21,119
um but my friend I haven't like I met

1890
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,960
another friend later on who was growing

1891
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,000
those

1892
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,500
and uh

1893
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,439
he called them

1894
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:31,439
purple king and you said the other one

1895
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:34,019
was white king or green King so they

1896
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:35,879
were just calling them but um I mean it

1897
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:37,620
was just you know

1898
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,079
they were I think they were probably

1899
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:41,880
selling most of it as king you know

1900
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,279
whether it's purple or green you know

1901
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,840
you'd be like oh I got a bag of King and

1902
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:48,238
it's like oh did you get the purple king

1903
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,300
or the green King I think that's how it

1904
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:53,698
went down if I had to guess okay but

1905
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,619
yeah those those particular cuttings

1906
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:59,219
were really

1907
01:14:55,619 --> 01:15:01,319
um tightly held for the longest time and

1908
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:03,000
so when reefer man got him he was

1909
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:05,880
probably one of the first guys outside

1910
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,460
of the circle to actually get them

1911
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:10,380
and like my friend that I met later he

1912
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,420
was also one of those guys that he said

1913
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:14,159
he would have got in trouble if somebody

1914
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,020
you know the wrong person found out that

1915
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:19,799
he was growing up

1916
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:22,260
wow very tightly held yeah

1917
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:25,320
oh yeah yeah yeah this is like tight

1918
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:28,380
tighter than tight

1919
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:29,880
there you go and like if you had to

1920
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:31,739
guess the genetics you said you think

1921
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,859
it's a polyhybrid of some sort do you

1922
01:15:31,738 --> 01:15:38,099
think it's hash plant cross something or

1923
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:41,399
it's probably like uh if I had to guess

1924
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,719
um and like like I said before I have no

1925
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:45,359
idea but

1926
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,300
in my mind it would be a cross of maybe

1927
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,099
it could be a old world uh hash plant

1928
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,619
that they pulled that they pull out of

1929
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,120
bricks that they were hitting it with

1930
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:56,460
um seeds that they were getting from

1931
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:59,579
home that would be my guess that they

1932
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,198
got something like Afghani or like they

1933
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:04,019
may have gotten some hash plant seeds

1934
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,059
from Holland and mixed it with you know

1935
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,199
what they were getting out of bricks or

1936
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,719
maybe they got a bunch of different

1937
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,698
plants out of bricks uh seeds out of

1938
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:13,920
bricks and we're hitting like mixing

1939
01:16:11,698 --> 01:16:16,379
them up so I I mean I just can't say I

1940
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,819
but I do think that it was a poly hybrid

1941
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,619
that's basically all I'm trying to say

1942
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:23,219
is I think it's

1943
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:26,158
uh a poly hybrid or both of them are but

1944
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:28,140
yeah after after doing a number of

1945
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:29,759
different hybrids with those King

1946
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:33,600
cuttings um

1947
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:36,480
it would seem to us that the the green

1948
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,520
King is the mother of the of the pincush

1949
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,439
yeah

1950
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,360
because when you hit the pink Kush you

1951
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:44,158
get way more Thanos out of it and

1952
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:46,259
they're like way all over like all over

1953
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:47,460
the place like they're yelling it's like

1954
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,500
a really good

1955
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:52,800
um it's a really good plant for finding

1956
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:55,920
uh wild stuff because uh like it spits

1957
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:58,199
out stuff that you wouldn't predict and

1958
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,719
come out of there yay but on the other

1959
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:01,979
like on the other side of things it's I

1960
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,800
would think it would be a really hard

1961
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:07,259
plant to Ingrid to try and like uh

1962
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,579
capture you know what it uh what the

1963
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,760
cuttings like

1964
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:13,738
unless you're like uh feminized it

1965
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,020
to try and make a seed line out of it I

1966
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:18,000
think would be fairly challenging very

1967
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:21,239
yeah

1968
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,939
okay and out of curiosity do you think

1969
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:26,099
it stands up to the stuff today and if

1970
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:29,299
so why do you think it's sort of falling

1971
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,300
off in popularity

1972
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:33,779
um well this is stuff for today yeah it

1973
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:35,760
is big and it's hard to grow too I mean

1974
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:38,880
it's not the easiest [ __ ] to grow yeah

1975
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:40,980
King Kush is the number one Aunt uh

1976
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,960
grown in Canada right now I would say

1977
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:46,678
yeah definitely I can't think of

1978
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,399
anything else maybe GMO is probably

1979
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:49,739
um

1980
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:51,599
but yeah pinkish seems to be like at

1981
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:53,339
least here where we are where we are it

1982
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,739
rules the market yeah where we are it's

1983
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:58,679
just it's all pink Kush like literally

1984
01:17:55,738 --> 01:18:01,439
nine out of 10 people are growing fish

1985
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:03,480
uh in the whole west coast of BC

1986
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:05,939
seriously

1987
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,759
so just to clarify you think like it's

1988
01:18:05,939 --> 01:18:11,279
sort of still on the uptrend or like or

1989
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,380
at least it's not falling off at all

1990
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:15,840
oh no it's filling off the cliff and

1991
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:18,060
it's like doing a 9 000 foot uh free

1992
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,579
fall into hell right now as we speak

1993
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,860
yeah it's it's its errors done it's over

1994
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:24,719
yeah it's like sticker fork and it is

1995
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:27,539
hopefully this fall we'll see something

1996
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:30,179
pop up and you know we'll see this kind

1997
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:32,039
of yeah there's definitely like uh I

1998
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:35,279
think the next trend is going to be some

1999
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:38,519
uh flavor a bunch of flavor weed

2000
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,679
um but I think uh I think we're gonna

2001
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,480
see a bunch of different stuff instead

2002
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,980
of one you know instead of pink Kush

2003
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:45,779
dominating I think we're gonna see a

2004
01:18:43,979 --> 01:18:47,639
bunch of weird stuff

2005
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:49,619
um because like all the guys out here

2006
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:53,280
growing it uh

2007
01:18:49,619 --> 01:18:57,300
they now have uh Pink Kush uh PTSD so

2008
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:59,519
for sure the blue dream of Canada well

2009
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,860
it's just been overgrown and they

2010
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,020
uh the combination between

2011
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:07,799
the last six months in the last six

2012
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:09,540
months the Canadian legal Flower Mart

2013
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,000
like the Canadian legal cannabis Market

2014
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:13,619
has flatlined the sales have not

2015
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,899
increased

2016
01:19:13,619 --> 01:19:17,939
um so those guys are dropping all their

2017
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:19,679
prices so they're like

2018
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:22,319
there's like a huge War basically

2019
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:26,399
between commercial legal weed and

2020
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:28,979
Commercial black marketweed so

2021
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:32,238
basically uh at the end of the day

2022
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:36,059
um there's too much pink Kush

2023
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:37,979
and uh the price has has to drop down to

2024
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:39,719
nothing basically because there's no one

2025
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:41,339
no one's buying it like they're like

2026
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:43,439
yeah I got like you know the guys that

2027
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,360
are buying already have what they have

2028
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:47,519
you know they don't need anymore

2029
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:48,719
and the guys that and Farmers being

2030
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,620
Farmers

2031
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,719
um

2032
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:54,479
when the price of a crop goes down

2033
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:57,960
double down yeah you got a double your

2034
01:19:54,479 --> 01:20:00,658
double your production and uh so we're

2035
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,760
we're uh seeing that yeah we're gonna

2036
01:20:00,658 --> 01:20:05,039
have obviously that's not that situation

2037
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,860
it's not gonna work out too well

2038
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:10,019
and to add a curiosity do you think the

2039
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:11,939
you mentioned like you know the next big

2040
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,340
push will be like Fruity flavorful

2041
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:15,779
strains any predictions at all do you

2042
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,579
think it'll be something that jumps over

2043
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:20,340
from California or maybe something

2044
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:23,698
unique will come out of the Woodworks

2045
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:27,779
um well in Canada a lot of guys

2046
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:29,579
uh pull stuff out of random seeds stocks

2047
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:32,519
um and a lot of it is just like uh you

2048
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:34,559
know BX uh whatever or it's just you

2049
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,900
know a lot of it is name cross name kind

2050
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,300
of stuff um you know that's just uh it's

2051
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:42,238
got the right names

2052
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:46,739
um and they'll pull stuff out of that

2053
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:48,539
um but definitely there's uh

2054
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:51,359
ton of stuff coming up from the states

2055
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:54,000
like we actually have

2056
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:56,158
the amount of um Elite cuttings in

2057
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,658
Canada is pro is pretty huge like it's

2058
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:59,158
pretty impressive actually

2059
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:02,219
um

2060
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:04,079
so I'm just saying like I think uh

2061
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:06,000
I think the fruity thing

2062
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,859
is going to be the next thing just

2063
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,679
because uh

2064
01:21:07,859 --> 01:21:12,479
it's you know that's the big Trend down

2065
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:14,940
south so

2066
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:17,218
um and we're already seen

2067
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:18,178
um what guys are asking for and it's you

2068
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:21,119
know it's

2069
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:22,199
uh it's stuff that has uh you know like

2070
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:23,099
Fruity

2071
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:25,859
um

2072
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,380
I call it like Flavor weed

2073
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:31,019
I don't know how else to describe it

2074
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:32,100
yeah no that works that works I

2075
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,440
understand

2076
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:37,440
let me take us back for a little bit to

2077
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:39,059
those earlier days and uh we've got some

2078
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,379
really cool fan submitted questions here

2079
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,760
again and they just sort of asked you

2080
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,619
know in the earlier days there was like

2081
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,619
a number of seed companies that were all

2082
01:21:43,619 --> 01:21:49,920
operating out of the same post office on

2083
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:53,158
Nana Mayo the normal is that how you say

2084
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,079
it the normal Vancouver Island yeah was

2085
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,879
there like much collegiality like

2086
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:58,260
cooperation between the different groups

2087
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,579
or was everyone just like keeping their

2088
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,579
head down doing their own thing

2089
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:08,340
um I would say everyone was fairly

2090
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:10,920
independent back in those days and um

2091
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:13,619
the fact they were using the same

2092
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:16,859
mailbox just means that that was a

2093
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:18,719
tolerant uh Meal box

2094
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:21,599
it was the same thing in Vancouver

2095
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:24,359
there's a mailbox by Emery seeds that

2096
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:27,600
when the seed Market in Vancouver opened

2097
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:29,460
up like they all got mailboxes at That

2098
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,300
Money Mart

2099
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,939
um

2100
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:36,239
by Emery seeds

2101
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:38,158
yeah okay so thinking like did the mile

2102
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:40,319
staff ever say anything because like you

2103
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,000
get like these hordes of a mile from all

2104
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,340
over the world and like the volume of

2105
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,600
packages you're sending

2106
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:50,039
uh like I don't I don't know you know to

2107
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,260
be honest I don't I just know they

2108
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:54,539
tolerated it and

2109
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:56,760
I mean I don't know like you can't uh

2110
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:58,738
there's so much privacy with uh male

2111
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,659
laws that uh I don't think it's really

2112
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:01,979
up to the stuff you know to determine

2113
01:23:00,658 --> 01:23:04,679
yeah

2114
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:06,718
um I think that's the jurisdiction of

2115
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:09,000
like the Postal Service to determine if

2116
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,800
there's something not you know not right

2117
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,260
going on

2118
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,300
um yeah now that makes sense yeah well

2119
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:18,960
another question we got sort of around

2120
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:22,079
that time was did any of the DEA raids

2121
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,300
on Mark Emery or the general Crackdown

2122
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,460
around that time ever affect you or get

2123
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,380
you sort of concerned and as a follow-up

2124
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:30,480
did it did it affect seed sales either

2125
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:32,699
going up or down

2126
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,519
well it definitely effective the seed

2127
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:38,899
sales that he was generating

2128
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,900
um well you know what though like

2129
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,619
there was there was there was a ton of

2130
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,779
other seed companies so

2131
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:47,340
um the seed sales were just exploding at

2132
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:50,639
that time you know whether you bought

2133
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:51,960
from Mark Camry or kind seeds or a bunch

2134
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,579
of the other ones there's a bunch of

2135
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,640
them I can't remember them all but yeah

2136
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:58,679
at that time there was

2137
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,480
uh there's a place called the potluck in

2138
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:03,539
Vancouver and uh

2139
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,039
there's some buildings there that like

2140
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,619
uh landlords that were tolerant

2141
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,719
landlords and they would rent out to uh

2142
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:11,340
various seed guys uh like uh smoking

2143
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:15,179
Sean was one of them

2144
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:17,880
grind seeds uh Legend seeds

2145
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:20,060
Emery seeds of course a guy down around

2146
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,900
the corner

2147
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:23,900
yeah yeah

2148
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:27,658
um there's a few others

2149
01:24:23,899 --> 01:24:32,238
uh Canada see Bay Canada Seed Bank of

2150
01:24:27,658 --> 01:24:32,238
Canada it was super sketchy

2151
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:37,920
um but yeah those were the original seed

2152
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,679
uh Canadian seed bank pioneers and there

2153
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:43,679
was a few in uh the East Coast there was

2154
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:45,658
the uh London seed bank yeah Chris Clay

2155
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,679
you know

2156
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:49,759
um

2157
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:52,800
um Quebec seed bank yep

2158
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,159
of course Heaven's uh Heaven Stairway

2159
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,159
yeah

2160
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,920
uh who else would be in there

2161
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,920
uh

2162
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:11,060
so yeah yeah interesting so this guy did

2163
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:15,359
it spook you at all oh no

2164
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:17,880
I mean uh like the main concern is uh

2165
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,380
just being rated at your personal you

2166
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,420
know grow or whatever

2167
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:23,520
yeah I've been rated like three times

2168
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:25,560
and through the uh through the whole

2169
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,440
regular role right so

2170
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:30,840
uh luckily we had excellent lawyers like

2171
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:32,879
Kurt Tusa who stood up for lots of

2172
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:35,219
Growers around this around the west

2173
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,719
coast and you know helped pave the way

2174
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:40,920
for the uh

2175
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,619
mmar program and then the AC NPR on and

2176
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,980
on we go

2177
01:25:42,619 --> 01:25:49,500
interesting interesting just to to Chuck

2178
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:52,979
things over to an older strain I'd love

2179
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:55,319
to grab some perspective on the Texada

2180
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:57,539
time warps probably one of the most

2181
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:00,719
widely dispersed outdoor genetics in

2182
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:03,238
Canada and it originates from like you

2183
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,579
know the VC Island do you think this is

2184
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:07,138
probably the oldest Canadian clone going

2185
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:08,698
around because I think it was it comes

2186
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:09,960
from like the 70s or something doesn't

2187
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:12,839
it

2188
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:14,939
well there's some uh I mean there's

2189
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,279
questions about anything that that's

2190
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:20,879
that's that all there's questions about

2191
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:22,800
um but I mean I've grown it since uh the

2192
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,359
early 2000s so it's at least 20 years

2193
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,920
old

2194
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:27,119
um you know it's hard to say like some

2195
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,760
of these cuttings

2196
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,380
that people think I think people's uh

2197
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,079
memory you know there's a little bit of

2198
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:35,760
memory loss uh involved you know with a

2199
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:36,960
lot of these cuttings they people think

2200
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,940
that they're a lot older than they

2201
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,460
actually are like uh

2202
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:43,259
just because uh you know maybe

2203
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:44,819
you know the people weren't they weren't

2204
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,800
there and they you know they weren't

2205
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:49,979
they weren't there when they're like it

2206
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:52,619
emerged onto the scene and um

2207
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:53,879
they don't really know you know like

2208
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:55,979
just uh

2209
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,039
we'll go back a little bit the guys at

2210
01:26:55,979 --> 01:27:01,799
that time on techseta uh they were

2211
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:04,380
getting seeds sent up from Humboldt

2212
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,920
County uh as well all over the hippie

2213
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:10,139
hash Trail you know and um you had a lot

2214
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,840
of people that were uh you know they

2215
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:14,819
weren't uh Rich they uh barely had

2216
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,560
electricity or if they had electricity

2217
01:27:14,819 --> 01:27:18,299
it was the house down the road that they

2218
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,000
used once a week or something you know

2219
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:23,159
so when that in that time frame I think

2220
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,198
a lot of uh those things are mixing and

2221
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:27,719
there was a fella on the island that

2222
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:30,960
made some seeds Mr Lambert and passed

2223
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:32,819
the move to uh the the community and

2224
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:35,698
they kept looking for the fastest

2225
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:37,319
finishers right uh every year and I

2226
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:39,960
think in four or five years that

2227
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:41,939
something like the time warp came up is

2228
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,698
the story I've heard and uh in the late

2229
01:27:41,939 --> 01:27:46,979
70s in the late 70s around 79 and those

2230
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:49,019
guys didn't even have electricity they

2231
01:27:46,979 --> 01:27:51,419
went to their parents house and put a

2232
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:53,940
fluorescent light you know in the closet

2233
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:56,639
and took a cutting and revedged it kind

2234
01:27:53,939 --> 01:28:00,000
of thing and yeah they had to learn

2235
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:02,100
about uh re-veging and cloning yeah that

2236
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,840
was like all new and like light like

2237
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,639
what's the kind of light you use to grow

2238
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,159
a plant indoors to keep it alive over

2239
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:10,920
the winter and over the years you know

2240
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:13,679
we've seen it really take a beating in

2241
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:16,319
terms of uh like how it grows you know

2242
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:18,000
it's become powdery mildew susceptible

2243
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:19,920
that thing powdery mildew wasn't even

2244
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,139
the thing when we were like young you

2245
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,179
know you never saw it ever around right

2246
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:26,340
so how the [ __ ] would that plan even

2247
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:28,560
know right but uh

2248
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:31,500
yeah it's it's an interesting story

2249
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,300
right and the like I personally I assume

2250
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,760
it's an old plant just because back in

2251
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,380
the day the old time the old timers um

2252
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:40,079
held it with you know quite a bit of

2253
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:42,480
irreverence so I assume it was

2254
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:43,800
I assume it's like maybe 30 years old at

2255
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,198
least maybe

2256
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:48,779
um I know the guy that I got it from

2257
01:28:46,198 --> 01:28:51,119
um his son he had had it the whole time

2258
01:28:48,779 --> 01:28:53,759
his son was alive and his son died at

2259
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,679
the age of 20. so I mean it's at least

2260
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,219
20 years tagged on to what we've got

2261
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:01,739
yeah I mean theoretically it could um

2262
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:03,840
could be from 1978 but I you know like

2263
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:06,059
maybe there's something added on in the

2264
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,860
in the early in the 80s or whatever that

2265
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,260
we don't know about yeah there was like

2266
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:12,899
a lot of Camaro driving people back then

2267
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:15,239
and uh like one thing they like to do is

2268
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:17,519
they'll uh like I've been around here a

2269
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:20,879
long time and they'll take genetics like

2270
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,320
Time Warp Indica A3 but they'll just

2271
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,900
call it Time Warp and they'll give you a

2272
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:27,238
cut okay Yep this is my time workout you

2273
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:28,859
know but uh when you go and sit down and

2274
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:32,059
smoke with them they're like no that's

2275
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:35,158
the mighty might Afghan Time Warp Indica

2276
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:37,380
A5 A3 blah blah blah you know it's got

2277
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:39,779
all this [ __ ] in it that they cross

2278
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:42,119
together every year to get something out

2279
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:44,039
of the season right so I think you know

2280
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:46,559
there's could be a little bit of that

2281
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:48,479
that play too but yeah there's so many

2282
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,280
there's so many uh Cuts over the years

2283
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:51,799
that people have called Time Warp that

2284
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:54,539
they have been handed around that word

2285
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:56,639
yeah it's the same thing with Romulan I

2286
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:57,658
bet you there's like 50 Romulan cuts out

2287
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,060
there

2288
01:29:57,658 --> 01:30:02,339
but the one we have is the original one

2289
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:05,159
that all the old people grew and uh yeah

2290
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:07,079
verify so and it's good it's good we eat

2291
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:09,899
yeah yeah so we we think it's you know

2292
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:12,420
it's it's good enough to keep around for

2293
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:15,599
however long experience I mean it's got

2294
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:18,000
really cool qualities too like the uh

2295
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,039
the way it flowers and passes on those

2296
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,039
flowering genetics to other plants yeah

2297
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:25,979
it's got uh it's got Autoflower in it

2298
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:28,380
so it it's it has Autoflower in its

2299
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:30,419
genetics but as a plant it's a semi-auto

2300
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:32,699
plant yes so when it gets root bound it

2301
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:34,619
starts burn generally

2302
01:30:32,698 --> 01:30:36,779
what do you think the genetics are

2303
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:39,840
because it's obviously a sativa right

2304
01:30:36,779 --> 01:30:41,819
you know the closest thing I've seen is

2305
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,679
uh something called Nigerian Nightmare

2306
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:46,380
that kind of reminds me of it which is

2307
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,880
like a Nigerian hybrid

2308
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:50,100
um

2309
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:52,980
it's it kind of seems like it could be

2310
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:56,100
something like there's some uh African

2311
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:58,138
or Southeast Asian or who knows like

2312
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:00,060
some sativa that's reasonably fast you

2313
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:03,000
know in in there that would be my guess

2314
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:04,800
that there's it's a mix of uh

2315
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,079
something semi like something

2316
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,460
autoflowering that they mixed with

2317
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:10,380
something

2318
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,539
um with maybe a little bit of Afghani

2319
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:14,279
but maybe not not a whole lot yeah

2320
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:16,380
because uh like that in those days

2321
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:17,759
Afghani wasn't even really like not a

2322
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,639
thing yeah it wasn't even really a thing

2323
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:23,699
until the 80s and uh I like when I grow

2324
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:25,859
it inside I see like a a plant that's

2325
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:27,719
Southeast Asian and Thai like you know

2326
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:30,658
and when it gets into the sun it gets

2327
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:32,579
more of the hashiness of like something

2328
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:34,500
you find in the Middle East come out

2329
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:37,260
kind of a little bit

2330
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:39,479
um but uh we sent it into what the [ __ ]

2331
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:42,360
was that company called again silos

2332
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:44,039
nothing banged up on the family meter I

2333
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:47,339
don't think did it no it's there's

2334
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:48,899
nothing related nothing related to it I

2335
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:50,880
mean you hear the the guys who were

2336
01:31:48,899 --> 01:31:52,439
running around the house Trail you like

2337
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,119
uh you hear yeah it could be like a

2338
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:56,460
Nepalese Cross or something yeah yeah

2339
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:58,260
something weird like that right uh one

2340
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:01,679
of the cuts that came out of tuxedo was

2341
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:03,600
A3 indica and it came out of hemp seed

2342
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,219
you know people were throwing hemp seed

2343
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,020
in there in their yard and it was a

2344
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:08,579
plant that came up that ended up you

2345
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,900
know getting grown for years and years

2346
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:12,420
so

2347
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:15,000
um had a really nice grape smell big

2348
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:17,520
buds but it the weather was better back

2349
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,500
then I think too we had longer longer

2350
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,260
summers it's we've gotten more rain in

2351
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,600
the balls easier so I think uh you gotta

2352
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:26,280
keep up with the breeding right well I

2353
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,679
think also um

2354
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:31,139
plants are used to a specific time

2355
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:33,779
period as crazy as this sounds

2356
01:32:31,139 --> 01:32:36,000
um they're used to their the environment

2357
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:38,460
they were born in and obviously the

2358
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,600
Earth is slightly it's more than

2359
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:41,579
slightly different the Earth is

2360
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,920
different they like the climate is

2361
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:45,719
different from when it was back then so

2362
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,359
there's a lot of different things that

2363
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:51,539
have changed since those days so I don't

2364
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:53,460
think like a plant is has evolved for a

2365
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:55,260
specific time period and like we're way

2366
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,300
past that time period so

2367
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:01,679
it would make sense that that plant is

2368
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:04,260
is not uh adapted for the conditions

2369
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:06,658
right now

2370
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,000
yeah I can get down with that and just

2371
01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:11,158
as one final question to sort of wrap up

2372
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,960
on the time warp questions

2373
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:16,379
I noticed you guys work with a plant

2374
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:18,179
called Pine warp is that one that's just

2375
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:20,039
in your opinion sort of like an

2376
01:33:18,179 --> 01:33:21,719
all-round improvement on the time warp

2377
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:23,158
or is it different in sort of its own

2378
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:26,100
thing

2379
01:33:23,158 --> 01:33:27,779
uh it's a commercial plant yeah it was

2380
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,639
during the time when there was a lot of

2381
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:31,439
outdoor growing going on on the coast

2382
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:32,940
and they were looking for something that

2383
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,259
was like

2384
01:33:32,939 --> 01:33:38,939
and uh just harder nugs that would uh

2385
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:41,219
bigger nugs that would fill a bag faster

2386
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:44,039
faster faster finishing the market was

2387
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:47,819
changing yeah easier trimming for sure

2388
01:33:44,039 --> 01:33:50,340
more weight totally and uh it was across

2389
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:53,579
the tree frog was it sister I think and

2390
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:55,739
it was uh possibly a cream soda yeah it

2391
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:57,719
reminds me of the cream soda uh times

2392
01:33:55,738 --> 01:34:00,000
the time or yeah that would be my guess

2393
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:02,639
for sure that's what it is nobody will

2394
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,560
tell you that but that's what it is

2395
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,800
yeah cream sodaka was one of the

2396
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,380
original building blocks back in the day

2397
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:12,840
ah okay okay yeah there you go

2398
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:16,020
yeah a friend of ours uh on the island

2399
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:18,960
grew some uh some some of the mix that

2400
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:21,060
came from hexada like from the Texada

2401
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:24,179
crew and it was

2402
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:25,380
um definitely had some cream sodica in

2403
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:30,480
there

2404
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:33,719
in my my guess I mean my my uh Theory or

2405
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:36,000
whatever but yeah um the cream soda cup

2406
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:37,500
it has like every when you cross it with

2407
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,960
something it'll give you every single

2408
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:44,219
color combination possible

2409
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:46,198
so that's kind of why uh

2410
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:48,480
um some of the stuff like uh Pine warp

2411
01:34:46,198 --> 01:34:51,000
and tree frog has got some cool colors

2412
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,859
going on the original ones were like uh

2413
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,260
baseball bats you know you could knock

2414
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:57,420
your friend down

2415
01:34:54,260 --> 01:35:00,060
you know super thick and Hearty and uh

2416
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:01,980
yeah the pine work was definitely an

2417
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:04,380
improvement on that but the thing that

2418
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:06,959
sucks about the pine warp is it has

2419
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,760
those terpenes that don't hang around a

2420
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,500
long time so when you get into a bag of

2421
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:12,179
it you know two months down the road

2422
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:15,300
you're like oh what is this you know

2423
01:35:12,179 --> 01:35:16,859
it's Gotta Go first right and that's the

2424
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:19,380
way thing you know it was early so you

2425
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:21,119
get a higher price for your weed uh if

2426
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:23,159
it was in if like that three weeks

2427
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:25,019
earlier than the market you know you get

2428
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:26,819
a little bit of a bump so people were

2429
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:28,980
always chasing that over the years right

2430
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:30,599
yeah because there'd be a drought in

2431
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:33,059
August yeah there wouldn't be any weed

2432
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,820
around right we'd be out and those days

2433
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:38,400
don't exist anymore yeah so it that was

2434
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:40,738
part of like how they end or

2435
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:42,960
um being involved is because there was a

2436
01:35:40,738 --> 01:35:44,399
stroke in August and uh to take

2437
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,619
advantage of that you know you'd want to

2438
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:48,779
run a indoor crop because like the

2439
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:50,099
prices you could sell everything at the

2440
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:52,859
highest price

2441
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:55,340
it could be wet and you get like 3 600 a

2442
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:57,779
pound wet American back there yeah

2443
01:35:55,340 --> 01:36:00,719
exactly so

2444
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:03,420
interesting and another variety I wanted

2445
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:05,639
to quickly ask a question about was I

2446
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:07,980
noticed that you guys use a plant you

2447
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:11,219
call the special Kush in the special

2448
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:12,178
Kush Haze what's the backstory on that

2449
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:14,460
kush

2450
01:36:12,179 --> 01:36:16,199
uh that one is actually related to the

2451
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:19,679
Kings

2452
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:23,099
the mother of special Kush is a plant

2453
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,119
called Queen which is somehow related to

2454
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:27,900
the Kings

2455
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:30,658
um and crossed with an Afghani yeah the

2456
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:33,179
it's called Queen Afghani and uh by

2457
01:36:30,658 --> 01:36:36,059
Vision Creator yeah and uh it's a really

2458
01:36:33,179 --> 01:36:38,100
good coach that's uh I mean we we smoke

2459
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,380
all the American things that come up and

2460
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:42,780
it really it is complex it hits hard and

2461
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:44,880
it always has right yeah it stands up to

2462
01:36:42,779 --> 01:36:47,099
most anything Indica that you can grow

2463
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,800
yeah for sure

2464
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:53,460
I noticed on your site you've also

2465
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:55,619
worked with an x18 plan and I wanted to

2466
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:57,480
hear your thoughts on some of the

2467
01:36:55,619 --> 01:36:59,158
various Tom Hill lines you might have

2468
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:02,039
worked with because I think you see a

2469
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:05,399
lot of DC like deep chunk stuff around

2470
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:07,920
but you really don't see much x18 or

2471
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:10,379
like pine tar cush stuff what's your

2472
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:13,800
thoughts on his lines

2473
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:15,179
um they're very uh consistent yeah

2474
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,179
um yeah

2475
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:20,639
the pine I think the pine turn the x18

2476
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:24,239
came from his father and there was those

2477
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:26,159
who were his fathers the the chemist and

2478
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:27,119
the Deep chunk was from Tom Hill if I

2479
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:30,119
recall

2480
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:31,559
the Deep chunk I mean the x18 out of

2481
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:34,439
those three like I've grown all three

2482
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:37,020
the x18 seems to have the most

2483
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:39,059
um the best flavors

2484
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,020
and uh

2485
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:42,179
um

2486
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,520
it seems to be the most commercial like

2487
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:45,600
the better yield out of all of them and

2488
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,239
more um

2489
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,920
vigorous the most bigger like that was

2490
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,959
the problem with the Deep chunk is it's

2491
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:55,440
the ones I grew anyways were very

2492
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:59,340
they're highly inbred so they're uh

2493
01:37:55,439 --> 01:38:01,319
very slow very slow vegging I think the

2494
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:04,139
pink I I don't I can't really like I

2495
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:06,840
can't remember the pine tar push but it

2496
01:38:04,139 --> 01:38:09,659
was very uh inbred too

2497
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:12,000
um and you know interestingly enough the

2498
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:13,920
pine Target you've ever grown it it's

2499
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,179
one of the few plants that reminds me of

2500
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,060
pinkish

2501
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:20,639
your listeners wow that have grown my

2502
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:22,739
entire requests it's fairly similar

2503
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,000
but I I haven't grown it for a long time

2504
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:25,738
so

2505
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,859
um I don't really I can't really say

2506
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:29,519
much about it but I can say that the

2507
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:31,559
the

2508
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,000
XT the x18 is really nice

2509
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,340
um it's got a nice high it's not like

2510
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,840
super potent

2511
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:38,400
um but it's really like it's got a

2512
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,760
pretty good quality

2513
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:43,439
that's cool and did you ever see the I

2514
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,179
always read about this fabled green

2515
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:47,158
apple Fino have you ever come across

2516
01:38:45,179 --> 01:38:48,779
that in the x18

2517
01:38:47,158 --> 01:38:52,319
yeah there's lots of those green apple

2518
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:55,679
and uh parrots and uh like uh

2519
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:56,939
gin there's like gin in there

2520
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:00,779
yeah they're pretty common actually

2521
01:38:56,939 --> 01:39:02,219
those spinos oh yum I gotta get into it

2522
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:04,679
yeah

2523
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:08,340
here's a random curveball question I've

2524
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:11,639
got for you guys what are some of the

2525
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:13,440
more rarer narrow Leaf varieties that

2526
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:16,139
you think the general public are not

2527
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:18,419
particularly aware of in terms of like

2528
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:20,579
the quality of the effect or maybe the

2529
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:21,840
unique nature of the effect are there

2530
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:23,340
any things that you think are a bit

2531
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,400
underrepresented

2532
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:28,860
uh well I think Bruce to preface that

2533
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:30,960
question we need to

2534
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:33,779
we need to like look at

2535
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,239
um the various lawn races what they are

2536
01:39:33,779 --> 01:39:39,539
is they've taken Regional seed stock and

2537
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:40,619
applied a generic name to it so in truth

2538
01:39:39,539 --> 01:39:43,019
there's like

2539
01:39:40,619 --> 01:39:45,238
each one of those has infinite variate

2540
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:48,000
versions of it with a general theme

2541
01:39:45,238 --> 01:39:49,799
within a general theme but um

2542
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,658
as far as answering the question what

2543
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:53,400
are some things that I think everything

2544
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:55,079
like except for they're like the real

2545
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:58,259
old timers

2546
01:39:55,079 --> 01:40:01,619
um I think everything's been you know

2547
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:03,480
Miss been missing for a long time like

2548
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:05,279
uh yeah I mean all that's you can find

2549
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:07,198
good stuff anywhere in the tropics it's

2550
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:08,698
just a matter of finding the guys that

2551
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:11,039
kept the you know that knew how to

2552
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:14,899
select uh good the good [ __ ] from the

2553
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:18,238
bad [ __ ] if I can

2554
01:40:14,899 --> 01:40:19,859
it's a good flower from the hemp

2555
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:21,658
yeah so like

2556
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:24,299
you can cut the good [ __ ] can come from

2557
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:26,939
anywhere in my in my mind yeah it's more

2558
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:29,340
like a land Rave is that a land race in

2559
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:32,579
my mind right

2560
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:34,920
um yeah that's the that's the word I

2561
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:38,100
like to use in my brain

2562
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:42,500
yeah uh land race is kind of uh it's

2563
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:42,500
kind of a a controversial term to use

2564
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:49,139
do you mean like in the sense that it's

2565
01:40:45,658 --> 01:40:52,619
just like so widely misused uh well it

2566
01:40:49,139 --> 01:40:55,619
to me the word land race means

2567
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:56,819
uh plants that are selected by the by

2568
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:58,679
the land

2569
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:00,539
um Without Really without human

2570
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:01,920
intervention

2571
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:03,479
um because when they're like the

2572
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,039
Breeders the old school breeders when

2573
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:06,599
they're breeding wheat or whatever they

2574
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:07,979
would go out into the land and they

2575
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,860
would get they would do their selections

2576
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:13,138
from the land races yeah interesting so

2577
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:16,079
what would you call like a strain from

2578
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:18,319
like that a certain Afghan Village has

2579
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:21,658
worked for you know however many years

2580
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:24,859
historically I would call that a

2581
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:27,000
uh heirloom or a regional cultivaria

2582
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:29,099
cultivares meaning something that's

2583
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,139
cultivated and they're like

2584
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:34,139
intentionally selecting seed

2585
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:36,300
yeah okay I mean it could it could have

2586
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:38,219
it could have aspects of a lawn race

2587
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:41,880
like the Palms coming over from the lab

2588
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:42,960
so yeah it's basically heirloom I guess

2589
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:45,060
yeah I mean

2590
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,980
yeah in my mind right now I'm thinking

2591
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,780
maybe that is an Elon race you know if

2592
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:51,779
it's got Pawn coming over from the land

2593
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:53,099
it's got the influence of land race

2594
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:54,779
um

2595
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,880
um but if they're like somehow

2596
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:59,099
non-engine not to get cross-pollinated

2597
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,779
uh from

2598
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,500
the outside

2599
01:42:00,779 --> 01:42:04,679
um

2600
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:07,439
like if you're let's say there's an area

2601
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:09,600
uh of Afghanistan or Pakistan or

2602
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:11,819
whatever where it's only just Farms

2603
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,159
where they're it's like so dry that you

2604
01:42:11,819 --> 01:42:16,198
can only grow your

2605
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:19,439
your weed plants in certain spots and

2606
01:42:16,198 --> 01:42:21,539
it's all being farmed yeah the nuts

2607
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:22,979
that could be a bunch of different

2608
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:25,380
heirlooms

2609
01:42:22,979 --> 01:42:28,618
um with some slight cross pollination

2610
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:31,500
or maybe extreme amounts across

2611
01:42:28,618 --> 01:42:33,599
pollination yeah it's pretty interesting

2612
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:35,698
to talk about though I mean to like to

2613
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,420
think about yeah how far do you go I

2614
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:39,238
mean

2615
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:42,480
it's really funny though right yeah

2616
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:45,000
um like I I find it interesting how uh

2617
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:47,158
the terminology is constantly changing

2618
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,579
like uh you know is this kind of a

2619
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:53,219
sativa is this uh is this a narrow Leaf

2620
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:55,019
drug cultivar it's hard to like it

2621
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:56,960
there's a lot of uh you know different

2622
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:59,580
changes in the

2623
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,439
nomenclature that have happened a lot in

2624
01:42:59,579 --> 01:43:04,500
the recent history

2625
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:08,519
yeah definitely and I was gonna even say

2626
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:11,158
like I I agree with um many of the sort

2627
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:13,500
of ideas you just put forward what I've

2628
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:17,579
noticed is that people like to use the

2629
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,840
term heirloom to I mean it's in in all

2630
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:20,639
honesty if I'm going to be very

2631
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,699
reductive it's probably just ultimately

2632
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:25,560
a sales thing but people will use it to

2633
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:27,899
describe like a clone that's been in a

2634
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:29,400
certain area for a long time like and I

2635
01:43:27,899 --> 01:43:30,960
think when I asked someone about it I

2636
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:32,279
can't remember who they said oh you know

2637
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,520
if you've been growing it in that area

2638
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:37,319
for 10 plus years it's acclimatized to

2639
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,540
that environment and it's an heirloom

2640
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:42,118
well heirloom is uh just means something

2641
01:43:39,539 --> 01:43:44,639
that's passed pass along like it came

2642
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:46,920
from the errors it's a loom that came

2643
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:49,679
from the errors the thread was woven by

2644
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:52,139
the loom that came from The Heirs I like

2645
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,819
it I like it um so I mean you can call

2646
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:55,980
whatever you want heirloom if it came

2647
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:58,500
from someone else I was hanging on to it

2648
01:43:55,979 --> 01:44:00,419
because it was good you know I mean in

2649
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:02,158
my mind anyways that's what matters is

2650
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:03,840
that the people are doing the things

2651
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:05,759
that they like and keeping them from

2652
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,920
generation to generation and year to

2653
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:11,820
year you know yeah and I do believe that

2654
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:14,520
clones can acclimatize because uh

2655
01:44:11,819 --> 01:44:16,618
every time you grow it

2656
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:19,860
um the plant is always adopting them

2657
01:44:16,618 --> 01:44:22,500
where you select the actual the

2658
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:23,880
the particular part of the plant where

2659
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,279
you select your cuttings from will

2660
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,779
actually have slight variations in

2661
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:28,859
genetics

2662
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:31,079
so

2663
01:44:28,859 --> 01:44:33,179
uh if you take a cut from the top of the

2664
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:34,500
plant it'll be more it'll have more

2665
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:36,658
silica

2666
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:38,880
um dominance

2667
01:44:36,658 --> 01:44:41,759
to the top and the outside of the

2668
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,859
branches is more silica dominant to the

2669
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:47,039
bottom and the inside of the branches is

2670
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:48,839
more calcium dominant so uh like the

2671
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,698
north side of the plant will be

2672
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:52,560
different from the the south side of the

2673
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:55,079
plant for instance

2674
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:58,139
um yeah there's slight very slight uh

2675
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:59,880
differences in the genetics

2676
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:01,920
that's really interesting stuff you

2677
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,960
don't hear that talked about very much

2678
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,880
while we're talking about slight

2679
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,980
variations in genetics I I forgot to

2680
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:11,279
bring it up earlier when we were talking

2681
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:14,459
about the Iraqi f2s you did did you see

2682
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:16,859
anything come out in the f2s that was

2683
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:20,880
like recessive and not in the f1s or

2684
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:22,859
were they like quote land race enough

2685
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,480
that it was like largely speaking

2686
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:25,198
homogeneous because the line was sort of

2687
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:27,539
pure

2688
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,000
uh no it wasn't pure at all it was just

2689
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:31,618
uh we only did a it was a one-to-one

2690
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,359
selection so it would have been those

2691
01:45:31,618 --> 01:45:34,738
two individual funds so you got to think

2692
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:36,899
of that as a

2693
01:45:34,738 --> 01:45:37,979
uh the f2s were kind of like a hybrid

2694
01:45:36,899 --> 01:45:39,599
them

2695
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:42,599
they're probably it's like probably more

2696
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:44,820
like a hybrid like a F1 yeah um because

2697
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:47,639
it's just it's just a [ __ ] mix you know

2698
01:45:44,819 --> 01:45:49,799
of Iraqi genetics so

2699
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:52,920
um you know we're still it's gonna take

2700
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:54,179
like there is all sorts of variations of

2701
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,679
stuff in there

2702
01:45:54,179 --> 01:45:58,500
um so it's going to take a few more

2703
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,719
generations to to uh you know get it

2704
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:02,880
stabilized looking consistent

2705
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,520
like some um

2706
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:08,219
some interesting terms that are used in

2707
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:10,199
uh reading terminology are um

2708
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:12,239
stability

2709
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:15,000
and consistency

2710
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:17,039
and I like I like to think about these

2711
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,479
things sometimes and to me stability

2712
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:21,658
means

2713
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:24,599
a plant that you can use for breeding

2714
01:46:21,658 --> 01:46:26,960
that the progeny are are not all over

2715
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,960
the place

2716
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,480
but a lot

2717
01:46:28,979 --> 01:46:33,000
a lot of people use the word stability

2718
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:34,979
to mean plants that don't don't uh get

2719
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,960
like term flowers

2720
01:46:34,979 --> 01:46:42,599
what would you call a plant that doesn't

2721
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:44,579
produce hermaphrodite flowers

2722
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:48,420
uh

2723
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:52,219
uh true a true female straight yeah like

2724
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:55,560
true female an arrow I don't know

2725
01:46:52,219 --> 01:46:57,658
it's interesting isn't it because like I

2726
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:59,940
I have this discussion in one form or

2727
01:46:57,658 --> 01:47:02,219
another with lots of guests because

2728
01:46:59,939 --> 01:47:04,439
there's it's not just in this particular

2729
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:07,020
example it's it's replete throughout all

2730
01:47:04,439 --> 01:47:08,579
of our nomenclature people misuse it and

2731
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,860
I guess it sort of all boils down to

2732
01:47:08,579 --> 01:47:13,559
this issue of like you know because some

2733
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:15,960
people like to be like oh an Indica is

2734
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:17,940
actually is meant to mean Indian which

2735
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:20,579
is sativa and you know like they they go

2736
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:22,319
through that whole sort of thing and I

2737
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:26,039
guess it sort of boils down to this idea

2738
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:28,920
of we'll do do I use the technically

2739
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:30,539
incorrect term because we both know what

2740
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,039
we're talking about and it's like we're

2741
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:34,738
we're talking we're trying to represent

2742
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:36,899
that we're talking about the same idea

2743
01:47:34,738 --> 01:47:38,939
um it's interesting or or do we like

2744
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:41,339
draw a line in the sand and say like we

2745
01:47:38,939 --> 01:47:42,299
have to like you know really get on top

2746
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,579
of it

2747
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:46,260
in what in my mind one of those terms is

2748
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:48,600
an academic term and the other one's

2749
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:52,440
like just a regular regular day language

2750
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:55,260
yeah yeah do you like most donors they

2751
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:56,879
don't really care about like narrow Leaf

2752
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:58,619
drug called the bar you know broadly

2753
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,139
drug cultivar they just want to know

2754
01:47:58,618 --> 01:48:04,439
does it have a cerebral effect or does

2755
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:07,739
it have more of a relaxing body effect

2756
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:10,439
you know so and so I think that uh I

2757
01:48:07,738 --> 01:48:12,359
mean that's ultimately the question

2758
01:48:10,439 --> 01:48:15,599
yeah that's definitely a hard question

2759
01:48:12,359 --> 01:48:17,880
like how do you uh amplify those

2760
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:20,760
qualities that are important enough to

2761
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:22,800
uh you know give it a name or give it a

2762
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,500
category I guess yeah it's interesting

2763
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,840
we'll see what we come up with lots of

2764
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,460
people smoking weed now so

2765
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,039
definitely and it's definitely something

2766
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:35,460
that evolves over time

2767
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:36,960
yeah but eventually they're um is

2768
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:38,579
probably those terms are probably going

2769
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,380
to be thrown up like completely they're

2770
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:42,359
going to just uh

2771
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:44,039
be extinct at some point

2772
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:45,899
just because like it just it won't make

2773
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:47,039
any sense at some point

2774
01:48:45,899 --> 01:48:49,379
um because everything's you know

2775
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:50,698
everything's hybridized and

2776
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,440
um

2777
01:48:50,698 --> 01:48:54,658
there's just so many variations that you

2778
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:56,819
kind of just like slop a label like this

2779
01:48:54,658 --> 01:48:57,719
one's in a sensitiva

2780
01:48:56,819 --> 01:48:59,460
um

2781
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:01,260
but I think you can definitely say like

2782
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,539
this one's got more cerebral qualities

2783
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:06,060
yeah that's the way I like to do it when

2784
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:08,519
a bio was saying is like you know the

2785
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:10,560
qualities that you like as a person how

2786
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:13,020
does that reflect out in a plan you know

2787
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,940
and um depends what kind of person you

2788
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,619
are if you're creative you're mathematic

2789
01:49:14,939 --> 01:49:20,939
you're whatever you know

2790
01:49:16,618 --> 01:49:24,738
uh so like uh it's just uh yeah it'll be

2791
01:49:20,939 --> 01:49:24,738
interesting to see I [ __ ] lost myself

2792
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:33,139
[Laughter]

2793
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:33,138
yeah another thing about it is um sorry

2794
01:49:34,679 --> 01:49:40,500
um another thing about it is um with the

2795
01:49:37,319 --> 01:49:43,559
new all these like we've read out not us

2796
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:46,079
per se but the community has spread out

2797
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:48,239
all the alternative cannabinoids so as

2798
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:49,738
we ReDiscover all those alternative

2799
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:51,779
cannabinoids we're gonna have to come up

2800
01:49:49,738 --> 01:49:54,779
with the new definitions for things like

2801
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:57,618
you know what is what does CBC bring to

2802
01:49:54,779 --> 01:50:00,238
the table what is uh um age

2803
01:49:57,618 --> 01:50:03,118
thcv like you know when we started

2804
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:06,299
having more complex uh combinations like

2805
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:10,019
thcv mixed with uh high THC with you

2806
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:13,619
know if you had like the uh relaxing the

2807
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:15,719
non-cerebral terpenes uh mixed with thcv

2808
01:50:13,618 --> 01:50:17,279
and high THC what's going to happen you

2809
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:19,500
know like

2810
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:22,019
um and then throw in some CBC like uh

2811
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:23,639
like a big shot of CBC or something like

2812
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,320
that you know

2813
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:29,039
um we're going to be moving into

2814
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:30,719
Uncharted Territory territory

2815
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:32,819
like we're only dealing with two

2816
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,380
cannabinoids right now or you know for

2817
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:37,019
the most part

2818
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:39,420
yeah look it's it's gonna be wild and

2819
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:40,920
wonderful and we've had a range of

2820
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:44,219
different uh

2821
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:46,139
predictions in the past including um

2822
01:50:44,219 --> 01:50:48,899
people won't even be smoking weed in the

2823
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:50,579
future it'll be all produced by yeast

2824
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:52,439
and it'll just be like kind of annoyed

2825
01:50:50,579 --> 01:50:55,979
in a few beers and that's all we'll do

2826
01:50:52,439 --> 01:50:57,599
so it's some interesting uh ideas for

2827
01:50:55,979 --> 01:51:00,000
the future I just wanted to quickly

2828
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:01,440
bring us back though to the Past for a

2829
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,539
moment well it's the present but it's

2830
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:06,719
also the past I know that in the past

2831
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:08,819
you guys had um ran some ads in high

2832
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:10,618
times and I was interested to hear like

2833
01:51:08,819 --> 01:51:14,698
what's your thoughts on High Times Now

2834
01:51:10,618 --> 01:51:16,920
versus in the past and specifically do

2835
01:51:14,698 --> 01:51:20,118
you think it has any sort of real value

2836
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:20,118
at at this point

2837
01:51:21,658 --> 01:51:26,579
um I don't think it'd add much value

2838
01:51:24,118 --> 01:51:29,519
um yeah you know other than uh

2839
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:32,219
it was something for people to you know

2840
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,900
get stoned and look at right or just it

2841
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:35,579
was just something in culture to bring

2842
01:51:33,899 --> 01:51:37,859
the Cannabis culture bringing that

2843
01:51:35,579 --> 01:51:39,658
question into the mind it's like uh to

2844
01:51:37,859 --> 01:51:42,899
me it's like uh

2845
01:51:39,658 --> 01:51:44,099
national no it's a National Enquirer the

2846
01:51:42,899 --> 01:51:46,799
the

2847
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:48,840
news the newspapers you see at the at

2848
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,900
the grocery store in the lineup you know

2849
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:52,800
like uh with like uh Kanye West did this

2850
01:51:51,899 --> 01:51:55,920
and

2851
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,420
Etc you know it's it's a it's a it's a

2852
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,340
it was a delivery vehicle for

2853
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:01,260
advertising like let's be uh let's be

2854
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:04,199
straight yeah

2855
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:08,400
yeah sure okay and I think it was uh

2856
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:09,599
yeah like it was started by uh law types

2857
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:11,460
or something like like they knew the

2858
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,960
laws and [ __ ] so they they knew what

2859
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:14,819
they could get away with but it's cool

2860
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:17,460
yeah it's cool like it was

2861
01:52:14,819 --> 01:52:19,979
for it's cool for what what it did like

2862

2866
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:31,039
the quality of what it was

2867
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,039
