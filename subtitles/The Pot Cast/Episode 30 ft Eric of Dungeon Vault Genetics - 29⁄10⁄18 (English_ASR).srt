thanks man for having me

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,799
no worries so the first question i gotta

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
ask you i feel like it's almost like

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,200
obligatory at this point how do you feel

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439
about granddaddy purple

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,159
the strain yeah

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,239
i love it it's uh it's it's a good

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
strain i feel like

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,039
classic i'm from california originally

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,320
so from the time that i first discovered

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,079
some really good perps till now even you

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,158
all have that we have the same opinion

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,000
we call it you just call it the perps we

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
have that it's got that that purple

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
smell whatever but

49
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,759
the cut of kim's gdp that i bred with

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,479
and the one that i'm so familiar with

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,519
a lot of people say came from the urkel

52
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,879
family

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,039
and if that's the case then it seems

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,679
like i might need to dig more into the

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
purple urkel lines because it's got that

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
it's it's very it's just a great plant

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,319
in general i think the for medicinal

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,159
values and

59
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,478
breeding wise everything it's just it's

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,799
a it's perfect

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,200
and how do you feel about the

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,439
sometimes comparison made that it's kind

63
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,359
of like a cash cropper version of urkel

64
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,239
do you see that per se and do you do you

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,239
find that to be a negative thing

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,800
i wouldn't say negative i think at this

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,200
point um

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
honestly in in the circles that i see

69
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,439
and the people that are running stuff it

70
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,439
almost seems like the purple's like just

71
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,519
straight purple whether it be urkel

72
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,280
granddaddy some of those are not

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
um i don't see them getting pumped out

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
as much it seems like it's kind of

75
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,119
moved on to the hype circles you know

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
like a lot more of these

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
you know

78
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,799
newer stuff that's come out but there

79
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,479
are certain breeders who i see working

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
with that stuff and they're absolutely

81
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,959
killing it and everyone's loving their

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,479
gear so

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
knowing that there's obviously some good

84
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,280
things going on i imagine that

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
um

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,479
the urkel i don't know

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,959
like i said i haven't had as much

88
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,639
experience with that one so i i've only

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,319
seen it um when i lived down in

90
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,439
california it's been a while since since

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,759
i've been up in washington that i've

92
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,120
seen that but

93
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,799
yeah for sure

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
and i guess this is maybe just a more

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,200
personal question i was wondering

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,599
do you find that mendo perps and gdp get

97
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,280
confused a lot

98
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,119
i think i think many strains get

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,719
confused a lot but yeah definitely the

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
perps just like i said earlier anything

101
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,080
that's got purple has that smell someone

102
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,079
immediately goes oh it's that mendo perp

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
so that's this or that but there's so

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,239
many varieties that that all have very

105
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,640
similar smells and or it could be you

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,360
know crossbreeds with each other so

107
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,119
who's to really know some guys out there

108
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
you open a bag you know exactly what

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
you're smelling you've been familiar

110
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
with it you've smoked you've grown

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,719
you've seen it

112
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,759
to me

113
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,719
mendo perps

114
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,798
i think is completely different than say

115
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,479
gdp and some of these other ones i i

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,400
used to get mendo purp so it's a lot

117
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,919
more of a darker

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,158
um

119
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,598
i almost want to say sweet it's been a

120
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,679
little while but

121
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,359
i will say they're different

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,719
in my opinion

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
yeah definitely

124
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,720
so fast forward to now what are you

125
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,599
currently smoking on

126
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
well

127
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
i just got done smoking some platinum

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
girl scout yeah i'm still smoking

129
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,519
cookies

130
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,120
hey it's good right

131
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,198
yeah i love it it's one of those things

132
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
like just like a good og or really

133
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,879
anything i'm a connoisseur so i'm

134
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160
staring at my jars right now i've got

135
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:39,040
gelato i've got some dr gonzo i've got

136
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,639
brandywine citrus farmer um i got the

137
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
cookies um

138
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
kind of a kind of a mixed array of

139
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,478
things but i do like smoking my strains

140
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,879
when i go every time i go to a cup

141
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,399
uh i'm always running into people who

142
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,560
have grown my strains and they come by

143
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,758
and shoot me a jar or something

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
and that's always really cool because

145
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
then i get to go home and smoke it and

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
sample it and sometimes it's not a great

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,720
sample sometimes they're extremely well

148
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,038
grown so it's kind of a toss up and it's

149
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
it's really cool so

150
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,599
i'm loving anything right now that's got

151
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,439
a good smell and a good flavor so

152
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,439
yeah okay and in general are you more an

153
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,918
indica or a sativa guy

154
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,120
definitely indica or indica hybrid i i

155
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,038
don't mind

156
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
uh good sativa i'm trying to bring more

157
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,599
of that into my work actually but

158
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,359
to me on a daily what i'm looking for i

159
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
i want to know i'm stoned i want to feel

160
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,560
that slap across the face or the couch

161
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
lock kind of a high so i prefer the

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,478
indica but

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,160
man it's kind of hard to rival a a

164
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,800
really nice smell in sativa you know you

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,240
get the right one um and it and it

166
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,199
definitely puts a smile on your face so

167
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,600
there's there's kind of days right i

168
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,439
would like to smoke a sativa i think but

169
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,439
my my jars are always filled with dense

170
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,399
buds

171
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,478
that's a good description

172
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,198
so let's go back to the start what was

173
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,800
your first experience with cannabis

174
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,000
man i had a neighbor two doors down from

175
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
me who

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,519
um

177
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,918
he worked for disney or he works for

178
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,359
disney now because now excuse me but he

179
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,240
he uh

180
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
he turned me on to the weed he had i had

181
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
shown up to his house and was talking

182
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,959
about wanting to get high and i knew he

183
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,560
smoked and he had i had only seen

184
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,000
you know pictures of stuff at that point

185
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,519
but uh

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,079
he had some

187
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,918
uh i guess what you know green bud

188
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,399
a lot of you were smoking the mexi weed

189
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,599
back when i first started um you know

190
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
compressed

191
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400
swag straight brown bud with seeds and

192
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,799
stems this guy was the first person to

193
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,519
show me some actual

194
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,199
um you know killer bud that that looked

195
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,680
like what i saw in magazines in the high

196
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,639
times and things back in the day so

197
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,400
he

198
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,079
he was the first person to get me stoned

199
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,159
and that was that was pretty awesome i

200
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,478
mean that to this day i've still sent

201
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,759
him messages here and there said man

202
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,639
if you could only see where i'm at now

203
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,038
bro like it's your fault

204
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,079
he definitely led the he got he sparked

205
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,079
the interest so to speak

206
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,400
so that was that was really cool but

207
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,560
i've got um

208
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,239
yeah there's there's a lot of memories

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,598
but i think that that was probably he

210
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,160
was probably the the number one

211
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,240
influence in my life for weed

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,199
and so when did you make the transition

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
from enthusiast to grower

214
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
well

215
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,959
there's a big difference between

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
a guy who grows

217
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,318
or someone who is popping seeds for

218
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,079
instance or anything that matter and

219
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
then someone who's actually successfully

220
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,639
growing like i've been popping seeds

221
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
since i was a little kid i'd throw them

222
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,478
over the place in my parents yard i'd

223
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
i'd set a little spot in the field and

224
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,639
think it was good sure all my friends

225
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,839
had to get taken within a month

226
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,680
i lost

227
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,119
tons of plants along the way before i

228
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
realized that okay you're supposed to

229
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,079
keep your mouth shut about this it's

230
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
supposed to be a secret you don't tell

231
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,959
nobody so i think when i really got into

232
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,879
growing and had my first successful grow

233
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,279
wasn't until

234
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,400
probably close to

235
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,878
uh honestly like 2 000

236
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,799
shoot that'd have been like 2003

237
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,599
because i had grown no excuse me i'm

238
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,879
wrong

239
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,360
maybe a little bit before that but

240
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,360
either way it i'd been growing a while

241
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,280
but nothing to a point where

242
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,598
i had it down i was successfully

243
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,519
cropping i was able to you know look at

244
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,079
my work and say damn look what i've done

245
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,758
or you know gain something from it there

246
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,199
was too many times where i was getting

247
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,879
all the way to the end and then someone

248
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,560
would come and rip my plants and it's

249
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,759
because i had a big mouth so

250
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,158
um that's that's why i say successful

251
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,158
so it's probably probably a good 15 plus

252
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,038
years now that i've been actually

253
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,038
at it but uh and

254
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,199
and what was it that stimulated you to

255
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,958
start creating your own seeds was it

256
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,440
self-sufficiency or you got interested

257
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,039
in being able to offer something

258
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
no because when i started you could

259
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,319
still get a good number for your weed i

260
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,679
mean people were still selling you know

261
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
um

262
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,599
i mean 300 ounces so

263
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,120
it was very

264
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
good if you could get into the if you

265
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
can get into the industry or in the

266
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,278
business and have a medical card or not

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,039
if you were just growing and selling

268
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,879
weed you were doing okay for yourself

269
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,079
but to me

270
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,720
i think i've always just been very very

271
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,879
interested in i don't know why but i i

272
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,040
just i just every time i smelt pot it

273
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,720
was just like a total like my head would

274
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,278
spin and to speak you know i don't know

275
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,639
if you're there's this old uh tv show

276
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,080
back in the day when i was a kid and the

277
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,600
guy would smell cheese and his head

278
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,278
would spin he'd go crazy every time he

279
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,639
smelled cheese and i kind of that's

280
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,639
that's pretty much how i was with weed

281
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,958
so i knew something was up with it there

282
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,120
was more than i just like i just enjoy

283
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,559
smoke and i i was so enthralled with it

284
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,639
that i knew there was something more to

285
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
it i was really interested in all the

286
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,600
different strains and categorizing

287
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,278
things and and um i'd look in the excuse

288
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,480
me

289
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,600
i'd look in the beginning of those uh

290
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,440
i don't remember the name of the

291
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
magazine but they'd have a huge seed

292
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
catalog and i would just sit there and

293
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,639
highlight all the strains i wanted to

294
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,879
get and what i was wanted to you know

295
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,958
see but um

296
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,000
yeah it kind of just took over and i

297
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,239
feel like

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,679
i feel like the seed thing

299
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,759
more or less became a part of me because

300
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,759
i wanted to have

301
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,958
my own lines i wanted to say hey i made

302
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,799
that

303
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,239
there were certain things i wanted to

304
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,359
smell and i wasn't smelling and i

305
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,759
thought it would be cool if i could

306
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,759
create something that had certain you

307
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,600
know flavors that we were after i've

308
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,679
always been a skunk fan when i was a kid

309
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
so anything that really stunk that's

310
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,359
what i was really into and really wanted

311
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,800
so i thought that at some point i'd

312
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,240
really like to get into making something

313
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,799
that really you know you crack the jar

314
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,159
and makes the whole whole uh house smell

315
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,039
and i'll have people asking where the

316
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,679
weed is at so that's that's been a goal

317
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,240
for a long time i guess yeah

318
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,958
yeah that's a fun memory of so many

319
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,278
guests on the show um something i wanted

320
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,838
to mention a lot of people probably know

321
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,399
you by your online forum handle for so

322
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,839
long i was trying to dig it up but to be

323
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,799
honest i ran out of time i remember it

324
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,399
was pnw something what was it

325
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,639
it was uh originally it was uh man what

326
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,799
was that pacific northwest grown

327
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,480
was my original um since 2004

328
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,838
um maybe even earlier because i was i

329
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,720
was on overgrow i was originally on

330
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
um

331
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
i think it was stoned stupid or

332
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
something way back in the day and then i

333
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,639
uh

334
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,959
we all overgo got hit and shut down and

335
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,838
everybody jumped to ic mags so i had

336
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,518
made

337
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,279
sort of made friends with some of these

338
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,440
heads that were actually pretty popular

339
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,120
people at their time

340
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
and so when we made the switch over to

341
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,039
icmag i switched my name to pacific

342
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,639
northwest grown and

343
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,319
that in a way kind of started my whole

344
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,600
career in a in a sense as well because

345
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
that's when i really started getting

346
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,800
into genetics and i had met a man by the

347
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,759
name of captain [Â __Â ] he has done work

348
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,919
with dna genetics and and he has his own

349
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,600
seed line i don't he's kind of

350
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,240
behind the shadows i'm not exactly sure

351
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
what he's up to nowadays but he he's i

352
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
mean he's kind of taking a step back i'm

353
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,719
not sure but he he had some amazing

354
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,399
stuff and he and i had been exchanging

355
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
stuff for a minute there and we we had

356
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,639
talked for for quite a while and and he

357
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,919
had really i think he actually was

358
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,919
another now i mentioned it was another

359
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,519
huge influence in me wanting to make my

360
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,039
own seeds as well so

361
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,639
um

362
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,919
yeah people like that there was a ton of

363
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
guys on there that were just real

364
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,278
popular heads that that yeah switched

365
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,879
over to ic meg and icymag was

366
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,720
really that was the spot if you want to

367
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,480
talk about anything you want to know the

368
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
latest and greatest on genetics that was

369
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,959
your place to go and then if you had a

370
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,799
somewhat decent reputation

371
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,719
you would be well known on there enough

372
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,919
to where people they'd mess with you

373
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,639
they'd talk to you and you could make

374
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,240
some some decent friends on and offline

375
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,159
so

376
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,759
it was kind of cool

377
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,078
yeah it sounds like the glory days in a

378
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,480
lot of ways were there any people on

379
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,239
there who you kind of looked up to in

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
regards to breeders or just even people

381
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,399
in general or was it more of like a

382
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,399
inward community type of thing

383
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,639
no you know what there was

384
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,159
buddies we would be up all night waiting

385
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,399

386
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,240

387
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,958

390
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,159
busted because of rezdog actually

391
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,519
sad to say but uh there was other people

392
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,439
as well that those were those were the

393
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,278
um those are the people that were making

394
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
big moves back then they had they had

395
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,000
huge

396
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
following and before this whole

397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
instagram thing that was that i mean you

398
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,759
look at the forums and you basically

399
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
look at the person's little like karma

400
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,919
points how many how many posts do they

401
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,519

you know credit do they have on this

403
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,159

senior members or a breeder and whatever

405
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,958
and that's another thing you couldn't

406
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,639
talk to these people like you do now

407
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,399
it's crazy nowadays you can just hit up

408
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,159
anybody and everybody and it's just

409
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,839
they're they're really a direct message

410
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,879
away it's it's wild

411
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,839
so um but yeah there was you know res

412
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,919
dog that's grown um i mentioned captain

413
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,920
[Â __Â ] there was there was quite a few

414
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,399
other people as well i mean even i mean

415
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,159
dna genetics all these guys that are big

416
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,000
now that are they were still big back

417
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,078
then so i mean we everyone wanted those

418
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,519
seeds we were all you know writing down

419
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,319
lists of everything we want and all that

420
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,078
stuff it was it was crazy times so

421
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,278
i mean it really wasn't long ago that i

422
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,120
was uh

423
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,519
you know spending all my money on seeds

424
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
not not really making them so now it's

425
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,320
it's a little bit different but i still

426
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,719
spend all my money on seeds i don't know

427
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,040
what's wrong with me

428
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
you got the uh the disease we all got

429
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,519
seaported

430
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,759
yeah

431
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,560
cetitis

432
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,639
so

433
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,799
um just for the kind of the next part of

434
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,440
the whole keeping linearity within the

435
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,240
storyline how did you then transition to

436
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,240
working with ken

437
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,360
so

438
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,399
i was a

439
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,399
i was hired on i did a huge review on

440
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,720
craigslist of all the washington state

441
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,799
dispensaries i had visited

442
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,560
i had got my medical card

443
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,399
i want to say in like

444
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,479
2008 or something like that here in

445
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,839
washington state i started going around

446
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,199
to every shop i could find and just

447
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,120
basically checking out their jars seeing

448
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,078
what they had and what i found was more

449
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,759
than

450
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,599
i mean i don't want to exaggerate but i

451
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,958
want to say more than

452
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
50

453
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,759
more than 50

454
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,959
but i'll just i'll just leave it there

455
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,720
to to be fair to the state but um the

456
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,198
half the shops you go into had

457
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,879
mislabeled jars absolute fake you know

458
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,719
just garbage there was nothing that was

459
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,958
super heady nothing that was like oh my

460
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
god look at this i mean few and far

461
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,958
between you'd find some some real stuff

462
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,278
but it was it was kind of a sad scene up

463
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,278
here so basically

464
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,799
i started reviewing stuff on on

465
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,639
craigslist and ended up having someone

466
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,240
hit me up and says hey well we've we are

467
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,600

um

473
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,399
i ended up

474
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,758
getting in touch with a guy who walks in

475
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,839
and says hey man you seem to know your

476
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,919
stuff you know i see you're into seeds

477
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,720
and you're you know you're strains you

478
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,838
should meet my friend ken and ken turned

479
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,440
out to be ken estes and at the time

480
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
there was a pretty big following for

481
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
granddaddy perp there was still a huge

482
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
you know he had a really good reputation

483
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,279
and then going back to the forum days

484
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
there used to be a um

485
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,799
there used to be a clone list like a top

486
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,359
ten or a top you know genetics to get

487
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,039
and ken's gdp was always on there that's

488
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,199
what everybody wanted

489
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,039

491
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,159
pure it was ken's gdp was the name so

492
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,919
that name stuck with me since i was

493
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,000
younger and so when i hear about this oh

494

497
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,959
next few days or whatever i ended up

498
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,519
meeting ken um and then we sort of hit

499
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,278
it off just based on again the knowledge

500
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
uh i was dropping and some other stuff

501
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,639
he just was impressed with what i knew

502
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,078
and so he said you should come on board

503
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,759
with me we're trying to sell seeds up

504
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,240
here and we need someone who can you

505
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,400
know go around and rep the company so

506
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
that's what started me off with ken

507
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
i was a seed rep i went around all over

508
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
the state all over the country with him

509
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,119
doing the different shows

510
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,199
and we'd uh we you know i was a

511
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,678
salesman pretty much you know so that's

512
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,759
what started it and then from there it

513
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,759
uh kind of blossomed into other things i

514
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,038
was involved with you know everything

515
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,359
that they were doing with the company

516
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,119
but then there was a huge

517
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,199
kind of a falling out

518
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,399
of him and his employees and that's

519
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,240
that's what ended up giving me the

520
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,720
position to turn breeder for him and so

521
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,599
i took on that and

522
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,600
here we are today

523
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,839
so

524
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,000
basically

525
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,599
i think a lot of people would be aware

526
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,279
that you know ken has some physical

527
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,678
disabilities but maybe they weren't

528
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,079
fully aware that if they had bought some

529
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,240
seeds from ken during that time period

530
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,759
the reality was you made those seeds

531
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,359
correct

532
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,879
absolutely so that's that and you're

533
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,558
right that is something that come up in

534
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,200
the past you know many people said hey

535
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,720
you you did this you did that as far as

536
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
you know uh

537
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
um

538
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,559
stealing or ripping something off but

539
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,240
it's it's it's not the case when when i

540
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,558
was the one who was the breeder behind

541
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,319
the stuff and everything that was

542
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,079
like i said after they had their split

543
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,678
and i was given the position

544
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,159
there are certain

545
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,840
certain things i'm supposed to be doing

546
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,558
for the company and one was breeding and

547
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,639
so i'm making my seeds for them

548
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,720
i'm doing everything under the sun as

549
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,400
far as repping the company making the

550
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,558
sales happen talking to people online

551
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,559
doing all that pain to go to these shows

552
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,960
and selling them packaging everything

553
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,240
that was all me so yeah there's there is

554
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
a little bit of confusion that lies

555
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,640
within there and that was also the

556
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,038
hugest part about um

557
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,120
um after even leaving the company

558
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,879
was was having the issues with everyone

559
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,879
trying to say well did you make those or

560
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,520
was that kin stuff and you know and it

561
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,720
was very very confusing so

562
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,558
um

563
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
not not necessarily the best thing but

564
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,480
yeah anybody that bought during the time

565
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,000
that um

566
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,400
it was

567
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,720
there was i think 11 strains made during

568
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,400
that period around around

569
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,319
2011 or 2012

570
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
to 2014

571
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,319
somewhere in there

572
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,558
so with that thought in mind when you

573
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,159
decided to start dungeon vaults and kind

574
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,079
of do your own thing did you

575
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,640
intentionally think to yourself i'm

576
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,199
gonna use a new male kind of fresh start

577
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,640
thing or did it just work out that way

578
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,279
that's exactly what i was thinking it

579
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
was it was i still had and

580
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,119
this goes back to your previous question

581
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,360
as well i still had stock left over from

582
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,599
the granddaddy days and so kind of to

583
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,879
get my jump start and kind of get just

584
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,558
to get my brand out there because i

585
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
didn't have my other mail selected yet

586
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,678
it wasn't or

587
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,759
maybe i did at the time but it wasn't

588
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,640
ready one way or another i wasn't ready

589
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,240
to release seeds um a new line yet under

590
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,080
dungeons of all but i did still have

591
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,079
some of my originals from granddaddy so

592
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,000
i still had the funk i had the grand og

593
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,199
purple champagne

594
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
and uh

595
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
there was i think another one the candy

596
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,919
land

597
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
but

598
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
some of these strains they were they

599
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
were getting close to selling out so at

600
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,798
that point i i knew that i it was time

601
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,360
to uh you know get a fresh start and all

602
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,119
that so i had already been talking to i

603
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,119
had told ken my idea the whole time you

604
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,918
know i said hey i've got this idea for

605
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,000
grandpa's breath you know everything was

606
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
you know related to gdp or grandpa or

607
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
anything like that all kind of fit in

608
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
with the company so i had already

609
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
thought of grandpa's breath and kind of

610
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,639
stuck so that's where

611
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
that's where this whole new line came

612
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
from and it's unfortunate we aren't

613
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,240
working together because had we been

614
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,080
this could have been taken to who knows

615
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,759
what kind of levels what the with the

616
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,480
you know warehouses and the capabilities

617
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,480
we had down at california so but yeah

618
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,120
grandpa's breath was created in

619
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,120
washington state i i was behind that i

620
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,439
did it all so it was kind of cool to be

621
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,719
able to say that once i broke away and

622
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,400
was able to

623
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
start over that i had

624
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,559
um

625
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,839
as much success with with uh what i did

626
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,519
even though it did take a little while

627
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,959
for people to pick up on me and really

628
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,720
give me the shot a lot of people were

629
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
still a little bit salty toward the

630
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,319
situation didn't really know where to or

631
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,840
what to think about everything so it's a

632
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,678
little bit hard to

633
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,199
you know get my start but once people

634
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,880
started growing everything and they saw

635
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,120
what i had to offer i think people were

636
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
a little bit more accepting

637
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,798
yeah and it's certainly good to see that

638
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,559
people have you know given you that

639
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,079
chance and the proof's in the pudding to

640
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,440
say the least

641
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,000
something i did want to mention because

642
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,919
i i think you fall into a small category

643
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,919
of breeders who whether it was

644
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,080
intentional or not i'm not sure i don't

645
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,440
think you're a fortune teller per se but

646
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,798
i think you

647
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,798
gauge

648
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,000
and uh archive you know you probably

649
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,599
know where this question is going you

650
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
all fell into that boat where you kind

651
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,079
of managed to incorporate the og kbb

652
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,960
into your work right as it was taking

653
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,639
off

654
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,159
was this something you were aware of or

655
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,080
did it just work out that way and you're

656
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,720
like man i'm happy to ride that wave or

657
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:02,079
like how do you feel about it all

658
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,079
that it's funny there was um i like i

659
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,399
said i've always been a connoisseur i've

660
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,158
been very well um

661
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,640
you know in tune with all the strains

662
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,640
going around when i first got into the

663
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
cookie scene and i and i first got my

664
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
clone the first cut of cookies i got was

665
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
fake as [Â __Â ] like i knew right away i

666
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,759
was like this is not the same thing that

667
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,519
i'm smoking or or that all the people

668
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,759
are talking about so

669
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,038
i got the one grew it wasn't it i knew

670
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,960
right away

671
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,240
then this whole

672
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,840
you know

673
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,440
there was like a release all of a sudden

674
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,879
like somebody got it and then they were

675
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,038
they were angry at the fact that they

676
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,559
had to pay so much or the fact that that

677
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:37,759
so many people were hoarding the cut and

678
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,918
it all of a sudden started to spread

679
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,879
like wildfire i was one of the first

680
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,720
people

681
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
i mean honestly i i hadn't seen cookies

682
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,440
anywhere no one had even heard of it and

683
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
i brought i finally got it and brought

684
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,759
it up to uh to washington and start

685
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,519
showing people and that's when this this

686
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,519
whole thing just blew up like every it

687
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,079
was already huge in california and then

688
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,679
i'm up here with it and i knew that

689
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,399
you know just having any cookies was

690
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,240
good but there was the one the ogkb cut

691
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,200
that was the one that was kind of you

692
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,038
know so really held back it wasn't being

693
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,798
passed around very much

694
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,079
if you knew the right people you got it

695
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,879
if not good luck and i guess i just i

696
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,558
mean

697
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,320
it's a blessing that's all i can say is

698
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,839
the people the guy that gave it to me he

699
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,519
knows who he is i'm not going to mention

700
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,839
names but he knows

701
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,679
what he did for me and i owe him a lot

702
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,519
for it you know eventually i think we

703
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,120
will square up at something but it was

704
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,720
never a hey you owe me this you owe me

705
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,359
that or i want this much he gave it to

706
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,200
me on just good principle he knew me

707
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,959
well enough he trusted me he liked me i

708
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,960
guess and he wanted to see me shine and

709
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
that's exactly what happened so i think

710
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,519
at the time

711
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,640
i yeah like you said gage green archive

712
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,639
me

713
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,640
very few people had it and i was right

714
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,080
there in line with them and did we did

715
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
our releases pretty much one after

716
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,759
another

717
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,639
and i think from there on out it kind of

718
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,960
got

719
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,080
even more spread out but you know man i

720
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,480
i still see so many people growing ogkb

721
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,480
that's not ogkb it's it's they they got

722
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,360
soul to cut

723
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,679
if anything has even remotely

724
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,240
um puffy leaves or kind of that that

725
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,038
little mutant look someone will refer to

726
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,038
it

727
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,759
as an ogkb

728
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,200
or an ogkbeno when in all reality that's

729
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,759
not what it is really i mean it's just

730
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,278
that's there's been so many you know

731
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,720
cuts that that come out like that

732
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,558
anything with cookie lineage has a

733
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,480
chance of having that mutated you know

734
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,798
kind of a funky look and they're really

735
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,278
not i mean that's not necessarily sought

736
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,679
after but ogkb just happened to be the

737
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,119
one that that one when you get it dialed

738
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,960
in and you can grow it correctly it

739
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,038
yields good it tastes better than

740
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,960
anything and it literally has the

741
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,480
craziest smell of all the cookies it's

742
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,120
just it's just one of the better ones in

743
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,798
my opinion but like i said real i was

744
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,719
lucky that's that's all it is i was

745
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,679
really lucky and i feel like me having

746
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
that early start really kind of helped

747
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,278
but many people thought that grandpa's

748
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,519
breath had mendo breath they thought i

749
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,759
took gage green's mendo breath or one of

750
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,240
their things and crossed into it when

751
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:06,079
all reality is no i had the original cut

752
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,519
crossed it to the tahoe gdp mail and bam

753
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,839
so

754
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,918
yeah so i mean first thing i want to say

755
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,519
is what the hell's up with like the

756
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,840
seeds you know there's like a curse on

757
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,519
them like no one can really get them to

758
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,319
germinate easy do you think it just

759
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,720
makes

760
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,079
the mum kind of unviable as like a

761
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,079
commercial release plant

762
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,240
this the seeds of og kb yeah

763
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,640
i think that they're that's why i didn't

764
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
release the the f1s of grandpa's breath

765
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,320
it was it was so tough to crack those

766
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
suckers it was like there's i'm not

767
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,200
gonna

768
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,360
i'll never hear the end of it

769
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,960
if i was releasing you know if you get

770
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,639
if you get such poor germination that

771
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,319
you replace in every pack you've sold

772
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,480
you just screwed yourself so i knew

773
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,439
right away hey let's not do that so the

774
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,200
f2s i released i i seem to have pretty

775
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
good luck with popping seeds i think a

776
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,080
lot of people

777
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
really make it harder on themselves and

778
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,319
they need to and it's still a question i

779
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,240
get asked every day how do you pop your

780
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,278
seeds how do you do this how do you do

781
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,558
that and now you got a guy that's i wish

782
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,640
i knew his name so i could shout him out

783
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,319
but he's made this little seed cracker

784
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,919
tool and i'm sure that's been around

785
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,000
before but

786
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,600
this little seed cracker seems like it

787
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,960
could help a lot of people out you know

788
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,519
you get through that tough shell gives

789
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,120
it the spot or gives it the chance to

790
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,480
pop its little tail out

791
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,479
and

792
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,400
you know maybe help someone who's who is

793
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,798
having some uh germination issues with

794
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,440
some older seed stock but

795
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,839
uh i'd say yeah man there's definitely

796
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,600
something to that with the ogkb i don't

797
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,519
know what it is but maybe maybe it maybe

798
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,719
it provides an extra thick shell or

799
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,759
something that just makes a little bit

800
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
harder but

801
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,359
i i don't know what everyone else's

802
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,440
experience is with all the uh with all

803
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,918
the other companies that are um selling

804
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,840
these crosses but i know i know with

805
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,679
mine there's there's been some issues

806
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,278
here and there but you mean i've gotten

807
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,278
so much good feedback that the little

808
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,679
bit of hey i had issues here and there

809
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,599
it's kind of outweighed by the good so i

810
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,278
always try and make everyone happy

811
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,480
and take care of whoever i can but for

812
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,880
the most part um it's kind of a

813
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,079
mute point with me almost

814
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,480
yeah no definitely i i believe that um

815
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,678
the f1s of the other companies similarly

816
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,120
had some issues with germination

817
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,720
kind of just to also touch on that point

818
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,639
you you hammered that point home so

819
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,679
perfectly in regards to people mistaking

820
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,480
that cookie look for ogkb in general

821
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,720
because i find any cookie cross can

822
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,319
potentially yield that result and um our

823
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,839
buddy csi humboldt he even made the

824
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,960
reference that just from urkel s ones

825
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:43,199
you can get that exact phenotype so

826
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,640
you know interesting note to take but

827
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,319
also you know hints something maybe

828
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,559
deeper about the connection between

829
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,839
urkel and cookies

830
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,158
yeah

831
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,720
there could be i mean it's it's they the

832
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,240
whole claim is this this uh

833
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,319
cookies came from an f1 durbin and i

834
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,880
don't mean f1 like f1 generation it's

835
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,439
supposedly f1 is a strain altogether

836
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,120
across the durbin hit with

837
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,440
uh

838
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,879
with uh whatever else and you get and

839
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
you get the cookies or whatever and it's

840
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,880
like i don't see how there's any durbin

841
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,839
in there whatsoever maybe i'm wrong but

842
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,679
i think i think there's a lot more to it

843
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,319
with maybe just a solid purple getting

844
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,880
crossed with something else but

845
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,278
i i would i would almost want to

846
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,679
know if there's if if possibly what

847
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,839
happened was that cherry pie that got

848
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,519
big before cookies which we all know

849
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,959
herms out maybe touched the og which

850
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,679
everyone in california was already

851
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,038
growing rooms of and then that would

852
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,559
kind of make sense why you get that

853
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,158
really tight

854
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,599
cookie structure that's like an og

855
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,039
almost

856
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,480
and then it's kind of smaller buds and

857
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,359
you get a little bit of the perp it

858
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,599
could have easily been a a uh

859
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,439
cherry pie times no g but i have no idea

860
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,398
man i i really don't i think there's

861
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,720
there's so many different um

862
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,639
you know possibilities and and those

863
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,759
that that were there when it happened

864
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
would be the only ones that know they'll

865
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,319
take that to their grave because i've

866
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,319
heard way too many stories and i don't

867
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,599
really know which one i believe but i

868
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,879
think when it all comes down to it's

869
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:15,119
some good pot and if if fables are going

870
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,640
to go along with cannabis then that's

871
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,278
fine it just creates more of something

872
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,440
to talk about when we're all high right

873
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,480
yeah definitely

874
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,240
so

875
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,720
what traits do you like to look for when

876
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,200
selecting a male and if we kind of give

877
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,839
it a kind of some more detail to the

878
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,159
question i guess when you were selecting

879
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,079
you know your grandpa's breath mail were

880
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,000
you looking for a balance of things or

881
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,119
were you just looking for all one side

882
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,398
how did you go about that process

883
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,479
when i popped um when i popped all those

884
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,918
those grandpa's breath seeds

885
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
um

886
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,919
so i could actually no it's a step back

887
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,558
because i was looking for the the tahoe

888
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,600
gdp male to make the grandpa's breath so

889
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,519
that

890
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,199
man you know and that's a long time ago

891
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,440
but i believe

892
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,720
if i can remember that mail correctly it

893
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,519
was it was kind of a short and stacked

894
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,200
um mail i nowadays i do things a little

895
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,359
bit differently but that was when i was

896
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,319
back back then that was uh

897
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,678
that was

898
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,079
it was kind of like a trial and error

899
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,320
what happened was i found

900
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,839
a set of males and i knew which ones i

901
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,359
wanted to breed with so i set those ones

902
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,678
to the side and then out of a certain

903
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,719
amount i picked the best looking one

904
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,120
because that's what was available to me

905
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,399
at the time so that was a little bit you

906
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,239
know that's not how i would do it

907
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,079
nowadays but back then i just picked the

908
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,759
best looking one of the set

909
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,000
of you say there was like i think about

910
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,919
five or six of the the tahoe gdp males

911
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
and i picked the best looking guy and he

912
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,840
turned out to be pretty damn good

913
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,038
obviously but overall

914
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,678
uh

915
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,919
the the way i'm doing it now and what i

916
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,480
would what i would say the best way to

917
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,038
would be you're looking at

918
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,798
obviously structure and then if you can

919
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,640
get a good smell off of it that's

920
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,079
obviously you know same thing as picking

921
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,919
a female you know if you can get a good

922
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,599
stem rub and you gotta you you have just

923
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,200
a nice kind of a

924
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,398
a plant that kind of permeates a good

925
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,038
smell in the air you know you got

926
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,639
something to look forward to and then

927
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,319
you know then when you you got to flower

928
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,840
that you got to flower it out you know

929
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,639
and really see how it how it looks when

930
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,000
it's you know fills out all of its uh

931
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,519
um

932
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
you know stems everything how it looks

933
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,558
you know you're going to really want to

934
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,599
pay attention to that so

935
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,440
i i found that with with once i found

936
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,398
the grandpa's breath mail

937
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,038
i found the one that was uh it was tall

938
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,959
it had some some internal spacing going

939
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,960
on so it wasn't as tight as my first

940
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
selection that made the grandpa's breath

941
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,240
and then um

942
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,919
the

943
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,038
the thing once i put in the flower this

944
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,200
guy had

945
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,558
he just had stacks of flower clusters

946
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,159
that it literally looked like corn on

947
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,678
the cob i know i've mentioned that

948
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,200
online before i've told people but that

949
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,360
that's like the closest reference i

950
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,159
could find like it literally looked like

951
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,319
little husks of corn just solid yellow

952
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,360
that were just these big you know foot

953
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,158
long

954
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,479
you know thick colas of flowers it was

955
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,799
pretty cool

956
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,519
that and the fact that i saw some resin

957
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,359
glands on the leaves um i know some

958
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,880
people can say that too much resin or if

959
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,959
you see plants that have a lot of resin

960
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,679
on it it could potentially be a male

961
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,278
hermaphrodite um or show intersex traits

962
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,038
if it if flowered and you actually look

963
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,480
up close you might end up seeing some

964
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,679
white hairs coming out of it and at that

965
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,079
point that's the same as finer

966
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,240
hermaphrodite in your in your other in

967
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,398
your female garden you don't really want

968
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,798
it so um

969
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,879
but this this guy in particular i saw i

970
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,960
saw frost on it and it never showed any

971
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
any intersex traits and it was all good

972
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
all the way to the end i thought it was

973
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,000
just going to be an absolute stud and i

974
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,759
was right so everything that that

975
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,798
grandpa's breath mail touched has turned

976
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,839
out you know nothing short of amazing so

977
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,158
i've been pretty stoked on everything

978
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,079
killer so moving forward do you kind of

979
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,440
like the idea of using resonance mouse

980
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,480
or do you think just maybe in that one

981
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,519
situation it worked out pretty well i

982
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,839
think

983
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,000
i think that would be a trait i'd like

984
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,798
to see on them just so i know well you

985
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,558
know i mean

986
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,480
i'll be honest with you i don't know

987
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,519
i would say if i'm gonna call myself a

988
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,798
breeder i'll i'll say i'm i'm beginner

989
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,000
you know i'm not going to sit there and

990
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,558
claim to know everything i didn't go to

991
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,240
school for this i'm uh i'm going off

992
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,918
what i feel has worked for me in the

993
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,880
past i'm going off of what i what i

994
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,360
think will do great i've been right so

995
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
far so i'm not a know-it-all by any

996
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,319
means but

997
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,759
the stuff that i did

998
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,158
learn along the way and what i've picked

999
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,359
up on has seemed to work out quite well

1000
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,919
so i'm just going to keep going in that

1001
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,240
direction i wish i had more scientific

1002
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
terms so i could use and uh you know a

1003
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,000
little bit more knowledge on on the

1004
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,839
plant itself and how life works in

1005
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,359
between but overall i think

1006
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,278
when you're growing these guys out you

1007
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,519
just you get so used to seeing different

1008
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,440
plants and how everything looks that you

1009
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,640
just you just have a feeling and you

1010
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,480
just know when you're going in the right

1011
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,038
direction some things can end up being a

1012
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,839
complete flop but um

1013
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,278
so far i haven't really ran into that

1014
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,798
issue i mean some people might not be

1015
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,000
too happy with my gear or like it and

1016
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,639
that's fine everyone's entitled their

1017
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,719
opinion but everything i've done so far

1018
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,159
i i feel like i can stand behind and say

1019
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,239
hey that's a that's a decent strain you

1020
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,000
may not find the plant you're looking

1021
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,358
for but there's definitely one out of

1022
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,719
every line i've released that someone

1023
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,000
could say that's one of their favorites

1024
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,000
so that's one of the ones they would run

1025
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,119
again so that's good enough numbers for

1026
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,079
me but i i would think that

1027
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,838
um

1028
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,839
from here on out i'm i'm definitely

1029
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,440
gonna you know you just you just got to

1030
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,279
flower out the mail that you want to use

1031
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,039
and if if it's gonna if it shows you

1032
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,159
what you're looking for then great and

1033
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,119
if not then start over

1034
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,358
solid answer it raises the idea that i

1035
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,000
constantly think of myself as is

1036
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,838
breeding an art or a science and i think

1037
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,838
the way to summarize this question is to

1038
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,799
put it in this kind of abstract question

1039
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,599
where it's

1040
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,599
if we got all the things that you or

1041
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,838
maybe generally speaking people consider

1042
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
to be advantageous about a male

1043
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,599
programmed into a computer and then got

1044
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,280
it to select one do you think it would

1045
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,039
do a good job or do you think as you

1046
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,880
said there's like this certain feel to

1047
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,199
it which would inevitably maybe make the

1048
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,079
robot in this example not really do as

1049
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,759
good of a job as say a human

1050
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,400
man i don't know it's tough because with

1051
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
all the scientific uh

1052
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,880
input and when someone has a computer

1053
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,559
program that can literally take not just

1054
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
me but like so many other people that

1055
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,159
have a lot more expanded knowledge than

1056
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,118
i do

1057
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,399
you could potentially have such a crazy

1058
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
stack of information

1059
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,639
and all the i mean the program could run

1060
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,559
could run in a way that you they knew

1061
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,480
exactly what they're doing but

1062
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,239
again we could all set everything to

1063
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,000
auto tune on all of our gardens on

1064
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,838
everything but i think when it all comes

1065
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,599
down to it we all like to be there

1066
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,159
physically we want to be involved with

1067
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,079
it and i'd much rather say that hey i

1068
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,000
created this or i did that by my own

1069
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,599
hands by my selection by me going and

1070
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
picking it smelling it knowing

1071
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,119
everything

1072
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,039
that sounds better to me than a robot

1073
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,640
did or it was picked by some

1074
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,320
auto-generated number and then we just

1075
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,239
went and selected out of the warehouse

1076
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,160
but you might be onto something there i

1077
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,598
mean i think there could be some sort of

1078
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,358
you know like a challenge where someone

1079
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,599
could say well hey we found just as good

1080
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,519
of a male by this and just by having the

1081
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,200
general knowledge in the situation and

1082
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,800
knowing what we were looking for and

1083
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,799
clicked a number on a computer and bam

1084
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,359
here this is what popped out but like i

1085
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,480
said hands-on that's that's number one

1086
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,400
for me

1087
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,079
yeah for sure a bit of a crazy

1088
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,320
theoretical you just made me think about

1089
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,000
the idea of like a new breeder emerges

1090
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,838
and their whole advertising campaign is

1091
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,079
like yeah we use this machine to pick

1092
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,279
our mail

1093
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
hey yeah

1094
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,480
at this day and age i don't i i wouldn't

1095
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,480
put it past anybody you mean yeah there

1096
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,559
you go so a question i love to ask

1097
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,920
breeders when you're kind of you've

1098
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,920
created a new strain and you're going to

1099
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,519
maybe do some testing yourself how many

1100
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,720
seeds do you like to pop to get a feel

1101
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,719
of what's inside of it

1102
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:59,039
usually i i mean if it were up to me as

1103
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,039
many as you freaking can but i mean

1104
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,719
let's be real here there's there's

1105
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,800
certain things that can restrict a

1106
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,159
grower whether it is

1107
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,280
legality

1108
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,118
or

1109
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,800
room or

1110
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,640
you know there's a lot that goes into

1111
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,480
play i mean trust issues you start

1112
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,838
getting into a huge thing you have way

1113
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,519
too much to take care of you have to

1114
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,719
bring in people and as soon as you bring

1115
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,960
in those people you better make sure

1116
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,159
those people are like family and oh wait

1117
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,000
family isn't necessarily always

1118
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,000
trustworthy either so you just pretty

1119
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,639
much open yourself up to

1120
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,239
getting genetics stolen

1121
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,159
having people snitch on you having

1122
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,598
people get greedy having the cops come

1123
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,639
bust you there's a lot that goes into

1124
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,160
the whole having too many plants to me

1125
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,639
i want to stay in a position where i

1126
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,799
feel like you mean i'm i'm giving the

1127
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,960
customers what they need i'm testing the

1128
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,640
plants or having them tested by friends

1129
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,119
so one way or another anything that

1130
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,679
comes out of my camp is being grown out

1131
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,119
completely from start to finish and and

1132
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,960
if there's any issues at all we're

1133
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,119
addressing them if there's too many

1134
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,400
issues we're not releasing it

1135
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,800
if there's

1136
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
any doubt in my mind it the the i'd

1137
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,640
rather not release the planks like i

1138
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,160
said if i if it's not

1139
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,679
it's not good for him it's not a good

1140
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,759
look for me if i put something out that

1141
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,039
i that i have to get a bunch of returns

1142
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,800
on so

1143
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,358
for me i'm trying to

1144
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,480
um i personally

1145
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,000
will pop at least a few packs uh

1146
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,559
of each one

1147
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,079
um that hasn't always happened but now

1148
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,679
from here on out i think that's kind of

1149
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,359
where i need to be we need to pop at

1150
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,639
least you know two three packs of every

1151
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,239
single strain that's you know

1152
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,598
essentially just like anyone else if you

1153
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,118
go out and buy a pack of seeds most

1154
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,960
people are only buying you know one

1155
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,119
maybe two and they do their little feno

1156
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,880
hunt if i do the same thing pop it and i

1157
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,079
don't find any issues then that's i mean

1158
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,800
that's uh

1159
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,400
between me and say a few three four five

1160
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,560
other guys are doing the same thing

1161
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,079
we've just ran you know a decent amount

1162
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,400
of the packs we all have an idea of what

1163
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,320
we can look for um

1164
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,320
i used to when things are a little bit

1165
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,039
different up here in washington i had

1166
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,760
i'd have you know 100 100 seeds of one

1167
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,199
strain going just to find the the mail

1168
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,760
and pick out my winners that's what

1169
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,439
happened with the grandpa's breath

1170
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,640
that's not the case anymore i wish it

1171
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,000
was but

1172
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,920
i just can't um i can't do it i'd be in

1173
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,400
trouble if i did

1174
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,838
yeah it's surprising i think uh you may

1175
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,039
be aware but

1176
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,279
a lot of breeders out there

1177
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,358
unfortunately are forced to you know

1178
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,599
bend or break the rules in order to you

1179
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,279
know kind of do what they feel is

1180
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,320
you know like kind of the right number i

1181
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,160
guess

1182
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,160
yeah and and again i mean i don't know

1183
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,039
what the right number is i think if i

1184
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,358
had

1185
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,599
if i had a nice big warehouse i'd say at

1186
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,199
least at least 100 to 200 of every

1187
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,880
single one but

1188
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,199
if you're doing things

1189
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,400
the right way and you don't have a crazy

1190
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:47,759
um you know a crazy amount of phenos

1191
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,680
going on then i mean you sh with an f1

1192
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,359
cross or even others there shouldn't be

1193
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,118
that many that you need to select from

1194
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,239
hundreds of plants but i mean i guess it

1195
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,440
gives you the upper hand when you have

1196
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,199
that many one could be growing a little

1197
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,960
bit better and give you an idea but to

1198
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,159
me i thought you're gonna see what you

1199
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,559
need to see in in 30 40 plants you know

1200
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,759
but the more the merrier obviously but

1201
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,759
it's just

1202
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,119
i know that at this at this point i've

1203
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,200
seen what i need to see and i know what

1204
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,519
i'm putting out is is going to be good

1205
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,199
and if not then i'll hear about it from

1206
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,039
all my testers and all the guys before

1207
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,879
it even gets released so

1208
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,039
it's not an issue

1209
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
yeah i totally agree i think 40 is that

1210
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,239
magic number as well and just a quick

1211
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,440
little reason behind that because some

1212
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,439
people are going to wonder why i say

1213
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
that i think far and a lot of people

1214
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,280
back this idea up because five percent

1215
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,119
is about the lowest common percentage

1216
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,720
you'll get for a phenotype to appear

1217
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,640
obviously you can get crazy lower

1218
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,239
outliers but generally you're not going

1219
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,239
to find something that occurs less than

1220
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,838
five percent so if you run 40 seeds

1221
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,279
you're guaranteed to find at least one

1222
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,279
thing of that five percent and if you

1223
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,040
don't find it well then you know that

1224
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,800
that phenotype doesn't exist at that low

1225
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,159
percentage anyway

1226
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,640
talking about the phenotypes and the

1227
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,239
percentages candyland and false teeth

1228
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,358
are two-year strains that i'm really

1229
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,199
interested in because they've got like

1230
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,358
the different versions associated with

1231
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,679
it and i guess the the kind of the

1232
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,559
deeper idea i'm interested in is this

1233
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,480
idea of using multiple females and

1234
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,480
offering the different versions

1235
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,318
hasn't really been adopted too much but

1236
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,920
i have a feeling it might be on the rise

1237
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,920
do you think that's the case and why do

1238
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,960
you choose to do it

1239
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,760
i i yes i think it is on the rise i

1240
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,639
think

1241
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,240
i i for sure did not start this this

1242
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,799
whole let's do a bunch of different

1243
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,039
versions one two three four whatever

1244
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,359
i've seen it before even going back to

1245
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,119
res he had different versions of v2 or

1246
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,880
whatever it was and that's and and other

1247
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,119
breeders did as well and i don't

1248
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,680
remember if it was because he remade the

1249
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,240
strain and so it was aversion to

1250
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,078
or if he put out two separate phenotypes

1251
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,479
of the same cross

1252
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,760
but in my situation that's exactly what

1253
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,358
happened

1254
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,680
and it's kind of a

1255
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,078
two reasons for that one being

1256
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,318
when i did the original um

1257
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,318
false teeth what i had done was i had

1258
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,559
crossed you know i had popped all the

1259
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:59,838
different candy lands that i had you

1260
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,000
know from seed from when i worked with

1261
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,239
ken so i popped a bunch of candy lands

1262
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,760
and as i did i started seeing some that

1263
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,039
were you know there were some that were

1264
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,720
just [Â __Â ] they really just didn't come

1265
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,159
out that great there was some mutation

1266
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,159
stuff going on that just didn't yield

1267
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,399
didn't it wasn't anything too fancy

1268
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,960
those that did come out you know and

1269
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,960
looked really good i i was it was so

1270
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,880
hard and it could be the hoarder in me i

1271
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,039
don't know but i i looked at these

1272
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,720
plants like i can't get rid of this one

1273
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,400
and i don't know

1274
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,559
why i don't know what i'm gonna do as

1275
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,160
far as having you know four different

1276
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,679
ones that are all full of seeds so what

1277
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,679
i decided was

1278
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,598
let's say

1279
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,358
if i release the one people are gonna

1280
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,119
find something good but let's just say

1281
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,960
that they they're like yeah it's okay

1282
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,720
you know but i wish i had something else

1283
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,480
to choose from or you know a different

1284
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,318
selection so i thought if i released all

1285
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,480
three four versions i guess the fourth

1286
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,239
one just was released but originally

1287
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,358
three different versions of

1288
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,679
v1 v2 v3 and it was all

1289
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,440
that it was all done same time same

1290
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,519
breed it was just a different plant

1291
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,599
number in the same exact room got hit

1292
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,519
with the same pollen and what happened

1293
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,599
was i just decided to release them all

1294
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,440
that way you could have a little bit

1295
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,280
something different than the next guy a

1296
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,519
problem i found going back to the old

1297
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,200
dispensary days was you'd walk into a

1298
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,280
shop and say hey i've got cookies they'd

1299
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,598
say cool we have cookies and they could

1300
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,119
be a totally different look than yours

1301
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,039
and and they weren't budging they don't

1302
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,559
want it because it's the same thing well

1303
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,400
i figure if you walk in said well i've

1304
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,000
got something that

1305
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,358
you know i've got i've got some false

1306
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,880
teeth or i've got some candyland that

1307
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,400
looks a little bit different it's the v3

1308
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,480
or v4 whatever you know it's a different

1309
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,838
version and it was something

1310
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,679
you know completely different than the

1311
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,519
next guy maybe they would put it on the

1312
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,199
shelf because it was so much different

1313
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,800
even though it had you know but same

1314
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,078
kind of quality pot you know so that's

1315
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,400
what i was originally thinking would be

1316
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,800
nice but uh it did create a lot of

1317
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,160
confusion but i mean everyone ate them

1318
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,480
up people bought every single one of

1319
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,639
those things so they they

1320
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,559
i think having having something that'll

1321
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,239
make you different to the next guy is is

1322
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,799
what's what people are into and they

1323
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:00,719
want to see that so it's um

1324
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,760
it's kind of a benefit i feel like

1325
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,559
giving people more options is never bad

1326
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,319
yeah i wholeheartedly agree with that so

1327
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,000
a little interesting theoretical

1328
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,079
question for you if you were going to go

1329
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,519
back and remake a strain you'd made

1330
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,119
before but let's just say you didn't

1331
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,960
have the mail you initially used so

1332
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,800
maybe you're going to remake the mail or

1333
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,240
reselect it from stock

1334
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,240
would you like that idea like do you

1335
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,679
like the idea of would you voluntarily

1336
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,799
do it i guess is what i'm asking or

1337
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,159
would you just opt to use the original

1338
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
well

1339
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:33,358
it would be cool to use the original but

1340
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,280
the original grandpa's breath mail is is

1341
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,838
is uh

1342
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,839
gone

1343
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,720
so yeah i i killed i killed that that

1344
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,880
guy off a while back he he's been done

1345
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,039
and i just i feel like after i had after

1346
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,240
i had released him enough stuff of it

1347
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,599
you know i just feel like you know it's

1348
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:50,399
time to move on even though i know it's

1349
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,760
probably

1350
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,838
probably one of the better males i

1351
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,520
figured i would find you know out of the

1352
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,440
progeny once i start cracking into the

1353
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,119
f2s the grandpa's breath and i get ready

1354
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,960
to make the f3s i'll have a new male

1355
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,640
that's selected in for its own reason so

1356
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,240
i figured you know he'll make a return

1357
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,358
at some point or it won't be him it'll

1358
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,279
be a different one like you just

1359
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,719
mentioned so

1360
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,319
i've got no problem with that i feel

1361
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,559
like there's there's so it's always nice

1362
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,559
to move on and start something new

1363
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,559
i also feel like having something

1364
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,719
having the same thing in every cross

1365
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,160
isn't always a good thing like i mean

1366
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,838
i've i've ran into that problem in the

1367
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,358
wreck scene up here in washington trying

1368
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:26,559
to sell seeds to someone saying okay

1369
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,159
well here's this and i go we've already

1370
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,519
got a grandpa's breath crossed like yeah

1371
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,039
but you don't have this one this one's

1372
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,559
different this one it grows completely

1373
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,039
different it looks and smells completely

1374
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,119
different um it's not the same thing you

1375
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,880
know so it's it's it's a sometimes it's

1376
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,079
a hard sell letting people know that

1377
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,838
even though it's got the same male

1378
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,200
you're going to get you get completely

1379
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,400
you're going to have different results

1380
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,799
you know it's not always going to be the

1381
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,039
same things

1382
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,039
yeah interesting tapping into a really

1383
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,279
interesting point about kind of

1384
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,440
lack of education within the

1385
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,640
consumer scene something which jumps to

1386
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,960
mind when you mention that is i was in

1387
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,639
colorado and i went to a dispensary and

1388
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,960
i was like show me the best weed you got

1389
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,799
guys and they pulled out some cookies

1390
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,280
and i was like oh cool what cut is it

1391
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,440
and they were like oh it's the uh durvan

1392
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,440
cross og cut

1393
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,280
and i was just yeah you know and i was

1394
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,519
just like really like you're meant to be

1395
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,560
the knowledgeable one here like

1396
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:23,039
yeah no it's not gonna work

1397
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,400
yeah okay so just to quickly rule out a

1398
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,838
little question i'd found i'm not even

1399
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,519
sure if it's true but i think i read on

1400
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:29,599
a forum somewhere that like at some

1401
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,800
point in the earlier days before you did

1402
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,480
the call you just mentioned of the

1403
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,640
grandpa's breath now you did a

1404
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,639
re-selection was that true or no

1405
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,720
yes actually so what okay so

1406
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,318
yeah i know you're right we did uh the

1407
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,879
original okay so

1408
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,239
uh my first male i selected of grandpa's

1409
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,960
breath that was

1410
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,919
the

1411
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,119
um

1412
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,240
humble pie

1413
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,318
grandpa's breath f2 foul mouth

1414
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,719
uh false teeth all those guys that was

1415
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,318
all done under that uh grandpa's breath

1416
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,399
mail then

1417
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,639
that one was gone and i had to select

1418
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,400
another one uh

1419
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,078
which was done

1420
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,639
um to make the

1421
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,960
sugar daddy italian ice

1422
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,480
pine and perp and that line the second

1423
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,880
grandpa's breath line was all done with

1424
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,880
the new male and i feel like all those

1425
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,760
ones have turned out just as good if not

1426
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,760
um better offspring so

1427
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,079
that's i totally space i'm glad you

1428
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,599
brought it up i uh sometimes i need to

1429
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,359
remind myself that i i did do that

1430
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,880
because i forget at times because it was

1431
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,880
the grandpa's breath but yeah it was a

1432
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,280
different male for that breed

1433
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,880
yeah no that's all good so if we kind of

1434
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,839
look at some of the ones you mentioned

1435
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,200
there none of them were the ones you

1436
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:42,880
chose for the new male i think you

1437
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,719
actually ended up choosing purple vapor

1438
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,559
was the first male what was it about the

1439
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,480
purple vapor which made you pick that

1440
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,599
one as your new male or at least of the

1441
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,480
initial selection going forward

1442
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,079
there was a there was a purple vapor and

1443
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,838
a brandywine that were selected at the

1444
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,640
same time uh

1445
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:03,920
with help from a friend i was able to i

1446
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:06,639
gave him uh the last of my purple vapor

1447
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,400
and i gave him a bunch of the brandywine

1448
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,639
and in return i said i'd like you to

1449
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,720
bring me back all the mails so he when

1450
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,118
he did that he brought a truck full i

1451
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,358
mean i had so many selections i was like

1452
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,440
oh my god so i had

1453
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,960
i sat there in my yard one summer and i

1454
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,440
was like i've got literally

1455
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,440
i think i had 20

1456
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,639
20 or 25 of each

1457
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,200
so

1458
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,358
looking out all those and then flowering

1459
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,799
them all out i allowed them all to just

1460
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,400
get big and i actually collected the

1461
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,599
pawn this time i didn't even take cuts

1462
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,920
of them i was like this is gonna be a

1463
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,519
once and done type of thing so i got all

1464
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,280
the pollen that i wanted off the ones i

1465
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,519
was gonna keep or that i knew i wanted

1466
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,240
to breed with um to arrest them were

1467
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,880
discarded um and then so in particular

1468
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,799
the purple vapor that guy

1469
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,559
it was just a badass male like that one

1470
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,440
and the brandywine both just showed

1471
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,599
extreme close uh close nodal space and

1472
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,159
there was like a nice they had i didn't

1473
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,640
have as much of a uh what i i don't want

1474
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,639
to call it a cola but essentially a male

1475
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,039
flower cluster cola whatever you know

1476
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,480
there's probably a more of a scientific

1477
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,000
term for that but i don't know it off

1478
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,358
the top of my head so i'm not going to

1479
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,960
make one up but yeah they uh

1480
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:16,480
they they just had a really good look to

1481
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,358
them and those ones were the ones ended

1482
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,119
up being selected for the new the uh the

1483
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,039
wine line which isn't even i mean i've

1484
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,119
released a few of those but

1485
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,480
not all of those

1486
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,318
have been released and in the purple

1487
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,920
vapor line

1488
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,358
i think there was the first one i

1489
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,559
released from that so far i think was

1490
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:33,519
the uh

1491
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,960
um

1492
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,559
or one of the newer ones that he was the

1493
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,000
biker perps

1494
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,359
and that's that hell's angel times

1495
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,639
purple vapor so all those the new ones i

1496
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,759
feel like are going to be killer man i

1497
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,358
really feel like those ones are going to

1498
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,520
be awesome

1499
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,920
yeah definitely i mean the brandywine is

1500
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,920
one i'm extremely interested in mostly

1501
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,358
because it contains pink champagne we'll

1502
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,280
jump to that in a second

1503
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,799
what is it about the brandy one which

1504
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,480
drawed you to it i mean i know it's won

1505
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,720
a cup on its own so that's probably a

1506
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,199
good starting point right

1507
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,598
oh yeah no it's it's the

1508
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,679
the the brandywine itself like we i knew

1509
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,720
once we started growing that one out it

1510
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,719
showed so much um it very

1511
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,879
i i don't have a percentage but it had a

1512
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,639
lot of the of the uh

1513
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,200
the um offspring had some good um signs

1514
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:24,000
of pink champagne and that cut in itself

1515
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,318
i've been smoking for 20 plus years and

1516
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,559
i am yet to see one other strain that

1517
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:30,480
has that same tert profile

1518
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,640
nothing i have not come across anything

1519
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,079
else in all my cannabis days that have

1520
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,159
that smells exactly like the pink

1521
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,599
champagne and i mean this it has to be

1522
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,279
the cut from the bay area um

1523
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,440
i'm i still don't know the full lineage

1524
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,040
of it i've been told story after story

1525
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,960
and it's almost it's more of a secret

1526
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:49,119
than anything else people people make

1527
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,599
stuff up but they're supposedly or

1528
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,960
supposedly there's a

1529
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,359
some romulan

1530
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,440
urkel and c99 in there somewhere i can

1531
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,039
see the c99 or maybe the urkel because

1532
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,240
of the color but there's something in it

1533
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,599
that is it makes it super unique and

1534
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,439
like i said i've just it's it's

1535
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,359
unmatched so

1536
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,639
finding anything like that in the brandy

1537
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:10,719
one

1538
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,078
was super cool and just knowing that

1539
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,239
that's

1540
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,960
the potential i knew that there was some

1541
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,719
that i was onto something um

1542
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,800
having the brandywine in the lineage i

1543
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,598
feel like it has a certain kind of a

1544
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,160
sweetness and it adds frost so that male

1545
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,760
was a stud and i feel like it's just

1546
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,519
another one of the something from

1547
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,160
grandpa's breath line that once it

1548
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,759
touches the female it just adds so much

1549
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,598
good stuff to it that it's it's kind of

1550
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,359
a no-brainer

1551
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,960
yeah without a doubt

1552
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:40,239
it's funny i was thinking about this for

1553
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,920
a while i was like oh we're going to

1554
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,000
geek out over

1555
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,519
over champagne or sorry the pink

1556
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,440
champagne because i didn't realize there

1557
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,000
was another strain called champagne but

1558
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,760
apparently there is um but then i yeah

1559
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,358
as we're in it right now i realize it's

1560
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,319
pretty much both of us just going yeah i

1561
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:58,000
don't know what's in it like

1562
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,440
but that's what's kind of cool man i

1563
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,119
mean that's what i kind of was saying

1564
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,000
earlier there's a lot of

1565
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,838
um

1566
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,159
i'm not gonna i mean not a fable fable's

1567
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,639
more of a story like a like a kind of a

1568
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,679
made-up story but um i really feel like

1569
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,719
there's

1570
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:13,039
um

1571
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:14,558
there's some hidden

1572
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,838
there's something going on where some

1573
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,839
people just don't want someone to

1574
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,440
recreate or they just decide to keep it

1575
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,679
a secret or maybe they're just they

1576
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,280
maybe no one really knows but i find it

1577
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,279
extremely odd that this day and age

1578
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,800
they're not i've had a lot of

1579
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,319
bullshitters step forward and try

1580
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,760
telling me that they know what it is and

1581
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,440
this and that it's like we don't even i

1582
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,040
mean i don't know who you are i've never

1583
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,480
heard of you and if you all of a sudden

1584
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:35,759
out of nowhere you pop up on instagram

1585
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,480
and you're the [Â __Â ] creator behind

1586
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,280
pink champagne i don't think so so

1587
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,838
uh

1588
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,000
whoever has it or made it out there

1589
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,838
congratulations you made something that

1590
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,719
i hold very dear to my heart it's

1591
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,558
awesome plant so that's cool but um yeah

1592
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,159
i really wish i knew what it was it

1593
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,240
would it would it would help a lot of

1594
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,000
things out but sometimes it's better

1595
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,838
that not to just have a mystery it

1596
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,239
creates it creates a good uh

1597
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,480
something to talk about again you know

1598
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,879
yeah for sure for sure

1599
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,159
um i guess kind of the next thing which

1600
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,920
i found on your instagram when i was

1601
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,318
doing a little stumble through it all

1602
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,200
was that you have done some feminized

1603
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,880
seeds in the past not exactly a staple

1604
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,039
in the menu but can we expect to see

1605
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,440
more going forward

1606
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:22,480
yes and no so here's here's here's if

1607
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,280
people don't know this those that was a

1608
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,559
it was a collaboration release i didn't

1609
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,319
breed those

1610
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,040
a friend uh who goes by uh at mary jane

1611
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:37,199
wines he was the creator behind the

1612
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:38,480
gorilla glue 4s1 and the uh

1613
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,558
um

1614
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,719
the gorilla grapes which a lot of people

1615
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,280
liked and we we still grow and we love

1616
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:48,719
it it's very glue dominant but

1617
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,480
you get just enough of a kind of a a

1618
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,239
sweet berry thing going on that kind of

1619
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,440
just adds a little bit more of

1620
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,759
you know something interesting to the

1621
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,760
glue but both of those released were

1622
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,319
they were fantastic

1623
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,720
got a lot of good feedback um except for

1624
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,279
the glue out of respect for josie wales

1625
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,118
i wouldn't ever release another glue

1626
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,519
s1 he really wasn't happy with that and

1627
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,680
i can understand but at the same time i

1628
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:14,239
didn't do it so i just released it as a

1629
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,239
you know help a friend out but um i

1630
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,318
think at some point yes you can expect

1631
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,639
to see more i've i've been it's been

1632
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:22,639
requested of me so much and i get asked

1633
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:25,838
at every show are your seats feminized

1634
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,440
why not can i get some you know there's

1635
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:28,719
and it's always a mixed answer i've told

1636
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,679
people

1637
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,199
i prefer regular seeds but i'm not going

1638
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,719
to tell you how to grow if someone else

1639
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,118
wants to grow feminized seeds and

1640
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,798
they're hell-bent on i want feminize i

1641
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,480
don't want to pick out the males and i

1642
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,079
want to i want the risk i want to risk

1643
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,599
the potential of having herms you know

1644
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,920
late in flower and having to figure out

1645
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,480
where they're coming from that's fine

1646
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,880
you can run those feminized seeds so i

1647
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,119
at some point i think i'll probably

1648
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,760
you know release some to people but uh

1649
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,680
it's definitely not on my agenda or my

1650
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,359
to-do list anytime soon i've got i've

1651
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,838
got so much other stuff going on and i

1652
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:04,239
find what i'm doing now is a lot more

1653
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,639
fun and it's it's it's just what i'm

1654
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:09,759
into i don't i haven't i personally have

1655
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,039
never reversed a plant um

1656
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,000
to uh

1657
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,880
um

1658
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,559
make the pawn it so it's it's one of

1659
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,160
those things like i i

1660
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,079
i know i can do it but it's just a

1661
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,598
matter of uh setting up the space and

1662
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,318
getting the little feminize room going

1663
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,000
so

1664
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,358
but again it's just really i've got with

1665
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,400
everything else i've got going on i'd

1666
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,679
much rather focus on my regular line

1667
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,838
yeah okay

1668
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,639
so an interesting point you kind of

1669
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:37,519
loosely touched on was josie wales and

1670
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:39,279
kind of gorilla glue moving forward an

1671
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,039
interesting point is there seems to be

1672
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,040
talks i don't know if it's actually

1673
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,960
happened but you know of like trying to

1674
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,558
take more of like a strong legal stance

1675
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,720
on people using their strains and

1676
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,480
whatnot do you think how do you think

1677
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,639
about that idea moving forward and if

1678
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,559
there became a precedent for that would

1679
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,000
you ever consider using it if people

1680
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,519
were like you know s wanting your

1681
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,519
strains and stuff or do you think like

1682
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,239
it's not necessarily the best road we go

1683
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:05,679
down as a community

1684
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,000
there man there's i'm kind of it

1685
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,838
i feel strongly about a couple different

1686
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,358
things so one

1687
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,279
do i think that we should all be able to

1688
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,679
brand our work yes

1689
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,240
but do i am i against someone else using

1690
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,879
my stuff no i think i think there's a

1691
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:24,159
fine line between someone who has a good

1692
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,358
idea and wants to use your work to

1693
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,199
um

1694
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:28,880
you know to make something special and

1695
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,399
then some guy that wants to be lazy and

1696
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,079
just say hey i'm going to take i'm going

1697
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,039
to take someone else's stuff and just

1698
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,519
make a feminized line out of his work or

1699
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,039
i'm going to take his his pack of seeds

1700
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,639
and cross it to all my stuff and release

1701
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,558
that it's like that's kind of i mean

1702
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,879
that's too easy bro i mean you should

1703
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,400
you should do at least one breed find a

1704
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,720
male from that and then cross it to

1705
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,358
something but i think at this point if

1706
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,159
we can all get to where we've got our

1707
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,159
own

1708
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,598
you know strains that we've made and we

1709
00:56:54,159 --> 00:57:00,399
are known for it and people can we can

1710
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,720
if there's no argument that that we all

1711
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,798
know that csi made this strain and air

1712
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,719
and and dvg made that stream archive

1713
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,880
made that stream and those are theirs

1714
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,719
then those strains should be ours and it

1715
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,798
should be no argument but since we all

1716
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,719
know that's not the case and many people

1717
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,000
will abuse that

1718
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,078
maybe we do need to have a little bit

1719
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,599
more of a legal standpoint

1720
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,240
i feel like everything's going that way

1721
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,720
anyway in the canvas industry so

1722
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,239
unfortunately i wish it wasn't but it is

1723
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:27,598
what it is so you kind of gotta follow

1724
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,239
suit and just run with it so at this

1725
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,599
point i think uh trying to get involved

1726
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,679
with you know

1727
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,119
i don't know if patenting my strains is

1728
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:36,879
necessarily the right word but but

1729
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,200
getting them into philosophy there's

1730
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,039
another there's another thing um some

1731
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:42,879
woman presented to me where you can

1732
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,719
basically send in clippings of your

1733
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,880
strains and they you basically get some

1734
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,399
sort of uh they do it with flowers and

1735
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,838
other plants but

1736
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,519
kind of branding your work and then you

1737
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,960
get ownership of it there's there's

1738
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:54,400
certain things that are kind of turning

1739
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,639
in that direction

1740
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,480
and i'm all about it i will follow i'll

1741
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,318
do whatever i can to get my streams all

1742
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,400
listed under so it's known that i made

1743
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:03,920
them but whether that makes them legally

1744
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,160
mine like i can take you to court and

1745
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,079
sue you that seems kind of douchey i

1746
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,519
mean unless it's a huge company that's

1747
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,039
going to be making millions of dollars

1748
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,880
off me then at that point yeah i want my

1749
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,798
piece of the pie but i think if some

1750
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,160
other guy wants to use your strain or

1751
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,318
something it's and it's with good

1752
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,000
intentions then is it really a reason to

1753
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:21,440
go cost stink and then pay a bunch of

1754
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,760
lawyer fees and get involved and all

1755
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,920
that i don't i don't think so but

1756
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,520
um there's definitely

1757
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,159
there's definitely a lot of stuff going

1758
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,000
on right now and a lot of shady stuff

1759
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,519
going on and a lot of people burning

1760
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,039
bridges so

1761
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:38,159
i don't know it's so it almost seems

1762
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,440
like it's it's kind of like uh

1763
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,118
you know you should be doing anything

1764
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,599
you can to protect your business and

1765
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,440
your branding

1766
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,280
yeah it definitely seems like there are

1767
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,119
some kind of underhanded moves being

1768
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,720
made by some people but

1769
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,559
not to drown on that maybe to even

1770
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,159
highlight the opposite if someone did

1771
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,839
want to breed with some of your work and

1772
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,838
do it the right way kind of you know

1773
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:58,880
underlying part of this question

1774
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,880
do you

1775
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,559
kind of in general like when people

1776
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,318
reach out and say hey you know i'm going

1777
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,599
to do this what do you think or you just

1778
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,719
don't care you know like you know

1779
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,559
because i'm like yeah do it but you

1780
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:11,279
don't need to talk to me or anything or

1781
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,160
how do you feel about all that

1782
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,160
well

1783
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:16,078
seeing as i'm guilty of it myself i

1784
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,598
think that i think that everybody if

1785
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,880
you're gonna use someone else's stuff

1786
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,640
you should probably mention it to them

1787
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,318
like hey man i just thought you'd know

1788
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,159
um i found something killer out of your

1789
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,318
work i'm gonna use it as one of my

1790
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,318
females in my project and then hit it to

1791
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:29,599
my mail and you know voila

1792
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,199
i want to give you some of the seeds

1793
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,559
back if you're interested or hey just

1794
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,078
want to pay homage i'll make sure i

1795
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,400
shout you out whatever there's a lot of

1796
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,480
stuff that goes into it and i have not

1797
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,358
always done that but well i used the

1798
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,639
seed junkies uh his wedding cake the cut

1799
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,480
didn't come from him it came through

1800
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,078
someone else and

1801
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,760
i in a roundabout way hit him up and

1802
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,119
said hey man i know i talked about

1803
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,240
wanting this cut i ended up getting it

1804
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,519
through someone else just want to let

1805
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:54,159
you know he's like hey man that's cool

1806
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,880
right on have fun with it enjoy

1807
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:58,000
and there's just a mutual respect i i

1808
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,039
think

1809
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,039
so

1810
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:02,798
that's different than someone else just

1811
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,400
using for instance if someone just all

1812
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:05,920
of a sudden crossed you know my

1813
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,760
grandpa's breath or something to their

1814
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,119
entire line which actually just recently

1815
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,359
happened and then they didn't even

1816
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,039
mention it to me and then i find out

1817
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,318
that not only did you not even mention

1818
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:15,679
that you're going to agree with my stuff

1819
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:17,759
but you

1820
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,078
you then released it all untested to the

1821
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,520
community that's a slap in the face man

1822
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,519
because then all of a sudden i'm going

1823
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:24,960
to look like like i'm a part of that in

1824
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,480
a way like if you didn't test your gear

1825
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,400
and you get a bunch of bad stuff coming

1826
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,159
out of it then all of a sudden my my

1827
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,079
name is attached to someone else really

1828
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,759
shitty stuff i don't like that and i

1829
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,920
also don't like people you know just

1830
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,440
releasing stuff to the community just to

1831
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,838
make a quick buck really quick you know

1832
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,440
that's not really cool either so there's

1833
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,119
there's definitely

1834
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,039
it just comes down to respect man i

1835
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,480
really feel like if someone

1836
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,000
if they want to use your stuff it's kind

1837
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,519
of an honor in a way you know there's no

1838
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,880
reason to be mad but

1839
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:53,838
again i feel like there's certain

1840
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,440
intentions people have that

1841
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,039
you should just you should just look out

1842
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,000
for and i think that some people just

1843
01:00:57,039 --> 01:00:59,920
don't really give a [Â __Â ] they're going

1844
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,480
to do whatever they're going to do but

1845
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,480
i've seen it countless times where some

1846
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,719
well-known breeders or people that are

1847
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,240
making seeds take someone else's line

1848
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:09,838
and drop it without mentioning anything

1849
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,838
to them it's like wow that's kind of why

1850
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:13,759
would they do that and it's just like

1851
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,119
you know there's kind of mixed feelings

1852
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,720
about it so

1853
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,920
if someone gets offended about that then

1854
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:22,239
i think they already know the answer

1855
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,519
yeah okay so just leaving back to a

1856
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,439
point you met in the previous question

1857
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:26,639
you mentioned fire loss

1858
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,960
how do you feel about the idea of

1859
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:31,358
genetic mapping and kind of

1860
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,798
maybe kind of in answering the question

1861
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,480
you pose where you said oh look you know

1862
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:36,400
i'm down with the idea of getting

1863
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,960
ownership but not necessarily so i can

1864
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,519
go and sue people one of the kind of

1865
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,358
things about files is they say that if

1866
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,039
you submit your stuff to them it will

1867
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:46,639
get you know mapped and you'll have

1868
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,880
ownership of it but it'll go into the

1869
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,480
public domain so that like everyone can

1870
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,599
use it but obviously it's known that

1871
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,559
it's yours

1872
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,240
would you do it if that was the case

1873
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,440
absolutely like i i really i've been

1874
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:59,279
meaning to meet up with those they've

1875
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,880
been talking to me for a while and i

1876
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,240
want to say at least a couple years

1877
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,240
about getting together and doing some

1878
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,798
stuff and i really i need to do that and

1879
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,639
i want to do it and yeah i guess i don't

1880
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:10,079
understand how it works i i thought

1881
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,078
anyone and everyone could turn in a

1882
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,519
strain and then if it kind of just goes

1883
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,680
into that map where they kind of just

1884
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,358
has the stars are all on there with with

1885
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:19,598
you know with everything kind of showing

1886
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,719
where it all lands on the on them on the

1887
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,880
field but

1888
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,639
um if there's a way for me personally to

1889
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,640
say no this is mine and have my name

1890
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,480
attached then hell yeah man i think that

1891
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,920
anything like that that can kind of put

1892
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,838
you into the history books as you're the

1893
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,440
guy behind it then great because that's

1894
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,358
kind of where we've had issues in the

1895
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,119
past where people are butting heads over

1896
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,880
well that's my strain well no it's not i

1897
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,480
made that one well no you didn't i made

1898
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,838
that no three you came out in oh wait i

1899
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,079
mean who knows man there's a lot of

1900
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,519
stuff that that can really

1901
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,160
you know we can end an argument really

1902
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,719
quick if if it was known uh facts and it

1903
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:52,719
was stuff that's been documented already

1904
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:54,798
yeah for sure

1905
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,480
so just to look back on the brandywine

1906
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,239
for one moment i noticed on your

1907
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,880
instagram it actually kind of snuck by

1908
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,879
me the first time the absinthe cross

1909
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,039
chem dog big part of this show you know

1910
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,798
holds a special place in our hearts how

1911
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,119
do you rate the chem d and do you so do

1912
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,639
you see yourself working with the chem

1913
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,039
in you know whether it be the kmd the

1914
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:14,480
chem 91 whatever moving forward or was

1915
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,000
it just more of like a one-off trial

1916
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,358
thing

1917
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,960
i think that um having kim in my lines

1918
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:22,639
is definitely something that's needed to

1919
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,960
happen when i first was working with ken

1920
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,960
i had a kim 4. i still have kim 4 but

1921
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,720
the kim 4 was one that i first was had

1922
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,880
access to and i really liked it it

1923
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:34,480
yielded great it's a good plant

1924
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,480
i want more of that stank and the chem d

1925
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,079
and the chem 91 which i

1926
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,599
um

1927
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,280
which i do have it just hasn't been bred

1928
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,318
with yet uh

1929
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:47,119
both of those have a little bit more of

1930
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:50,400
the smell i'm looking for um what i did

1931
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:52,240
find or excuse me what my tester found

1932
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,400
with the absinthe cross that he just

1933
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:56,399
recently finished up was there wasn't as

1934
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,400
much chem dog

1935
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,720
smells coming out of his what he

1936
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,240
selected as the keepers which is fine i

1937
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,679
wasn't necessarily trying to create

1938
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:05,759
something that i would say is better

1939
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:07,440
than the original mom by any means what

1940
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,599
i'm trying to do is just literally

1941
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,599
release something that's going to have

1942
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,838
some new smells all together and i know

1943
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,359
that when you combine such a good parent

1944
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:18,078
with something that i'm offering i think

1945
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,679
there's there's there's it mixes well

1946
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,519
and it creates let's just say like a new

1947
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,199
drink at the bar you know i mean like we

1948
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:24,960
all can go get the originals we all love

1949
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,239
and like but then we can go and make hey

1950
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,559
try this one all of a sudden it gives

1951
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,159
you some new taste on or a new view on

1952
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,920
on the strain you already liked then

1953
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:33,519
great i did my job and that's kind of

1954
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,599
where i'm going so

1955
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,440
yes i'm gonna have more kim in the line

1956
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,160
yes there'll be more kim popping up but

1957
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,039
for now the cross that you see the uh

1958
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:44,798
the kim four cross to brandywine is

1959
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,240
called kim fusion that one's going to be

1960
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,960
coming out at some point and the same

1961
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,558
with the absinthe kim d times the

1962
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,920
brandywine both of those are going to be

1963
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,280
great i i know it but um definitely got

1964
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,639
to go through the testing i'd like to

1965
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,640
run them myself you know before

1966
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,480
releasing them and

1967
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,558
so there's a little bit of a wait but

1968
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,000
i'd rather i'd rather always you know

1969
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,839
put something out that i'm proud of than

1970
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,679
rather just have someone else's word and

1971
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:10,078
just release it on on without any

1972
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:11,838
knowledge of what what i'm doing um i

1973
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,720
i'd like to have

1974
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:15,199
some

1975
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,679
some really good lines that include

1976
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:19,679
those kims but i think what i'll find

1977
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,919
once i get those those ones going with

1978
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,838
some back crossing or if i need to just

1979
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,440
do some in-car whatever i'm going to do

1980
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,920
i have a feeling i will i will be

1981
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,960
looking for more of the kim phenos to be

1982
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,960
popping up to use more of

1983
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,880
oh very exciting yeah i definitely am

1984
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,679
interested in that absence

1985
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,358
so

1986
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,558
just to pop to another strain that kind

1987
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,318
of snuck by me that i'm really

1988
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:44,640
interested in hangover haze this one i'm

1989
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:46,558
yeah i'm super interested in it because

1990
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,798
ghost train haze was big for a minute

1991
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,319
and then it kind of popped off but i

1992
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,318
still think it's a killer strain you

1993
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:54,318
know what is it about it that draw you

1994
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,079
to it and do you have any of these other

1995
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:58,558
kind of strong sativas that you're

1996
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:03,519
thinking about breeding with

1997
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:05,200
yes and yes so so um the the ghost train

1998
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:07,679
it's it's a cut out account uh to

1999
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,759
colorado i don't know if it for sure

2000
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,318
came from the rare dankness camp or not

2001
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,799
but one way or another um it's got it's

2002
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,880
got killer smell it's uh

2003
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,400
it's hard for me to describe smells as

2004
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,318
much some people have different way of

2005
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,920
doing it but to me it was more of that

2006
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:24,719
that um

2007
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,318
kind of like a pine saw cleaner

2008
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,838
you know like the metallic haze kind of

2009
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,679
thing going on but with that cleaner

2010
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:31,599
smell and the pine i don't know ghost

2011
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:35,199
train haze has a very distinct smell in

2012
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,280
my opinion and it it it was awesome um

2013
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:40,159
crossed it to the brandywine and each

2014
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,000
time i saw it um finish up it was very

2015
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,199
um there was you get some of that lemon

2016
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,280
and some of the stuff from the mom but

2017
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,960
again you get you get kind of a mixed

2018
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,280
you know smell thing going on there

2019
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,318
that's it definitely leads for uh

2020
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,079
some interesting stuff uh the

2021
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:55,519
that one

2022
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,720
was one of the more

2023
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:00,639
sativa dominant ones i did um i do have

2024
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:03,038
some some uh

2025
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,358
there's one called uh redheaded stranger

2026
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,760
that's a new one in my line uh that's

2027
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:10,318
gonna be hit here shortly but that's a

2028
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,000
tom hills haze with uh williams wonder i

2029
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,719
believe

2030
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,239
wow that is two powerhouses

2031
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,078
yeah that one right there i think will

2032
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,239
be interesting there's a couple others

2033
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,000
too um oh the dutch tree the original

2034
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:24,719
dutch street i got that one's that one's

2035
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,239
in flower right now um i think that one

2036
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:27,919
will eventually get here with some stuff

2037
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:29,118
and we'll have some some new ones to

2038
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,358
play with but

2039
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,440
i like i said earlier i like sativa

2040
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,759
people ask for it all the time just like

2041
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,200
that and cbd and i don't ever i don't

2042
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,280
hardly have anything to offer them

2043
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:41,199
especially cbd i have nothing but sativa

2044
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,119
wise the hangover haze was the first one

2045
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,919
i could say that in my cipro which is

2046
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,838
the snow cap cross they uh

2047
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,480
those would be two i'd be leaning toward

2048
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:52,480
the sativa side of things

2049
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,838
yeah okay cool

2050
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,559
and so

2051
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,239
um do you ever plan to work with any

2052
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,559
crazy land race stuff or it's just not

2053
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,358
really on the radar

2054
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,119
i

2055
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,798
i've got i was i just pulled him out

2056
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,119
yesterday because i'd i'd taken a

2057
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:09,119
picture of my seed my seed collection

2058
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,559
and i have i had mentioned having land

2059
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,640
races in there i pulled them out i've

2060
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:16,480
got i've got nepalese

2061
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:18,079
stuff i've got stuff from uh uh india um

2062
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,599
there's there's an issue right now a lot

2063
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:22,238
of people are saying that a lot of stuff

2064
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,838
that that's coming out of india has been

2065
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:25,678
you know stuff that was just you know

2066
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:27,439
basically hemp you know or stuff that's

2067
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,119
very low potency just nothing great and

2068
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,960
a lot of people have have been just

2069
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:32,238
breeding [Â __Â ] and and not really

2070
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,880
paying attention to what they're doing

2071
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:37,278
out there now i do know for a fact that

2072
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,880
the guy that i got them from

2073
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,560
uh was a little bit uh more reputable as

2074
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,319
far as you know he's not just going to

2075
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,159
the the base of the mountain collecting

2076
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,520
seeds he he knew people up in the hills

2077
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:51,599
his wife was from uh india he had a

2078
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,000
little bit more of a reputation he was

2079
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,079
friends with ringo who passed away a

2080
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,039
little ways back

2081
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:59,600
and

2082
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,600
i believe

2083
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,318
i believe dj short got seeds from him as

2084
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,880
well at the same time i did and grew

2085
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,560
some out and he found some good stuff

2086
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,239
now

2087
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,520
those plants really should be grown

2088
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,119
outside or in the greenhouse or

2089
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,799
something and right now i only have

2090
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:17,039
indoor room to dedicate so i won't be

2091
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,880
popping any of them soon but before they

2092
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,439
go bad i mean i really need to get get

2093
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,279
them in the ground because there's the

2094
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:25,919
what could be found in the seeds i do

2095
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,759
have would be would be incredible and i

2096
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,759
i'm telling you right now i've never

2097
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,838
seen seeds like these so whatever they

2098
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,279
are i have a feeling just based on what

2099
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:34,880
i'm looking at in the bag i have

2100
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,279
something special like they literally

2101
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,600
look like espresso beans just these tiny

2102
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,440
little black things that are just dark

2103
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,640
and shiny like i've never seen anything

2104
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,639
like it

2105
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,880
so there's definitely some interesting

2106
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,279
stuff in there but when when i get to

2107
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,838
pop them and will they be uh crossed

2108
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,480
into anything i have who knows but i i

2109
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,238

2110
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,879

2111
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,319
what is some genetics you wish you had

2112
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,079
right now to work with that you don't

2113
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:04,000
have whether it be just a clone you

2114
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,880
don't have access to or some genetics

2115
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,719
that are from you gone by

2116
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,640
i recently just got a clone from

2117
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,640
somebody that's supposed to be or it's

2118
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,679
not supposed to be it's it's from duke

2119
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,239
diamond and it's a uh it's one of his i

2120

believe it's dominion seed company uh he

2121
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:22,238
has he has some new skunks he's been

2122
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:24,639
working with and he i would say if

2123
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:25,919
anybody out there right now has

2124
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,400
um

2125
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,480
you know good feedback on releasing some

2126
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:32,399
some of the old-school skunk that really

2127
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,718
that roadkill kind of smell there's

2128
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:36,399
something from from from matt wright i

2129
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,719
hear about all the time this skunk spray

2130
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,799
afghan but there's also the uh

2131
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,719
this stuff from from duke where he's got

2132
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,719
this local skunk and these different

2133
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,079
ones that are all supposed to be just

2134
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,520
just really

2135
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,920
bring back the memories of that old

2136
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,760
lineage that we all thought was extinct

2137
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,440
so i'm kind of looking into that i'd

2138
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,560
really wish i had some of his stuff

2139
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:56,799
because that takes me back to my

2140
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,400
childhood anytime i smelt a dead skunk i

2141
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,960
correlated that to

2142
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:01,759
you know smelling some good green bud so

2143
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,600
um

2144
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,199
he he's something i i'd like to get into

2145
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,560

2146
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:09,279

2147
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,360

something i'm after i'd like to see in

2150
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,239
my line um but then also uh

2151
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,840
i don't know who i don't know who the

2152
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,000
breeder is but there's something called

2153
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,560
tits this is the [Â __Â ] is what it stands

2154
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,158
for there's something like that or sour

2155
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,560
this is the [Â __Â ] there's a few out there

2156
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:31,039
that i'm a big sour diesel fan so

2157
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,400
anything that's got um

2158
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:34,238
anything that's close to that or has a

2159
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:35,439
very sour smell or just a real just

2160
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:37,439
strong funk

2161
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:39,759
i'm into that there's there's another

2162
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,439
one royal kush every time i've seen

2163
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,199
royal cush i'm absolutely in love with

2164
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,319
it but i know some guys are you know

2165
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,639
there's plenty of people out there

2166
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,158
breeding with it some people

2167
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,159
are known for that that's like their

2168
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:51,279
baby so that kind of goes back to what i

2169
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:52,879
said originally like i don't want to

2170
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:54,719
necessarily

2171
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,319
take what someone else is already you

2172
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,399
know that's you know something of theirs

2173
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:00,158
and then use it in mine maybe if it was

2174
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,079
gifted to me or they asked me to breed

2175
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:04,079
with it that'd be another story but

2176
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:06,800
um i think i'm gonna

2177
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,640
more or less try sticking to uh

2178
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,079
stuff i'm finding in my own lines and

2179
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,280
then obviously i'll have to go back and

2180
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,039
you know some of these ones some of the

2181
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:14,158
hyped cuts and

2182
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:17,519
some of these ones that people really

2183
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:19,279
want to see me work with i'll end up

2184
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,199

2215
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,600
same thing as soon as you squeezed that

2216

2221
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,719
god man and even a year after getting

2222
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,000
that bud i was smoking what i was

2223
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,560
calling christmas weed because that's

2224
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
around the time i got it um a year later

2225
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,800
and it was still just as good as when i

2226
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,359
first did it was just gooey sticky

2227
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,119
great just really nicely grown weed out

2228
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:52,319
of humble

2229
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,319
yeah well the dream right

2230
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:57,439
so i'm gonna push you on one last thing

2231
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:59,519
before we jump back into your own stuff

2232
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,960
you put a photo out recently kind of

2233
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,640
touching on that point you made earlier

2234
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,960
about being both a seed collector as

2235
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,280
well as a seed creator in that photo we

2236
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,359
can see of your little seed your seed

2237
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,719
storage container we can see a few

2238
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:12,479
breeders in there i'm pretty sure i can

2239
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,800
see a pack of body at the front nice and

2240
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:17,519
center but i can also i also think i can

2241
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,440
see it's either like a pack of oni or a

2242
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,800
pack from goo

2243
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:23,439
i can't quite make it out it doesn't

2244
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,960
matter but what i want to know is if you

2245
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,399
had to pack a few pops from your little

2246
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,920
collection what would it be and who are

2247
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,519
some of the breeders who you currently

2248
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,840
jive with

2249
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,679
man there's there's so much stuff in

2250
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,279
here dude i mean there's but yeah you're

2251
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:36,880
right you're seeing some bodhi right

2252
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:38,960
there on the top of it i've got some

2253
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,199
bodhi gear um

2254
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,359
he's someone he's one of the breeders

2255
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:44,719
who you don't see a lot of these shows

2256
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,639
he's always been kind of behind the

2257
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,119
scenes i met him one time and he was the

2258
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,840
most humble down to earth the coolest

2259
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:54,319
guy i i had talked to in a long time and

2260
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,600
it was an honor to meet him um and he

2261
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,799
literally after meeting a guy like that

2262
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,480
you pretty much want to buy his whole

2263
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,119
line but you'd go broke doing it because

2264
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:03,678
he's got so many strains

2265
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:06,399
but he he's such a cool dude and then

2266
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,000
there's like uh shoot who else i think

2267

awning or an on one with seed was it

2269

2277
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000

2278
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,519

2279
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,880
stuff in here it's not even funny but i

2280
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,400
think honestly

2281
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,640
i've got some stuff right here at the

2282
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:39,359
top from a guy called

2283
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,679
elite cannabis out of colorado and him

2284
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,039
and his boys uh he's friends with green

2285
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,199
dot uh

2286
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,119
green dot dave i believe green dot labs

2287
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,119
dave had a colorado through these other

2288
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,158
guys and they've got these kim de la kim

2289
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,039
crosses

2290
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,599
and

2291
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,439
i believe it's a kim d i-95 cross

2292
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,400
something like that and

2293
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:58,000
just

2294
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:59,920
it i mean all the stuff they've got

2295
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,520
triangle kush kim dogs everything's

2296
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,679
crossed to this kim daily kim and i

2297
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,760
think that sparked my interest because

2298
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,158
even going back to the old ic mag days

2299
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,679
all i wanted was the stinkiest stuff i

2300
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:11,839
could find like that's what sold that's

2301
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:13,920
what i wanted i want the gas i want the

2302
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,760
just the nasty baby poop stuff just

2303
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,800
anything that just makes you go ugh

2304
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,960
that's what i'm into so so

2305
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,960
he i have a feeling popping any of that

2306
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,119
stuff there i'm gonna find everything i

2307
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,319
need to fall under the nasty category

2308
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:28,719
and then uh

2309
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:29,920
i mean after that probably those indian

2310
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,439
land race i mentioned earlier because i

2311
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,000
mean i know there's there's so much

2312
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:35,279
value in popping some original uh land

2313
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,039
race and being able to use that and

2314
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:39,439
you're breeding to get some pure stuff

2315
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:40,719
but if it is or not that's another thing

2316
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,479
i'm gonna have to get some guys that are

2317
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,920
that are very well versed and you know

2318
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:45,359
that have traveled or have seen these

2319
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,640
things up close and can tell me hey

2320
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:49,039
that's what this is or you know you're

2321
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:52,239
growing freaking hemp

2322
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:54,079
yeah for sure on a little side note um i

2323
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:55,759
spoke to professor p and he said he grew

2324
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,000
out some of those chem dealer chem

2325
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,280
crosses and he was blown away so you're

2326
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,800
in for something especially if you do

2327
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:04,079
pop those ones

2328
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,320
um oh good to know yeah so

2329
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,559
kind of same topic but a little bit left

2330
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,479
of it would you ever consider doing a

2331
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,560
breeding collaborative project and if

2332
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:13,839
you did how would you want to do it like

2333
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,440
because i think a lot of people these

2334
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,360
days like you know each person brings

2335
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:19,519
one kind of parent to the table is that

2336
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:21,679
how you'd want to do it or you know some

2337
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,840
other weird idea maybe

2338
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,319
it you know it kind of depends so that's

2339
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,319
i did the uh i did that release from my

2340
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:30,079
buddy mary jane weinzer like i said you

2341
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,079
know that was something we talked about

2342
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:33,679
you know i i had mentioned

2343
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:35,119
wanting to

2344
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,719
you know have some feminized stuff and

2345
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,158
why people are asking for it so much he

2346
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,600
says well i've got you know i'm making

2347
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,759
gorilla glue s ones i'm making this

2348
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,120
thing called grill grapes you know what

2349
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,440
do you think

2350
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,359
and i thought it was a good idea

2351
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,719
i think i think i'd like to have a

2352
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:50,479
little bit more

2353
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,399
um

2354
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,839
involvement rather than just having

2355
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,519
someone say hey this is what i mean here

2356
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,560
you go and selling them under my brand i

2357
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,040
don't i

2358
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,120
there was no issues with that but i

2359
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:02,960
still don't want to do that ever again

2360
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,800
just because um

2361
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,960
i think it's better for a breeder to

2362
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,480
have a little bit more of a

2363
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,760
say in what's being used and what's

2364
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:11,599
going on that way you can back the

2365
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,280
project a little bit better

2366
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,719
i think

2367
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:16,319
this day and age like i said earlier

2368
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:18,158
there's a lot of greed and there's a lot

2369
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,599
of shadiness that goes on so if you're

2370
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,719
going to get involved with anybody like

2371
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,239
that you probably want to have

2372
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,520
you know someone that you've known or

2373
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,519
that you can work well with and that

2374
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,040
you're vibing good with i've got a guy

2375
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,920
out of california by the name of green

2376
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,679
gold collective he was the guy that bred

2377
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,359
the uh the lemon grove that i'm

2378
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,679
currently growing which is the lemon

2379
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:39,279
tree times citrus farmer he told me what

2380
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,279
he was doing the entire time and i was

2381
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:43,599
like man that's that's literally a cross

2382
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:44,639
that i wanted to do and that's awesome

2383
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,159
good for you

2384
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,400
and he's you know that's when we started

2385
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,799
talking about working together on it so

2386
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:52,879
he did the original f1 cross i'm growing

2387
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,079
out them right now he's had a few

2388
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,760
buddies grow some of them out in

2389
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:56,960
california in the outdoors and in the

2390
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,679
greenhouse and everything's come out

2391
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,119
perfect we will take

2392
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,800
um

2393
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,000
selections i've already pulled bales off

2394
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,440
the table and everything they're already

2395
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,960
put to the side but i'm growing out

2396
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:09,599
females right now we'll see how that

2397
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,119
goes and then i imagine that uh he'll

2398
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,880
probably end up having to come up here

2399
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,039
vice versa and we'll have to check

2400
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,920
things out on the on a little bit closer

2401
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,158
uh

2402
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,600
with inspect and everything but i think

2403
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,599
we will end up

2404
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,960
more than likely releasing that that

2405
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,360
product together and it'll be something

2406
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,319
that we both have seen and and grown

2407
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:28,079
um

2408
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:29,359
both in california and washington so

2409
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,760
it'll be kind of cool

2410
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,920
um i think for any future project that's

2411
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,840
exactly how i'd want to be like it's

2412
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,520
something like either either you bring

2413
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,960
the male or i bring the female but one

2414
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,560
way or another we meet in the middle and

2415
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,719
we are going to be there through the

2416
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,480
entire process of seeing and knowing

2417
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,640
what's going on

2418
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,559
and then even even to a point of

2419
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,320
harvesting the seeds

2420
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,840
uh just getting you know you get the

2421
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:53,519
seed count around you guys just either

2422
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,159
split it up right then and there or it's

2423
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,440
just a trust thing where they know that

2424
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,119
there's x amount of packs and we're

2425
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,399
gonna put them all up for this price and

2426
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:04,319
uh expect a payday i don't know

2427
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:07,119
yeah yeah that's obviously some of the

2428
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:08,238
more interesting final logistics one of

2429
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,158
the things which you just mentioned

2430
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:11,839
though which caught my ear was the

2431
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:12,879
citrus farm i wanted to touch on this

2432
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,319
because there's so many interesting

2433
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,880
things about it i guess first and

2434
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:18,479
foremost the skunk tangerine tell us a

2435
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,000
bit about it you know it's it's kind of

2436
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:22,479
like got a bit of a cult following and

2437
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,439
it's hard to find info on it

2438
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:27,599
that one is uh it's it's it came from

2439
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:30,479
oregon kid he's not the creator i think

2440
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,520
he was just holding it for a while um he

2441
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,919
i believe

2442
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:36,480
some guy out of socal maybe even san

2443
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,880
diego i don't remember um fletcher from

2444
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,638
archive has a lot more knowledge on this

2445
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,400
strain he told me that when i told him

2446
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:43,840
that i had that cut he was like he was

2447
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,399
he was shocked he said that's that's an

2448
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,639
old one um it's one you don't see

2449
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,960
circulated very much i guess there's a

2450
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:52,719
few people that have it now and i think

2451
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,399
they're trying to sell it more and

2452
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,560
trying to get it out there but i saw a

2453
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:58,079
guy was even knowing that i worked with

2454
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,639
it he was trying to get me to pay him

2455
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:02,479
five thousand dollars for a cut

2456
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,000
so it's definitely

2457
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:06,000
something that's being presented to

2458
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,840
breeders and to other people as you know

2459
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,439
potential money maker and i don't know

2460
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,960
if it's because

2461
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,000
um

2462
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,600
you know i already bred with it so i

2463
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,920
don't know it's not worth five thousand

2464
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,520
dollars to me anymore as a cut but um

2465
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,520
for those people that haven't ever had

2466
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,239
it i will tell you it's better than your

2467
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,800
average um orange strain it's definitely

2468
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:26,479
got some old school uh feel to it to

2469
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,760
where it's just it's not your it's not

2470
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:31,279
your watered down tangy

2471
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,719
yeah well i mean the only thing i'd

2472
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:35,920
really been able to read about it was

2473
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:38,560
that it was like an 11-week flowering

2474
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,719
tangerine type of thing

2475
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,719
yes very much so and i didn't i'm not

2476
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,560
mean to i didn't i just sounded like i

2477
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,480
was disrespecting tangi i didn't mean to

2478
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,480
say watered down tangi like tangies

2479
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:50,319
watered down what i'm saying is it's not

2480
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,399
it this is an original orange strain

2481
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:54,880
whoever made it i think what i've heard

2482
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,960
was there's some salmon creek big bud

2483
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,800
with something else crossed to it i'm

2484
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,800
not exactly sure what but the salmon

2485
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,039
creek big bud i had that back when i

2486
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,239
lived in california i'd have access to

2487
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:08,079
that bud and i absolutely loved it um so

2488
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,718
whatever this plant is that makes it the

2489
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:14,319
tangerine it gives it that citrus spell

2490
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:16,000
hands down has has has uh a better smell

2491
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,158
than than most other oranges that i've

2492
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,760
come across um there's so many of them

2493
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:21,759
nowadays and that citrus the citrus

2494
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,679
scene is really hit some people are over

2495
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,119
it some people can't get enough of it

2496
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,800
i'm one of those people that it doesn't

2497
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,960
matter it's like my daily cup of coffee

2498
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,520
i'll dr i'll smoke uh orange

2499
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:33,920
concentrates i'll smoke anything tangy

2500
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,159
anything like that it leaves that flavor

2501
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,239
on on the pallet and sometimes there's

2502
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,439
not much power that gets and that gets

2503
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:41,039
associated with the orange strings

2504
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:42,399
sometimes oh it's not really that stony

2505
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,679
but one thing i can tell you i don't

2506
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:45,279
know if it's the grandpa spreads or the

2507
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,760
skunk tangerine on its own but one way

2508
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:50,479
or another those two create a powerhouse

2509
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,719
we've had tests of upwards of uh

2510
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,319
high 20s all the way up to 30 percent

2511
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,480
now i know that some tests can get a

2512
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:58,319
little bit uh juggled but for the most

2513
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,718
part anything that's tested in the 20s

2514
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:03,519
you know it's going to work out well

2515
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,679
oh yeah and i think you touched on a

2516
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,000
really relevant point i mean you said

2517
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,239
you know not to hate on tangi so to

2518
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,079
speak and i'm not hating on tangy but

2519
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,759
it's pretty widely accepted that it

2520
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,238
doesn't it's not really bringing too

2521
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,320
much in the potency department so with

2522
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:19,439
that yeah i mean i've heard that

2523
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:20,639
yeah

2524
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,399
i think what you're saying is you've

2525
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:26,239
felt that

2526
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:28,319
yes yes um but uh what i'm interested in

2527
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:30,479
is do you think do you find that the

2528
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:31,920
tangerine haze on its own obviously you

2529
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,359
answered it before you said in

2530
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,560
combination with the grandpa's breath

2531
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,158
not an issue

2532
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,520
but on its own do you feel it overcomes

2533
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:40,079
that or do you feel like a lot of the

2534
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:43,760
pure tangerine strains inherently have

2535
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:46,559
this issue of lacking potency

2536
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,840
i i think

2537
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,920
what i've come across so far hasn't

2538
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,920
you know i i've seen

2539
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,679
i've seen so many different oranges you

2540
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,800
know as far as the you know from the

2541
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,960
original orange bud or then the calio

2542
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,639
and then um you know more recently the

2543
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,319
tangy stuff and then

2544
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,079
one that i've really come across that

2545
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:07,359
i'm in love with is this tropicana

2546
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:09,679
cookies

2547
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:11,519
so i'm not sure i think there might be

2548
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,800
something to it as far as

2549
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,639
the orange is all about flavor and uh

2550
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,400
that that just blow your mind smell like

2551
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:20,719
when you open a bag i mean if you if

2552
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:22,000
you're not a very you know big smoker

2553
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,000
and you haven't seen that before most

2554
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,479
people think that something skunky's

2555
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,479
that smell they relate that to pot you

2556
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,158
you put a bag of orange butt underneath

2557
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:31,599
someone's nose especially a female that

2558
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:33,359
hasn't smoked or doesn't smoke and

2559
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,639
they're blown away like they they can't

2560
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,799
believe that it's coming from a weed

2561
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,159
plant you know so so

2562
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,159
i think that

2563
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:42,000
what's going on here is this just like i

2564
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,079
said the tropicana cookies well there

2565
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,158
you go it's got some sort of some sort

2566
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,679
of orange or something crossed to a

2567
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:49,599
cookie plant well

2568
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:52,480
maybe the cookies is just bringing that

2569
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:55,600
extra potency and making it a more of a

2570
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:57,839
uh well worthwhile strength

2571
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,639
yeah that's so funny i was um i was at

2572
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,079
bob hanbill's house and i saw a giant

2573
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,679
tropicana cookies and i pulled it out

2574
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:06,238
and smelled it i was like oh my god this

2575
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:08,158
smells like tangy cookies

2576
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,238
it's like what's it made of you guys

2577
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:12,638
like tangy cross cookies

2578
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:14,479
i was like

2579
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:17,199
i was like oh that's pretty cool you

2580
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:18,799
know um you guessed it yeah so i mean

2581
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:21,279
but you did too right you hit it on the

2582
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,279
head you like orange cross cookies

2583
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:25,279
yeah no it's it's there's there's the

2584

2585
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,158
called the the the mountain shrop cut or

2586
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,039
something like that i'm not exactly sure

2587
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:35,519
but that one to me it's got even more of

2588
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:36,639
a like a fruit punch like a like a red

2589
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,040
candy

2590
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:41,520
you know like like cherry strawberry red

2591
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:43,600
kind of candy crust with the orange

2592
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,199
tangy smell with something else i mean

2593
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,440
it just creates a whole new

2594
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:48,960
kind of a flavor profile so

2595
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:50,638
man i don't know what it is but like i

2596
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,880
said these these orange drains whatever

2597
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,480
they are they they all they all seem

2598
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,560
like they have a place

2599
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:58,479
and uh what we want to have you know and

2600
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,719
what we want to smoke on

2601
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,399
yeah definitely and just another point

2602
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,560
you quickly mentioned and i want to kind

2603
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,960
of delve into this a little deeper is

2604
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,600
you said when you for example you show a

2605
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,840
girl who doesn't smoke much this uh this

2606
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,679
orange smelling weed and they get amazed

2607
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,279
certainly experienced that myself where

2608
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,639
people are just blown away by and i

2609
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:18,399
thought a little more about it and kind

2610
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,920
of what i was thinking is

2611
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:21,599
i think that it happens with more than

2612
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,440
just the tangy because there's been a

2613
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,520
few strains where you know maybe it

2614
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:27,759
smells like bang on

2615
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,560
blueberry or bang on a mango you know

2616
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,800
really accurate like not around but like

2617
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,719
perfectly smells like that

2618
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,400
i think that um i think that there's

2619
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,920
something that goes on in the mind where

2620
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:39,599
it's kind of like

2621
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,600
you get wowed by the fact that you're

2622
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,039
looking at something but it smells like

2623
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,039
something else and there's like this

2624
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:46,800
miscomputing kind of factor there

2625
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:48,639
because you know that like it shouldn't

2626
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,800
smell the way it does

2627
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:53,600
um with that in mind do you think that

2628
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,920
it's kind of like a worthwhile endeavor

2629
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,360
to breed for that specific thing or do

2630
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,039
you think that it's just like no it's

2631
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:01,039
not really worth pursuing in that regard

2632
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:05,599
i think that back in the day there was a

2633
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,480
lot more premise with the whole you know

2634
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,560
i mean the

2635
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,879
names were given names because of why

2636
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,400
they smelt like for instance blueberry

2637
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,400
is called blueberry and we named it it

2638
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,238
was named that because of how closely it

2639
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:18,799
resembles either the real blue like a

2640
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:20,879
blueberry muffin or artificial blueberry

2641
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,880
candy whatever you know i mean and that

2642
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,639
that i'm not sure that we're steering

2643
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,480
away from that because like for instance

2644
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,440
citrus farmer it's the name implies you

2645
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:30,000
know you're growing something with

2646
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:31,359
citrus but sometimes people

2647
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,760
i don't think we're necessarily sitting

2648
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,279
around and waiting until the very end

2649
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,480
and you know i mean we're testing we

2650
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:38,000
throw all this wheat out on the table we

2651
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:39,599
start rolling stuff up like oh man this

2652
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,359
one smells like mangoes okay then we're

2653
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,039
gonna call it mango this now like i feel

2654
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:44,238
like nowadays we're doing things a

2655
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:45,920
little bit different and just trying to

2656
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:47,279
be the first to come up with this

2657
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,800
creative name before someone else can

2658
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,559
steal it because with all the breeders

2659
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,880
and everyone making stuff now it's

2660
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,560
almost hard to be original like

2661
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,760
it took me three times recently to come

2662
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,880
up with a strain because every time i

2663
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,320
named it and thought i'd come up with

2664
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,679
something awesome here we are with

2665
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:00,559
someone else who'd already named it that

2666
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,079
so

2667
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,120
you kind of have to be really creative

2668
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:04,719
and just kind of come up with something

2669
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,559
to make sense but doesn't necessarily

2670
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:09,119
resemble what you're going to get in the

2671
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,039
end product tropicana cookies that one

2672
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,880
obviously you you like you said man this

2673
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,198
smells like chop it's like a tropical

2674
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,920
cookie or the citrus with the it's spot

2675
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:20,719
on so that's that would go under the uh

2676
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,319
uh perfectly named category whereas

2677
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,800
some of the stuff i've released you know

2678
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:27,679
i have palpatine like so it smells like

2679
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,800
an old man and a cloak on a on a ship

2680
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,319
no

2681
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,320
it it's just named that because it was

2682
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:34,238
it was just a play on words with with

2683
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:36,479
the with the lineage so i mean there's

2684
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:39,919
there's definitely names that that that

2685
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:42,238
reflect end results or end and uh smells

2686
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,600
and i think that's something that i i i

2687
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:45,439
feel

2688
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,159
should be paid a little bit more

2689
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:50,399
attention to um some woman told me the

2690
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:53,039
brandywine that i presented to her she

2691
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:56,399
says i'm a chef i don't smoke pot this

2692
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:59,279
smells to me exactly like fresh it was

2693
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:01,519
either mango or some sort of fruit and i

2694
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,840
i had never thought of it that way i was

2695
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,880
stuck on that well it's got kind of a

2696
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,960
fresh floral dank smell and she's like

2697
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:12,480
no it smells like mangoes i'm like oh

2698
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:14,880
okay so i mean it's everyone's got their

2699
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,959
own opinion i think that some

2700
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,199
sometimes i almost feel like having a

2701
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,039
blind taste test panel and someone like

2702
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:22,559
where where people that don't smoke you

2703
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:24,158
put all your weed in front of them and

2704
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,480
let them decide hey what does this smell

2705
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:27,679
like because you get a completely

2706
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:29,919
different

2707
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,800
uh feedback and a completely different

2708
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,639
uh

2709
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,639
result than what you were looking for i

2710
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,239
mean i i've done it already with people

2711
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:38,719
that don't smoke and it's hilarious what

2712
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,238
they say compared to someone who's who's

2713
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,840
who just gives you the average answer oh

2714
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:43,759
it smells dank bro or that smells like

2715
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,279
weed or you know it smells like this or

2716
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,560
skunky or whatever no like you start

2717
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,800
hearing things that you never would have

2718
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,639
thought of so i feel like when it comes

2719
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,320
to breeding that might be something that

2720
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,239
we all might want to get back into is

2721
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,399
trying to get closer to what does it

2722
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:58,000
actually really smell or taste like but

2723
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:59,279
that'll that we there's only so many

2724
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,560
things we can name it like then we'd

2725
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,599
already already passed like all the

2726
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,639
existing fruits and and and vegetables

2727
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,600
and

2728
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:07,039
everything

2729
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,800
so i don't even know how it would be

2730
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:10,319
original with that but we'll figure out

2731
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,239
one way or another

2732
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:14,880
will you raise a really valid point

2733
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,799
about being original with names and it's

2734
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,159
getting to the point where it's it's

2735
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,679
crazy as you said you know you had to go

2736
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:22,399
back to the drawing board three times

2737
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,399
and we even see some people admittedly

2738
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:26,960
not common or from the biggest breeders

2739
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:28,879
but you see some some breeders will put

2740
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,480
up a list of names before they've even

2741
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,719
made the crosses they're like all right

2742
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:35,198
reserving these ones now you know what i

2743
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,439
mean i've been i've done it myself yeah

2744
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:38,960
like i mean it's kind of like cutthroat

2745
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:40,399
like you got to get in there quick what

2746
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,000
do you think will be the end solution

2747
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,759
because eventually you know like we're

2748
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,920
going to be doing

2749
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,520
rolling over dog next to puddle you know

2750
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,760
just like ridiculous stuff that hasn't

2751
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,080
been taken like

2752
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,159
dude i don't know man it's to me it's

2753
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:57,039
it's kind of a it goes back to the

2754
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:58,559
respect thing for instance i put i put

2755
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,560
up something recently it said arctic

2756
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,080
grape i thought i was original i looked

2757
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,600
it up i couldn't find it anywhere well

2758
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:05,119
turns out red eye genetics has already

2759
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,480
had this strain not only do they have it

2760
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:08,319
it's already flowered out and they're

2761
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:09,919
done whereas i'm just starting to test

2762
01:31:08,319 --> 01:31:12,158
and just getting done with my first test

2763
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,679
of it so for me i'm like well they've

2764
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:15,119
got it they're ready to release who am i

2765
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,560
to step in front of them and say no i'm

2766
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,079
keeping that name it's kind of like well

2767
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,760
you guys got it you're ready to go have

2768
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:21,119
fun with it so

2769
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,199
that's kind of how it is and i think

2770
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,719
that having strains that have the same

2771
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:25,919
name as someone else that's that's a

2772
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,920
shot in the foot that's not going to

2773
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,600
help you it's not going to help me some

2774
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,119
someone walks into a club or starts

2775
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,480
buying seeds or telling you what their

2776
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:34,158
favorite strain is and they're like oh i

2777
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:36,158
really like this like well which one

2778
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:37,519
from do you like that one from these

2779
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:39,679
guys or do you like it from those guys

2780
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,520
better and it's like is it is it really

2781
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:43,359
hurting anybody i'm not sure but i think

2782
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,239
i just make a lot more sense and be a

2783
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:48,319
lot easier on all of us if we just had

2784
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:49,439
one one person who's known for their

2785
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:51,359
strain like

2786
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,559
i'm not gonna like you're not gonna come

2787
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,639
another person's not gonna come out with

2788
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,159
docido tomorrow not only would you

2789
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,520
create so much of a headache to yourself

2790
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:58,960
by trying to do that but it's just like

2791
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,320
why would you name it something that's

2792
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,000
already become famous with someone else

2793
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:04,399
you know i mean just it just it's kind

2794
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,639
of like it's just pointless so i think

2795
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:08,638
yeah we really should focus on trying to

2796
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,520
you know be original but also just when

2797
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,279
it comes down to just it it's whoever's

2798
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,199
quick the quickest or the most creative

2799
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:16,960
person wins whoever was first to uh put

2800
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:17,759
it out there and and yeah i don't know i

2801
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,158
guess

2802
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,159
naming strains before it's even done is

2803
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:23,920
that is that good or not i don't know

2804
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,279
because if you wait till the end before

2805
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,960
it's you know when it's done then you

2806
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:28,158
name it then that name could be taken

2807
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,359
and you're stuck trying to figure out a

2808
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,679
name when you got something that's ready

2809
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:34,559
to release and it becomes uh pain in the

2810
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,639
ass for marketing and and trying to get

2811
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,080
stuff into production

2812
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,279
yeah totally

2813
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:41,439
so

2814
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:42,880
uh people may not be aware but we've

2815
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,479
been we've been talking about doing this

2816
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,239
one for a while i gotta ask this

2817
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,399
question because i started writing these

2818
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,759
questions a long time ago and this one's

2819
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:52,000
been on the list it was like the very

2820
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,400
first one i wrote and it's it's a little

2821
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,399
out there but we're gonna do it um

2822
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:58,638
a little birdie told me that back when

2823
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:00,719
you were working at gdp you know so this

2824
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:02,719
is nothing about you obviously that bay

2825
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,960
11 won an award

2826
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,719
someone told me that what got entered in

2827
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,560
the cup wasn't actually bay 11 it was

2828
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:12,960
actually appalachia which is one of the

2829
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,960
parents of bay 11. is that true

2830
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,800
get ready for get ready for the spilt

2831
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,079
milk uh there there was

2832
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,600
multiple

2833
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,039
things that happened while working under

2834
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,960
grand and i'm not trying to throw anyone

2835
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:27,039
under the bus or talk any [Â __Â ] but let's

2836
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,198
let's keep it real here facts are facts

2837
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:31,679
and i'm a very factual person i don't

2838
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:33,198
like liars i don't like taking claims

2839
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,359
for things that are not true and i sure

2840
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,678
as hell like misrepresenting strange

2841
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:40,238
when it comes to awards i feel like all

2842
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:42,319
that stuff goes into karma and and if

2843
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:44,799
you're if you think that by

2844
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,399
lying about your your plants and lying

2845
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,320
about what you're entering just to win a

2846
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:50,960
cup is going to help you in the long run

2847
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:51,759
well where's granddaddy now

2848
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,439
so

2849
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:57,440
there's your answer but what happened

2850
01:33:53,439 --> 01:34:00,960
was bay 11 apparently bay 11 plant was

2851
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:05,678
uh aka appalachia it was stolen from

2852
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:07,600
bodhi from a an ex-garden worker or some

2853
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,480
guy that had access to bodhi's plants at

2854
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,800
his at his facility he supposedly took

2855
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:16,238
this plant and brought it to ken and

2856
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:18,800
then they changed the name to bay 11 bay

2857
01:34:16,238 --> 01:34:20,479
was their head growers name and he you

2858
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,400
know he got credit for that one and

2859
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,799
called it bay 11. i'm not sure why i

2860
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:25,920
mean it sounds cool i guess but i i

2861
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,800
don't know much more than that other

2862
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,480
than the fact that yeah it was uh

2863
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,520
it was straight up appalachia entered

2864
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:35,279
his bay 11 and then

2865
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,400
just like back in the day what the way

2866
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:38,079
you do it

2867
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,359
you market these strains you enter the

2868
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,079
cup and then guess what happens right

2869
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:43,920
after the cup you release the seeds well

2870
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:45,198
it's kind of hard to release

2871
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,118
you know what you just entered in the

2872
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:49,198
cup when you got the what into the cup

2873
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:51,679
was a clone only so they crossed

2874
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:54,399
everything with their male gdp or

2875
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,560
whatever they had and then bay 11 seeds

2876
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:58,158
were were born so really in all reality

2877
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,280
anyone who bought bay 11 was more than

2878
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:02,879
likely buying appalachia times

2879
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,599
uh gdp

2880
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,520
or

2881
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,679
gdp bag seed at that excuse me because

2882
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,360
it's not even pure gdp pure gdp is a

2883
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:11,199
clone only as well so

2884
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:12,960
it kind of it's kind of a mess and then

2885
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:15,599
to go to get further more into that

2886
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,359
let's let's let's go into the uh let's

2887
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:20,079
go into the very next cup after that the

2888
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:22,158
very next cup was uh was one why was

2889
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:23,519
there we won third place for ken's

2890
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:27,279
phantom

2891
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:30,159
ken's phantom is uh our beloved pink

2892
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:33,359
champagne so pink champagne was gifted

2893
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:36,399
to a granite perp collective in 2011 or

2894
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:38,719
2012 whatever it was and it was then

2895
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:40,879
grown out and that was entered into

2896
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:41,840
norcal cup san francisco or wherever it

2897
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,079
was

2898
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,000
i believe was 2012 and it was entered as

2899
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:48,000
ken's phantom it was straight up pink

2900
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,920
champagne again another strain gifted to

2901
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,840
their collective and then turned into

2902
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,440
something else they won with it that

2903
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,960
time and then sure enough right after

2904
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:59,118
that seeds are then released and it's uh

2905
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,560
it's it's the lineage on the pack said

2906
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:03,359
uh

2907
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,119
cherry pie times gdp and still to this

2908
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:07,519
day i get messages or someone's like hey

2909
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:09,759
so i know that the phantom uh or ken's

2910
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,000
phantom kush or whatever no not phantom

2911
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,239
kush the phantom cookies or

2912
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,520
whatever it was i'm i get confused now

2913
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:17,198
because there's so much nonsense that's

2914
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,000
associated with it but one way or

2915
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:21,678
another it was it was not pure

2916
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,760
uh pink champagne it was not the same

2917
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,840
thing entered as the cup which then

2918
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,520
leads me to my next

2919
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:31,520
uh bit of uh spilt milk was the uh

2920
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,880
their candyland entry

2921
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:38,560
they won first place for candyland that

2922
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:40,880
again was either animal cookies or

2923
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,360
forum cut or platinum cookies whatever

2924
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,840
cut that came through their collective

2925
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:49,279
was turned in as candy land when in all

2926
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,719
reality it was just pure cookies

2927
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,679
oh man

2928
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:55,279
my pack of candy lands bogus

2929
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,199
no it's not don't think that way it's

2930
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:58,238
still good i promise you the seeds that

2931
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:00,479
were made

2932
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:02,000
were where cookies crossed to gdp i mean

2933
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:04,559
there was some really good finds out of

2934
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,560
there but but

2935
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,800
no i like that that's some good good

2936
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,639
spilled milk um

2937
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,719
yeah very interesting

2938
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,719
yeah see hind lonesome was another guy

2939
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:16,880
off the forums and he kind of got into

2940
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,880
me when i cuz i was i was granted a purp

2941
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,560
rep i was that was the guy behind the

2942
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,760
behind the company online so everyone

2943
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,360
was like yo

2944
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,880
that's some [Â __Â ] i'm like i agree

2945
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,319
with you but what can i do about it i'm

2946
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,400
just the spokesperson i'm not the

2947
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:30,000
breeder i'm not the guy that made it i'm

2948
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:33,359
not the one turning stuff in i'm not the

2949
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,198
one making these horrible decisions so

2950
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:36,639
it was uh it was kind of a pain in the

2951
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:38,238
ass because i'm sitting there being

2952
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:40,159
being the poster child for granddaddy

2953
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:42,399
and i had to take all the heat all the

2954
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:43,519
time that's what got old too because

2955
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,439
there's nothing worse than getting

2956
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,560
yelled at for something you didn't do

2957
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:50,638
yeah totally man i feel feel oh well

2958
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,360
good to be out of those days

2959
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,359
yes very much so

2960
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:58,238
so something the fans always came to

2961
01:37:55,359 --> 01:38:00,000
hear about we are you know pretty big on

2962
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:01,519
organic growers on the show probably

2963
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,118
partly because that's what i am but i

2964
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,040
don't think that's what you are but you

2965
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:06,479
know to rule the question out are you

2966
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:09,039
organic or synthetics what's your

2967
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:11,118
preferred style of growing

2968
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:13,600
currently um and what i have been doing

2969
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:16,399
for the past shoot i mean for years now

2970
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:19,119
has been i'm a cocoa grower i prefer

2971
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:21,279
pure cocoa core no no additives nothing

2972
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:24,000
just straight pure cocoa core usually

2973
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:25,840
it's house and garden um cocoa sometimes

2974
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,158
it's just whatever's available but you

2975
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,840
got to watch the salts the salt build up

2976
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:31,599
in that cocoa sometimes is really really

2977
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,360
bad and you end up going into it just

2978
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,719
looks like straight lockout for weeks

2979
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:36,799
until you get it flushed out and i don't

2980
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,560
i don't really like that so i tend to go

2981
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,360
with a little bit higher end cocoa and

2982
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,520
then

2983
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,799
from there i use mils nutrients i have a

2984
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:46,159
couple additives i've been playing with

2985
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:47,840
but for the most part elite elite 91

2986
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:50,559
for roots and stuff like that and then

2987
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,239
um my meals and mills does have some

2988
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,960
organic stuff in it but for the most

2989
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:57,439
part it's it's a synthetic nutrient

2990
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,639
cool and like how do you feel about this

2991
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,158
one because

2992
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,639
i've always had this interesting

2993
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:05,118
perspective where i've never had anyone

2994
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,039
give me like really really really good

2995
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:08,479
synthetic stuff obviously i'm in

2996
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:10,560
australia so you know a bit of a

2997
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:12,238
different game so to speak do you feel

2998
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,920
the same like how do you feel about that

2999
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,718
do you just think it's not not really

3000
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,639
much of a difference to you

3001
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:21,439
to really it

3002
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:25,600
it comes down to i love weed so if

3003
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:26,960
someone presents me something hydro dirt

3004
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,480
i mean i don't care what you're growing

3005
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,239
if you know how to grow and you do a

3006
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:31,439
good job and you bring me something that

3007
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:33,279
i don't i don't have to completely

3008
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:34,638
destroy the bud to get the smell out of

3009
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:36,399
it um

3010
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,279
i can obviously look at it and tell that

3011
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:39,679
it was

3012
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:41,679
grown with love you trimmed it up nicely

3013
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,679
you didn't bring me wet weed i mean

3014
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:46,079
there's there's there's so much that

3015
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:48,399
goes into it but i mean organic i had

3016
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,319
some of my some of the best tasting pot

3017
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,559
has been organically grown i mentioned

3018
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:54,559
captain [Â __Â ] earlier i tried some of his

3019
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,560
blueberry and some of his uh he had a

3020
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,639
strength called super fruit back in the

3021
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,000
day and i it's extinct now as far as i

3022
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:02,800
don't think anyone's got superfruit

3023
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,760
anymore but that was one of the tastiest

3024
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,600
like i cannot describe how good that

3025
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,880
plant was and it's i don't know where

3026
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,719
it's at anymore if it's gone or whatever

3027
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,400
but again i believe i believe everything

3028
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:14,560
he grew was organic

3029
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:16,000
there was there was a few other

3030
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,880
gentlemen that brought me examples and

3031
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,760
again

3032
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,359
organic was was absolutely killer but

3033
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,560
just because you grow organic doesn't

3034
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:24,238
mean you're going to have good taste in

3035
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,440
weed like if you don't know what you're

3036
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:27,118
doing you don't know how to play or

3037
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:28,799
build that soil and get that stuff out

3038
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:31,198
of there and and make sure it doesn't

3039
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,239
show up in the end then

3040
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:33,839
you know i mean you're going to have

3041
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:35,118
you're going to have some harsh tasting

3042
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,520
you know stuff that's not that great

3043
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:39,118
anyway so i think depending on who who's

3044
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,800
grown it and if they have their if

3045
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:42,639
they've got theirs their system dialed

3046
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,079
in then i truly

3047
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,159
i i don't really have a preference

3048
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,679
honestly i just i love smoking weed so

3049
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:49,839
if it's got good flavor and it's got

3050
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,520
some good smell then sometimes even when

3051
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,279
plants don't have the best flavor and i

3052
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,360
can tell it either wasn't flushed

3053
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,519
necessary correctly or not but it's got

3054
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:59,118
an extremely good smell i end up smoking

3055
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,040
anyway because i just i can't get over

3056
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,880
that that smell

3057
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:03,840
yeah no i i totally agree with you on

3058
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,440
that one

3059
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,639
so one thing i just want to quickly ask

3060
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:09,519
because you brought it to my mind when

3061
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:11,920
you mentioned um captain crip's name

3062
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,360
another name that phantom or pink

3063
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,118
champagne sorry i should stop saying

3064
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:17,439
phantom pink champagne

3065
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:18,479
that it goes by is kryptonite have you

3066
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,000
heard that and do you know where it

3067
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:22,479
maybe comes from

3068
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,719
i did yes i don't i don't know who gave

3069
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:25,759
it that name or what but like

3070
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,760
that

3071
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,920
and this is this goes along early like

3072
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,760
so we all have the same strain

3073
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,199
but for some reason some guy was like

3074
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,239
you know what i'm growing pink champagne

3075
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:35,359
but

3076
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:37,198
you know what i think i like the name

3077
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:40,238
kryptonite better or i think i like the

3078
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:42,559
name uh raspberry kush or there's or

3079
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,718
there's another one it's called wow and

3080
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,320
i can see wow being a better name for it

3081
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:48,239
because every time i've ever grown it i

3082
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:50,000
say wow so

3083
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:51,759
it's it's like you smell the bag and i

3084
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,359
can just see a bud to there going wow

3085
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,880
what is that and that can that that

3086
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:57,679
would make more sense but some of these

3087
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:00,159
other strains just just to throw another

3088
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,840
name on top of it makes no sense like i

3089
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:03,118
feel like there's there's there's been a

3090
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,159
lot of that it doesn't really help

3091
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:08,399
anything so i'm not sure who decided to

3092
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:10,399
dub it kryptonite or maybe they didn't

3093
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,000
but i know that the guys out of florida

3094
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:14,799
have been calling things kryptonite or

3095
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,319
[Â __Â ] crippy or crypto for a long time so

3096
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,840
not to confuse it out of florida or

3097
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:19,679
confuse it with an og kush or the

3098
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:22,239
triangle or anything any other story

3099
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:24,639
like that but

3100
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:26,319
it was i went into a seattle club once

3101
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,239
and they had it as kryptonite and i said

3102
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:29,439
man that's that's pink champagne i breed

3103
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:30,718
with that strain i know that there's

3104
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:32,719
there's like i said earlier there's only

3105
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,639
one strain i've come across that smells

3106
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:36,239
like this and it's always pink champagne

3107
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,880
so what's up and they told me that oh

3108
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:41,118
yeah it is it's from the bay area uh not

3109
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,719
sure where they got that name though so

3110
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,599
yeah interesting just one of those ones

3111
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,480
that got attached maybe

3112
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,320
okay

3113
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:49,919
so a point you made earlier on in the

3114
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:51,759
nice side track just but you know i'm

3115
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,000
taking us back it's all good

3116
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,600
you kind of liked and you said you like

3117
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,679
the idea of sticking within your own

3118
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:00,639
lines this is a concept i like to

3119
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:02,960
explore because not only is it kind of

3120
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,880
good for picking males but i don't think

3121
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,560
enough people really delve into their

3122
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,960
own females when they're making

3123
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:12,000
selections is this a conscious decision

3124
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,118
for you or it just worked out that way

3125
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,719
now

3126
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:16,399
if i understand are you asking like how

3127
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,439
am i how i'm feeling now by using within

3128
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:19,920
my lines

3129
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:21,839
yeah and like do you consciously like to

3130
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,760
say like let me put it this way a lot of

3131
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,679
breeders they'll use like a list of

3132
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,159
clone onlys that they breed with and

3133
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:30,239
it's like a new mail to that list and

3134
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:32,079
they never incorporate females that

3135
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,759
they've just created whereas you will

3136
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:34,960
you know this round i've got to keep a

3137
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,960
brandy

3138
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,880
wine female and i've got to keep a hot

3139
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,118
rod and so i'm going to cross the purple

3140
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,440
vapors to them you get what i mean

3141
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:46,479
yes absolutely so so

3142
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:49,039
basically i think that

3143
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,799
rather than always creating new f1s

3144
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:52,079
which people do want people want to see

3145
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,679
the new stuff they want to see the new

3146
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:55,198
hype strains crossed to something you've

3147
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:56,880
made that's all good there's definitely

3148
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,198
a place for that but i think what needs

3149
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,800
to happen also is for you to show enough

3150
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:02,879
confidence in what you've created to

3151
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,800
know that look this one was awesome this

3152
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,079
this plant is the [Â __Â ] and it was

3153
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,520
crossed to this one which is another one

3154
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:09,920
of my creations and look what happened

3155
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,520
it now created something even better um

3156
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,359
someone who's really doing this a lot

3157
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,080
lately i can i can see it's working out

3158
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:18,719
quite well for him is uh exotic exotic

3159
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,639
genetics has he has put his strains out

3160
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,000
there to a point where enough people

3161
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,440
know them cookies and cream that's a

3162
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,840
household name with everybody and not

3163
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:28,000
just because of the ice cream uh there's

3164
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,679
there's people growing his

3165
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,520
tons of historians and now you see

3166
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:33,199
crosses of those strains with this one

3167
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,840
and that one and the and they're

3168
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,198
absolutely killer there's there's

3169
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,480
if you look up the lineage though you

3170
01:44:37,198 --> 01:44:41,198
can clearly see okay this one's got

3171
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:43,359
sherbet this one's got thin mint but

3172
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:45,678
in all in all reality what you're

3173
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:47,759
staring at is still his creations he has

3174
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,279
then created there's two strains he made

3175
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,320
put together and it creates something

3176
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,800
even better

3177
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:53,759
that's awesome but again some people who

3178
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,679
aren't

3179
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,119
you know the most educated or people

3180
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,480
that don't maybe they don't know mike

3181
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:00,000
they might not know what this one is

3182
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:01,599
crossing that one they're looking for oh

3183
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,359
i want the girl scout cookie cross to

3184
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:05,039
that one little they know girl scouts in

3185
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,359
both plants but they just don't see that

3186
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:09,679
name so they don't want to buy it

3187
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:11,679
so there to me i think there needs to be

3188
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:14,000
a little bit of a balance of having

3189
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:16,399
having the wedding cakes and and the and

3190
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,719
the the royal kush the the the clone

3191
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:20,238
only that everyone's wanting

3192
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:22,319
crossed with stuff that's new and

3193
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:25,279
exciting to make a new strain and then

3194
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:26,960
also showing people that hey i

3195
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:28,479
i'm working my own strains i'm not just

3196
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,760
always throwing out new stuff i'm back

3197
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:32,079
crossing

3198
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,400
i'm furthering the filial generation by

3199
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:36,319
taking them to f2 f3 f4 that's where i

3200
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,399
want to head i want to get some of my

3201
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:40,319
most you know my best my favorites the

3202
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:41,920
ones that people have bought out and

3203
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:43,840
that are sold out and have been sold out

3204
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,840
and i keep getting requests for those

3205
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:49,840
ones will be first to be created again

3206
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,119
into f2 f3 and further or uh re-bred to

3207
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,119
you know even just bring them out again

3208
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:55,118
so people have access to the beans but

3209
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:57,118
definitely want to have a little bit of

3210
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:58,639
both and then again like we said earlier

3211
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:00,559
something with maybe some seminars down

3212
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:03,118
the line i want to have a complete menu

3213
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,199
but one thing i'll say about my stuff is

3214
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:08,000
i haven't released 100 strains i don't

3215
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:09,519
release huge lines at one time i i've

3216
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,118
released a total of

3217
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,480
you know i want to say like under 20

3218
01:46:11,118 --> 01:46:15,359
strains in the four years i've been

3219
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,959
going um i don't i'm i mean and not to

3220
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:18,960
say that i'm better than anyone by any

3221
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,118
means that could also just mean i'm way

3222
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,880
too slow for people but in my opinion

3223
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:24,799
it's given me enough time to represent

3224
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,800
what i've got and giving people enough

3225
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,800
time to where they can have

3226
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,560
a chance to grow every one of my strains

3227
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,560
before i've dropped another 50 on them

3228
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,760
you know so that's kind of where that's

3229
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,600
kind of where i'm heading i want to make

3230
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,679
it to where there's enough strains that

3231
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,960
that people are interested in but also

3232
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,118
there's stuff there that makes me

3233
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,198
relevant and and we can still get stuff

3234
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:44,719
that's uh you know exciting and new to

3235
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,198
people

3236
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:48,719
yeah an approach i certainly can see the

3237
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:50,559
value in

3238
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:52,560
you banged you actually banged it on the

3239
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,920
head when you when you said oh you know

3240
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,600
one person who's having success with

3241
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:57,279
this and i'm like exotic genetics exotic

3242
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,960
genetics

3243
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:00,079
so i'm gonna give you a bit of a test

3244
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,158
now

3245
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:04,000
i think that there's a little bit of an

3246
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:05,439
issue in the scene and it's i'm not the

3247
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,118
one bringing this up so i'm certainly

3248
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:08,238
not taking credit nor am i the first to

3249
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:10,399
talk about it but i think there's a bit

3250
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:12,399
of an issue within the scene of some of

3251
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:13,839
the breeders certainly not yourself who

3252
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:15,599
use like

3253
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,279
just the same females you know the same

3254
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,039
clone onlys and so

3255
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:21,279
everyone's got a cross of this

3256
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:22,960
everyone's got a cross of that

3257
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,118
how do you feel about that do you do you

3258
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,800
see that problem yourself and in my mind

3259
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:28,799
here's the test you know in my mind i'm

3260
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,239
thinking of one specific clone only that

3261
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,840
everyone's just breeding with at the

3262
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:33,039
moment

3263
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,239
i want to know i want to know if you can

3264
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:36,238
guess it

3265
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:38,319
so if we're talking about purple punch

3266
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:40,000
then uh

3267
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:42,158
is that what we're talking about

3268
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,600
oh no you know what that wasn't but it

3269
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:45,279
perfectly fits the category i'll give

3270
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,920
you one more guess it's not purple punch

3271
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:51,479
oh man so if it's not punched then god

3272
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,480
what do um

3273
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:55,920
what is it well i don't know i'm gonna

3274
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,199
i'm i don't i'd have to think i'm sure i

3275
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,118
know but it's just it's not coming to my

3276
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,879
mind right a second i've got to give you

3277
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:02,399
consolation prize because purple punch

3278
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:05,679
fits the description so bloody

3279
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:08,638
brilliantly but and and again you know

3280
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:11,359
i'm not having to go gmo

3281
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:13,199
oh yeah okay there we go yes so and and

3282
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:14,479
that's you know what is so funny about

3283
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:18,399
gmo

3284
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:21,599
no hardly anybody gives any credit to

3285
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:24,879
to the creator the breeder is mamiko

3286
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,719
seeds or mamiko or how he pronounced it

3287
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,760
and i've heard a couple things here and

3288
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,000
there and i'm not going to get into that

3289
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:32,400
story but what i do know is if you are

3290
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,679
the man who made those seeds and those

3291
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:35,759
seeds then

3292
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:38,560
were you know someone found something

3293
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,159
gmo as it's dubbed from those seeds that

3294
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,840
breeder should still be getting as much

3295
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,960
credit as the guy that found that clone

3296
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,800
only now skunk master i'm sure he has

3297
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,198
and he's given out you know plenty of

3298
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,000
yeah of praise to mamiko and these other

3299
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:51,279
people

3300
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,479
that could have been involved but i

3301
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:54,158
think he

3302
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:56,718
is killing it he's got some good things

3303
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:58,559
going on that guy's taking stuff to

3304
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,639
another level with his breeding so good

3305
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,679
for him and i think that he really did

3306
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,719
put a put the the name to gmo so just

3307
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:06,000
like

3308
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:07,840
girl scout cookies and some of these

3309
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
other ones that have been highly bred

3310
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,800
with uh

3311
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,960
everyone's jumping on jumping on the um

3312
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,480
the gmo bandwagon but there's so many

3313
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,480
people that love it i mean it's it's a

3314
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,399
great strain it's got it's got some

3315
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:23,359
power it's got some stank that just is

3316
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:25,279
unmatched and it really is uh it's it's

3317
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:26,799
it's a decent plant so i get why a lot

3318
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:28,800
of people breeding with it but at the

3319
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,719
same time what's kind of cool is even

3320
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,719
though there could be 20 20 different

3321
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:35,039
breeders out there that have a gorilla

3322
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:36,719
glue a purple punch a gmo cross a girl

3323
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:39,519
scout we all may have it but what we

3324
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:41,760
don't have and what sets us all apart

3325
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,520
is that male selection so that's what's

3326
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,880
going to give you the different effects

3327
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,880
because even though we've all got a gmo

3328
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,440
you might end up with some gmo dominance

3329
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,359
in each one of those crosses but

3330
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:52,960
what you're also going to get is the mix

3331
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:55,118
of flavors that you might not have

3332
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,800
expected and what really could end up

3333
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:58,639
bringing some cool things to the table

3334
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,119
so everyone's got their own their own

3335
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,279
cross and we all get credit for it but

3336
01:50:01,118 --> 01:50:05,519
yeah gmo is that one's definitely making

3337
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:07,198
its waves now

3338
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,080
yeah for sure

3339
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:09,279
so

3340
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:11,198
this is going to be a bit of a weird

3341
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:13,198
question but i'm kind of interested in

3342
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:15,279
discontinued strains

3343
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:16,960
some breeders out there do it because

3344
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:18,719
maybe they've just lost interest in

3345
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,079
selling the strain maybe it didn't sell

3346
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,920
that well you know there's a whole

3347
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,079
variety of reasons most of the time i

3348
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,279
always find it's not the obvious reason

3349
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:26,880
which is like

3350
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:29,679
there was maybe some issues with the

3351
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:32,319
strain or something like that um

3352
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:33,840
anyway what type of things do you think

3353
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:35,599
about if you were to consider

3354
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,960
discontinuing australian like do you

3355
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,800
just think like oh if it just didn't

3356
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,319
really impress me that much and it

3357
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,920
didn't make much of a splash i'd

3358
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:44,960
probably discontinue it like how does

3359
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:46,319
that thought process go for you

3360
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:49,039
that's i mean you pretty much just

3361
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:51,279
mentioned i just said it like i think

3362
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:54,000
so my original grandpa's breathline

3363
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:57,920
there was there was i think there's

3364
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,359
10 or 11 that i released um

3365
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,118
lost soul

3366
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:04,000
swamp thing

3367
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:06,960
purple vapor east uh jersey mike

3368
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,679
the ones that had the popular

3369
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:12,239
mothers you know the ogs the gdp the the

3370
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:13,760
east coast diesel those ones uh and then

3371
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:15,759
my hot rod the hot rod had the motor

3372
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,199
breath in it anything that's got the

3373
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,079
real popular

3374
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:22,158
um you know gassy female it seems like

3375
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:23,279
it went the quickest but at the same

3376
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:25,279
time some of these other ones like

3377
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:27,439
palpatine it's got the death star in it

3378
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:29,359
and so that leads me to believe

3379
01:51:27,439 --> 01:51:31,439
is there something with the name that

3380
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,039
makes it not sell very good is it

3381
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:34,879
something with

3382
01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:36,319
you know what what exactly is it going

3383
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,639
on where because i don't see as many

3384
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:40,000
people growing it it's so it sells great

3385
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:42,079
people have bought a ton of the seeds

3386
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,560
but it's very few and far between that

3387
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:46,079
i'm posting a palpatine picture compared

3388
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,480
to a brandywine or some of these other

3389
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:50,238
ones have really made a big splash so

3390
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:51,839
that's where i got to ask myself

3391
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:53,678
is this something that i want to

3392
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:55,760
continue to bring out and then maybe

3393
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:57,679
make another you know f2s of it or even

3394
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,400
further on and then offering to people

3395
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:02,719
if it hasn't really done that well in

3396
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:05,118
first place i don't know i think i need

3397
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,480
to do like a feedback like a like a poll

3398
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:07,759
and see what people think because at

3399
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:10,158
this point

3400
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,800
like you mentioned i'm gonna be judging

3401
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:15,598
you know what what to continue based on

3402
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:17,119
popularity that's it like if it's sold

3403
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:18,639
out and i g and the ones i'm getting

3404
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:20,880
messages about all the time swamp thing

3405
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,920
lost soul purple vapor those ones were

3406
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,520
great

3407
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:26,000
i know that and then ones that haven't

3408
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,000
even sold out yet brandywine and

3409
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,319
actually grandpa's breath finally the

3410
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,079
original f2 not the different versions

3411
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:34,880
but the original f2 is finally all the

3412
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:36,238
way gone um and and i'll be making f3s

3413
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,079
of that soon and then and then that's

3414
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:39,678
going to create a whole new thing but

3415
01:52:38,079 --> 01:52:41,359
that one in general

3416
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:42,560
will always be held dear to my heart

3417
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:44,319
because it's what started the company

3418
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,320
but some of these other ones i just feel

3419
01:52:44,319 --> 01:52:47,519
like they'll kind of fall off because

3420
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:49,198
they either

3421
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,440
yeah they either weren't as popular or i

3422
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:53,039
just didn't see like every show i'm at

3423
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:56,479
like i mentioned i get people coming by

3424
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:58,079
with with samples some sometimes

3425
01:52:56,479 --> 01:52:59,519
if i just never get brought in a sample

3426
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:01,118
i'm like that just again tells me that

3427
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,040
no one's growing this strain or it just

3428
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:04,479
it wasn't that great so that's another

3429
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:06,000
reason why i guess i would just ditch

3430
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:07,359
something is if it just never showed up

3431
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,880
and i don't see anyone with it then

3432
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:10,639
obviously it didn't it wasn't that

3433
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,560
special

3434
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:14,639
yeah totally

3435
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,239
so just a quick little side note on the

3436
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:18,480
topic of special

3437
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:20,479
how's your little special seedling vial

3438
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:23,759
going

3439
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:25,919
oh the vial shoot man yeah i i have to

3440
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,599
talk to my buddy i i'm not sure that was

3441
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,359
all a joke man i mean it wasn't ever

3442
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,039
meant to be something that was going to

3443
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:33,519
be going or like it was it'll be a joke

3444
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:35,519
and then there was so much um a lot of

3445
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,560
stuff got brought into that like i don't

3446
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,199
know if you're

3447
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:42,000
well well aware but there's been

3448
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:43,519
i seem to attract a certain amount of uh

3449
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,880
i don't want to say negativity because

3450
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:47,199
that's kind of a bad look but i mean

3451
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,840
there's sometimes my posts can get a

3452
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:51,519
little bit crazy as far as what's said

3453
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:53,440
in them and what's going on and

3454
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,560
something as simple as me showing off a

3455
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:56,158
vial

3456
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,480
with a seat in it and saying look what

3457
01:53:56,158 --> 01:54:01,598
happened this popped in the in the uh in

3458
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:04,079
the washer i wasn't in by any means i

3459
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:06,639
was not trying to diss anybody or saying

3460
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:09,039
look we can pop my seeds in a in a in in

3461
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:11,440
a washing machine you can't get them to

3462
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:13,359
pop you you suck there was no there was

3463
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:15,598
no negativity attached i wasn't trying

3464
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:17,039
to bash anybody but for some reason some

3465
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:19,039
people decide to take it that way and

3466
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,399
say oh okay so you just here you are

3467
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:22,079
talking [Â __Â ] about us they can't get

3468
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:23,920
your seeds to crack i'm like nope not at

3469
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:27,039
all but for some reason it went that way

3470
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:29,760
but that that vile thing

3471
01:54:27,039 --> 01:54:31,599
if it's still alive uh

3472
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,520
it was literally it was just a funny

3473
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:34,880
fluke it was an accident and i just

3474
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,239
thought it was hilarious to show that it

3475
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,840
was actually growing i thought how

3476
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:42,079
amazing uh a a seed is so

3477
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,360
so like wants to grow so bad that that

3478
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:45,679
it continues to live inside of a

3479
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:47,519
basically like a little test tube

3480
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:50,000
yeah and i agree i thought it was

3481
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,679
awesome i figure if if i had that seat i

3482
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,920
would grow it out just because it's like

3483
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:56,319
man you earned it like

3484
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,599
exactly i i need to i need to call him

3485
01:54:56,319 --> 01:54:59,279
up and see you know hey is that thing

3486
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:01,599
still going if so what did what did you

3487
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:03,439
do with it but i i don't know he's funny

3488
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:05,119
he might still have it he might not but

3489
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:07,359
it was all it was all just supposed to

3490
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:08,559
be just to look at this isn't this cool

3491
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:10,238
and it wasn't supposed to be anything

3492
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,440
negative attached and some reason it did

3493
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:12,799
so i ended up

3494
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:14,399
i don't know i don't know if i deleted

3495
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,119
the post just turned off commenting but

3496
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:16,719
one

3497
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,719
way or another it was like

3498
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,399
it went south real quick

3499
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:23,039
yeah that's full on i'm pretty sure i

3500
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,638
sussed out and like didn't seem like you

3501
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:27,198
i'm pretty sure what the comment you had

3502
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:28,800
said on it was really quite neutral but

3503
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:30,399
people will interpret things the way

3504
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:32,560
they will write

3505
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:34,559
yeah it's exactly but i mean i'm really

3506
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,480
not a jerk i i try to be anyone that's

3507
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,679
ever met me they they know i can joke

3508
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:39,839
around a lot or whatever but i

3509
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:42,639
definitely don't insult anyone just just

3510
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:44,159
because that's not that's not me

3511
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:44,880
yeah fantastic

3512
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:47,118
so

3513
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,960
just talking on like a bit of a weird

3514
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:52,000
topic but it's one we used to talk about

3515
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:54,319
a lot it kind of died off seed tampering

3516
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,399
used to be kind of like a hot topic but

3517
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:57,759
as i said it's fallen off probably due

3518
01:55:56,399 --> 01:55:59,920
to the fact that a lot of people have

3519
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:01,520
adopted more sophisticated methods of

3520
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:04,000
packaging and trackaging and

3521
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:06,320
authenticity is this something you hear

3522
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,840
about and something you are hash i say

3523
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:11,840
legitimately concerned about anymore

3524
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,599
for me it it

3525
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:16,880
it was always a hard one because you

3526
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:16,880
have a guy who

3527
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,840
as seed as the guy is releasing the

3528
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,679
seeds

3529
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,520
we're giving them to these guys at a at

3530
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:26,560
a cost to where they're gonna make their

3531
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:28,800
money off of it so if you think about it

3532
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,920
i'm selling my own brand this guy is

3533
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:33,039
selling up to 10 15.

3534
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,880
he

3535
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:36,399
i guess you can't put it past anybody

3536
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,159
because everyone's conscience is a

3537
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:40,319
little bit different than the other guy

3538
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:42,319
but for a man that could be making as

3539
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:45,439
much money as you could by selling so

3540
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:47,599
many brands of seeds i don't see why

3541
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:49,198
for any reason why you would take out

3542
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:50,880
any of those seeds and try and switch

3543
01:56:49,198 --> 01:56:52,559
them out to have someone grow them out

3544
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,319
because some of these guys breeds for

3545
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,400
instance tropicana cookies like we

3546
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:58,799
mentioned earlier or even some of my own

3547
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:00,799
creations if you grow that out there's

3548
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,159
certain things that are expected and

3549
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,840
they've been tested and we've seen what

3550
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:06,000
they grow so all of a sudden some guy

3551
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:08,239
says yo i grew out your you're this or

3552
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,118
that it looks super funny or it doesn't

3553
01:57:08,238 --> 01:57:11,839
have

3554
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:13,439
you know what i was expecting

3555
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,800
all you do it where'd you get those from

3556
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:16,158
the next thing you know the guy's called

3557
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,760
out it didn't it wouldn't take very long

3558
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:19,759
that scheme would only work for so long

3559
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,440
before you get called out but honestly i

3560
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:23,039
think that uh

3561
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:24,879
with with the seed tampering i mean i

3562
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:26,319
think that there's definitely some

3563
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,679
shadiness that goes along with it i

3564
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:29,920
think some guys might have done

3565
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:31,520
something like that but with my gear i

3566
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,800
haven't had anyone send me pictures of

3567
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:36,080
anything or show me something that

3568
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:37,840
didn't make me feel like um there was uh

3569
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:39,439
you know any issue at all but like i

3570
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:41,360
like i mentioned i i started using the

3571
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:43,759
canned verify stickers so from here on

3572
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:45,359
out if you can't give me a qr code or

3573
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,880
show me that you know give me the number

3574
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:48,719
off the back of your pack then it's it's

3575
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,118
not really anything i can do but for the

3576
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,198
most part all my stuff will be will be

3577
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:54,559
fully verifiable

3578
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,479
yeah awesome

3579
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:58,400
so how do you feel about the idea of

3580
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,319
outsourcing a crop the reason why i

3581
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:02,319
bring this up is because in the past few

3582
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:04,000
people who have had some issues with

3583
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:04,960
some seed crops

3584
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,639
generally

3585
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,239
that's one possible reason you know

3586
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:10,319
they'll say oh you know i had someone

3587
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:11,839
make the crop for me actually not kind

3588
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:13,679
of in the way that you mentioned with a

3589
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:16,159
friend but as in like they pay another

3590
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:17,840
company to do it is this something which

3591
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:18,960
you think is acceptable and you know

3592
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,639
because a lot of people will say that

3593
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,319
when you get to a certain size you've

3594
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,840
got to look at things like that or do

3595
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:26,799
you think that that's just not the type

3596
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:28,480
of thing you would be willing to do

3597
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,719
you you're actually like talking about

3598
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:33,118
stuff i'm i'm currently seeking i'm

3599
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:35,118
working on this right now what i what i

3600
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:37,279
touched on earlier was not having enough

3601
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:39,198
room and not not having enough area to

3602
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:41,198
do these things and and and with the

3603
01:58:39,198 --> 01:58:43,039
current legal status of where cannabis

3604
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:45,279
is a lot of these states are requiring

3605
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:47,599
you to be a licensed up producer

3606
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:50,719
processor or somehow have a licensed

3607
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:52,400
facility to grow medical is still alive

3608
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:53,599
and thriving in some states but even

3609
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:55,598
then you're not you're not allowed to

3610
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,039
just grow ungodly amounts of plants i

3611
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:59,440
mean you have to be in with whatever

3612
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:01,679
your state's requirements are so

3613
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:05,118
to to to move forward with that and the

3614
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:06,719
idea is to find people you can partner

3615
01:59:05,118 --> 01:59:08,960
up with who yes are in these other

3616
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:11,198
states and have facilities ready to go

3617
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,399
um i've built relationships with me with

3618
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:13,439
some people in

3619
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:16,000
michigan

3620
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:18,559
um in oregon california obviously up

3621
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,279
here in washington state um i've got a

3622
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,280
guy who's in

3623
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:24,719
nevada

3624
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:26,560
there's these all these places have the

3625
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:28,719
potential to

3626
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,000
give me a little bit of room to breed i

3627
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:31,118
know there's other guys out there that

3628
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,800
are doing this and this is how they've

3629
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:35,439
become so successful and how they're

3630
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:38,400
able to produce as much as they are but

3631
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:39,118
one thing i can tell you is whereas

3632
01:59:38,399 --> 01:59:41,519
i

3633
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:44,000
some people are are wanting to

3634
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:45,280
have the bigger space they can produce

3635
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,198
more and more and more and more i'm

3636
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:49,439
literally looking to just have more area

3637
01:59:47,198 --> 01:59:50,879
to breed with and bring back stuff and

3638
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:52,479
work on the things i've already got i

3639
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:54,560
don't want a hundred new projects but i

3640
01:59:52,479 --> 01:59:57,198
do want to release the ones i mentioned

3641
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:59,360
earlier getting them back into a

3642
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:01,439
to further generations of them and then

3643
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:03,359
also making new crosses

3644
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,960
um

3645
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:06,880
that's all good but i still i really

3646
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:08,800
want to focus on on certain things and

3647
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,319
but that's with these extra spaces

3648
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,760
that'll give me the opportunity to do so

3649
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:13,439
so as long as you've got a good

3650
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:15,199
relationship with these guys i think it

3651
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:17,598
it's a it's a winning combination for

3652
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:19,519
them to open up some space for you to uh

3653
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,199
to do it and then also i think they see

3654
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,040
their value because

3655
02:00:21,198 --> 02:00:24,879
for them to have a new strain that they

3656
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:26,719
can then have a selection of that is

3657
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:27,920
your cut or you're what you're standing

3658
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:30,158
behind saying hey this is one of my

3659
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:32,560
keepers from this crop or from this from

3660
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:35,118
the seed line they they are then allowed

3661
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:37,119
to have that uh

3662
02:00:35,118 --> 02:00:38,880
you know that plant and it sets them

3663
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:41,198
apart from someone else because they've

3664
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:43,279
got something no one else has

3665
02:00:41,198 --> 02:00:44,079
yeah most certainly

3666
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:46,479
so

3667
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:48,800
this is kind of more on the mechanics of

3668
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:51,279
breeding but do you ever do anything

3669
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,760
different when you are doing a seed crop

3670
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:56,238
versus say a scentsy crop in regards to

3671
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:58,960
say like nutrition or lighting or just

3672
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:01,279
anything you know

3673
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,800
now for the most part i i'm growing

3674
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:05,039
exactly how i would within the other

3675
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:06,079
thing um

3676
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:08,079
i

3677
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:11,118
can say that

3678
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:13,039
when when growing

3679
02:01:11,118 --> 02:01:14,399
when growing your scentsy obviously

3680
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:16,000
you're going you're trying to make the

3681
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:18,479
absolute best thing possible you want to

3682
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,760
make sure you're hitting every single um

3683
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:21,118
every single feeding right you want to

3684
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:22,400
make sure those things are coming out 10

3685
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:24,399
out of 10.

3686
02:01:22,399 --> 02:01:26,079
not to shy away from you know saying

3687
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:27,598
that you shouldn't have a perfect crop

3688
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:30,000
by any means but

3689
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:32,719
i think that with a seed crop you could

3690
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,158
be allowed and it's very forgiving if

3691
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:35,599
you were to feed a little bit less

3692
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:37,039
nutrients because you know the plants

3693
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:39,599
trying to produce the seed not

3694
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:42,399
necessarily the uh the uh

3695
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:43,840
the best looking flowers but um i think

3696
02:01:42,399 --> 02:01:45,439
it's a good principle to probably try

3697
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,199
and grow the healthiest plants you can

3698
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:49,598
whether you're growing for seeds or not

3699
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:51,598
but i think that in in doing so you

3700
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:53,920
could probably uh

3701
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:55,599
maybe schedule back a little bit on the

3702
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,039
on the nutrients and some other stuff

3703
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:58,960
that you normally would do because it

3704
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:01,039
might not it doesn't necessarily require

3705
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,880
it as much but as long as your plant's

3706
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:04,158
in good health and you see yourself

3707
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,960
producing everything you're looking to

3708
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:08,399
do then it should be fine yeah

3709
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,198
yeah killer so

3710
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:13,598
an idea i love to run by all breeders is

3711
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:15,598
where do aesthetics or you know bag

3712
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:17,360
appeal as generally referred to where

3713
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:19,279
does this rate for you is this something

3714
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:20,799
you constantly got in the forefront of

3715
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:23,920
your mind when you're making a cross or

3716
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:25,520
is it really kind of an afterthought

3717
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,760
it's probably one of the first things

3718
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:30,800
because to me

3719
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:33,920
like i mentioned earlier

3720
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,719
i said something about um

3721
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,719
uh

3722
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:38,399
you know having having strains that set

3723
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,399
you apart you going into the dispensary

3724
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:42,638
and they've already got you know they've

3725
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:44,879
already got something or whatever well

3726
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:46,400
if you have um

3727
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,760
if you've got something that just right

3728
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:49,519
from the beginning they they look at

3729
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,360
your jar they see that you open your bag

3730
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,840
and it's just shiny or it has a certain

3731
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:56,880
color or it has something to the look of

3732
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:59,360
it i i i see there's a certain type of

3733
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,520
uh there's this some wheat i've seen it

3734
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:03,439
has the hairs come out kind of a puffy

3735
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:05,599
look and it kind of just it wraps around

3736
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:08,638
the bud the the hairs are not very loose

3737
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:10,719
from the uh from the actual flower so

3738
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:12,239
it has a real tight look to it i've seen

3739
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:13,760
buds like that and they literally always

3740
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:15,678
stand out to me they're just a certain

3741
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:17,280
look that i that i can say that i've

3742
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:20,239
always really loved about some some

3743
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:22,158
types of pot now i feel the same way as

3744
02:03:20,238 --> 02:03:23,439
far as dispensaries go they want to see

3745
02:03:22,158 --> 02:03:25,359
something that's going to stand out to

3746
02:03:23,439 --> 02:03:28,559
the next person but

3747
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,319
also the smell can can really take you

3748
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:32,800
away from that because you know this

3749
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:35,439
another hyped up strain skittles

3750
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,360
the skittles cut that's going around it

3751
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:39,118
i've more times than not have seen it

3752
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:41,519
where it doesn't necessarily look like

3753
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:44,319
the highest quality flower but that

3754
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:46,159
smell and flavor are so incredible that

3755
02:03:44,319 --> 02:03:47,439
it's you forget about the looks of it

3756
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:50,638
real quick you just want to smoke

3757
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:52,319
another joint so um i think there's a

3758
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,159
lot of strains out there like that they

3759
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:56,799
may not be the prettiest but damn the

3760
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:58,479
the high it produces and the uh the

3761
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,440
smells that are coming off of the plant

3762
02:03:58,479 --> 02:04:02,638
are are worth growing it in general so i

3763
02:04:01,439 --> 02:04:04,879
i do

3764
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,719
really hold um the bag of pill high on

3765
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,440
my on my scale of what i'm looking for

3766
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:11,840
with stuff but also um

3767
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:14,399
you know taste smell yeah all that stuff

3768
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:16,078
comes into play just as much so um it's

3769
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:17,598
kind of like the trifecta you know it

3770
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:19,118
kind of needs to be all of the above you

3771
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:21,199
know because if it's lacking one or the

3772
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,598
other then it really just makes it you

3773
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:25,279
know either a really nice weed without a

3774
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:26,639
kick a really good looking pot that's

3775
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:28,158
got plenty of high but there's zero

3776
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:29,520
flavor it's like you kind of want all of

3777
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:32,319
them

3778
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:34,800
yeah well-rounded

3779
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:36,719
so talking on the topic of the skittles

3780
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:38,960
emerald cut last few years has been

3781
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:41,520
dominated by it have you got any special

3782
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:44,239
surprises or kind of exciting releases

3783
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:46,639
in store for the emerald cup this year

3784
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:48,399

3786
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,158

that line will be there so the white

3788
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:55,759

3789
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:57,840
should that one will be ready by then uh

3790
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,360
we're gonna have uh the pine fruit which

3791
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:00,159
is a ghost og

3792
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:01,920
um

3793
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:04,799
uh purple vapor that should be ready to

3794
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:07,520

the tangy wine should be ready to go

3796
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,360

3797
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:13,520
brandywine um there will be a few

3798
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:14,960
surprises i'm i'm trying to like i said

3799
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,560
i don't want to put anything out in a

3800
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,560
hurry i'm trying to just release stuff

3801
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:20,960
that that's you know that we know

3802
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,480
um will pass a test of time as far as

3803
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,599
popularity and people enjoying what

3804
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:25,598
they're buying you know i don't want

3805
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,800
people to um

3806
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,239
you know spend hard-earned money and

3807
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:30,960
then not not be impressed with what

3808
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:32,479
they're what they're growing

3809
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,800
yeah no that sounds like a good little

3810
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:35,839
ethos to have for yourself

3811
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,719
so

3812
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:39,760
vinnie sorry vino og my apologies vino

3813
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:42,078
og

3814
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:45,199
not very well known about extremely

3815
02:05:42,078 --> 02:05:46,559
limited number of packs would you be

3816
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:49,919
able to tell us a little bit more about

3817
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:51,679
it and why you decided to work with it

3818
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,359
so vino is

3819
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:55,118
i mean if if

3820
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:56,078
if i take everything that man has told

3821
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:57,279
me

3822
02:05:56,078 --> 02:06:00,078
uh

3823
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:02,238
as as truth then what he's told me is he

3824
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:05,359
he he knew some of the guys from from

3825
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:07,039
cookie fam uh so he knew [Â __Â ] or had

3826
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:09,439
had been in contact with him at some

3827
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:11,519
point they're all from the bay um

3828
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:13,519
i guess there was

3829
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,239
um the original batch of seeds or

3830
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,159
whatever that came from those guys who

3831
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:20,000
had you know when they made the girl

3832
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:21,759
scout cookies there was certain seeds

3833
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,439
that were you know handed out to some

3834
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:25,199
people some were given out you know

3835
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:27,198
without any you know colleges here you

3836
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:28,799
go try these out whatever there was some

3837
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:31,598
people that grew them out and found them

3838
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:34,159
so for instance ogkb came from that line

3839
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:36,000
the ogkb is from the original

3840
02:06:34,158 --> 02:06:37,839
cookies line it's just another plant

3841
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,520
that popped up

3842
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:41,039
so that's something that's not i mean

3843
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:42,320
some people don't realize that and then

3844
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:45,359
another

3845
02:06:42,319 --> 02:06:48,399
apparently according to um

3846
02:06:45,359 --> 02:06:49,598
mary jane wines the vino og cut which he

3847
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:52,799
does have that

3848
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:56,480
cut alone uh supposedly came from

3849
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,480
uh girl scout cookie seeds

3850
02:06:57,439 --> 02:07:02,000
interesting and so do you see that

3851
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:05,759
similarity yourself or are you just kind

3852
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:08,158
of taking the the story on face value

3853
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,840
er a little bit of both so growing it

3854
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:11,519
out myself i only grew it out the one

3855
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:14,159
time the pure vino was grown out one

3856
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:15,520
time and to me i feel like it was um

3857
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:17,759
there could be some cookies in it it

3858
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:20,320
wasn't it wasn't in my opinion it wasn't

3859
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:24,560
pure cookie form by any means but

3860
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:26,399
a lot of stuff i found when growing um

3861
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:28,400
stuff from the girl scout is you do you

3862
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:31,359
do get girl scout cookie

3863
02:07:28,399 --> 02:07:33,759
uh obvious um domination and some some

3864
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:34,799
effects but then there's um

3865
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:36,000
there's some that come out that

3866
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,679
literally just have a completely

3867
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,920
different thing going on and i think his

3868
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:41,840
one the vino obviously means wine in

3869
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:44,480
italian and i believe that's the what he

3870
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:45,760
was going with was it's more of a

3871
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:46,879
more of a

3872
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,039
kind of a

3873
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:50,159
merlot type of thing going on there's a

3874
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:52,000
definitely

3875
02:07:50,158 --> 02:07:53,118
sort of a

3876
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,279
musky

3877
02:07:53,118 --> 02:07:57,279
kind of a wine sort of smell i i suppose

3878
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,440
yeah interesting and so can we expect to

3879
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:03,119
see it appearing in some of your crosses

3880
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:05,519
going forward

3881
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:07,598
uh to be honest probably probably not i

3882
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,960
don't even have the cut anymore and and

3883
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,400
uh he

3884
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,319
that's something that's that's his i

3885
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:13,920
mean i i i could get it back anytime and

3886
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:16,238
check it out again but like i said i've

3887
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,000
i've got there's

3888
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:19,839
it's almost to a point when does it stop

3889
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,039
at what point do you do

3890
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:25,360
do you quit with having so much stuff

3891
02:08:23,039 --> 02:08:27,679
um

3892
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:29,279
um yeah but there's there's there's

3893
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:31,118
something that i would imagine there

3894
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:32,719
being um

3895
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:34,639
maybe down the line or something from

3896
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:37,039
him but it's like uh just it's one of

3897
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:38,400
those things like i i'd like to

3898
02:08:37,039 --> 02:08:39,599
probably use it down the line but it's

3899
02:08:38,399 --> 02:08:40,799
just there's just so many freaking

3900
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:42,719
projects to do it's like i don't even

3901
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:44,800
know how to get in i mean there's just

3902
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:47,279
where do i start you know so i i

3903
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:49,440
definitely have um

3904
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:51,679
you know a lot of plans in the works but

3905
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:53,919
that one really isn't on the uh on the

3906
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:56,639
to-do list right now

3907
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:57,760
yeah totally understandable

3908
02:08:56,639 --> 02:08:59,359
so

3909
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:02,079
kind of you know talking about the

3910
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:04,000
emerald cup how do you feel about the

3911
02:09:02,078 --> 02:09:05,439
quantity of cannabis cups we have these

3912
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,800
days do you feel like there's a good

3913
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:08,638
amount do you feel like maybe we're a

3914
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,719
little over saturated and what's your

3915
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:13,679
favorite one

3916
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:16,319
uh hands down emerald cup is my favorite

3917
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:19,199
go-to show right behind the high times

3918
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:21,840
michigan um the reason i like the high

3919
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:23,839
times michigan show so much is

3920
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:25,440
other than when colorado was still going

3921
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,599
on that

3922
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:29,839
that was that was my favorite place to

3923
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:31,840
go to there was it was i had such good

3924
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:33,599
feedback from my strains there so many

3925
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:35,279
people were interested in it they all

3926
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:37,440
had heard of me so i always did really

3927
02:09:35,279 --> 02:09:39,118
well when i did those shows now the same

3928
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:41,439
goes for michigan every time i go there

3929
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:43,039
i can go twice a year in the same summer

3930
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:45,678
two different times and do do really

3931
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:48,719

3934
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:55,599
cup obviously that is the

3935
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:57,039
it's your number one spot to go to just

3936
02:09:55,599 --> 02:09:58,480
because of uh

3937
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:00,078
um

3938
02:09:58,479 --> 02:10:02,238
the scene i mean you have everybody

3939
02:10:00,078 --> 02:10:05,039
there is coming to shop for their next

3940
02:10:02,238 --> 02:10:06,718
season seeds you see

3941
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:09,039
people from every demographic but but

3942
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:11,118
literally a ton of older people older

3943
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:13,198
gentlemen walking with their wives

3944
02:10:11,118 --> 02:10:14,880
i i've even seen women that looked like

3945
02:10:13,198 --> 02:10:16,399
they were sent down there by their by

3946
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,159
their their husband and their boyfriend

3947
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:19,759
they they got their mud boots on they've

3948
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:21,198
got a they've got like a basket that

3949
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:22,800
they're just filling up with their seeds

3950
02:10:21,198 --> 02:10:24,638
they're buying for the next year it's a

3951
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:26,400
i get a kick out of it i've i've had

3952
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:27,359
conversations with with men in front of

3953
02:10:26,399 --> 02:10:29,039
my booth they're just sitting there

3954
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:31,039
jiving to the music for an hour while we

3955
02:10:29,039 --> 02:10:32,719
all sit there and talk weed it's crazy

3956
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:33,599
man it's it's just an awesome show to be

3957
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:36,158
at

3958
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:38,078
and i do think that there can be i think

3959
02:10:36,158 --> 02:10:39,679
a lot of people are

3960
02:10:38,078 --> 02:10:41,198
kind of quick to jump on let's have a

3961
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:43,440
cannabis cup and we'll just make a ton

3962
02:10:41,198 --> 02:10:45,118
of money off these people um and the

3963
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:46,238
funny part about it is

3964
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:47,598
you'll have

3965
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:49,279
these people that say they want to put

3966
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:50,000
on these shows they'll supposedly buy

3967
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:51,439
this stuff they're going to get

3968
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,880
everything going they buy permits they

3969
02:10:51,439 --> 02:10:54,319
do whatever and then come to find out

3970
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:55,760
that oh guess what you're not even

3971
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:57,599
allowed to have the show in general so

3972
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:00,000
we just paid them money and then they'll

3973
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:01,840
want to have us hold a credit or they'll

3974
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,679
want to pay us back later in time it's

3975
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:05,119
like you guys took all of our money and

3976
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:06,719
didn't even know if you're having a show

3977
02:11:05,118 --> 02:11:08,238
so that's been the case i've had that

3978
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:10,158
happen before

3979
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:13,439
i've i've seen it happen with even some

3980
02:11:10,158 --> 02:11:16,319
of these big companies

3981
02:11:13,439 --> 02:11:17,919
yeah that's scary so it's yeah it's it's

3982
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:19,920
it's crazy but no i don't know i think

3983
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:21,359
that i think it's good to have shows i

3984
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:23,520
don't know if there's a certain amount

3985
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:25,519
that that you know you know there's too

3986
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:27,040
many um they've actually been shutting

3987
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,960
them down left and right because it just

3988
02:11:27,039 --> 02:11:29,920
doesn't go with the legalization you

3989
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,078
know you're just not supposed to be

3990
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:33,679
public consumption um you're not

3991
02:11:32,078 --> 02:11:35,118
supposed to be sales of cannabis and so

3992
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:38,078
you end up having a lot of people that

3993
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:39,598
were using these shows as basically a a

3994
02:11:38,078 --> 02:11:41,759
table to just sell their their products

3995
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,199
from that's no longer allowed at a lot

3996
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:45,599
of these places the last show i was at

3997
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:47,839
in june um for high times for the norcal

3998
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,599
show it was an empty it was totally

3999
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,520
empty scene like you're used to seeing

4000
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:53,279
so many booths everywhere popping up and

4001
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,960
less and less people are able to attend

4002
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:57,359
because they're not licensed up yet

4003
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,960
they're not they don't have the proper

4004
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:00,960
paperwork and they therefore they can't

4005
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,560
sell

4006
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:05,520
yeah okay

4007
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:07,520
so where do you see the overall industry

4008
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,920
heading over the next five years and do

4009
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:11,920
you think that large-scale legalization

4010
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:13,760
is going to occur and potentially ruin

4011
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:16,319
things

4012
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,920
man i think it kind of goes

4013
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:21,920
i think there's good that's coming from

4014
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:23,679
it because everything everything in life

4015
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:25,760
is changing there's steady change coming

4016
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:27,599
with everything do we all agree with it

4017
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,599
not necessarily but

4018
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:32,239
is it good yes because it's also given

4019
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:34,639
us an opportunity to not just be a guy

4020
02:12:32,238 --> 02:12:37,279
who's who claim i have a company but

4021
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:39,359
it's not necessarily a legal company but

4022
02:12:37,279 --> 02:12:40,238
i kind of make money off it no i'm i'm

4023
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:41,679
i'm

4024
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:43,839
i'm involved in something where i'm

4025
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:45,760
paying my taxes i'm i have a full

4026
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:47,599
legitimate business out of this and it's

4027
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:50,320
something i want to see myself grow more

4028
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:53,199
and more with and i think that the the

4029
02:12:50,319 --> 02:12:55,359
the theme of cannabis cups might get

4030
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:57,039
smaller as far as just a huge group of

4031
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:58,399
people selling pot out of a you know

4032
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:00,719
their different booths and doing that

4033
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:02,158
way but i think that

4034
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:03,359
those are fun and i think it's awesome

4035
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:04,879
it should be a part of it but i think

4036
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:05,839
they'll get smaller and smaller as far

4037
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:07,359
as

4038
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,239
having more of a

4039
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:12,639
kind of an underground network of uh

4040
02:13:10,238 --> 02:13:13,678
cups where it's more of a private scene

4041
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:15,199
because that's where it all started

4042
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:16,560
anyway it was it was more of a smaller

4043
02:13:15,198 --> 02:13:18,078
scene if people turn in their buds and

4044
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:19,440
those people would judge

4045
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:20,960
the cannabis based on what we were

4046
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:23,039
seeing right there at face value not

4047
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,960
some judges behind a closed door and

4048
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:27,279
then given the award to the most you

4049
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:30,399
know the the biggest highest paying

4050
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:31,118
vendor which seems to be the case um

4051
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:32,719
so

4052
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:34,479
i don't know man it's it's it's good and

4053
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:36,639
bad but i think that the overall

4054
02:13:34,479 --> 02:13:38,238
legalization is going to draw us to more

4055
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:39,840
shows that are more like the canna con

4056
02:13:38,238 --> 02:13:41,598
and more of like convention style where

4057
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:43,199
there's no smoking there's no vending of

4058
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:45,279
any cannabis products but more or less

4059
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,359
shaking hands and using it as a tool to

4060
02:13:45,279 --> 02:13:49,118
network your brand and really you know

4061
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:51,118
meet and greet and kind of get people

4062
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:52,880
turned on to what you have to offer but

4063
02:13:51,118 --> 02:13:53,679
all of that stuff is going to be you

4064
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:54,800
know

4065
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:56,399
getting things out of your local

4066
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:58,079
dispensaries or out of the different rec

4067
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:59,920
stores that are available in your state

4068
02:13:58,078 --> 02:14:01,519
but hopefully dungeons of all genetics

4069
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,118
will be something that you can find in

4070
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,480
every state that's going to legalize and

4071
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:06,078
ones that already have you're slowly

4072
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:10,399
seeing more and more of my strains pop

4073
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:10,399
up so i think in the long run here

4074
02:14:10,479 --> 02:14:13,598
it will get to a point where you're

4075
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:15,679
gonna you will start seeing brands just

4076
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:17,279
like you do nestle and all these other

4077
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:18,480
you know chocolate companies and big you

4078
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:20,639
know tobacco and all these different

4079
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:21,839
people you're familiar with those brands

4080
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,880
and you'll start seeing them in every

4081
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:24,319
state and you'll start seeing that with

4082
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,960
these cannabis brands as well and i

4083
02:14:24,319 --> 02:14:28,158
think it's good but overall as long as

4084
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,920
the right people are running it and

4085
02:14:28,158 --> 02:14:31,198
they're still letting us get a piece of

4086
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:32,480
the pie

4087
02:14:31,198 --> 02:14:34,158
and we're able to operate like we've

4088
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,238
been doing and have a good thing going

4089
02:14:34,158 --> 02:14:37,839
then there's nothing to complain about i

4090
02:14:36,238 --> 02:14:40,158
was super against

4091
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:41,920
legalization at first you know but now i

4092
02:14:40,158 --> 02:14:43,118
mean how convenient i mean if if you

4093
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:44,480
don't have any weed and you're not

4094
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:46,319
growing it at the time you can only go

4095
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:48,638
right down the street and go pick from

4096
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:50,639
100 different strains i mean that's kind

4097
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:52,000
of what we always wanted but there's

4098
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:53,440
still a few things that come into play

4099
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,479
that kind of make it a negative

4100
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:56,479
experience

4101
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:58,399
so it's it's really i mean everyone's

4102
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:00,078
got their opinion but i'm kind of i'm

4103
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:01,679
not on the fence i'm more towards

4104
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:04,078
legalization more

4105
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,920
um for the you know the the movement

4106
02:15:04,078 --> 02:15:07,840
that we're heading in but at the same

4107
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,199
time i can't forget my past and that was

4108
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:10,480
you know either black market or being

4109
02:15:09,198 --> 02:15:12,319
involved in the medical scene where we

4110
02:15:10,479 --> 02:15:14,000
could pretty much do whatever we wanted

4111
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:16,719
as long as you had you were falling into

4112
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,560
that gray area you know

4113
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:21,760
yeah totally

4114
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:23,039
so that brings us to the last little

4115
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:25,360
section of the show where we've got our

4116
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:27,519
quickfire questions so

4117
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:29,359
last little few certainly don't take as

4118
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:31,280
long to answer hopefully but usually

4119
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:33,839
people stress out about it i love it so

4120
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:35,198
first one what is your favorite strain

4121
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,119
of weed

4122
02:15:35,198 --> 02:15:40,158
oh my gosh

4123
02:15:37,118 --> 02:15:43,359
man that's that's tough

4124
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:46,879
honestly no no hands down it's gelato i

4125
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:49,759
don't care i i'll say it i did gelato 33

4126
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:51,760
gelato 41 which is the there's a there's

4127
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:54,480
a company here in washington state

4128
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:56,400
called canada organics they do all

4129
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:59,598
um greenhouse grow

4130
02:15:56,399 --> 02:16:01,439
um and their gelato is some of the i i

4131
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:02,880
absolutely love it there's and that's

4132
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:04,879
another thing that's weird washington

4133
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:07,199
state we have very few people that are

4134
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:08,880
actually producing the strange gelato in

4135
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:10,479
the wreck scene it's very weird they're

4136
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,239
one of the only people i've seen to have

4137
02:16:10,479 --> 02:16:14,319
it and and there's a couple other guys

4138
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:17,039
that have gelatos but this one in

4139
02:16:14,319 --> 02:16:17,840
particular is the number 41 cut and it

4140
02:16:17,039 --> 02:16:20,319
is

4141
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,319
it's amazing i i literally love it i

4142
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:24,479
can't get enough of it smoke whenever i

4143
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:26,559
can find it but i go down to california

4144
02:16:24,479 --> 02:16:29,039
i can get access to the 45 i can get the

4145
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:30,719
30 all these any anything gelato it just

4146
02:16:29,039 --> 02:16:32,398
seems like it has such a good nose to it

4147
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:34,159
kind of like the sherbet

4148
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:35,679
i think i think mike has mentioned

4149
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:37,039
exotic mike has mentioned this sherb is

4150
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:38,799
one of his favorite strains because of

4151
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,040
the creaminess and the it's just got

4152
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:42,638
everything he loves in his cannabis i i

4153
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,319
agree with that i think the sherb is

4154
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:46,079
another one up there that's got amazing

4155
02:16:44,318 --> 02:16:47,519
things going for it so shout out cookie

4156
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:49,760
fam for making some of our favorite

4157
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:51,760
strains that we love to scr uh smoke and

4158
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:53,840
then crossbreed with but there's there's

4159
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,800
a lot of great other ones that have been

4160
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:58,639
gone for a while that i haven't seen um

4161
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:01,119
for instance the blue cheese i don't

4162
02:16:58,638 --> 02:17:02,879
know who who i don't know which cut i

4163
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:04,559
don't know who had it which one who made

4164
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:05,679
it whatever but there was a blue cheese

4165
02:17:04,558 --> 02:17:07,039
that was going on for a while and i

4166
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:09,200
absolutely love it and i missed that one

4167
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,439
like crazy but for right now i'm i'm

4168
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:13,679
smoking on i love the gelato that's one

4169
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:16,239
of my favorites

4170
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,920
so on the flip side what is the worst

4171
02:17:16,239 --> 02:17:20,879
strain you've ever had or just the one

4172
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:23,200
that least jives with you

4173
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:23,199
man

4174
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:31,439
blue dream no i'm just joking

4175
02:17:28,079 --> 02:17:32,879
i'm just kidding uh honestly i don't uh

4176
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:34,639
man there's

4177
02:17:32,879 --> 02:17:36,159
i don't even i don't know because just

4178
02:17:34,638 --> 02:17:38,478
like just like

4179
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:40,558
the experience if it wasn't good i mean

4180
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:42,079
into the into the uh not necessarily

4181
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:43,599
into the trash bin but definitely into

4182
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:45,599
the trash jar that gets passed to

4183
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:47,840
someone who doesn't mind smoking

4184
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:50,159
anything that's handed to them because

4185
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:51,519
if i didn't like it it's it's it's not

4186
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:54,239
something i'm going to hold on to very

4187
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:56,398
long so um i don't know man that's hard

4188
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:57,840
off the top of my head

4189
02:17:56,398 --> 02:17:59,039
what did i just smoke recently that i

4190
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:01,040
didn't like there was something that was

4191
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,479
given to me at the michigan cup that i

4192
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,000
was just like man that was [Â __Â ]

4193
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:06,000
garbage but i don't know i don't

4194
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,040
remember i don't remember what strain it

4195
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,558
was and i'm definitely not going to

4196
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:10,479
mention if i did because that's just

4197
02:18:08,558 --> 02:18:11,679
kind of it could have been a bad example

4198
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:13,358
i mean to sit there and say that the

4199
02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:15,760
strain sucks just because the example i

4200
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:18,000
got yeah it's not really fair but i've

4201
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:19,200
had my fair share of bad weed now let's

4202
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,718
just say the worst strain i've ever

4203
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,079
smoked how about that what i started

4204
02:18:20,718 --> 02:18:24,398
this interview off with with some of

4205
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:27,439
that brown sticks and stems

4206
02:18:24,398 --> 02:18:29,199
uh weed that swag from

4207
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:31,200
mexico

4208
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,079
yeah good answer

4209
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:34,800
so

4210
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:36,638
what is a strain that

4211
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:38,558
kind of asked this one earlier into but

4212
02:18:36,638 --> 02:18:40,398
a strain that you no longer have access

4213
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:42,159
to but you did in the past that you wish

4214
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:44,159
you had back

4215
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:47,519
hands down super fruit from captain [Â __Â ]

4216
02:18:44,159 --> 02:18:49,039
i don't i don't i i i was very uh i was

4217
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:51,200
a big smoker

4218
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:53,439
back when i was talking to that guy 2003

4219
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:56,399
2004 i came from california so i knew

4220
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:58,318
what goodweed was i knew what i wanted

4221
02:18:56,398 --> 02:18:59,519
and and literally i

4222
02:18:58,318 --> 02:19:01,359
i i

4223
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:02,639
if anybody out there listening has

4224
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:05,200
access to superfood or any of the

4225
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:07,920
crosses that guy made hit me up um that

4226
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:10,719
literally to this day like i don't know

4227
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:12,879
what it was just the smell and overall

4228
02:19:10,718 --> 02:19:14,239
like i i feel like i almost remember

4229
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:15,518
getting green sick but i it could have

4230
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:16,959
been from something else it wasn't from

4231
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:19,120
just smoking as weed but i mean it was

4232
02:19:16,959 --> 02:19:21,039
awesome weed but it was just i got so

4233
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:22,880
baked combined with something else i

4234
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:24,080
think i threw up that day but regardless

4235
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:26,000
it was uh

4236
02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:27,599
it was just good weed and i i really i

4237
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,920
think he had he had something really

4238
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:31,280
special there and i i i had the clone at

4239
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,519
one point and i lost it because i was

4240
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,519
young and dumb and if if literally if i

4241
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:37,599
could get anything back that one would

4242
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:40,719
probably be it um

4243
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:43,599
alongside that 2003 2004 i was getting a

4244
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:43,598
string called uh

4245
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:48,398
northern lights skunk haze and i know

4246
02:19:46,239 --> 02:19:50,478
that's a that's a pretty typical cross

4247
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:52,559
from the dutch i mean i mean you can get

4248
02:19:50,478 --> 02:19:54,879
northern wise skunk hazes everywhere but

4249
02:19:52,559 --> 02:19:57,600
the specific combination of that

4250
02:19:54,879 --> 02:20:00,000
northern lights skunk haze and then the

4251
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:03,840
the specific pheno that this guy had

4252
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,200
found was it it put it before we use the

4253
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:07,120
word loud

4254
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:09,520
like oh this strain is loud

4255
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:11,280
this guy just it was absolute you could

4256
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:12,960
not cruise around with it it would be in

4257
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:16,000
your car and you'd be white knuckle

4258
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:17,438
driving with driving 35 the 35 and

4259
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,600
as slow as you can so you don't get

4260
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:21,040
pulled over i mean it was if you get

4261
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,040
pulled over with that weed there's

4262
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:24,319
you're it's being found no matter what

4263
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:25,200
so

4264
02:20:24,318 --> 02:20:26,639
there's

4265
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:28,319
just there's just certain ones that are

4266
02:20:26,639 --> 02:20:30,239
just killer and that definitely was that

4267
02:20:28,318 --> 02:20:32,318
was one i miss and and really wish i

4268
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:34,239
could get back

4269
02:20:32,318 --> 02:20:35,920
fantastic so

4270
02:20:34,239 --> 02:20:38,719
if you could go back to any time in

4271
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:41,040
history any place to collect some seeds

4272
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:42,478
where would you go and what seeds

4273
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:44,560
man probably

4274
02:20:42,478 --> 02:20:46,000
just because i'm a big indica fan i

4275
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:47,119
think if i mean as long as i was

4276
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,478
accepted i knew i wasn't going to get

4277
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:50,399
kidnapped i'd probably somewhere in the

4278
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:52,879
hindu kush mountain range collecting

4279
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:55,199
seeds straight off um plants out of

4280
02:20:52,879 --> 02:20:56,959
there i mean something about hindu kush

4281
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:58,960
i had it i had it a few times back in

4282
02:20:56,959 --> 02:21:01,599
california and i mean i don't i'm not

4283
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:03,279
sure if that was pure or real by any

4284
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,840
means but if if i knew for certain that

4285
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:08,239
i was i was in the cush mountain ranges

4286
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:10,000
and i was able to get a pure hindu or

4287
02:21:08,239 --> 02:21:11,520
something similar to that that i could

4288
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,239
bring back and smoke and i'd be pretty

4289
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:16,079
pretty pumped on that um

4290
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:17,840
i mean again i mean all the other ones

4291
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:19,359
that people have grown and crossbred

4292
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,280
made from you know from back in the

4293
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:22,800
until now i don't know but i mean

4294
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,079
there's there's a lot of stuff that i've

4295
02:21:22,799 --> 02:21:25,840
probably come across i really didn't

4296
02:21:24,079 --> 02:21:27,600
know the smell of that i i could

4297
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:29,840
probably um

4298
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,840
i'd love to see again but

4299
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:33,920
that one for sure is something just a

4300
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:37,280
pure just a real pure cush that i knew

4301
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:40,478
that it's as pure as it can get

4302
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:41,600
nice humble little answer

4303
02:21:40,478 --> 02:21:43,920
so

4304
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:46,318
what uh final oh no second last little

4305
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:48,079
quick five question what is the next

4306
02:21:46,318 --> 02:21:49,600
little breeding project you're doing

4307
02:21:48,079 --> 02:21:51,439
that people should be getting excited

4308
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,600
for

4309
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:56,318
man there's too much man i don't know i

4310
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:58,159
think uh i think probably

4311
02:21:56,318 --> 02:21:59,840
um

4312
02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:01,920
a lot of people have been excited about

4313
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:03,760
this lemon grove this this this lemon

4314
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:07,040
tree time citrus farmer i think it's

4315
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:08,318
going to be something that that provides

4316
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:10,720
like i mentioned earlier just something

4317
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:12,079
different than your typical tangy orange

4318
02:22:10,719 --> 02:22:14,478
citrus strain i think it's going to have

4319
02:22:12,079 --> 02:22:16,000
a nice combo the lemon tree is one of

4320
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:18,639
those ones that

4321
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,478
ever since i first smoked it and excuse

4322
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:23,519
me if i'm wrong but from what i get from

4323
02:22:20,478 --> 02:22:24,639
it i believe it's a lemon sour diesel

4324
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:27,200
uh

4325
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:28,799
some sort of mix up with that or a

4326
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,479
bag seed from it something like that i

4327
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:32,159
could be wrong but if i remember what

4328
02:22:30,478 --> 02:22:35,358
reading it was something had to do with

4329
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:36,719
lemon sour diesel and the lsd from when

4330
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:39,200
i used to get it

4331
02:22:36,719 --> 02:22:41,039
was it was such an incredible flavor and

4332
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,880
and it was just it was really it was

4333
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,800
totally different it wasn't it was their

4334
02:22:42,879 --> 02:22:46,879
citrus but it was different all the way

4335
02:22:44,799 --> 02:22:48,239
around and so that's kind of

4336
02:22:46,879 --> 02:22:49,920
that's kind of what i'm hoping for that

4337
02:22:48,239 --> 02:22:51,680
i get out of this strain is that we find

4338
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:53,520
something like that that's going to be

4339
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:55,280
it's not necessarily the exact same

4340
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,920
thing but just something that brings

4341
02:22:55,280 --> 02:23:00,399
just ultimate flavor and has uh a real

4342
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:02,719
kick-ass uh kind of a lemon

4343
02:23:00,398 --> 02:23:04,639
uh orange kind of combination going on

4344
02:23:02,719 --> 02:23:07,039
there

4345
02:23:04,639 --> 02:23:09,279
killer so final question where can

4346
