problem my friend the first question we

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,959
love to ask all guests what are you

49
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,300
currently smoking on

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,900
oh man you caught me on a good one this

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,800
is some uh outdoor zerbert from 365

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,939
count of farms grown by Cali kosher Sun

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
grown

54
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:30,479
not not outdoor sungrown is different

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,700
okay so I mean it begs the question are

56
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,199
you more a fan of sun grown or indoor

57
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,399
generally speaking

58
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,738
I'm fan of good man uh most of the time

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,959
most weed nowadays not most weed but

60
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,700
this is some good ass weed and uh I'm a

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,340
fan of good man this is some good

62
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:50,878
outdoor this is some good indoors so you

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,519
know easy does it for me for sure and do

64
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,919
you think that indoor will continue to

65
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,360
hold the kind of placeholder as the

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,518
superior quality or do you think that

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,080
over time outdoor and Sun grown will

68
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,080
become the more popular amongst the

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,319
masses

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,480
uh I've yet to see an outdoor flower

71
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,339
that kind of just hits like an indoor so

72
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,780
I think there's always going to be a

73
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,200
spot for indoor

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,419
yeah for sure for sure so I mean on that

75
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,878
note sounds like a very sort of terpy

76
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,039
strain what sort of flavors do you find

77
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,318
you're more inclined to you're a gas guy

78
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,019
a fruity guy

79
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,639
oh I'm a gas fruit guy for sure there's

80
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,319
there's way more flavors than that so

81
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,939
it's not like I can't choose both I

82
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,199
could choose both I like fruit I like

83
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,479
gas

84
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,479
I'm not too big on you know old world

85
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,899
Terps like you know

86
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,000
a brick or something

87
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,700
but uh yeah

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,560
there you go I mean I gotta ask them

89
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,598
because it costs so much hate amongst

90
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,340
the scene have you ever tried or been

91
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,798
impressed by one of the more Amsterdam

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,979
hazes like the typical Jack sort of

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,680
Terps thing or not your thing I mean I

94
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,539
came up on Jack I'm 28 years old so that

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,459
gives you how much you know knowledge I

96
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,959
got on weed I'm a [ __ ] baby compared

97
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,319
to a lot of foods that you know probably

98
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,780
got 10 20 years on me uh but uh

99
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,339
Jack is cool I [ __ ] with Jack man if you

100
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,379
[ __ ] around give me a jack cut I'll hit

101
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,918
it to Wilson and I've smoked plenty of

102
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,439
Jack and J1 and you know Super Lemon

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,060
Haze and [ __ ] like that and I mean it

104
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,719
has its placeholders just not my

105
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,699
preferred uh smoke sure and you raise an

106
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,280
interesting topic that I've been asking

107
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,500
people about for a while and that in

108
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,478
particular the Bay Area and even down to

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,978
LA and whatnot you get a lot of people

110
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,079
talking about how they're just they're

111
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,779
over the Jack turves it's just saturated

112
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,000
for them but what my perspective is is

113
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,399
that the rest of the world isn't of that

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,259
opinion they love it do you find that's

115
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,299
reflective in sort of the demand for

116
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,780
your seeds that those sorts of strains

117
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,280
still do pretty well

118
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,959
uh when it comes to the seeds man

119
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,359
there's a demographic for everything

120
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,060
just like you said you know like there

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,919
are people that love Jack you know so uh

122
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,439
I like to hit everything

123
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,560
and cover every every box

124
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,540
and uh you are right or I don't even

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,560
know if you said that but uh people do

126
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,379
there is a bigger calling for you know

127
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,019
gelatos and Skittles and and stuff like

128
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,000
that runs has is like the number one

129
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:27,120
probably trending [ __ ] strain amongst

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,519
Instagram or whatever weed uh Avenue

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,019
you're on but uh yeah these strains are

132
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,639
good for a reason you know they are good

133
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,740
all these strains that I name runs is

134
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,699
good gelato is good Skittles is great

135
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,038
I'm smoking a skittle's uh derivative so

136
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,660
uh [ __ ] yeah man I'm privy to

137
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,360
everything man it's just I like stuff

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,280
better than others yeah perfect and I

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,500
mean it's cool to hear that you're

140
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,418
you're so young and achieving what you

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,240
are and the question that comes to mind

142
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:56,879
for me is that given you probably grew

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,680
up when cookies was taking off you were

144
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,579
like getting into the Cannabis scene and

145
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,918
whatnot

146
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,779
what's your thoughts on cookies overall

147
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,060
as a strainer you because a lot of the

148
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,559
older folk have this bit of a you know

149
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,538
they're not so into it they don't like

150
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,418
it it's too new for them but you feel

151
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,159
like you love it cookies is dope cookies

152
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,680
is nice man ain't nothing wrong with

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,320
cookies man cookies is dope cookies has

154
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,079
his namesake placeholder for a reason

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,139
you know [ __ ] it's it's a good strain

156
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,478
you know yeah okay and I mean on that

157
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,819
same note you mentioned gelato you

158
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,139
mentioned Skittles and runts what's your

159
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,020
thoughts on runs do you feel like it

160
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,000
stands up to gelato or it's derivative

161
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,099
oh man it's it's two different things

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,639
gee I've I've tried it from different

163
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,979
people you know I've tried you know

164
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,800
I've tried gelato I've grown gelato I've

165
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,839
grown runts they're two different things

166
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,699
and they're both great you know and then

167
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,560
there's different gelatos too you know

168
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:58,139
we can talk 41 33 so on and so forth

169
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,600
and they're all great yeah well I mean

170
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,139
you you asked the question for me which

171
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,680
of the gelatos are you most inclined to

172
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,900
uh of 33 I think is a full

173
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,579
representation of all the gelatos you

174
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,099
know what I mean but uh I'm more

175
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,459
inclined to the 41 for show

176
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,979
yeah I I remember being at uh the

177
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,198
bobbery dispensary a while back in San

178
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,659
Fran and trying some of shebinsky's 41

179
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,520
and I was so blown away by the potency

180
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,979
like I really thought it was going to be

181
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,779
a bit hypey and I remember just looking

182
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,620
at my friend being like dude I am [ __ ]

183
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,500
up

184
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,360
people assume all wreck weed is not good

185
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,000
that's the problem you know what I mean

186
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,220
in generalizing in any aspect of life

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,720
man you're gonna be in for a treat you

188
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,520
know you're gonna you're not gonna be

189
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,259
open to new things you're gonna be in

190
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,258
your same box because you're just

191
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,538
everything is hype everything is

192
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,098
mediocre nothing lives up to you know

193
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,360
your palate you know people are like

194
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,598
that so

195
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,840
you know I'll power to him yeah okay

196
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,639
and I mean a point around gelato and

197
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,198
runs that I wanted to specifically ask

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,460
you because I think you're a master of

199
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,120
this is that

200
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:11,279
I feel like I like gelato more than runs

201
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,500
but it's undeniable that runs have done

202
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,359
a phenomenal job marketing the brand and

203
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,759
I think you excel in that in your own

204
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,139
right do you see it similar to the way

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,038
I've just put it or do you think it's a

206
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,439
bit different

207
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,060
oh man you hit it on the head uh they

208
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,740
pushed their product man and and that

209
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,019
helped shove it down people's throats

210
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,840
let alone solidify it as a namesake

211
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,399
strain in the Cannabis industry and

212
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,740
people should take notes on that you

213
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,360
know [ __ ] go make a song go hire some

214

216
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,418

217
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,338

fam like that but go get your money man

219

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,339
legacy quit being a [ __ ] a dude

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,839
sitting at a [ __ ] table on your couch

222
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,700
with a bunch of other 40 year olds

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,820
talking about how you could have did it

224
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,820
better

225
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,720
yeah I mean I've certainly seen a few of

226
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:03,600
those conversations go down and it kind

227
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,879
of segues nicely into the idea of burner

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,500
and what he has and hasn't done I

229
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,019
remember watching a YouTube video from

230
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,458
you just a day or two ago and you were

231
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,259
saying you know a lot of people

232
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,939
criticize burner they say you give him

233
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,379
too much props and you were like I think

234
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,980
I kind of give him the right amount of

235
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,620
props and it brings up this idea of like

236
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,659
the nice Sayers often hate the fact that

237
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,580
he's not the breeder but then I would

238
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,740
always respond with but he did do stuff

239
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,720
like you can't deny that he hyped it to

240
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,820
the point where it is what it is what's

241
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,600
your thoughts on Burner overall

242
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,060
Berner is a is a is a business person

243
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,060
you know what I mean uh he's over there

244
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,679
making sure he's good you know and uh

245
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,958
that's just people got to understand

246
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,439
that in life that not everything is a

247
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:52,259
honeymoon you know and that's a good uh

248
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,420
he sets the bar of what you might be

249
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,759
dealing with you know and whether it be

250
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,259
good or bad you know [ __ ] I got

251
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,519
nothing but nice things to say about

252
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,980
people because

253
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,320
you know that's how that's how I am now

254
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,459
I learned to be nice so shout out big

255
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,760
burn

256
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:11,338
yeah I feel you and I think a point that

257
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,740
kind of helped me to realize that exact

258
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,600
sentiment you just expressed is I think

259
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,879
it was sticker Farm I put up a post and

260
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,620
he said whatever you think about burner

261
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,720
like he's paved the way for people to be

262
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,820
able to feed their family for years to

263
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,440
come and I thought that's actually a

264
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,680
really unique perspective on it because

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,880
he's created this Empire kind of more so

266
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,620
than what anyone else has done around

267
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,980
any other strain

268
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,799
he made jobs Point Blank period yeah

269
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,440
that's exactly and what you can say he

270
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,299
didn't make jobs but like okay he

271
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,459
represents cookies people work at

272
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,559
cookies he made jobs

273
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,319
easy does it for me you know

274
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,199
yeah all right well let's jump back to

275
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,540
what we normally ask people first which

276
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,160
is tell me about your first experience

277
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,659
with cannabis

278
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,578
oh

279
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:02,458
damn

280
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:04,679
uh well I'm from South Central Los

281
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,479
Angeles so there's weed you know people

282
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,719
smoke their weed out here so it's not

283
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,000
like I'm a from a conservative area that

284
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,300
is not accessible so it was accessible

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,980
growing up my pops always told me he

286
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,139
didn't want to see me smoking that [ __ ]

287
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,600
because he didn't see no future in it

288
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:22,860
because of all the stigma on it you know

289
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
especially being in the hood if you got

290
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,278
caught with weed they're probably gonna

291
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,600
throw you in jail real quick you know

292
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,100
especially being a a Mexican you know

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,159
[ __ ] boom boom

294
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,820
but uh so I I was always scared of it

295
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:41,458
and then I got into eighth grade summer

296
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,980
going into ninth grade

297
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:48,119
I think uh that's when

298
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,980
I found like a my buddy in in eighth

299
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,500
grade had like a stem of some stress

300
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,300
that's what we call brick weed and he's

301
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,578
like showing it to me and and I'm like

302
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,958
what's that smell like and he's like oh

303
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:59,578
that's weed and I'm like oh can you

304
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,099
bring me some tomorrow just being a bad

305
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,599
little kid you know [ __ ] eighth

306
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,759
grader or something yeah I was an eighth

307
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,740
grader and and whatever he doesn't bring

308
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,019
me none the next day and like we just

309
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,940
smell the stem and that's like my first

310
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,639
encounter with weed it was just smelling

311
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,040
the stem of it second encounter I'm

312
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,078
hanging out with the skaters and we end

313
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,219
up in a garage I was I was a fat kid I

314
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,039
couldn't even skate dude I would

315
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,839
literally run with Chase the skaters

316
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,639
around running because I wanted to be

317
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,140
like hanging out with them you know I

318
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,699
wanted to be part of the skating crew

319
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,159
couldn't escape for [ __ ] didn't even

320
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,680
have a bike I'm just like running behind

321
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,699
these kids and uh we end up in a garage

322
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,559
and

323
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,660
whatever one of their older brothers

324
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,000
lights up in there and dude I ran out

325
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,519
that [ __ ] so fast I gotta go

326
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,700
like this is scary

327
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,899
so yeah but I think finally ninth grade

328
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,220
came around

329
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:55,379
and I I got some weed from Javonte

330
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,360
he's one of my classmates and and I went

331
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:59,639
home and I rolled it up and there used

332
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,139
to be a cul-de-sac with like a dead end

333
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,240
place where all the transients would

334
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,220
sleep in in South Central and I rolled

335
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,159
it up in a joint but I didn't break it

336
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,680
down and I lit it up and the [ __ ] was

337
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,000
just falling out dude like the nugs the

338
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,278
compressed nugs would just fall out the

339
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,799
joint and I'm like whatever you know I

340
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,480
gave it my best shot I go back just and

341
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,919
whatever that was a failed attempt so I

342
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,959
haven't got high yet three times with

343
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,360

345
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,339

experience getting really high was with

00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,439
like cat piss I guess that's some of the

357
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,480
perks of growing up where you did were

358
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,399
you aware of any other strains that were

359
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,579
popular around that time

360
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,679
not completely oblivious to anybody that

361
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:06,659
smoked marijuana just like a little you

362
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,120

fantastic so was that the experience

367
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,980
that kind of solidified it for you that

368
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,379
you were like hey I'm gonna be involved

369

another one where you really like

371
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,839
realized hey cannabis is what I want to

372
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,940
do with my life

373

374
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,820

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,500
just want to get high you know not all

376
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,420

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,278
to become all the time you know not that

378
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:45,419

from there to your first grow like how

385
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,539
many years went by and what kind of

386
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,600
inspired you to first kind of plant a

387
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:05,519
seed or to grow one out

388

it in the cup and put it in the backyard

392
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,500
and watch it grow a little bit maybe

393
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,958

470
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,980
to how you mentioned your dad introduced

471
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,839
you to his friend was he like did you

472
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,220
consider the product he was producing at

473
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,139
the time to be good quality or do you

474
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,779
think he still was kind of figuring

475
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,520
things out himself I I I thought it was

476
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,859
good I thought it was cool it wasn't

477
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,019
like now that I look back it was you

478
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:33,599
know not that great but like at that

479
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:36,298
moment seen that much at any given time

480
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,159

481
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,379

485
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,639
a hobby grower himself or did he have

486
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,980

489
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,919
as far as uh what he was growing but he

490
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,600
he you know he he grew a lot of weed

491
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,919
that's for [ __ ] show

492
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,980
hell yeah

493
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,840
so you uh you kind of explained the

494
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,579
mediums what were the other aspects of

495
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,859
the grow going on like were they using

496
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,480
just like HPS lights what was the

497
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,099
situation oh no this is outdoor they

498
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,140
were doing outdoor this was outdoor

499
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,119
marijuana whatever indoor they did I I

500
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,020
didn't dive into that to this day I've

501
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,639
yet to like I have go walk into numerous

502
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,619
grows I've had my own little four

503
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,020
lighter that you know didn't go as

504
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:34,079
planned but I you know used it to what I

505
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:35,819
used it for and uh you know [ __ ]

506
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,220
you've never seen like a picture of me

507
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:39,538
like hey you know crushing my 20 lighter

508
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,740
never ever because it's never happened

509
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,200
you know

510
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,000
yeah sure so would you say that you like

511
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,500
predominantly you like to work more

512
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,480
Outdoors or it's just the experience you

513
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,579
have no that's that's what I know I just

514
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,380
know how to grow outdoor yeah a whole

515
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,339
lot of it nothing wrong with that

516
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,860
yeah so from that point was it mostly

517
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,879
this uh your father's friend who you

518
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,139
were kind of looking to for

519
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,640
inspirational knowledge or were there

520
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,320
any like bigger breeders you would

521
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,179
become aware of and you were like wow

522
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,939
this person knows what they're doing

523
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,400
well you know first it was you know uh

524
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,279
Ray my dad's buddy that uh you know

525
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,720
taught me the the 50 50 formula and then

526
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,819
I'd have buddies come over and be like

527
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,740
dude Miracle grows terrible like you're

528
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:21,899
supposed to use Fox Farm and I'm like

529
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,779
okay here goes nothing Fox Mark you know

530
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,880
and then [ __ ] hopped on Instagram and

531
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,279
people were like organic organic organic

532
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
and you know whatever organic at that

533
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,240
point I had like

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,220
figured out how to use Fox Farm and

535
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,599
General Hydroponics and [ __ ] like that

536
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,519
that's what I was using by the time I

537
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,798
hopped on Instagram and then I go on

538
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,679
Instagram and they're doing Organics and

539
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,200
it was like this crew called Summit dogs

540
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,419
they were using a nectar for the God so

541
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,460
I started using nectar for the gods and

542
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,020
then I started seeing this uh the K net

543
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,120
farmer dude and I'm like whoa like

544
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,700
that's like Wizardry dude like you're

545
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,859
over there [ __ ] like what like what

546
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,620
are you doing with that milk huh and

547
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:03,178
then I dove into knf and then I just you

548
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:06,058
know I went into a rabbit hole of that

549
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,380
ended up with jadam jadam said k f was

550
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,700
trash throw that whole book in the trash

551
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,679
and I'm like okay I'm just gonna stop

552
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,480
here go back to what I know and it's

553
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,840
keeping plants really green which is

554
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,819
with salts so now and and whatever I do

555
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,439
salts but I do it works now is basically

556
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,839
what I'm trying to say

557
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,400
sure that's a very interesting sort of

558
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,139
progression you've had through the

559
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,000
various growth Styles and it's cool to

560
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,059
hear that you've tried both sides of the

561
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,279
coin so to speak overall do you

562
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:34,319
subscribe to the idea that a lot of

563
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,720
people do where it's that like organic

564
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,220
is the best and product you can get or

565
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,960
do you think you can do just as well

566
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,298
with any sort of thing

567
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,880
oh man I've had some really good organic

568
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,440
[ __ ] man I'm not gonna lie but uh the

569
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,880
thing is I'm growing for seed production

570
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,220
so you know if if uh if it was up to me

571
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,159
I'd Bust It Out organic you know [ __ ]

572
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,319
when you go eat fruit was better organic

573
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,780
or [ __ ] the other one you know

574
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,899
yeah of course I think that's an analogy

575
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:07,558
that I often fall back on to myself so

576
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,419
from that point there what was it like

577
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,279
before you kind of became a breeder did

578
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,900
you spend some time just Fino hunting

579
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,418
things and figuring out the ropes and

580
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,460
kind of collecting clones like what was

581
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,860
happening before you started breeding

582
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,600
breeding breeding was like [ __ ] the

583
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:24,779
chocolate chip cookie for me man people

584
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:27,178
uh people would see accidental

585
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,819
pollinations in my yard and inquire on

586
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:32,038
them and then I'd be like whoa like

587
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,779
[ __ ] I should go do an intentional

588
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,259
one you know so

589
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:40,319
that became the the Tropicana cherry pie

590
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:44,279
Tangy Mel that I ended up giving to my

591
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,259
buddy uh warped he brought it back and

592
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,940
I'm still growing for you know cash crop

593
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,679
or whatever kind of blast it all into

594
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,740
shatter or whatever the case

595
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,960
and not knowing that I'm creating a dope

596
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,940
ass Seed where he's created a dope ass

597
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,980
seat at his house but I'm getting half

598
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,380
of them because I provided the mail or

599
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,940
whatever amount I'm getting and I put

600
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,740
them [ __ ] right for so as soon

601
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,298
as I got them and everybody's like dope

602
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,419
I want some it was agent orange

603
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:11,940
Tropicana cherry pie Tangy and it was a

604
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:16,020
plushberry Tropicana cherry pie Tangy

605
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,759
and people inquired and and the demand

606
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,279
was really high and [ __ ] I'm like

607
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,038
cool like I've been busting my ass

608
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,899
forever growing all these you know

609
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,839
plants in the backyard not forever but

610
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,580
as long as I've had then and and it's

611
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,279
high risk because I got to grow them as

612
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:34,918
big as possible and get as much as I can

613
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,779
in the middle of Compton [ __ ] and and

614
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,380
cross my fingers that I do it right you

615
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:42,359
know what I mean and uh you know [ __ ]

616
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,460
it just made sense to start making seeds

617
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,339
and establishing my seeds right then and

618
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,480
there so I just did it and my thing is

619
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:49,740
like you got to do it before it's

620
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,200
saturated you got to do it before

621
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,240
everybody else you know and you got to

622
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,159
do it Point Blank period so I just did

623
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,359
it boom we did the Tropicana cherry pie

624
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,659
Tangy

625
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,359
I [ __ ] made my uh homage all the way

626
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,760
to chalice and and [ __ ] in my mom's

627
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,099
car and it broke down on the way there I

628
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,259
[ __ ] smoking and steaming I'm like

629
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,538
[ __ ] this we're making it there we pull

630
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:14,038
up and and and [ __ ] I go say hi to

631
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,200
Oni because I'm already growing some of

632
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,879
the Tropicana uh the Cherry Pie Tangy

633
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,100
stuff which was uh one of the first

634
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,140
strains they had made for the Oni Banner

635
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,000
and uh I go and I meet Oni and they're

636
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,820
like you're [ __ ] batshit crazy like

637
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,919
what are you doing here like you're poor

638
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:30,839
you're supposed to be in Compton with

639
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,460
your shitty plants or whatever you know

640
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,379
and I'm like yeah well I'm here you know

641
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,659
he's like man here have these uh seeds

642
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,440
and you know have this hash and I go

643
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,780
home

644
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,298
and it's the papaya Femmes like the

645
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:45,359
first papaya availability one of the

646
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:47,579
first papaya strains on the market and I

647
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,558
grow those Tropicana F2 one of the first

648
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:51,720
people to grow Tropicana F2 which is

649

690
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,340
mean there's so many things I want to

691
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,440
ask you about that last little answer

692
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,538
you had I mean you touched on the papaya

693
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,700
for a long time there was what I think

694
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:37,859
is an incorrect rumor going around that

695
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,200
papaya was just a renamed Green Crack

696
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:42,959
what's your thoughts have you heard this

697
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,000
rumor yeah I think my buddy roster

698
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,919
that's in jail he was a meme guy back in

699
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,558
the day he was under the moniker of the

700
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,720
roster he actually started that rumor I

701
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,778
believe because I'm I'm I don't know

702
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,919
like I'll be a self-proclaimed like I'm

703
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:58,319
one of the

704
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,299
probably original meme guys like when it

705
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,158
comes to the weed memes like I'm the guy

706

710
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:13,558

and like he'll send it to Oni and only

715
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,720

or I've overheard someone ask and uh The

727
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,058
Story Goes that it's a cut from Pink

House in Colorado or some [ __ ] like that

729
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:56,278
that was uh that Harry Palm smoked and

730
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:59,400
he's like I really need this and he

731
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:01,980
brought it to the masses via cut you

732
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,120
know uh reversing it hitting it to other

733
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,079
things

734
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,819
Etc

735
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,519
yeah but that's what it is what what

736
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,678
seed stock it's from uh I don't [ __ ]

737
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,538
know you know uh and you know it's

738
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,600
something I can easily ask those foods

739
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:18,119
but it's like Papaya's papaya so that's

740

kind of that for me yeah sure good

741
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,019
answer and I mean I guess it begs the

742
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,359
question what's your thoughts on Green

743
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,038
Crack it's also like blue dream a bit of

744
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,678
a polarizing one

745
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,900

746
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,820

753
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,659
I love that so just to jump back a

754
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,158
moment you were talking about the first

755
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,720
kind of strains you were playing with

756
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,460
and they're a bit of a mistake but they

757
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,259
worked out being great and you mentioned

758
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,798
that one of the mothers was agent orange

759
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:01,319
the other was the plush berry I've for a

760
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,940
long time been a fan of TGA regardless

761
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,558
of what you think about sub and all the

762
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,200
rest I thought they put out some pretty

763
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,240
nice work what's your thoughts on TJ did

764
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,880
you like to grow their stuff

765
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,859
uh I never grown any TGA that was grown

766
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,278
by warp genetics he did that pollination

767
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:19,859
for me those were his moms but uh [ __ ]

768
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,558
man dude's an OG [ __ ] that's that's

769
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:25,139
for sure I've heard some weird [ __ ] but

770
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,178
like who cares I mean who cares that

771
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,860
like like you know show me the papers

772
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,899
and then I'll care but you know

773
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,759
everything is hearsay until I see it on

774
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:35,459
paper for me because the internet you

775
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,960
know don't don't hear everything I mean

776
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,159
don't don't believe everything you hear

777
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,340
and [ __ ]

778
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,778
sure so with that in mind what was the

779
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,000
you know we've heard about some of the

780
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:46,859
stuff that was unintentionally made what

781
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,619
was the first cross you intentionally

782
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:51,839
made and did it work out to work well or

783
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,658
didn't work out so well oh yeah the

784
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,778
first intentional crosses were uh the

785

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,200
early on in the game I asked now it's

810
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,658
I'm at a point where it's just I'm In My

811
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,720
Own Lane now you know [ __ ] if if I

812
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,919
get a cut from from a breeder and he's

813
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,079
like hey

814
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,360
respected that's different because I got

815
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,960
it hand to hand with a breeder you know

816
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:15,119
now if I went and bought some seeds it's

817
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,460
mine now you know those are my seeds and

818
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,898
and whatever I do with them [ __ ] it

819
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,399
shouldn't it shouldn't affect you

820
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:22,439
because you should be doing something

821
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,839
different anyways you know

822
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,820
yeah sure and I mean you just touched on

823
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,278
a very pertinent question I was going to

824
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:32,879
ask you a bit later on would you say

825
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,440
that generally speaking you preach that

826
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,600
sort of philosophy yourself in terms of

827
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,759
if someone buys your seeds they can kind

828
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,319
of do with it what they want or do you

829
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,940
feel like it is kind of good manners at

830
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,038
least just to try to reach out and just

831
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,519
you know touch base sort of thing

832
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,679
uh you can reach out but [ __ ] don't

833
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,480
be mad when they say no so you it's

834
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,399
better if you kill first and then ask

835
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,019
questions later you know and [ __ ]

836
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:56,459
what are they gonna [ __ ] do you know

837
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:59,339
what I mean [ __ ] you could get off

838
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,440
Instagram like oh man you know like

839
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:03,778
people are crazy like that [ __ ] it's

840
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,919
not it shouldn't bother you deep like

841
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:09,839
that uh now if you have like a

842
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,278
there's positions that you're in like if

843
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,658
you're just a random person this

844
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,000
shouldn't you should be like dude go

845
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,278
ahead you know make more seed stock you

846
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,619
know if it's a big person you should be

847
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,000
like hey [ __ ] you guy you know kind of

848
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:22,439
but like flattered because they're so

849
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,359
big they want to do it but it shouldn't

850
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,820
mess with you it shouldn't affect you

851
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,079
you know and and they should respect you

852
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,898
enough like you shouldn't make people

853
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,359
mad too you know because I will go F2

854
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:36,658
your [ __ ] and sell it for a penny you

855
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,579
know [ __ ] [ __ ] like that so like

856
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,980
it's just it's just there's there's

857
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:43,859
equations to everything you know not

858
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,798
everything is the same answer so yes and

859
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:49,199
no you know it's well yeah you know

860
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:52,798
[ __ ] it's like like for instance

861
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,620
calculator gave me a cut uh we did a

862
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,480
project don't release the seeds okay

863
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:02,038
that's because that's a that's like a

864
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,899
written formal contract now hey man uh I

865
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:05,940
see you made a cross with my things like

866
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,099
you shouldn't be selling that that's

867
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,960
different like was there ever any formal

868
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,599
thing do you have a disclaimer on your

869
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,038
bag like where is your backup is this

870
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,839
some Unwritten [ __ ] do you feel

871
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:19,440
threatened like you're having a bad day

872
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:21,898
like is it [ __ ] like that people that

873
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,600
get grab testers and and make seeds with

874
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:27,298
them I I could understand that too

875
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:29,339
but uh but also there has to be that

876
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:32,579
that foreground like hey these are

877
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:35,220
testers uh they're for you to have an

878
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:36,000
opportunity not to start a [ __ ] Seed

879
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,319
Company

880
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,659
you know

881
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,058
yeah I agree there's there's obviously a

882
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,860
lot of nuance in varying different

883
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,500
situations as to what sort of the

884
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,119
approach the approach to take it raises

885
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,179
the question for me and you raise you

886
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:54,000
raise capillator himself I often kind of

887
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:56,340
scratch my head a little bit at how cap

888
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,259
gets a bit frustrated at how the Mach 1

889
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:00,538
is you know everyone and his dogs able

890
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,278
to get their hands on it these days and

891
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,200
he you know he harps on about how he was

892
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,298
just meant to be given out to the ogs

893
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,280
and you deserve it and stuff but then I

894
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:09,480
also think about bodhi's sentiment where

895
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,099
he says look if you don't want something

896
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,079
getting out you just shouldn't give it

897
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,280
out like

898
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,418
um what's your thoughts on that do you

899
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,119
think like if you give a clone to

900
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:21,480
someone it's inevitably gonna get out

901
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:24,780
uh yeah man [ __ ] that that that's

902
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,539
that's you know that's

903
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,519
that might happen and the way I do it I

904
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:31,440
just poke fun at the situation and like

905
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,239
the first time I met cap

906
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,039
I was like how much like I think I told

907
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,319
him something like hey like how much can

908
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,179
I sell my Mac one for or something like

909
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,700
that and he just looked at me like you

910
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,440
[ __ ] [ __ ]

911
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:46,019
and like that's that was like my way of

912
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,320
breaking the ice you know [ __ ]

913
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:51,418
so uh yeah you know and and it kind of

914
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,519
like throws him off like like what the

915
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,259
[ __ ] guy like you know that I'm I get

916
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:59,039
mad about this and you're over here like

917
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,020
joking about it you know so [ __ ] yeah

918
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,239
yeah just break the ice

919
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,400
yeah I agree I think there's definitely

920
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:08,459
some humor to be had in that situation

921
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,858
so if we just rewind a little bit you

922
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:13,380
mentioned that you actually crossed a

923
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,299
dosie dough male I believe to Blue Dream

924
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,338
in the past

925
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,660
um what's your thoughts on dosey doe I

926
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:20,639
feel like it's a cool strain but it's

927
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:23,098
also kind of fallen off a little bit did

928
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,098
you find much success in that mail

929
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,800
oh uh people love the blue though man

930
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:31,260
and it was a very small seed stock and

931
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,119
people loved it to the point where I

932
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,579
have a clone of it it's probably like

933
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,460
two years old already now uh probably

934
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:41,280
older probably two I just love adding

935
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,740
years to [ __ ] but it's just it's it's at

936
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,119
least two years old or who knows my

937
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,979
buddy uh

938
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,920
Maga cannabis

939
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,139
uh or whatever his name is uh he he sent

940
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,420
me that cut and I hit it to Wilson again

941
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:57,179
not again I hit it to my Wilson keeper

942
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,380
but and I've had tons of flower of it

943
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:04,139
cash uh everybody that's grown it loves

944
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,880
it you know like I hate to [ __ ] put

945
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:08,219
cream on my taco but it's never been

946
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,800
like hey this Pluto sucks I've never

947
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:13,199
gotten that response and very very you

948
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,619
know it's probably like 50 to 100 packs

949
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:20,939
it wasn't that big of a drop but uh it

950
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:22,200
was very successful uh seat strap and I

951
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,420
put energy into it like we were talking

952
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,000
about marketing earlier like Bluto

953
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,579
happened to be the only strain I had

954
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,739
in the making at the time so all my

955
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,200
energy

956
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:36,838
marketing got put into that one strain

957
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,639
as opposed to now where I'm just like in

958
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,159
full production and it's like everything

959
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,379
Times Wilson so it's kind of hard to you

960
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,358
know nitpick which is like the one for

961
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,800
you you know so it's all like just go on

962
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,179
the site now it's not like go on the

963
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,859
site type in your favorite strain it's

964
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,960
probably across the Wilson that's what I

965
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:54,659
that's kind of the wave now

966
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,220
so a good answer and I think part of the

967
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:58,739
reason why I brought that question up is

968
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:00,598
because you know I I really like all of

969
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,699
Fletcher from archives work but

970
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,859
sometimes he does get a bit uh

971
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:07,439
frustrated when people breed with dosey

972
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:10,440
doe I I it feels to me as though he

973
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,159
wants to have sort of exclusive breeding

974
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,980
with males from that one did you did you

975
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,440
find any issues with that from him or

976
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,039
anything like that or it was all Bueno

977
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,720
I mean [ __ ] I know I'm I'm I know for

978
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,338
a fact he knows who I am [ __ ]

979
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,259
everybody knows who the [ __ ] I am but uh

980
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:30,299
when I did that [ __ ] I didn't [ __ ]

981
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,680
know who uh who made that [ __ ] I was

982
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,740
just grabbing dosey doe hitting at the

983
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:37,799
blue dream like that's how uh oblivious

984
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:39,179
I can be to you know the game The

985
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Players

986
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,480
Etc like I'm just out here having fun

987
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,260
[ __ ] the Fletcher would have hit me

988
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,519
up but I'm like oh what was happening

989
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,280
[ __ ] to this day it's all like I'm

990
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,179
not here to make anybody Madden at this

991
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
point

992
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:55,500
uh they shouldn't make me mad either

993
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,820
[ __ ] we're all human dude [ __ ] you

994
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,679
don't like something shut the [ __ ] up

995
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,559
stay in your corner leave me alone

996
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:02,759
so and something about the Dosey dough

997
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:04,980
which a few other breeders have done

998
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,599
with other strains is that there's like

999
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,639
different releases where there's like

1000
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,559
you know the number four the number 22

1001
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,960
the number 18. like all these different

1002
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,358
sort of variations on it do you think

1003
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,920
you would ever do a project like that

1004
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,019
with maybe Wilson where there's like

1005
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,700
these different sort of brothers and

1006
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,500
sisters using the breeding or you just

1007
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:24,480
like to stick with the keeper

1008
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,940
now this that's what I'm doing actually

1009
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,179
right now I'm popping like [ __ ] 200

1010
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:33,358
Wilson seeds and I'm gonna do that and I

1011
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:35,219
have my Wilson keeper Mel around and you

1012
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,838
know we're just gonna have some uh we're

1013
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,239
gonna make all the 40 year olds and up

1014
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:40,858
happy

1015
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,319
I love it I love it and out of curiosity

1016
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:46,199
do you remember which of the dosey doe

1017
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,780
variants you used in the blue dough

1018
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,519
it was pollen gifted from my buddy turt

1019
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Factory that he found he sent it from

1020
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:55,559
Colorado

1021
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,420
okay cool yeah so you mentioned it

1022
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,159
earlier but I'll get you to repeat it

1023
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,900
because the question we got more than

1024
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,118
any other question from the fans was

1025
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,800
what is the genetics of Wilson some

1026
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,160
people thought it was just a trop F2

1027
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,079
some people said banana papaya trop can

1028
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:15,539
you iron it out for them

1029
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,320
uh Wilson F1 that I made for Oni Seed

1030
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:20,400
Company

1031
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,980
is banana OG papaya from Femme seed

1032
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,800
stock that I found

1033
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,500
times Tropicana F2

1034
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:32,339
people get it confused with Wilson zero

1035
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,219
which is Oni noodles only seed companies

1036
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:38,338
interpretation of you know almost the

1037
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:41,759
same strain but with his selection of

1038
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:45,358
banana OG papaya from female seed stock

1039
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,240
hit to his Tropicana F1 that is his

1040
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:51,420
Flagship Mel used in you know almost

1041
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,338
every string until recently he's uh been

1042
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,400
using different medals

1043
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:58,500
cool cool and what sort of like flavors

1044
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,320
and structures can people expect Wilson

1045
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,699
to bring to crosses

1046
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,700
oh man uh

1047
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,960
I like to say it just

1048
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,940
brings hash to product you know

1049
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,338
everything seems to wash a little better

1050
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,639
with some Wilson in there but I've never

1051
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:20,759
got like a scientist or anybody to take

1052
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,739
data like oh like this is pre-washed

1053
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,859
without Wilson you know this is the mom

1054
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:28,379
that you hit pre-wilson and this is it

1055
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:30,719
like we got numbers for you buddy but uh

1056
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,720
what what I do get from Wilson is a

1057
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:37,980
[ __ ] uh it's just continuing like

1058
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:40,618
lineage like isolating a clone uh

1059
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,139
Terrapin profile Times Wilson getting a

1060
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,200
derivative of anything and and the

1061
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:48,960
easiest form as opposed to sitting Cuts

1062
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:52,439
you know keeping Cuts Like You can have

1063
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,240
a big ass [ __ ] bag of seeds with the

1064
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,460
flavor in there you know what I mean and

1065
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,459
and it's easy to give it to people as

1066
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,800
opposed to a mom that you gotta keep

1067
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,420
clean and you know hopefully it makes it

1068
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,920
across the country because it's not

1069
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,440
going to make it to [ __ ] Spain or

1070
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,180
whatever it's just that's what I I do

1071
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,480
and that's what Wilson does Wilson is my

1072
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:15,059
boy that [ __ ] everybody and allows me

1073
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,639
to get seeds of it and it just so

1074
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,679
happens that people are you know happy

1075
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,679
with the seeds no matter what the

1076
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,719
progeny of it [ __ ] I just say hey man

1077
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,858
it makes it Ashmore because you know it

1078
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,919
probably does and that's what people

1079
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:31,259
were telling me Wilson washes itself it

1080
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,838
hits like five six any given [ __ ]

1081
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,160
Pinot hunt so uh from the seed like you

1082
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,619
just grab a seat throw it in the ground

1083
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,719
you're gonna get some hash but Wilson so

1084
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,720
we'll say it brings that brings sexiness

1085
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:45,358
to the plant so you can grab a land race

1086
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:48,059
like uh Malawi or something like that

1087
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,400
and hit it to Wilson and now you got you

1088
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,799
know not fully blown purple weed but you

1089
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,579
know purple Hues you know undertones of

1090
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,019
purple which is brings that you know so

1091
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,420
it does it does some [ __ ] for the plant

1092
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:03,619
you know bag appeal you know

1093
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,358
hash that's what it does

1094
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:09,180
lovely and I mean we'll touch on some

1095
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:12,179
concentrate stuff later I'd just love to

1096
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:14,098
ask you quickly what was the creation of

1097
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,139
Wilson like like where did the name come

1098
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,400
from were you watching Castaway or how

1099
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:20,039
did it come about

1100
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,220
well uh I'm not too big on naming

1101
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:26,039
strains that's the thing Oni named them

1102
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:29,639
uh banana OG papaya is called castaway

1103
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:32,519
so I cross Cast Away to Tropicana F2

1104
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:35,159
that ended up becoming Wilson like a

1105
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,139
play on you know already

1106
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:40,199
you know Castaway so that's how that

1107
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:41,699
became that and it turned into [ __ ]

1108
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,338
this whole thing you know and it's still

1109
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:47,039
relevant with uh you know Tom Hanks

1110
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:49,799
getting coronavirus as soon as you know

1111
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,539
the [ __ ] and it just so happens he

1112
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,460
yells Wilson out in the [ __ ] movies

1113
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:55,380
it's just it's perfect time and

1114
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,380
everything happens for a reason

1115
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,720
I love it and so what was the decision

1116
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,940
like to breed with the male did you Fino

1117
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,439
hunt the seeds first and find a killer

1118
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,539
female and you were like damn I gotta

1119
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,300
find a male of this or how did it go

1120
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:12,480
yeah yeah so uh out of all of them out

1121
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,880
of all the females like Wilson was you

1122
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,760
know the one that was different it was

1123
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,400
something untapped you know papaya punch

1124
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,800
smelled too much like you know either

1125
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,220
papaya or was too Punchy the three cam

1126
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,318
uh papaya was just too much papaya the

1127
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:30,000
dosey doe and the Cato they just weren't

1128
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,880
as good as the Wilson so that left the

1129
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,980
Wilson and uh I went and we had a

1130
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,880
festival in San Francisco and we all sat

1131
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,619
down

1132
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,420
and I had made these crosses no no

1133
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,180
I hadn't made these crosses but I had

1134
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,099
went back home and they're like hey dude

1135
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:48,239
uh no we were in San Francisco I had

1136
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,700
made these crosses and they're like you

1137
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,159
got to pick one you know like to be the

1138
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:54,598
one and I'm like well [ __ ] I'm growing a

1139
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:56,699
bunch of them at the house right now I

1140
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,519
got like at least 30 of each growing

1141
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,439
right now of those five strains and I'm

1142
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,000
like uh they're like the Wilson's the

1143
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,460
one and I'm like yeah the Wilson's the

1144
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,260
one and I'm like well [ __ ] I got a bunch

1145
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,139
of males of them and I'm gonna go

1146
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,339
through them and you know that's how you

1147
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:13,500
know we started hitting everything with

1148
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:16,259
Wilson and that's how Wilson became the

1149
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,818
go-to you know strain and [ __ ] it

1150
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,280
worked out

1151
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:22,920
yeah and it was talked about it was

1152
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,480
talked about it wasn't spontaneous we

1153
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,480
did sit down

1154
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,539
and we did you know brainstorming like

1155
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,639
you know go home we being Oni noodles

1156
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:35,880
and Harry Palms was at the table that

1157
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,259
day when he was working with Oni and uh

1158
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,000
you're gonna go home and you're gonna

1159
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,700
get a Wilson and you know that's gonna

1160
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,619
be your namesake you know and [ __ ]

1161
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:45,719
here we are today

1162
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,480
sure and you mentioned earlier that

1163
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:51,059
oni's version of Wilson the Wilson zero

1164
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,159
is using their selection different males

1165
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,900
and whatnot have you ever kind of

1166
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,980
compared them side by side and do you

1167
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,119
think they're more similar than

1168
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,818
different or they're quite different

1169
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,519
because the selections just differ

1170
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:05,940
oh they're different man uh uh oni's uh

1171
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:08,639
trop F1 it really uh

1172
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,400
the progeny of it is is you know

1173
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,799
completely you know uh

1174
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,180
it just it stands out compared to you

1175
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,859
know my trop F2 you know so it's

1176
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:21,480
different it's different weed different

1177
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:24,179
selection different week

1178
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,800
sure sure and something you mentioned

1179
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,618
earlier which I think is a hugely

1180
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,839
relevant point is that you've got to

1181
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:32,940
like get the project made and out there

1182
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:34,679
before the time comes and goes and that

1183
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,039
was something he referenced in regards

1184
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:39,899
to that truck cherry pie Tangy mail what

1185
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,599
I'm interested to know is it seems like

1186
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,818
the Wilson is come at a very opportune

1187
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,740
time like that sort of flavor profile it

1188
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:48,539
has is Big at the moment and it's not

1189
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,338
like you know because some breeders will

1190
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:52,380
realize something's big and then try to

1191
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:53,940
get that sort of cross done and then by

1192
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,640
the time it's out there at Market it's

1193
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,920
it's come and gone what's your thoughts

1194
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,940
on the current flavor situation within

1195
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,800
the scene and do you have any

1196
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,539
predictions for what might be the next

1197
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,260
big flavor

1198
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:10,679
oh man people I think people are going

1199
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,720
back to the the the wheel which is oh

1200
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,940

yeah so you mentioned the term Force

1260
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,500
collab is that sort of like a thing

1261
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,838
where someone's a bit upset with a cross

1262
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,699
you're making and so to kind of uh you

1263
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,039

1264
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:46,618
collab or what did you mean by that oh

1265
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,779
that just means I just you know [ __ ]

1266
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,579
just do the collab without any consent

1267
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,079
kind of the kill now ask questions later

1268

seeds and I crossed on the Wilson Force

1270
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:58,400
Collette

1271
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,400
I love that

1272
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,140
pulls from the other side of what I was

1273
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,619
thinking okay that's cool yeah that's

1274
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:10,019
cool so what would be your advice for

1275
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:11,338
sort of a newbie breeder like someone

1276
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:13,739
who's looking to get a bit more

1277
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:15,539
notoriety how should they go about doing

1278
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:20,399

like you gotta use your platform so you

1283
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:33,659
know you gotta talk to people at least I

1284
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,459
think you do I mean you so you got to be

00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,318
kind of you know you gotta have good

1286

communication skills

1287
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:41,818
can't be [ __ ] an introvert you gotta

1288
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,500
gotta put out a little bit give them a

1289
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:46,259
little bit of taste of your work your

1290
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,900
life but I mean maybe you don't maybe

1291
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,079
I'm wrong but that's what I did I just

1292
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:54,180
kept kept it cool kept it real

1293
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,579
keep it honest if I don't know this [ __ ]

1294
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,919
don't lie about it don't got to come up

1295
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:01,318
with any story as I go just

1296
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,539
keep it 100 man

1297
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:06,719
so and I think you know that was a bit

1298
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:08,759
of a segue question in terms of I think

1299
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,039
that you've done very well on Instagram

1300
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,020
in terms of building a following getting

1301
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,659
people to be aware of the brand and the

1302
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,480
crosses do you think it's possible for a

1303
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:20,578
sort of fledgling breeder to be able to

1304
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,400
succeed in the current landscape without

1305
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:24,960
being sort of active on a social media

1306
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,119
or Instagram

1307
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,519
yeah someone asked that last time

1308
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,800
they're like what what like what would

1309
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,199
you be using if it was an Instagram well

1310
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,700
we there'd be another form there'd be

1311
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:38,939
another place you know it'd be YouTube

1312
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:41,338
it'd be Facebook it'd be any given form

1313
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,380
[ __ ] it'd be Word of Mouth

1314
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:45,358
however you got to get it I you know

1315
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,800
when I before I was breeding you know

1316
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:47,519
making seeds whatever you want to call

1317
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,940
it

1318
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:53,759
uh I was backpacking the weed I grew in

1319
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:57,380
my backyard from shop to shop you know

1320
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,640
selling that so you know [ __ ]

1321
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,200
that's what you'd end up doing but it

1322
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,358
wouldn't be as successful I think

1323
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,460
because you know it just so happens

1324
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,440
there's a lot of [ __ ] on

1325
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,400
Instagram it's easy to use it's user

1326
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,980
friendly

1327
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,838
and it's easy to you know get that

1328
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,960
message across on here as opposed to

1329
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,880
going on a whole last form not not user

1330
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,579
friendly not being able to put a face to

1331
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,380
a product Facebook a couple channels

1332
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:24,960
it's just the most

1333
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,780
convenient thing for people when it

1334
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,019
comes to weed like that so and I guess

1335
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:33,240
an extension of that would be that I

1336
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:35,039
feel like you're you're quite a

1337
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:36,719
polarizing figure to some people on

1338
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,639
Instagram I think most of the people I

1339
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,739
talk to really enjoy your content and

1340
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,960
the memes there are obviously some who

1341
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:45,598
are not so into it why do you think

1342
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,119
people view you as a polarizing figure

1343
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,818
and do you think that it's a case of

1344
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:54,838
just any publicity's good publicity

1345
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:57,119
no no not even that any any publicity

1346
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:59,519
like I would I don't want to be known as

1347
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,660
uh there's people that think that's the

1348
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,699
case and they're like just doing

1349
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,019
terrible like dude all the publicity

1350
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:06,539
you're getting just [ __ ] terrible

1351
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:09,960
like that's not the case you know so

1352
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:13,800
with me I think they just relate to like

1353
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,900
he's I can do that too you know he from

1354
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,880
the bottom to the top you know [ __ ]

1355
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,400
people's if they see me grow the

1356
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,559
foundation they're like they're like

1357
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,318
what the [ __ ] how did you do it you know

1358
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,839
where what's like the trick you know and

1359
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,420
and the trick is just just you know stay

1360
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:33,420
grounded keep your job build your dream

1361
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,920
and uh you know hopefully cross your

1362
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,960
fingers and that you did your dream

1363
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,900
writing you built it up right work hard

1364
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,460
of course but that's all that cliche

1365
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,160
[ __ ] that garyvee could tell you in any

1366
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:46,920
given video

1367
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:48,239
oh good old garyvee so you referenced

1368
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,099
earlier that

1369
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,919
um you know you're you're the meme guy

1370
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:55,200
so to speak how did this come about you

1371
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,318
know were you always sort of like uh a

1372
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:02,879
jokester sort of guy growing up yeah man

1373
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:05,519
I grew up on 4chan dude uh I would go uh

1374
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,880
to go visit my brother in college

1375
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,440
and he went to UC Santa Cruz and you

1376
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,720
know there they would nerd out his

1377
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,338
buddies and they would be on 4chan and I

1378
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,159
just thought it was the edgiest [ __ ] in

1379
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:19,619
the world and I kind of just would lurk

1380
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:23,879
every day every now and then I go on

1381
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:27,240
there and uh I've just been uh aware of

1382
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,240
memes longer than most people have so

1383
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:31,739
you know I got 10 000 hours of memes on

1384
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,799
them so it's like

1385
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:37,500
it's [ __ ] I'm the [ __ ] outlier

1386
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,000
when it comes to that [ __ ] there you go

1387
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,318
yeah you've uh what is it you've

1388
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,139
mastered it you've put in your ten

1389
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:46,440
thousand hours yeah straight up that's

1390
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:49,078
facts G so I guess the question is do

1391
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,599
memes sell packs or do you think they

1392
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,818
just grab people's attention enough so

1393
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,880
they can then push

1394
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:58,800
Elon Musk said it the best G

1395
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,660
memes control the world or some [ __ ]

1396
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,460
like that

1397
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:04,679
it certainly feels like it's the

1398
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,420
Zeitgeist and that like people respond

1399
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:09,539
to it definitely

1400
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:12,659
yeah my wife was talking to me in the

1401
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:14,159
car the other day that people were older

1402
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:16,519
they're going to be looking at memes

1403
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:19,739
like a piece of art like oh this meme

1404
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:21,480
came out like the dong the black dude

1405
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:23,098
with the dong you know in Corona or

1406
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,019
whatever happened like they're gonna

1407
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:26,400
bring that up on a screen in a college

1408
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:28,440
and they're going to be talking about it

1409
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,019
they're going to be like oh you know the

1410
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,338
great meme of the coronavirus epidemic

1411
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,838
and [ __ ] like that

1412
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:36,659
his art

1413
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:39,838
yeah it will be very interesting to see

1414
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:42,179
how it's all analyzed and broken down in

1415
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:44,338
like sociology classes in 20 years from

1416
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:46,039
now that's that's pretty hilarious

1417
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:49,739
actually

1418
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:51,719
so you referenced in a prior end for a

1419
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:54,118
little while ago that shabinsky's been

1420
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,739
hitting you up to do some stuff

1421
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,660
um what sort of stuff would you want to

1422
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:59,399
maybe work with him like using one of

1423
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:00,598
the gelato Cuts or what do you have in

1424
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,019
mind yeah

1425
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,400
yeah man uh I mean for starters I

1426
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:08,460
respect

1427
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,139
everybody you know that's how that's how

1428
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,818
it goes and unless they're not

1429
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:15,659
respectable people

1430
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:19,318
and he hit me up because uh he sees uh

1431
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:21,480
chiro and he he respects it and I've

1432
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:24,119
never disrespected him and if I have

1433
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,740
I've uh owned up to it because you know

1434
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,519
I can be a little disrespectful here and

1435
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,379
there

1436
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,800
and he's like I like the way you roll

1437
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:34,260
you know and uh I think it'd be a great

1438
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,720
opportunity for us to work together

1439
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,819
and I'm like [ __ ] yeah man you're

1440
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,379
[ __ ] strabinsky man people [ __ ]

1441
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:41,579
probably would say they don't want to

1442
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,720
work with you and end up working with

1443
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:44,339
you anyways because they're [ __ ]

1444
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,338

1494
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,838
when you made it but man I'm I'm [ __ ]

1495
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,240
I'm still trying to figure it out gee I

1496
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:43,980
didn't make [ __ ] that's all people see

1497
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,959
what they want to see and and that's all

1498
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,059
I let them see man they they only see

1499
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,159
they don't see my wife throwing a

1500
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:52,500
[ __ ] control at me across the house

00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,319
know it's like

1504
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:03,480
yeah okay I mean that raises a really

1505
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,818
interesting point do you feel like there

1506
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,980
is just like all this sort of behind the

1507
00:58:05,818 --> 00:58:10,800
scene Works which people often kind of

1508
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,300
discredit because Instagram often you

1509
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,619
know it doesn't really show that a lot

1510
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,480
of the time

1511
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:18,240
there's some shitty people out there

1512
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,280
that don't want their shitty lives uh on

1513
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,679
Instagram like they made shitty

1514
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,619
decisions in the past I own up to

1515
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:28,199
anything I do so I'm very open about

1516
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:30,420
everything like I'm an ugly [ __ ]

1517
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:32,759
so what you know show the ugliness but

1518
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,740
try to make it look good you know and

1519
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,420
and I'm very open like people could

1520
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:38,699
[ __ ] tell you like what I did today

1521
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,980
because I'll be [ __ ] crackhead on my

1522
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:43,318
phone all day so like it's weird like

1523
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,139
that I'm trying to figure it out there's

1524
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,838
a balance to everything

1525
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:50,460
uh I I do hide the shitty [ __ ] of course

1526
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,139
I'm not going to tell you like like if

1527
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,480
someone's doing adultery you think

1528
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:57,000
they're gonna be like oh man [ __ ] my

1529
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,699
wife caught me cheating today like it's

1530
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,019
gonna be a terrible week uh the seeds

1531
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:03,179
are and the plants are gonna look bad

1532
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:04,858
like nobody's and if they do they're

1533
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:07,259
just [ __ ] crazy like keep that [ __ ]

1534
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:09,719
to yourself you know

1535
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,460
yeah of course of course

1536
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:12,899
so just to jump back to what you

1537
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,579
mentioned earlier about how you know you

1538
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,680
were doing the buy a shirt get some

1539
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,940
seeds or get get the seeds get a free

1540
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:20,699
shirt however you want to look at it

1541
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:22,798
I've noticed that you have got to be the

1542
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:24,779
king of like the insane promos and I

1543
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:26,460
think that the the thing which like

1544
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,619
really piqued my interest in that is you

1545
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,880
were doing like 15 packs for like 450

1546
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:31,260
bucks or something like that I think

1547
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,400
you're doing even better deals than that

1548
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,020
at the moment

1549
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,119
do you feel like this is a really good

1550
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:37,679
way to get your work out there and to

1551
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,700
have people wrapping your brand or do

1552
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,899
you think you're just trying to be good

1553
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:44,399
to the customer

1554
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:45,720
it's both gee uh these dudes uh uh you

1555
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,539
know whatever

1556
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:51,118
they want to make it like

1557
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:53,279
like it's [ __ ] the Holy Grail you

1558
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,980
know like dude you have a five gallon

1559
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,780
bucket of those [ __ ] seeds like do

1560
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,179
you not want people to have them you

1561
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,980
know like like you like

1562
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:04,558
there's ways of doing things you know

1563
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,059
and I and I've managed to figure it out

1564
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,339
how to do it my way people think it's

1565
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:11,579
like they're whoring out their strain

1566
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:14,338
you know well isn't that what you want

1567
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:16,920
kinda you want everybody to try your

1568
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:19,199
perspective nah only these select people

1569
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,760
at this select price you know and there

1570
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,739
are strains that you can allocate

1571
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,619
towards that price because you put more

1572
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:27,539
work into them Etc or or there was only

1573
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:30,240
so many of them so you can do whatever

1574
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:33,659
you it's your [ __ ] product you can

1575
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,939
price at whatever you want and uh some

1576
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:39,000
people do better than others you know

1577
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:42,298
sure and I I mean it raises the question

1578
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,298
do you feel like what you're doing might

1579
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:47,639
help bring a new sort of era of pricing

1580
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:50,039
for seeds and that like gone are the

1581
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:51,058
days of you know the 150 pack sort of

1582
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:54,599
thing

1583
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:57,540
it is man everybody uh not everybody but

1584
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,980
I've I've had seed makers sellers

1585
01:00:57,539 --> 01:01:01,619
whatever you want to call them hit me up

1586
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:04,740
and be like dude that is you're [ __ ]

1587
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:06,838
crazy it was 15 for 300 at one point and

1588
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:09,479
I would let them pick the 15 packs from

1589
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:11,099
a [ __ ] extensive list and uh they're

1590
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,798
like would it like Anna had the five for

1591
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,500
100 so if you didn't have 300 to cough

1592
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:18,119
up you can get five packs but those

1593
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,798
would be dealer's choice you wouldn't be

1594
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:22,559
able to pick them from a cohesive list

1595
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:25,440
but uh to date I still have that except

1596
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,298
the the 15 for 450 is is a different

1597
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,559
tier and you whatever I sound like I'm

1598
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:30,239
selling the [ __ ] now that's not what I

1599
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,740
want to do uh

1600
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,219
we're talking about how we're driving

1601
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:36,899
the price down uh I think they it's just

1602
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:38,399
you got more work to do now you know

1603
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,099
what I mean now you gotta have somebody

1604
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,680
bag and tag for you now you gotta really

1605
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:45,240
you know put your [ __ ] boots on strap

1606
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:48,058
up because you know here comes [ __ ]

1607
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:50,399
Masonic and he has five gallon buckets

1608
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:52,319
of every strain he's ever made and it's

1609
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,000
[ __ ] he can give them away all

1610
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,920
[ __ ] day for a whole month if he

1611
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,980
wants and then and then [ __ ] sell him

1612
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,780
again it's like it's uh I gave away more

1613
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,719
seeds than I've sold that's for [ __ ]

1614
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:07,980
sure you know what I mean uh

1615
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:10,139
and five for 100 that's what like 50 60

1616
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:12,358
seeds or some [ __ ] like that is that's

1617
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:14,519
not too many seeds man uh

1618
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:15,779
I get it some people don't have all the

1619
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:18,119
space but we're in a different time

1620
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,460
we're in a different area era people

1621
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:24,059
have to grow very secluded very

1622
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,679
secretive back in the days access to

1623
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:27,720
genetics and all that [ __ ] you know

1624
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:29,399
there was it was harder now it's it's

1625
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:31,500
the future and and

1626
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,599
you know we move a little faster like

1627
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,000
the internet you know information goes

1628
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,440
fast

1629
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,358
everything's faster now let alone my

1630
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,659
seed production method

1631
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,460
and how the cells go yeah I mean so much

1632
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:46,440
to go into there I guess the first thing

1633
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,780
I quickly ask about is your seed

1634
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,900
production method on on the surface when

1635
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:54,540
I was looking at just your your output

1636
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,700
is insane like there's just new crosses

1637
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:58,858
dropping left right and Center do you do

1638
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:00,659
this by having a few different sites and

1639
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,279
kind of Staggering things or do you make

1640
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:04,259
them all at once and then just slowly

1641
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,760
trickle them out so it seems as though

1642
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,319
new stuff's always being made what's

1643
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,260
your approach to that

1644
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:12,239
uh well I will what I did uh this season

1645
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,339
I just kept the Mel and I just kept

1646
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,159
bringing out Mel's any given week from

1647
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:19,019
my big mouth or or I you know let alone

1648
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,960
brought out the big Mel at the very end

1649
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:23,759
or in the middle pollinated him and kept

1650
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,920
the cuts so it's all like there was

1651
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,500
always polling around pretty much there

1652
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,539
was always a tower of pollen hitting

1653
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,760
everything whether it be a cut this big

1654
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,159
one that grew out a little bit more you

1655
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,260
know the Mel that I you know the whole

1656
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:38,940
dad that I had and I just [ __ ]

1657
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,680
flipped the whole thing and just you

1658
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,720
know [ __ ] on everything and just

1659
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:45,298
called it a day but yeah it's it's

1660
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,159
keeping stages of him keeping towers of

1661
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:50,519
him all spaced out throughout wherever

1662
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,618
the [ __ ] I'm at okay yeah cool cool and

1663
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,900
you also mentioned that you've probably

1664
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:57,119
given away more seeds than you've sold I

1665
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,798
remember in a prior episode Bodhi spoke

1666
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,599
about how this is just sort of like a

1667
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,039
good act to do in general it's kind of

1668
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:03,900
like helping the scene out by giving

1669
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,058
people seeds obviously it helps promote

1670
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,260
you because although not everyone's

1671
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:09,059
going to test the seeds you give the

1672
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,680
them some will and some will post photos

1673
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:13,920
and it'll help to get you a bit more

1674
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:15,239
sort of notoriety amongst people do you

1675
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,619
subscribe to that idea and do you think

1676
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:18,539
that when a breed is sort of starting

1677
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,619
out they should give some seeds away and

1678
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:21,058
not just be trying to sell everything

1679
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:23,460
from day one

1680
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:25,079
yeah that's that's uh actually that's

1681
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,380
some game right there that's some real

1682
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:30,359
game actually uh dude you you when you

1683
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,880
make your first cross man and you think

1684
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:35,159
you're gonna just start me like uncle's

1685
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,140
Scrooge of whoever the [ __ ] just you

1686
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:38,940
know [ __ ] deep diving into gold bro

1687
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:41,519
you need to relax and just start giving

1688
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,740
[ __ ] away man you just just give away

1689
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,298
half half of the seeds do you you're

1690
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:47,159
gonna see they're gonna see other people

1691
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:49,739
have them and they're gonna be like I

1692
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:51,719
want some too now you can sell them you

1693
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:53,519
know what I mean and it's good karma

1694
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,459
points too so uh

1695
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:59,219
uh I'm into mystical [ __ ] like that you

1696
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,780
know I believe in positive out you know

1697
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:02,939
output you and get some positive [ __ ]

1698
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,280
back and ain't nothing wrong with you

1699
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:07,619
know there's dudes out there that got a

1700
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,420
yard but they think every seed pack cost

1701
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:11,579
a hundred dollars you know they're just

1702
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,380
because that's what every seed pack cost

1703
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,599
until you know [ __ ] people like me

1704
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,640
came around or been around you know I'm

1705
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,380
not too privy maybe there are people but

1706
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:20,759
they don't know how to use the Internet

1707
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,380
or they don't even know how to go

1708
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:26,160
through the Avenue of going it you know

1709
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:28,858
so uh yeah [ __ ] give away your seeds

1710
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,899
and then start your [ __ ] yeah for sure

1711
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:34,199
that's gonna help you a lot

1712
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:37,380
hell yeah so I mean on that topic of

1713
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:39,719
making seeds what's the next couple of

1714
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,338
Wilson crosses you want to make and are

1715
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:42,358
there any sort of dream crosses where

1716
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,980
like you're just trying to get your

1717
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:45,659
hands on the female but you're finding

1718
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,960
it hard to track down sort of thing but

1719
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:51,358
you think it'll be like a winner

1720
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:53,460
uh I'm not I'm not too uh I don't seek

1721
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,960
the strains too much I'm not too like if

1722
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:57,539
there's a hot strain on the market I'm

1723
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,579
not like oh man like I need that it's

1724
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:01,920
gonna really help you know me build

1725
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:05,280
everything just kind of Falls in my lap

1726
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,680
I've I'm I'm nice to a lot of people and

1727
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,720
uh I give like I give and they give back

1728
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,899
and it just so happens a lot of my

1729
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,879
buddies have some cool ass cuts and I

1730
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,500
happen to have a lot of them you know

1731
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,200
they happen to follow my lap they happen

1732
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,059
to get pollinated

1733
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:23,338
foreign

1734
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:26,160
pollinations with them so it'll be like

1735
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:27,900
a g41 that I didn't you know transplant

1736
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,179
and you know do full term or something

1737
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,920
like that like like the Cuban black Haze

1738
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:33,719
like even though I know it's probably

1739
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,519
not going to be my favorite strain I

1740
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:37,919
know a lot of people love it

1741
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:40,440
but so I want to put it in their hands

1742
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,818
and you know make some money just so

1743
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,980
happens to be part of that you know what

1744
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:46,139
I mean and people can be like oh I do it

1745
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,358
for God nah [ __ ] like you're

1746
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:50,818
doing this to you know put some food on

1747
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:53,578
the table and maybe go to Disneyland too

1748
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:55,920
you know what I mean so quit that [ __ ]

1749
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,420
like you know you know you want to live

1750
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,818
nice you know you don't want to [ __ ]

1751
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,559
be mediocre and if you do well [ __ ]

1752
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:03,538
you're ethical and you're cool and all

1753
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,240
power too you know what I mean Namaste

1754

1755
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:11,159
here [ __ ] uh you know we're doing

1756
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,440
stuff for a reason you know and and the

1757
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:15,358
guys that are gonna get the Cuban black

1758
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,858
Haze Wilson Times Wilson again they're

1759
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:18,119
going to be stoked for that that [ __ ]

1760
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:20,460
they're gonna be like dude you grab my

1761
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,619
favorite strain but not only did you hit

1762
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,900
it to Wilson but you hit it twice and

1763
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:26,818
and it's and it's cheap and I can get it

1764
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,500
you know I don't got to go through you

1765
01:07:26,818 --> 01:07:30,779
know to this guy to get it because

1766
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,298
[ __ ] it costs too much or whatever or

1767
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:36,119
it's inaccessible like I'll make it

1768
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:38,219
accessible and that strain along with a

1769
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:40,260
bunch of other strains that you know I'm

1770
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:43,798
stoked about like uh like the Mac Wilson

1771
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:45,960
the Mac from Cut Wilson I hit that small

1772
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:48,480
seed stock because Mac doesn't take well

1773
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,159
to pollen so I'm gonna hopefully the

1774
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,240
hybrid of it does so I'm gonna hit it

1775
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,759
again

1776
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:56,159
nice you you read my mind I was about to

1777
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,020
ask with them with the Mac have you

1778
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,239
figured out any tips or tricks to

1779
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:01,920
getting it to make pollen or it's just a

1780
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,739
luck sort of thing

1781
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,039
well to take pollen to take pollen the

1782
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:11,098
the cut uh I just hit it man just hit it

1783
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:12,660
from from badge to finish and cross your

1784
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:15,240
fingers that you get enough you know

1785
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:17,519
that's literally what I did and and and

1786
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,159
literally uh and I and I'd be like

1787
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,900
[ __ ] like Cap's just saying that to

1788
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,639
deter people from hitting it you know

1789
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:26,338
like he's just telling you it don't take

1790
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,140
but now like that [ __ ] don't take well

1791
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:30,000
gee it really doesn't take well to

1792
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,319
pollen and it don't want to give you

1793
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,838
seed and that's kind of cool because

1794
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:35,940
like you know that that's like one uh

1795
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:38,100
one one step of red tape from people

1796
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:39,838
pouring out his his uh

1797
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,838
his you know his baby

1798
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:45,420
yeah for sure and I mean I like to ask

1799
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:47,698
oh guess this what's your thought on the

1800
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,679
Mac flower and concentrate itself are

1801
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:51,659
you a fan it's a bit of a polarizing

1802
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,060
strain in its own right

1803
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:57,238
uh I mean I've been to PC green a couple

1804
01:08:54,060 --> 01:09:00,179
times and I pick up Mac Gap skirt to

1805
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:02,639
this day uh my buddy dog man was here

1806
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:04,980
the other day he washed them it's its

1807
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,039
own thing man it's it's dope Max cool

1808
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:10,439
I'm not one to hate on any strain it's

1809
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:12,899
just somewhere better than others

1810
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:14,759
it's like man you hate weed like come on

1811
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:17,939
dog chill out you know I don't hate

1812
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:19,798
anything too hates or dislike like I

1813
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:21,259
just don't like it I don't necessarily

1814
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:24,198
dislike it

1815
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:27,479
I'd like it less

1816
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:29,818
yeah I feel yeah and I mean speaking

1817
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,500
just referencing earlier I was watching

1818
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:33,600
some of your YouTube videos and you were

1819
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,060
testing like the Snowman from the

1820
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,060
cookies crew Powers up and uh the London

1821
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:41,339
pound cake these strains cop a lot of

1822
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,080
hate not necessarily because the people

1823
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:44,778
have tried them but just because they

1824
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:47,278
really dislike the crew behind them

1825
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:48,900
what's your take on these trains do you

1826
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,880
feel like like some of these strains

1827
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:52,619
which cop a bit of a flack are pretty

1828
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,539
good it's just like the stigma

1829
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:56,219
surrounding the crew that made them or

1830
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:58,979
how do you feel about it

1831
01:09:56,219 --> 01:10:01,739
it's a quality control had a lot to do

1832
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:04,678
with the stigma that was put on the

1833
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:07,019
string now for instance Snowman when it

1834
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:09,840
was debuted at Emerald cup there was

1835
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:12,080
some moldy batches so people were going

1836
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,940
to just put that you mentioned snowman

1837
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:18,179
moldy you know so stuff like that

1838
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:21,000
doesn't help and you know [ __ ] you

1839
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:22,920
grow [ __ ] a million Acres or I don't

1840
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,198
know how much they grow but and and

1841
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:27,300
[ __ ] you're gonna you look hard

1842
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:29,039
enough you're gonna find something but

1843
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,900
uh it's just it's how you address things

1844
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,079
too so uh

1845
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:35,698
this politics and everything you know uh

1846
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:39,000
the strains were good if they're good

1847
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:41,639
they're good uh there was whatever when

1848
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,920
I went to cookies burner called him

1849
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,140
and had them help me while I was on the

1850
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,239
phone with Berner and he made sure I got

1851
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:51,119
all the fresh stuff so there goes

1852
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:53,158
quality control like he made sure

1853
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,899
like his you know that's smart on his

1854
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:57,119
behalf you know what I mean like if

1855
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:58,679
somebody went to your house like not

1856
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,439
saying you sell weed but like say you

1857
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,000
sold weed and it just so happened to be

1858
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,979
like somebody you want to be in good

1859
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,840
graces with and you there's there's

1860
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:08,459
tears you know you're gonna call

1861
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,960
whoever's serving that dude and you'll

1862
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:12,000
be like hey man give them the [ __ ]

1863
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,939
the head stash you know like I want them

1864
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,219
to go home and and give me a good bias

1865
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:19,259
so you know you can't blame them for

1866
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:20,760
that you know [ __ ] there's there's

1867
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:24,539
there's there's a product for everybody

1868
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,280
not everybody can uh afford the fresh

1869
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:28,979
batch they got to get you know the sun

1870
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:33,359
grown or whatever so he made sure I got

1871
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:35,099
the good stuff so of course he he was

1872
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:37,198
smart about that he made sure I went

1873
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:39,900
home and it just so happens I was doing

1874
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,839
reviews at the time and he got good

1875
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:45,539
reviews because everything I reviewed

1876
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,340
wasn't [ __ ] terrible because you know

1877
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:49,260
sometimes shit's bad and

1878
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:52,500
you know and I and there's a complete

1879
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:54,719
Hiatus on that uh on that [ __ ] because

1880
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,000
it's just it's a whole ass job man you

1881
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:59,880
you know you do this [ __ ] so editing and

1882
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,260
all that my wife does it I record it and

1883
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,920
I'm just like you know what we're just

1884
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:07,140
gonna stop for a bit so yeah yeah I feel

1885
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,520
yeah so something I've been personally

1886
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,380
wondering about the whole cookie

1887
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,820
situation is that as you referenced

1888
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,739
there was some issues with quality

1889
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:17,179
control with some of the outdoor batches

1890
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:20,218
and it kind of raised this idea of like

1891
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:22,199
for a longest time cookies was primarily

1892
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:23,698
an indoor only sort of company like they

1893
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:25,439
were selling indoor flour it was good

1894
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:28,678
quality it helped get the brand to where

1895
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:30,719
it is now they're expanding outdoors and

1896
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:32,460
doing some sun-grown stuff do you feel

1897
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,198
like overall that's beneficial because

1898
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,939
it's providing like different price

1899
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:38,099
points like some cheaper more available

1900
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:41,099
stuff or do you feel like the potential

1901
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,620
issues with quality control my overall

1902
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:46,079
just diminished from the brand as it is

1903
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:48,140
which is kind of got reputableness for

1904
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,479
being like high quality

1905
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:53,940
man [ __ ] that's that's that's a very

1906
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:56,698
that that question has like 10 answers

1907
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:59,279
to it probably but uh

1908
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:02,759
I've never ran a big ship like that you

1909
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,679
know uh they probably have a a dude that

1910
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,300
does analytics on that [ __ ] you know

1911
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:09,539
[ __ ] over there like dude like when

1912
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:12,900
we put out you know you know said batch

1913
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:15,119
from said skew you know [ __ ]

1914
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:16,439
cells went above the roof and they just

1915
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:18,059
keep going above the roof so they're

1916
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:21,419
just like just keep putting it out that

1917
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:23,039
you know and and and

1918
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:26,100
and I know

1919
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:28,198
you know you you get to know people and

1920
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:32,840
you see what goes on behind the scenes

1921
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:32,839
and [ __ ] so my thing is I like just

1922
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:37,920
[ __ ] the truth always prevails so if

1923
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:39,899
if they're like doing some shady [ __ ]

1924
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,539
like they know they're doing it you know

1925
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:45,599
so hopefully they're not you know who

1926
01:13:42,539 --> 01:13:48,238
knows I know that I got a personal call

1927
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,400
and he's all like hey man QC but that

1928
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:51,959
wasn't me that was somebody else or

1929
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,299
maybe it was me I've I've talked to him

1930
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,399
a couple times and I'm just like well

1931
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,900
you know whatever uh I don't like to

1932
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,479
dive into it because I'm not that's not

1933
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:02,698
my business that's that's a big ass [ __ ]

1934
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:05,519
right there you know will it diminish

1935
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:07,559
the the brand I don't think so because

1936
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,020
they're they're really really big and

1937
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:12,360
and Instagram is so small compared to

1938
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,280
the demographic that they kind of cater

1939
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:17,460
to from what I see like not everybody

1940
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:19,920
knows who you know uh Gage green is and

1941
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:23,039
and like all these the Breeders they

1942
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,779
just know that there's a shiny bag and

1943
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,219
there's weed in it and that's what

1944
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:28,500
everybody's smoking so they want to

1945
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:30,779
smoke it too it's kind of like a

1946
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,560
billboard you know so that's what they

1947
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:34,139
are

1948
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,780
and and if there's good product in there

1949
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,500
then that's just extra you know what I

1950
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:41,158
mean

1951
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:44,600
and uh us we know

1952
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:47,939
the smoke and mirrors but the the common

1953
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:49,980
consumer is is is just getting a baggie

1954
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:52,738
with stuff in there

1955
01:14:49,979 --> 01:14:54,178
yeah I mean gosh what a what a great

1956
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,879
answer because there's so many Avenues

1957
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:59,039
we can go off in to me you kind of touch

1958
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,079
on this idea that's prevalent at the

1959
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:03,960
moment and a lot of Growers really get

1960
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:06,238
frustrated by it is among the just the

1961
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:09,179
average consumer you know the sort of

1962

hobby Enthusiast smoker the mylar

1963
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:13,920
culture seems to be very prevalent you

1964
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,199

1965

mylar bag with good advertising is going

1966

to sell well how do you feel about that

1967
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,539
does that frustrate you do you feel like

1968
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:23,158
what's in the bag is more important than

1969
01:15:21,539 --> 01:15:25,260
the bag itself or do you just think it's

1970
01:15:23,158 --> 01:15:27,059
just marketing like get with the game

1971

that's you see what I'm getting at it's

1979
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:44,759
kind of like that so it's all like you

1980
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,179
know what the [ __ ] you're getting into

1981
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,699
you're in you're in uh you're in Texas

1982
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:52,980
in the middle of nowhere you think

1983
01:15:50,698 --> 01:15:55,799
you're you're getting a real Gary Payton

1984
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:58,799
cookie bag for forty dollars

1985
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,719
like just like and and and that's that's

1986
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,640
another thing is just you know educated

1987
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,859
and it can go as far as remedial

1988
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,619
education you know some dudes have a

1989
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:09,179
hard time reading imagine how they are

1990
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:11,819
[ __ ] trying to figure out what weed

1991
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:14,699
they want you know what I mean

1992
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:17,880
yeah sure so do you think that this

1993
01:16:14,698 --> 01:16:19,500
trend will basically continue where some

1994
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,260
some of the things I've been told and

1995
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:24,539
observed is that you know the quality of

1996
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,760
the weed can kind of take back seat to

1997
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:29,100
the good mylar do you think that that's

1998
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,900
only Really Gonna fool the the kind of

1999
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:33,060
inexperienced or do you think that Trend

2000
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:35,279
will continue and weed might just go

2001
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:37,560
down a bit in quality because the mylars

2002
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:40,079
flashy enough

2003
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,780
oh man uh

2004
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,300
They're Gonna Keep uh they're gonna ring

2005
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:47,219
it as as much as they can and probably

2006
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:50,400
till till the end of time because

2007
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:52,380
there's McDonald's and there's you know

2008
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:55,619
the best burgers in the world whatever

2009
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:57,179
you think that is you know so uh there's

2010
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:59,460
there's always going to be that weed

2011
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,500
around and they're gonna give it to you

2012
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,779
in the best presentable package possible

2013
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,100
and mylars just so happened to be the

2014
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:07,738
one

2015
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:10,679
sure and a question which I've been

2016
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:13,019
pondering for a long time is in regards

2017
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:15,300
to last time I was in the states which

2018
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:18,840
was about a year ago now

2019
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:21,119
um I noticed that like a lot of the weed

2020
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:23,760
I was seeing and being presented to me

2021
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,340
it looked really nice but a lot of it

2022
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,739
didn't smell or smoke as good as it

2023
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:31,020
looked and it kind of is like in that

2024
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:33,359
same vein as the mylar and like it's got

2025
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,100
the Aesthetics but there's not a lot of

2026
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,479
substance behind it and then someone

2027
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:38,039
said to me this thing which I thought

2028
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,059
was really quite profound where they

2029
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:41,579
were like

2030
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,560
yeah like this this is what the demand

2031
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:45,719
is because on Instagram you can't smell

2032
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,520
buds people post you can't smoke it but

2033
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:50,760
you can look at it and if it looks good

2034
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:53,219
that post is going to be popular do you

2035
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,199
kind of see that Trend yourself and do

2036
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:57,119
you come across this sort of like weed

2037
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,099
that looks good but isn't really quite

2038
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:03,779
packing the punch you hoped

2039
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:06,239
yeah man that that goes back to uh

2040
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:09,479
uh organically grown [ __ ] you know

2041
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:12,718
[ __ ] some weed might look terrible

2042
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:15,599
and it's like the best [ __ ] ever so uh

2043
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:18,420
and and and yeah bag appeal does sell

2044
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,760
you know like that that hot girl does

2045
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,500
sell but she doesn't cook

2046
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,619
or do anything not that that's what

2047
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:27,238
ladies are supposed to do but like my

2048
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:29,219
partner you know

2049
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:31,678
I want her to be smart and [ __ ] you know

2050
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:33,119
[ __ ] some of them aren't some of them

2051
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,579
are the whole package though you know

2052
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:37,640
what I mean so [ __ ]

2053
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:40,439
same thing with weed some of it just

2054
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,500
looks really good but it it you know I

2055
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:46,198
don't know [ __ ]

2056
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:48,420
so do you think that that Trend with the

2057
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:50,639
average consumer will continue whereby

2058
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:52,079
like people are just looking for the

2059
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,300
most Frosty thing and they don't

2060
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:55,979
actually really care about the Terps or

2061
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:58,380
the end effect

2062
01:18:55,979 --> 01:19:01,678
yeah it's easier to point uh to just

2063
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:03,840
pump [ __ ] with hgv than it is to you

2064
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,420
know put a little bit more love into it

2065
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,279
you know people are doing big classrooms

2066
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,020
teaching all these plants at the same

2067
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:11,579
time

2068
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,960
so they're only going to get so much

2069
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:14,039
love

2070
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,380
sure

2071
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:17,760
and I guess the next question which I

2072
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,679
don't think I've asked anyone yet but

2073
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,020
it's got it ties into all this and it's

2074
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:24,300
been on my mind forever there's this you

2075
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,679
know amongst this same sort of consumer

2076
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,900
group we're talking about like the sort

2077
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:31,319
of casual Enthusiast

2078
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:32,819
um the term exotic it's it's used to be

2079
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:35,698
like you know that's the bee's knees

2080
01:19:32,819 --> 01:19:39,000
that's all I want the Exotic I realized

2081
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:41,759
there's really no definition around what

2082
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,100
exotic is like what to you is exotic

2083
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,920
weed

2084
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:49,760
exotic is uh what is exotic that's

2085
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,760
that's like a

2086
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:54,619
I don't know man anything burner is

2087
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:58,079
promoting is exotic you know what I mean

2088
01:19:54,619 --> 01:20:01,260
like anything trending I think would be

2089
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:04,019
like the right exotic definition even if

2090
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:06,480
it's I don't know but what if like uh

2091
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:10,320
Acapulco Gold is trending again that's

2092
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:12,899
that's not exotic you know so exotic is

2093
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:15,559
like you said that that's just it's

2094
01:20:12,899 --> 01:20:15,559
malarkey

2095
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,819
yeah yeah so do you feel like it's more

2096
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:22,379
of a marketing term than something that

2097
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:23,579
actually has like a strict sort of

2098
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,980
definition

2099
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:28,319
yeah man it's it's like I could come up

2100
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:30,238
with some [ __ ] like that like now this

2101
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:32,698
is antique you know like we only smoke

2102
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,738
antique weed over here

2103
01:20:32,698 --> 01:20:35,969

01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:40,140
[Laughter]

2106
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:41,939
there you go the old school and I mean

2107
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,460
it's probably about as good as the

2108
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:46,619
Segway as I'll get as any antique you

2109
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,179
know one of the favorite strains of the

2110
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:49,859
show and I try to bring it up in every

2111
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:51,899
episode because it's so near and dear to

2112
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:53,819
my heart is the chem dog it's it's a bit

2113
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:56,039
of an antique strain in its own right

2114
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:57,840
what are your thoughts on the various

2115

chem cuts and do you have a favorite

2116
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,360
would you ever want to breed with any of

2117
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,779
them

2118
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:05,819
uh [ __ ] man I'd be lying if I uh told

2119
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:08,819
you I had any of them you know my my

2120
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:12,119
first the first time I had Kim

2121
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:15,479
was from Skelly who works with 710 labs

2122
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:19,198
and uh I went to his house and he gave

2123
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:22,139
me some chem 91 in hash form and I'm all

2124
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:25,738
like oh this is like GMO but you know no

2125
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:28,560
no GMO is like chem you know what I mean

2126
01:21:25,738 --> 01:21:30,899
so uh that was like my first time and

2127
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,400
I'm just like cool like Kim is GMO you

2128
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:34,738
know like that's like that's kind of my

2129
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,259
interpretation because I had smoked GMO

2130
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:39,839
before I smoked Kim because I'm [ __ ]

2131

2133
01:21:42,658 --> 01:21:45,960
in love with Kim right away because it's

2134
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:47,460
like oh you're the original one you know

2135
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,500
what I mean to me that's how I look at

2136
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:53,158
it like oh like this is where it came

2137
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:56,520
from you know so uh chem and then uh

2138
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:58,079

I don't know but that's like the first

2140
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,479

01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,260
term antique I'm gonna keep using that

2155
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:40,019
are there any sort of other antique

2156
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,880
strains that you're fond of and or would

2157
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:44,040
like to discover a bit more so like

2158
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,239
things like you know like hazes or

2159
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:48,539
skunks

2160
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:51,539
yeah man I would love to uh dive into

2161
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:54,600
the rabbit hole of haze I like the first

2162
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:56,698
interpretation of Hayes that I had was a

2163
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,800
it was called Lighthouse I think the

2164
01:22:56,698 --> 01:23:01,019
cross was called and it was like nl5

2165
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,760
times nl5 times nl5 I was like they just

2166
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:05,219
crossed no five a thousand times or some

2167
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,500
[ __ ] and I'm like this is this is

2168
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:09,779
different you know and like it grew on

2169
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:12,420
me and then people would show me like

2170
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:16,198
Hayes interpretations their derivatives

2171
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:19,380
and I would have a marker for it so uh

2172
01:23:16,198 --> 01:23:21,839
today it's it's still not solidified yet

2173
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:24,779
like you know there's other hazes and

2174
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,100
[ __ ] so I'm I wanna I wanna meet foods

2175
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:28,859

2176

2178
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,960

2179
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:36,479
they're part of you know that great

2180
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,460
legacy of people getting Haze and then

2181
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,319

2187
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:54,658

2188
01:23:52,738 --> 01:23:56,819
books per se you know what I mean like

2189
01:23:54,658 --> 01:23:59,099
like anything like you you want to go

2190
01:23:56,819 --> 01:24:01,198
read the the first parts of the book so

2191
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,820
that just happens to be some of the

2192
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:04,859
first strains that were out that I'm I

2193
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:08,279
want to get privy to everything

2194
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:10,319
sure sure and there's I mean I'm sure

2195
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:12,420
you've seen posts and heard people talk

2196
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:16,380
about it but there's this huge sort of

2197
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:19,500
collective push in the scene to find or

2198
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:21,060
to revive the roadkill skunk what's your

2199
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,679
thoughts on this do you think it exists

2200
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:24,300
I'm kind of starting to get to the point

2201
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:25,319
where I actually doubt it's even around

2202
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:28,560
anymore

2203
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:30,658
oh man I'm I'm like like we were talking

2204
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,640
earlier I'm becoming aware of all this

2205
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:35,879
and I've I've heard a

2206
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,100
the funny [ __ ] before like I even had a

2207
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:41,159
like for some reason I ended up in the

2208
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:43,800
ITC dude's ear and he went as far as

2209
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:46,198

2210

2219
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:07,139
was part of the the the ordeal because

2220
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,119

roadkill skunk that he had and and

2230
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:30,119
whatever it was just like whatever food

2231
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:32,339
like that like let's just go be our own

2232
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:34,140
people I wasn't I wasn't impressed you

2233
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,779
know so uh

2234
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:39,659
so you know as far as roadkill skunk

2235
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:43,019
that's one interaction I had with it and

2236
01:25:39,658 --> 01:25:45,899
then before Matt Wright was on a team

2237
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:48,300
[ __ ] you Masonic uh I would dive into

2238
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:51,420
his lives and they would like talk about

2239
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,640
and he'd like you know you know snivel

2240
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,980
that other people even mentioning it so

2241
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,500
it was like it's like it was always like

2242
01:25:55,979 --> 01:26:00,479
the way I look at it is like okay dude

2243
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:04,260
what are you smoking right now all right

2244
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:06,599
like you got a swisher sweet and an

2245
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:09,420
eighth from the dispensary in a plastic

2246
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:12,360
can like okay like as far as I'm

2247
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:14,279
concerned you have no say in anything

2248
01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:15,960
like just shut the [ __ ] up and roll up

2249
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:18,479
your weed and just smoke away you know

2250
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,800
but like if you got some full melt and

2251
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:21,059
you're over there just Fino hunting

2252
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,340
every day you're every day you're

2253
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:25,860
rubbing into plants becoming one with

2254
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:28,199
the plant and you're just you're on the

2255
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:30,420
pulse your fingers on it I want your I

2256
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:33,539
want your perspective now you know but

2257
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:35,940
uh and and if there's an old school guy

2258
01:26:33,539 --> 01:26:37,500
that's still on on the pulse smoking

2259
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:39,839
every day smoking the new keeping around

2260
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,719
the old that's who I want to hear the

2261
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,699
perspective on rks you know so and and

2262
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,679
even then I'm not like as far as I'm

2263
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:48,019
concerned it's like

2264
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:51,179
who cares

2265
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:53,580
yeah yeah so

2266
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:55,139
so another topic which I think is still

2267
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:57,000
people trying to flesh it out because

2268
01:26:55,139 --> 01:26:59,460
there's just the ambiguity around it is

2269
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,800
all of the ogs you know there's so many

2270
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:04,198
variations in different cuts and it's

2271
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,480
the the lineage is still a little bit of

2272
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:08,460
mystery around it all what are some of

2273
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,319
your preferred ogs and what's your

2274
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:12,239
thoughts on the TK because a lot of

2275
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:14,519
people think that the TK is probably the

2276
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:16,979
original where do you sit that one

2277
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,920
compared to the other OG cuts

2278
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:22,379
well the thing with the OG's there was a

2279
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,079
lot of all right here I go talking about

2280
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:27,600
nothing I don't know about okay what I

2281
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:29,819
know from me being a consumer in Los

2282
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,300
Angeles where there was a lot of

2283
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:36,539
dispensaries that primarily sold OG

2284
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:39,840
I've seen a lot of vanity strains as I

2285
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:43,920
like to call it or even renaming so that

2286
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:48,239
helped pollute the namesake of you know

2287
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:51,000
TK maybe you know so uh that's probably

2288
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:52,319
it I've had TK by itself really really

2289
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,738
great strain

2290
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:59,219
uh but I've also had you know abusive OG

2291
01:27:55,738 --> 01:28:04,198
and you know Fire OG radiation OG

2292
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:07,260
Spider-Man OG Batman OG [ __ ] sad OG

2293
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,719
happy OG you know every [ __ ] OG known

2294
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:13,079
man and they're all very similar and

2295
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:15,899
they're all very good so uh I've only

2296
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:17,359
I've grown the Tahoe I've grown the

2297
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:23,039
hardcore

2298
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:24,658
uh [ __ ] you know and oh gee I don't I

2299
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,539
don't really have like a marker for

2300
01:28:24,658 --> 01:28:30,420
what's the the real one but it's it's

2301
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:31,738
better to go get a TK cut because you

2302
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,500
know at least you know what you're

2303
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:35,759
growing

2304
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:38,698
yeah kinda

2305
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:40,860
so I guess the question then becomes you

2306
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:43,500
know I think most people have had a cut

2307
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:45,420
given to them at some point where it

2308
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,579
wasn't what it was labeled be it either

2309
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,260
unintentionally mislabeled or just the

2310
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:51,420
person wasn't aware they had the wrong

2311
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:53,159
cut have you ever had that happen to you

2312
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:54,719
and which cut was the one you were

2313
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:56,939
hoping to get but then like it didn't

2314
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,639
turn out to be the right thing

2315
01:28:56,939 --> 01:29:03,059
uh no that hasn't happened but I have

2316
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:05,039
gotten uh cuts that weren't labeled and

2317
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:07,080
they were dope hit them to Wilson and

2318
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:09,479
sell them as is so they'll be like hey

2319
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:12,600
what's willotto it ain't a gelato cross

2320
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,979
that's for [ __ ] sure so and

2321
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,659
then I'll be like I don't know man like

2322
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:19,439
my homie bad [ __ ] gave it to me

2323
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:21,000
it was cool and I hit it to Wilson and

2324
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:22,979
people are asking me what it is because

2325
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,139
they love it and I'm like they're like

2326
01:29:22,979 --> 01:29:26,759
well I like it and that's it you know no

2327
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:30,359
need to fake the funk be like oh you

2328
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,920
know gelato bag seed like try to come up

2329
01:29:30,359 --> 01:29:34,619
with a story on the spot like no I

2330
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,960
called it wallado because I I don't know

2331
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:39,238
where in my right mind I I convinced

2332
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,219
myself it was gelato and then I start

2333
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:44,339
[ __ ] with real gelatos and that ain't

2334
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:45,960
no [ __ ] gelato and then you know so

2335
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:51,239
I'm like you know

2336
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:53,219
a lot of okay so I mean on that topic of

2337
01:29:51,238 --> 01:29:55,138
you know clones and your clone Library

2338
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:56,698
yours certainly seems to be very

2339
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:58,260
impressive you know if you look at the

2340
01:29:56,698 --> 01:30:00,960
crosses you've made it seems like you've

2341
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:03,300
got access to a lot of nice cuttings do

2342
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:05,100
you keep these clones around or do you

2343
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,719
just know you can access them again and

2344
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:09,000
what's your thoughts on people selling

2345
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,319
clones for like really expensive price

2346
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,800
tags

2347
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:19,079
uh [ __ ] I keep a nice network of people

2348
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:21,779
that I trust to give me Cuts if I like

2349
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:24,840
if I really like something you know some

2350
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:26,279
Cuts even go as far as like okay [ __ ]

2351
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,840
100 people have them already like

2352
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:29,639
there's no way that's going to go

2353
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,920
anywhere like the Compton land race

2354
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:33,539
a lot Compton land race that's a whole

2355
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,639
nother thing but like a lot of people

2356
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,979
have that you know so like and that's

2357
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:39,600
not even my cut so like that's kind of

2358
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:41,399
how Cuts work for me like if I want

2359
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,500
something to get spread I'll give it to

2360
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:44,638
10 of my friends you know and and of

2361
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:47,520
course other people are gonna have it

2362
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:50,279
but that's the point you know so uh

2363
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:53,280
that's kind of how that goes down uh me

2364
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:55,198
keeping Cuts I I flip everything like

2365
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:57,000
I'll keep some cuts on Mama mouth for a

2366
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:58,799
while and then I'll be like okay I'm

2367
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,679
tired of GMO I've crossed it to Wilson

2368
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,179
10 times already like I think I can let

2369
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:05,819
it go I think enough people in the world

2370
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:08,579
have GMO for me to get it again so

2371
01:31:05,819 --> 01:31:12,179
there's never been anything that's like

2372
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:14,219
like uh [ __ ] I really can't rely on

2373
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:15,840
somebody else to keep it around for me

2374
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:17,698
you know so there's never been anything

2375
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,199
like that and if there is something that

2376
01:31:17,698 --> 01:31:21,539
I want like that I make sure to give it

2377
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:23,698
to at least five [ __ ]

2378
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:26,340
sure and I think the obvious follow-up

2379
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:28,019
to that is was there ever a cutting or a

2380
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:29,940
strain that you had for a while and you

2381
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:31,679
were fond of it and then you lost it and

2382
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:33,479
all of a sudden like no one else has got

2383
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:36,779
it and it's gone forever

2384
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:39,479
well my portfolio of uh strain knowledge

2385
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:41,158
and that is very minimal so no way Jose

2386
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:43,319
man you guys would be like you're stupid

2387
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:45,238
if we've been you've known about strings

2388
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:47,340
for four years like what what could you

2389
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:50,099
possibly have that you missed so much

2390
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:52,619
dude you know so I I've yet to have that

2391
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:55,380
happen to me uh you know having

2392
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:58,079
something like oh man this is a game

2393
01:31:55,380 --> 01:32:00,679
changer and I lose it now that hasn't

2394
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:03,479
happened yet as far as a game changer

2395
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:05,279
everything's you know everything's

2396
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:07,079
everything so it's kind of just works

2397
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,759
for me I've never had there there are

2398
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:10,920
strains that excite me more than others

2399
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,199
but I don't put all my eggs in that

2400
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,060
basket so it never really hits me that

2401
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,279
hard if if something doesn't follow

2402
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:20,460
through like I want it to

2403
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:23,099
sure and just as a follow-up because I'm

2404
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:25,439
not sure we we chatted about it what's

2405
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,440
your thoughts on people who sell

2406
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:30,419
cuttings especially like I guess the

2407
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:32,698
question for me is more interesting is

2408
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,619
the person who found the cut so like

2409
01:32:32,698 --> 01:32:36,479
they they put in some work to maybe

2410
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:38,279
either buy the seeds or Tofino Hunter

2411
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,678
themselves what's your thoughts on

2412
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:43,679
selling that at that point

2413
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:47,158
so touching on uh

2414
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:49,560
it's it's happening to me now where I've

2415
01:32:47,158 --> 01:32:52,319
done some work and they're using my name

2416
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:54,179
to sell the cut for high price and it's

2417
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:55,679
kind of it leaves a nasty taste in my

2418
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:58,500
mouth like

2419
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,179
so what I'm gonna do so that I don't

2420
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,800
complain because I'm not a complainer

2421
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:03,899
like that's as far as I go as

2422
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,639
complaining is me telling you is I

2423
01:33:03,899 --> 01:33:09,658
address the situation

2424
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:11,819
so what I do is I grab same said cut

2425
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:13,979
and put it in my hands

2426
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:16,139
and just lower the price

2427
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:19,919
and now I'm happy

2428
01:33:16,139 --> 01:33:22,020
so uh yeah it can bother me so I'll I'll

2429
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,719
put that into I'll put I'll get in the

2430
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:26,520
driver's seat and just bust out a

2431
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,380
[ __ ] million trays and stand on the

2432
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:29,960
corner and [ __ ] sell it for ten

2433
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:33,600
dollars just to make me happy

2434
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:35,158
yeah I mean that's it is proactive right

2435
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,400
I like that

2436
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:40,439
Yeah man so you touched on just a moment

2437
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:42,479
ago the Compton land race and I've been

2438
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:44,638
interested in this one for a while most

2439
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:46,319
notably because I think the name's

2440
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:47,940
interesting it's obviously not a true

2441
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,460
land race

2442
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:52,859
um what's the backstory behind this

2443
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:56,760

peanut butter breath

2495
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:11,579
and then I hit it back to Wilson again

2496
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:14,219
so but that's Compton land race now it's

2497
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:16,380
Compton land race times Wilson

2498
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:17,939

2499
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:20,340
everyone doesn't it

2500
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:23,238
I mean I mean it's just a fun little

2501
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,239
project you know

2502
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:33,739
all right that's just what I needed in

2503
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:36,480
this [ __ ] love it what did you just hit

2504
01:36:33,738 --> 01:36:37,919
uh so when I take dabs I take really

2505
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,479
really huge Dabs out of everything

2506
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,639
because you know

2507
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:43,919
we work hard for that [ __ ] so I'll grab

2508
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:45,960
like a you know

2509
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,739
a dab that's not gonna get fully hit per

2510
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,539
se

2511
01:36:46,738 --> 01:36:51,658
you know everything on the stick's not

2512
01:36:48,539 --> 01:36:53,639
gonna get smoke so I'll have a container

2513
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:56,579
where every time I'm done with that dab

2514
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:59,340
I'll throw it in there so there's a

2515
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:01,198
hundred flavors that I did that jar to

2516
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:03,119
to the point where it got filled to the

2517
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,099
brim that I had to split it in two jars

2518
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:07,679
so that's what I just smoked right now I

2519
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,300
smoked one of those jars lovely so it's

2520
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,260
like like a bit of everything the jungle

2521
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,600
mix

2522
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:14,940
it's a gumbo for sure it's a big old

2523
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:16,620
gumbo but that one tasted like the

2524
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:19,198
rainbow belts that I was smoking so it

2525
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:21,179
had a lot of uh rainbow belts and

2526
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:22,919
Skittles if it's not I'm dumb but it

2527
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:24,359
tasted like Skittles

2528
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,719
s there's all types of Skittles tonight

2529
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:30,238
oh just [ __ ] Skittles everything

2530
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:32,279
I mean that's a good point to talk about

2531
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:33,718
for a second I find that Skittles is

2532
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:35,639
interesting because the overwhelming

2533
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:37,079
majority of people love the flavor of it

2534
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:39,239
right that's why it got big it's done

2535
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:41,460
well for itself but you get a small

2536
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:44,099
subsect of people who are like just

2537
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:45,420
tastes like soap to me where do you sit

2538
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:48,000
on that

2539
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:51,179
I don't taste like soap to me Skittles

2540
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,460
has its own unique profile I got preview

2541
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:55,800
the Skittles not in the States but when

2542
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:58,439
I would go travel to Barcelona they

2543
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,360
[ __ ] love Skittles out there and

2544
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:02,939
[ __ ] Skittles you know if it ain't

2545
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:05,579
Skittles [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of

2546
01:38:02,939 --> 01:38:08,158
here so uh you know I fell in love with

2547
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:10,920
it out there came back home

2548
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,259
and it's been a wrap since

2549
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:15,079
and it ain't so I've had some soapy [ __ ]

2550
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:17,880
before and

2551
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:20,100
[ __ ] disgusting and and and that's

2552
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:22,079
crazy because I've never like like I

2553
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:25,199
can't even say what weed that is I I can

2554
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,760
just I'm just like dude you had that in

2555
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:28,859
the [ __ ] laundry or something you

2556
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,320
know what I mean because there's no way

2557
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:33,238
weed can be that [ __ ] bad but if it

2558
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:34,920
is man that's probably like the only

2559
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:36,299
strain that I'll hate you know what I

2560
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,119
mean and it ain't Skittles because

2561
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:40,920
Skittles ain't that soapy [ __ ] and one

2562
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:43,439
time I did have a strain like that when

2563
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,899
we were in Colorado I was smoking with

2564
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:48,960
uh Ginger larf and and and and and

2565
01:38:45,899 --> 01:38:51,539
[ __ ] I forgot his [ __ ] name but

2566
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,039
he's uh real Rocky's homie and they'd be

2567
01:38:51,539 --> 01:38:55,738
able to tell you what [ __ ] strain

2568
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,060
that was but uh hopefully I can uh you

2569
01:38:55,738 --> 01:38:58,500
know show them this podcast and they'll

2570
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,300
be like oh that was this train and I'll

2571
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,079
be like [ __ ] that strain that's the only

2572
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,079
strain I hate

2573
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:09,479
there you go I mean you touched on the

2574
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:11,279
the Barcelona scene which I think is an

2575
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:13,619
interesting sort of scene in its own

2576
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,300
right what's your thoughts when you go

2577
01:39:13,619 --> 01:39:16,979
over there do you feel like in a couple

2578
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,260
years that would be kind of where the

2579
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:21,779
USA scene is do you feel like they

2580
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:23,340
follow the USA Trends too much what's

2581
01:39:21,779 --> 01:39:26,340
your thoughts overall

2582
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:28,980
that's two whole different Vibes G uh

2583
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:31,039
even amongst us in LA from state to

2584
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:34,019
state city to City so

2585
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:35,399
you can't replicate that you know uh the

2586
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,860
the the

2587
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:40,500
let alone the [ __ ] the city you're in

2588
01:39:37,859 --> 01:39:44,279
like you're in you're in like old world

2589
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:46,198
you know catalonian land and then next

2590
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:49,019
you know you're smoking a joint like you

2591
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:50,698
can't replicate that you know so uh it's

2592
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:53,940
its own thing

2593
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:56,359
sure and I mean interestingly we've seen

2594
01:39:53,939 --> 01:39:59,698
a lot of people leave California

2595
01:39:56,359 --> 01:40:03,059
say since the start of the Year often

2596
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:05,339
citing things like that it's too hard to

2597
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:07,500
get into the legal Market rents in

2598
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:09,480
California are quite prohibitive things

2599
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:12,000
like that and they're moving to other

2600
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:13,379
states do you feel like Barcelona or

2601
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,658
some of these other states will

2602
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:16,920
eventually Take the Lead over Kali as

2603
01:40:15,658 --> 01:40:18,839
the hot spot or do you think it's always

2604
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:21,719
going to retain that title of like the

2605
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:25,440
weed Mecca of the world so to speak

2606
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:29,420
yeah the the uh Cali will remain uh the

2607
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:32,939
mecca I think but other places will

2608
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:35,819
emulate and innovate you know what we

2609
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:38,399
got going here some places you know

2610
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:41,460
already do that so uh

2611
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:43,019
you know California I think is the

2612
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:44,939
[ __ ] you know the place that people

2613
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,139
you know good weed in California go hand

2614
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:48,419
in hand

2615
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:51,300
yeah touche too right

2616
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:53,100
so on that note of doing a dab right

2617
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:55,199
there and I think I can see you grinding

2618
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:56,820
up some flour right now my question is

2619
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:59,399
if you had to pick one or the other

2620
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:02,819
which would you be a concentrate or a

2621
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:06,960
flower guy oh man I'm not hash all day G

2622
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:10,198
hash I love me some dab of some hash

2623
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,239
hell yeah and what sort of style of hash

2624
01:41:10,198 --> 01:41:14,399
do you like water hash do you like dry

2625
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:16,138
sieve like what's your preferred if you

2626
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:19,679
could choose anything

2627
01:41:16,139 --> 01:41:23,400
full melt full melts uh water extracted

2628
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:25,380
hash is you know rare but it's there and

2629
01:41:23,399 --> 01:41:28,619
that's my favorite full body for

2630
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:31,380
everything it just feels the best uh and

2631
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:34,198
second is Hash rosin

2632
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:37,679
really great too

2633
01:41:34,198 --> 01:41:40,738
sure good picks good picks do you feel

2634
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:43,859
like water hash and more importantly as

2635
01:41:40,738 --> 01:41:45,899
you alluded to like you know full melt

2636
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:47,880
you know the five star the best quality

2637
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:50,099
you can get do you feel like it's almost

2638
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:52,139
becoming a bit of a Dying art I feel

2639
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:55,079
like we're seeing a lot of concentrates

2640
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:57,539
in the market but water hash doesn't

2641
01:41:55,079 --> 01:42:00,420
seem to be as well represented as say

2642
01:41:57,539 --> 01:42:04,679
like BHO or some other styles

2643
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:07,980
I mean uh it's easier to polish a turd

2644
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:10,859
with BHO and those other styles with

2645
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:13,259
full melt it's fire in fire out so if

2646
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:16,259
that shit's not pristine it's just not

2647
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:18,960
going to be good you know so uh you

2648
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:21,780
can't really hide it a lot in full melt

2649
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:25,020
so a lot of people aren't the most

2650
01:42:21,779 --> 01:42:27,118
versed so they can't achieve full amount

2651
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:29,040
and if they do it's not up to par so

2652
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:31,019
they end up squishing it into hash rosin

2653
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:32,819
because Lord knows

2654
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,920
they would rather have some [ __ ] full

2655
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:37,738
milk too but you know it's it's probably

2656
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:40,079
has too much particulate in it or just

2657
01:42:37,738 --> 01:42:42,718
doesn't you know smoke as good as the

2658
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:43,500
hash rosin you can make what it does so

2659
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,439
uh

2660
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:48,539
that's the case with full mouth

2661
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:50,819
sure and do you think that it just

2662
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:52,920
worked out coincidentally that like the

2663
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:55,380
Wilson mail is really good for adding

2664
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:57,658
trichomes for kind of making strains

2665
01:42:55,380 --> 01:43:00,539
that would suit this style I guess what

2666
01:42:57,658 --> 01:43:02,638
I'm trying to ask is do you breed for

2667
01:43:00,539 --> 01:43:05,399
concentrate production or it was just

2668
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:07,139
sort of a like a happy coincidence that

2669
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:08,759
that was how the Wilson mail happens to

2670
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:11,100
affect crosses

2671
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:12,960
yeah it was a happy coincidence because

2672
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:15,960
uh it could have been I could have been

2673
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,579
when I made that like that was it like

2674
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,960
it could have been something else it

2675
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:21,600
could have been uh

2676
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:26,158
two strains from somebody else

2677
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:27,840
who wasn't as good as Oni you know and

2678
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:29,638
that would have never happened so it was

2679
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,159
all coincidental and it just so happens

2680
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:34,618
these wash really well papaya washes

2681
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:37,439
really well banana G washes really well

2682
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:39,420
chop F2 just so happens to wash all

2683
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:41,460
three of them together [ __ ] you know

2684
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:44,340
there was nothing that you know reduced

2685
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:46,319
the quality and the genetic per se but

2686
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:48,060
I'm not a [ __ ] uh

2687
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:50,099
you know I'm talking about [ __ ] I don't

2688
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:54,539
know about because you know I'm just

2689
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:57,900
[ __ ] like you know it is what it is

2690
01:43:54,539 --> 01:43:59,639
so so you mentioned earlier that a lot

2691
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:01,679
of your breeding involves hitting Wilson

2692
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:03,779
to things and kind of seeing what comes

2693
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:07,139
out of it do you ever approach any

2694
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:08,939
crosses where you've you kind of think

2695
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:10,560
of it conceptually and you're like oh I

2696
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:12,960
think that these two strains are going

2697
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,760
to pair really well together or is it

2698
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,079
just a bit more sort of haphazard in the

2699
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,280
way you approach it and you're just like

2700
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:18,779
well if it's going to work it's going to

2701
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:21,238
work we'll just see what happens like

2702
01:44:18,779 --> 01:44:24,719
how do you approach making it it's

2703
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:27,359
usually uh uh what the mom's about you

2704
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:30,359
know so if Mom's banging I like the mom

2705
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:32,460
you know I'm like oh this is gonna be

2706
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:35,279
cool you know because that's what I like

2707
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:37,500
but if it's like oh like here goes

2708
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,779
nothing you know hopefully someone likes

2709
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:41,399
it then that's what that is and and

2710
01:44:39,779 --> 01:44:42,960
that's exactly what that is because

2711
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:45,238
there's people that like stuff that

2712
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,399
other people don't like and [ __ ]

2713
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:49,979
that's how life is you know [ __ ]

2714
01:44:47,399 --> 01:44:51,839
colors and [ __ ]

2715
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:55,698
yeah sure

2716
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:59,400
so on the topic of Wilson we had a few

2717
01:44:55,698 --> 01:45:01,559
listeners chime in and ask what would be

2718
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:03,299
some of your top picks for the Wilson

2719
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,980
crosses if they're kind of thinking

2720
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:07,560
about snatching something up from the

2721
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:10,859
site what do you recommend and what's

2722
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:13,739
like your sort of personal favorites

2723
01:45:10,859 --> 01:45:15,420
well [ __ ] uh I would ask them what's

2724
01:45:13,738 --> 01:45:17,939
their favorite you know like what do you

2725
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:20,039
like okay I just so happen to have that

2726
01:45:17,939 --> 01:45:21,779
cross the Wilson go check that out I

2727
01:45:20,039 --> 01:45:23,760
would tell them go grab Wilson by itself

2728
01:45:21,779 --> 01:45:25,139
but that's gone you know so they can

2729
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,659
have a marker of what they're getting

2730
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:30,659
into and see what that Wilson even

2731
01:45:27,658 --> 01:45:32,399
brought to said mother said strain so

2732
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,379
they could be like oh cool like I see

2733
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:37,859
the Wilson in The GMO because I've

2734
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:41,460
actually smoked Wilson before so uh

2735
01:45:37,859 --> 01:45:43,139
I I used to tell people go get Wilson so

2736
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,118
now it's all like oh get what you like

2737
01:45:43,139 --> 01:45:47,880
oh you like gelato go grab the g33

2738
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:49,439
Wilson oh you want like some old land

2739
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:51,600
race type [ __ ] you want some antique

2740
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:54,000
[ __ ] I got you you know [ __ ] you want

2741
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:58,139
some Exotics I got you you know cover

2742
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,880
every every marker but uh yeah I would

2743
01:45:58,139 --> 01:46:01,500
tell them to grab what they like

2744
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:03,420
and if they they don't know what they

2745
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:05,579
like I'll tell them go grab the five for

2746
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:07,260
100 because you're just gonna get a

2747
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:08,698
bunch of seats and [ __ ] you're gonna

2748
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:10,500
have fun and you won't feel bad because

2749
01:46:08,698 --> 01:46:13,919
it wasn't a hundred dollars for [ __ ]

2750
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:15,600
12 seeds it was you know way cheaper

2751
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,880
sure

2752
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:21,719
another question we got from a lot of

2753
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:24,300
customers was regarding testing and I

2754
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:25,760
think that there historically has been

2755
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:28,260
this sort of

2756
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:31,079
tradition of people testing their

2757
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:32,940
crosses but in a more recent sort of

2758
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:35,039
turn of events we've had many breeders

2759
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:36,839
come on the show and say that if you're

2760
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:39,960
going to make crosses and test them out

2761
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:41,699
and do the whole nine yards often the

2762
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:44,340
trend and the hype has come and gone

2763
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:45,899
before you can get that to Market what's

2764
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:47,900
your thoughts do you subscribe to that

2765
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:50,279
idea and do you tend to test

2766
01:46:47,899 --> 01:46:53,039
that's that's a nice way of putting it

2767
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:55,259
you know the way they say it you know

2768
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:57,840
that's that's [ __ ] yeah that's that's

2769
01:46:55,260 --> 01:47:00,539
like you know you sound you sound cool

2770
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,520
saying that but yeah straight up uh new

2771
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:03,960
[ __ ] I just put it out I don't test new

2772
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,239
[ __ ] but then again

2773
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:08,520
they're not they don't have to buy that

2774
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,399
[ __ ] there's a hundred strains that are

2775
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:13,380
two years old almost to date that are

2776
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:15,299
tested and I got numbers and I can show

2777
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:18,179
you a thousand pictures of so you can be

2778
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:20,279
like Oh I like that you know or you can

2779
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,840
you know [ __ ] do what I do and just

2780
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:24,359
grow any [ __ ] seed and see what

2781
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:27,000
[ __ ] happens and and be on top of the

2782
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:29,759
game and what they said by the time you

2783
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,039
know I test any runs Cross or any given

2784
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:35,520
hype strain the new one's going to be

2785
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:37,079
out so [ __ ] it's just just be honest

2786
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,360
about it [ __ ] if you didn't test it

2787
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:41,519
you didn't test it easy does it and and

2788
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:43,319
if nobody needs to buy it but if they

2789
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,760
weren't tested I got that too we got a

2790
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:46,738
hundred [ __ ] strains that are tested

2791
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,260
you know [ __ ] there's a little bit of

2792
01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:51,419
everything so uh and everything will be

2793
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,940
tested [ __ ] from the day you grab

2794
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:55,139
that strain [ __ ] somebody else you

2795
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:56,519
know three weeks later is gonna be like

2796
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:57,779
boom here's the pictures and I'll be

2797
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,360
like here's your tested [ __ ]

2798
01:47:57,779 --> 01:48:02,460
have a good day because that's exactly

2799
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:05,519
what it is you know [ __ ] they can say

2800
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:07,618
like oh you know [ __ ] I don't think

2801
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,080
they're out there with like a chart and

2802
01:48:07,618 --> 01:48:12,960
like a 200 Fino hunt on every strain

2803
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:15,539
they make I I highly doubt it and

2804
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:18,539
they're like oh you know 20 Herms and

2805
01:48:15,539 --> 01:48:20,819
you know germ raid Etc no most of the

2806
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:22,979
time it's all like oh the homie [ __ ]

2807
01:48:20,819 --> 01:48:25,439
that I never even met on Instagram that

2808
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:28,259
I sent testers to popped them he sent me

2809
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:30,719
a couple pictures it's tested he gave me

2810
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:32,219
a cool perspective and uh some people do

2811
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,079
have their testers and you know all

2812
01:48:32,219 --> 01:48:36,000
power to them like capillator the

2813
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:37,979
stranded I can't really stranded until

2814
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,100
cap is finished testing it

2815
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:43,439
so you know I do abide by those rules

2816
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:45,840
when I need to and you know with a cross

2817
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:48,419
with cap he's not going to let you know

2818
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:51,119
a bunch of Herms pop up with his collab

2819
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:54,300
with Masonic because it'll be funny so

2820
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:55,920
uh but but yeah like you know there's a

2821
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,020
hundred tested strains guys you know

2822
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,880
[ __ ] you want some tested [ __ ] I got

2823
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:02,280
you you want to be you know the new guy

2824
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:04,679
with the new [ __ ] I got that too you

2825
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:05,880
know what I mean whatever you want

2826
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:08,460
sure

2827
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:11,039
so you mentioned earlier that Wilson as

2828
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:12,960
a pure strain was sold out do you ever

2829
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:15,300
plan to remake it or do you like the

2830
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,520
idea of like there being some amount of

2831
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:19,860
exclusivity by not just continually

2832
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,900
remaking strains

2833
01:49:19,859 --> 01:49:23,939
and now F2 that that's it you know

2834
01:49:21,899 --> 01:49:26,339
whoever got it they got it if they want

2835
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:29,519
to keep a clone of it around and let it

2836
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:32,340
circulate you know by all means we're

2837
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,440
we're working on the F3 already so you

2838
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:37,380
know I already have the F3 so I'm gonna

2839
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:40,500
pop those out maybe find a keeper rotate

2840
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:43,800
that around and make the F4

2841
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:45,719
nice and I mean another question is

2842
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,760
about new males you know everyone's

2843
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:50,039
familiar with the Wilson work so we had

2844
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,619
quite a few questions regarding possible

2845
01:49:50,039 --> 01:49:54,600
new males and I noticed on your website

2846
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:56,939
that there were in fact a few crosses

2847
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:59,039
that utilized a monkey berries male

2848
01:49:56,939 --> 01:50:01,500
which I believe is from exotic genetics

2849
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:03,420
is that correct yeah that's that

2850
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:05,000
strawberries and cream

2851
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:08,279
uh

2852
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,600
across to Grease Monkey my high ass yeah

2853
01:50:08,279 --> 01:50:11,939
that's exactly what it is so what

2854
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:13,920
happened there what I do every year

2855
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:17,759
uh so

2856
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:19,859
two years ago or a year ago I like you

2857
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,619
grow a lot of seeds right and there's

2858
01:50:19,859 --> 01:50:24,960
males and and sometimes you spent money

2859
01:50:22,618 --> 01:50:26,759
on them and you're just like [ __ ] I

2860
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,739
don't want this male to go to waste it's

2861
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:31,199
like a cool no it has runs in it or it

2862
01:50:28,738 --> 01:50:33,118
has Grease Monkey in it you know it's it

2863
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:37,198
looks promising amongst you know it's

2864
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:39,658
counterparts so what I do what I did is

2865
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:41,698
like hey Los Angeles who wants to make a

2866
01:50:39,658 --> 01:50:44,099
strain would Masonic and they're like me

2867
01:50:41,698 --> 01:50:46,259
me me me me me me me me so I was like

2868
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:48,239
come okay come grab the smell hit it to

2869
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:50,699
you know your selection bring me half

2870
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:53,519
the seeds you know you keep half I keep

2871
01:50:50,698 --> 01:50:57,899
half so everything that isn't a Wilson

2872
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,639
hybrid on my site was pollinated and and

2873
01:50:57,899 --> 01:51:01,979
it wasn't like a random person the

2874
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:04,199
people that I did have do it were part

2875
01:51:01,979 --> 01:51:06,959
of uh my people that become my friends

2876
01:51:04,198 --> 01:51:10,079
now like you know Long Beach reefer did

2877
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:12,779
the monkey Berry cross for me uh I-beam

01:51:12,779 --> 01:51:16,618
uh for Masonic exceed company or for

2880
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:18,420
himself however you want to look at it

2881
01:51:16,618 --> 01:51:20,460
he made the seeds you know that I just

2882
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:22,859
so happen to have on my website that I

2883
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:24,960
provided the mail for that I grew out

2884
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:26,158
that I selected for them I'm like hey

2885
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,500
you should use this it's a cool

2886

and there's a couple more that probably

2889
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,560
aren't even you know up for grabs but

2890
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:39,238
that I have that I've done with uh you

2891
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:41,460
know a bunch of other of my buddies that

2892
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:42,599
grow as well and they're super into it

2893
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:44,639
because you know they get to [ __ ]

2894
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:46,139
make seeds and keep them and now they're

2895
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,359
in other people's hands because you know

2896
01:51:46,139 --> 01:51:49,739
I got a big Avenue to put seeds in

2897
01:51:48,359 --> 01:51:51,960
people's hands and they're like cool

2898
01:51:49,738 --> 01:51:53,698
[ __ ] my seeds are in Ecuador now you

2899
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:55,260
know yeah you made that in your backyard

2900
01:51:53,698 --> 01:51:57,419
[ __ ] good [ __ ] we did that together

2901
01:51:55,260 --> 01:52:00,920
you know it's a team effort

2902
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:04,380
yeah that's a good way to do collabs so

2903
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:06,359
in general what are you looking for in a

2904
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:08,520
strain when you're looking to pop a new

2905
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:10,738
one and maybe find a male in it and I

2906
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:12,960
guess in general are you a fan of

2907
01:52:10,738 --> 01:52:16,379
Exotics work

2908
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:20,100
everything I've grown from exotic uh I

2909
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:23,100
grew the the funky charms I grew the

2910
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:24,960
strawberries and cream I grew the slaps

2911
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:27,659
the Grease Monkey strawberries and cream

2912
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,579
I grew the slabs and everything so far

2913
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:31,500
has been I haven't been like oh that's

2914
01:52:29,579 --> 01:52:34,760
just not good you know everything's been

2915
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:37,500
great actually everything was great

2916
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:40,800
and [ __ ]

2917
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:42,060
When selecting anything it's just you

2918
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,400
know of course I'm not going to go with

2919
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:46,380
the rents you know the runts it's like

2920
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:48,960
all right like that's no bueno

2921
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:51,480
uh just the best [ __ ] you can tell

2922
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:54,000
[ __ ] the [ __ ] that Stacks the most

2923
01:52:51,479 --> 01:52:57,658
the [ __ ] that smells the most you know

2924
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:00,060
the more vigorous ones [ __ ] like that

2925
01:52:57,658 --> 01:53:02,519
people want to make it like this this

2926
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:04,139
this [ __ ] hard ass process but you

2927
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:05,880
know you put five fools in front of me

2928
01:53:04,139 --> 01:53:08,100
and I can tell you who's more athletic

2929
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:10,500
you know [ __ ] it ain't the food that

2930
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:12,480
weighs 300 pounds you know it's it's the

2931
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,460
six foot tall dude who's [ __ ] built

2932
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:16,198
like a linebacker it's the same thing

2933
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:17,579
with plants you could see it you could

2934
01:53:16,198 --> 01:53:19,678
feel it you've been growing for 10 years

2935
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:21,840
I hope you could [ __ ] tell which one

2936
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:24,779
is better than the other one

2937
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:26,340
definitely and that's a great answer in

2938
01:53:24,779 --> 01:53:30,420
terms of seguing to the next question

2939
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:32,279
which is what are some of the traits you

2940
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:34,500
look for in a male when you're looking

2941
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:36,420
to breed with it or is it more of a

2942
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:38,840
process of like feel and like you've got

2943
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:41,699
a hunch on this one

2944
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:44,039
uh it's like

2945
01:53:41,698 --> 01:53:46,259
like the way I chose this one you just

2946
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:47,460
stuck out the most you know he was a bit

2947
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:50,159
more

2948
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:51,359
the bigger one you know he just grew the

2949
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:54,420
fastest

2950
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:56,279
and that's how I chose my most recent uh

2951
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:58,618
mail that I have so

2952
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:00,719
it just sticks out amongst the pack and

2953
01:53:58,618 --> 01:54:02,759
it is a hunch if you want to call it

2954
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:05,279
that and as far as like oh I look for

2955
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:07,079
internodal spacing and all that other

2956
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:09,059
[ __ ] like I didn't dive that deep

2957
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:10,859
I'm just like that's the one we're gonna

2958
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:13,500
do work let's do work oh cool everything

2959
01:54:10,859 --> 01:54:15,359
all the progeny from it has been A1 so

2960
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:18,840
you know it worked

2961
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:21,359
boom yeah you just kind of touched on an

2962
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:23,340
interesting topic there and I think DJ

2963
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,099
Short kind of summarizes it the best

2964
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:27,539
himself where he says he kind of says

2965
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:29,219
look you know some people will tell you

2966
01:54:27,539 --> 01:54:30,960
that there's certain things you can look

2967
01:54:29,219 --> 01:54:32,460
at in a mail and it'll indicate whether

2968
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,198
it's going to be a good or bad father

2969
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:36,359
and he was like but at the end of the

2970
01:54:34,198 --> 01:54:38,460
day [ __ ] all that it's about testing the

2971
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:40,679
seeds and if the seeds are good the male

2972
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:42,239
was good it's just that simple do you

2973
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:44,158
subscribe to that idea or do you think

2974
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:45,479
there are certain things you can look at

2975
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:47,039
the mail and be like oh you know this

2976
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:48,319
one's got the short into nodes it'll be

2977
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,060
better

2978
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:52,500
nah nah I haven't talked to

2979
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:54,840
uh

2980
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:57,300
a breeder and dove in that deep and and

2981
01:54:54,840 --> 01:55:00,000
respected that opinion to that point you

2982
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,920
know but uh there are some there are

2983
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,779
some things like that but you know the

2984
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:07,380
other day I learned that you know the

2985
01:55:03,779 --> 01:55:09,479
the root ball in any given male could be

2986
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:11,340
you know like a good indicator of a good

2987
01:55:09,479 --> 01:55:12,779
male because you know it has a bigger

2988
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:16,139
stomach per se and it can uptick

2989
01:55:12,779 --> 01:55:18,479
nutrients and [ __ ] but uh but DJ Short

2990
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:21,960
is right in the way that you know if the

2991
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,638
shit's good it's good and [ __ ] and no

2992
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:25,560
matter how you [ __ ] chose the mouth

2993
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:27,000
there's no denying that [ __ ] you

2994
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,679
could have did the any mini miny mo

2995
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,960
method you know you could have had your

2996
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:32,579
neighbor juice for you like [ __ ] you

2997
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,139
could have pulled it out of the [ __ ]

2998
01:55:32,579 --> 01:55:36,479
hat but as long as the shit's [ __ ]

2999
01:55:34,139 --> 01:55:39,239
good that's what matters and you know

3000
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:41,459
whatever selection method you have

3001
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:43,259
that's good too good for you you [ __ ]

3002

3014
01:56:12,899 --> 01:56:16,138
strain you know we'll just say that the

3015
01:56:14,579 --> 01:56:18,179
monkey berries from exotic you've

3016
01:56:16,139 --> 01:56:20,159
decided you want to run some of it

3017
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:21,719
do you generally have a certain number

3018
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:23,399
of seeds you like to run like do you

3019
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:25,859
feel like one Pack's enough or you like

3020
01:56:23,399 --> 01:56:28,920
to get a couple packs how does that work

3021
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:30,899
oh no man um I'll get away with popping

3022
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:33,779
six of them [ __ ] Doug I'll pop

3023
01:56:30,899 --> 01:56:35,579
half the pack and or or the whole pack

3024
01:56:33,779 --> 01:56:37,439
you know and and [ __ ] most of the

3025
01:56:35,579 --> 01:56:39,300
time you find some dope Shin there but

3026
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:41,158
sometimes nothing comes out of it like

3027
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:43,139
the [ __ ] seeds won't even make it

3028
01:56:41,158 --> 01:56:46,979
you'll get all males and you'll be like

3029
01:56:43,139 --> 01:56:48,359
nothing uh sometimes you get the most

3030
01:56:46,979 --> 01:56:50,339
beautiful female and you're just like

3031
01:56:48,359 --> 01:56:53,939
damn like that's that's that's some

3032
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:55,619
gangster ass weed right there but uh and

3033
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:57,419
it's never more than [ __ ] one pack

3034
01:56:55,618 --> 01:56:59,698
the only [ __ ] that I do more than one

3035
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:01,739
pack is when I cross it to Wilson again

3036
01:56:59,698 --> 01:57:03,539
because now I I got more [ __ ] to play

3037
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:05,759
with you know what I mean so I can cross

3038
01:57:03,539 --> 01:57:07,439
I can pop you know as opposed to you

3039
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,539
know I went and bought a hundred dollar

3040
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:11,460
plus pack of 12 seeds from any given

3041
01:57:09,539 --> 01:57:12,840
breeder you know I'm like [ __ ] you with

3042
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:14,880
these seeds you know like I don't want

3043
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:16,020
these to go to waste so I hit them to

3044
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,539
Wilson

3045
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:20,219
and then now I got a million of them you

3046
01:57:18,539 --> 01:57:21,960
know so now I can go play with these

3047
01:57:20,219 --> 01:57:25,319
more and and that's kind of when it

3048
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:27,779
comes to Big Fino hunts it's most likely

3049
01:57:25,319 --> 01:57:31,920
going to be a Wilson hybrid

3050
01:57:27,779 --> 01:57:34,500
sure I mean it makes sense right so I

3051
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:37,020
guess the kind of the final question on

3052
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:39,779
Fino hunting I have is that when you do

3053
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,880
run some new seeds are you primarily

3054
01:57:39,779 --> 01:57:43,679
looking at the females and if you're

3055
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:45,599
impressed by the females you then

3056
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,279
consider using a male or is it the other

3057
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:49,860
way around where you go into it thinking

3058
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:52,380
I want to find a female uh sorry a male

3059
01:57:49,859 --> 01:57:54,420
I want to find a male nah it's never one

3060
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:57,060
to find them out it's the male is always

3061
01:57:54,420 --> 01:58:00,000
Wilson as is my mouth unless it's like

3062
01:57:57,060 --> 01:58:01,739
what the [ __ ] is that you know then then

3063
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,599
I'll I'll do what I did with the other

3064
01:58:01,738 --> 01:58:05,698
ones you know where I I you know

3065
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:08,940
Outsource them to another person so

3066
01:58:05,698 --> 01:58:11,819
there's no cross pollination going on so

3067
01:58:08,939 --> 01:58:15,000
uh sometimes and it's not even looking

3068
01:58:11,819 --> 01:58:18,359
for a Mel it's all like that has a nice

3069
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,399
calling to it or you know we we can hype

3070
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:22,439
that you know like that's runs times

3071
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:24,000
this we should totally continue that you

3072
01:58:22,439 --> 01:58:27,299
know because people are gonna want that

3073
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,399
you know or or that's a CBD or you know

3074
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,840
that's freak Show freak shows gnarly you

3075
01:58:29,399 --> 01:58:33,899
know or that's Australian bastard

3076
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:36,060
cannabis no matter what it is we have to

3077
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:37,920
continue that you know what I mean so

3078
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:40,739
it's it's [ __ ] like that you know it's

3079
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,179
it's there's equations to wanting to

3080
01:58:40,738 --> 01:58:44,339
keep something around whether being

3081
01:58:42,179 --> 01:58:47,819
female or in malformed

3082
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:49,199
sure so you just mentioned CBD and I

3083
01:58:47,819 --> 01:58:52,618
noticed on your site that you actually

3084
01:58:49,198 --> 01:58:54,598
do have a CBD cross using the uh I think

3085
01:58:52,618 --> 01:58:56,939
it's the auto Colorado Cherry mother

3086
01:58:54,599 --> 01:58:58,920
crossed to Wilson is this something you

3087
01:58:56,939 --> 01:59:00,658
did because you specifically wanted to

3088
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:02,579
be able to provide people with a CBD

3089
01:59:00,658 --> 01:59:04,618
option or do you think that there's

3090
01:59:02,579 --> 01:59:06,539
actually a bit more to CBD than most

3091
01:59:04,618 --> 01:59:08,880
people think and you've got kind of some

3092
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:13,319
future plans to work with it more

3093
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:16,800
so my buddy had uh did a CBD seed stock

3094
01:59:13,319 --> 01:59:19,198
like by itself so he had [ __ ] a whole

3095
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:21,900
room full of that [ __ ] and he's like hey

3096
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:23,579
Masonic like want to sell some CBD and

3097
01:59:21,899 --> 01:59:26,098
I'm like man I don't know [ __ ] about CBD

3098
01:59:23,579 --> 01:59:29,340
like and he's like well you know he he

3099
01:59:26,099 --> 01:59:31,980
put me on game and he's like it's uh box

3100
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:33,960
Colorado Cherry Box Auto or some [ __ ]

3101
01:59:31,979 --> 01:59:35,519
like that it's actually know what it is

3102
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,239
but that's that's what it is it's auto

3103
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:40,219
box Colorado Cherry Auto Times Wilson

3104
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:42,658
and uh

3105
01:59:40,219 --> 01:59:45,960
he's all I used to sell it so I start

3106
01:59:42,658 --> 01:59:48,179
selling it to people and as CBD

3107
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:50,399
and people are growing it and they're

3108
01:59:48,179 --> 01:59:54,420
sending me back results and it's CBD

3109
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:56,158
thank [ __ ] God so it's CBD and I'm

3110
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:59,039
all like and I'm like man everybody

3111
01:59:56,158 --> 02:00:01,379
keeps asking me for CBD you know CBD CBD

3112
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:03,118
so I already had CBD so I was telling

3113
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:05,639
them that it wasn't a Wilson hybrid yet

3114
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:07,198
I was selling them to it as is and I

3115
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:08,760
still have some of that stock and then

3116
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,219
I'm like [ __ ] it you know I'm gonna grow

3117
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:13,199
some myself too so I I have this bed and

3118
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:14,819
I just literally just [ __ ]

3119
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:16,678
like because I had a lot of it I just

3120
02:00:14,819 --> 02:00:19,439
threw a handful in there and I grew out

3121
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:21,719
of bed full of CBD hit it to Wilson so

3122
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:24,299
in that CBD seed stock it's actually

3123
02:00:21,719 --> 02:00:27,000
like any given mother that she'll get in

3124
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:29,520
there Times Wilson but it's it's box

3125
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,840
auto box Cherry Times Wilson though and

3126
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,239
that's exactly what it is people are

3127
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:36,659
growing at I've yet to get tests on it

3128
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:39,959
but it is a CBD THC cross

3129
02:00:36,658 --> 02:00:41,698
and and is that something you want to

3130
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:43,980
maybe delve a little deeper into in

3131
02:00:41,698 --> 02:00:45,299
regards to just generally CBD stuff or

3132
02:00:43,979 --> 02:00:47,098
do you just like being able to provide

3133
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:50,219
that option

3134
02:00:47,099 --> 02:00:52,319
uh uh I like to cover everything and I

3135
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:54,719
you know I got a lot of uh questions on

3136
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:57,179
CBD CBD you know and I'm all like well

3137
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:59,158
[ __ ] you know I'll this ain't [ __ ]

3138
02:00:57,179 --> 02:01:01,199
you know uh

3139
02:00:59,158 --> 02:01:02,819
I don't have like a paper and [ __ ] but

3140
02:01:01,198 --> 02:01:05,638
you know this is as much as I can tell

3141
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:07,618
you on CBD we had like some COA and [ __ ]

3142
02:01:05,639 --> 02:01:10,380
but you know how from County to County

3143
02:01:07,618 --> 02:01:12,118
to state to state hot can you know it

3144
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:14,940
can go from up and down so some places

3145
02:01:12,118 --> 02:01:16,380
it could have been hot and [ __ ] so you

3146
02:01:14,939 --> 02:01:18,479
know my buddy almost got in trouble for

3147
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:21,300
that but the way I sold it is like look

3148
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:22,799
here [ __ ] like this is CBD you know

3149
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:24,480
like this isn't you're not getting this

3150
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,400
with a [ __ ] lawyer or nothing this

3151
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:29,098
isn't I'm not going over here telling

3152
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:31,679
you to go do a whole cash crop you know

3153
02:01:29,099 --> 02:01:33,360
[ __ ] in in in Idaho somewhere where

3154
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:35,039
they grow a bunch of it I don't know but

3155
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:37,439
I'm I'm just giving you a couple and and

3156
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:39,840
it is CBD but it is because I got tests

3157
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,519
and [ __ ] you know people love it and

3158
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,819
he did too and it's just it's just hot

3159
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:47,280
in some places compared to others yeah

3160
02:01:44,819 --> 02:01:49,259
sure I think you know the variation is

3161
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:50,819
is somewhat intrinsic to plants right

3162
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:53,820
like they're not they're not identicals

3163
02:01:50,819 --> 02:01:56,759
of each other another cross I noticed on

3164
02:01:53,819 --> 02:01:59,219
your site which caught my eye was

3165
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:02,280
actually uh you did a cross using the

3166
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:03,960
Romulan clone and I wanted to ask what's

3167
02:02:02,279 --> 02:02:06,539
your thoughts on the Romulan it's come

3168
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:08,639
up a few times in the show because as

3169
02:02:06,539 --> 02:02:10,738
far as we can tell it might be the

3170
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:12,599
oldest clone in existence if you trace

3171
02:02:10,738 --> 02:02:13,738
it back it appears to be older than most

3172
02:02:12,599 --> 02:02:15,539
things

3173
02:02:13,738 --> 02:02:16,979
do you think your Cut's the original and

3174
02:02:15,539 --> 02:02:21,719
are you a fan of it

3175
02:02:16,979 --> 02:02:25,738
I got Romulan from three sources I got

3176
02:02:21,719 --> 02:02:27,179
Romulan from some dude that's pretty you

3177
02:02:25,738 --> 02:02:29,158
know like he's

3178
02:02:27,179 --> 02:02:32,219
you know he he's not like out here like

3179
02:02:29,158 --> 02:02:34,379
Masonic you know 40K followers but you

3180
02:02:32,219 --> 02:02:37,560
know like he was in the forums back in

3181
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:39,659
the day and you know he can talk to you

3182
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:41,699
know all these esteemed Growers and [ __ ]

3183
02:02:39,658 --> 02:02:44,698
and for whatever reason he reached out

3184
02:02:41,698 --> 02:02:47,638
to me and went as far as uh I don't know

3185
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:49,559
how some way but we he ended up using my

3186
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:52,079
name as his as his cloning so he's

3187
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:55,679
Masonic cloner so he sent me a Romulan

3188
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:57,118
cut so he's like pretty cool in the

3189
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:58,800
scene you know what I mean I think you

3190
02:02:57,118 --> 02:03:01,319
know Growers know who he is and stuff

3191
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:03,360
like cool Growers or whatever like like

3192
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:06,359
old school fools you know as opposed to

3193
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:08,399
you know us new guys and he reached out

3194
02:03:06,359 --> 02:03:09,960
and sent me a lot of old school [ __ ] and

3195
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:12,238
I kind of took it for granted because

3196
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:13,739
you get lost in the sauce sometimes and

3197
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:15,899
you're just like yeah yeah whatever use

3198
02:03:13,738 --> 02:03:18,238
Masonic cloner oh cool cool send me

3199
02:03:15,899 --> 02:03:20,158
those clones he sends me like everything

3200
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:21,598
anybody would ever want like as a

3201
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:23,819
starter pack and you're like whatever

3202
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:26,460
I'll hit him to Wilson and I did

3203
02:03:23,819 --> 02:03:28,979
but like but you lost that relationship

3204
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:30,300
because I wasn't too thankful about it

3205
02:03:28,979 --> 02:03:31,500
because I should have been more thankful

3206
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:34,139
about it because that's not just

3207
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:36,300
something you get and uh

3208
02:03:34,139 --> 02:03:37,800
and I think back on that so

3209
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:39,900
and whatever that's the whole other

3210
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:42,599
story but that's who I got one of my

3211
02:03:39,899 --> 02:03:45,539
romulans from and another Romulan I got

3212
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:49,139
from one of my buddies who just he just

3213
02:03:45,539 --> 02:03:52,198
trades back and forth so uh with him I

3214
02:03:49,139 --> 02:03:54,179
wouldn't like take it I'd take it with a

3215
02:03:52,198 --> 02:03:56,759
grain of salt more than anything because

3216
02:03:54,179 --> 02:03:58,980
you know it matters who you get it from

3217
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:01,079
you know so the Masonic cloner guy

3218
02:03:58,979 --> 02:04:04,198
pretty tapped into the old school scene

3219
02:04:01,079 --> 02:04:07,260
I'd imagine he'd have some type of

3220
02:04:04,198 --> 02:04:09,178
Romulan you know uh other dude got it

3221
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:13,340
from probably four other [ __ ] people

3222
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:16,319
that's you know quote unquote Romulan

3223
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:18,599
there you go and and overall are you are

3224
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:20,698
you a fan of it or you think it's a bit

3225
02:04:18,599 --> 02:04:22,860
of a yesteryear one but the Wilson cross

3226
02:04:20,698 --> 02:04:25,379
adds a new flavor to it

3227
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:28,979
I have no [ __ ] idea I grew it in my

3228
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:30,840
Greenhouse amongst [ __ ] uh a thousand

3229
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:34,019
other strains hit it to Wilson probably

3230
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:36,300
looked at it twice and uh I need to grow

3231
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:38,219
it out and to his full potential to be

3232
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:40,679
like that's Gucci and that's what I'm

3233
02:04:38,219 --> 02:04:42,960
doing right now I got Romulan Wilson uh

3234
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:44,639
I got six of them growing right now so I

3235
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:47,579
can grow a nice big one to be able to

3236
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:49,380
tell you like that's John Blaze or not

3237
02:04:47,579 --> 02:04:51,779
nice well there you go we'll have to

3238
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:54,539
wait and see I noticed on your Instagram

3239
02:04:51,779 --> 02:04:57,238
recently that you had mentioned you were

3240
02:04:54,539 --> 02:04:59,099

3241
02:04:57,238 --> 02:05:01,198

3242
02:04:59,099 --> 02:05:04,500

3245
02:05:07,319 --> 02:05:11,759
pimp Don Magic Wand

3246
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:13,738
so what what do you think's gonna what

3247
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:16,440
can people expect from that one in terms

3248
02:05:13,738 --> 02:05:17,519
of flavor profiles and whatnot and I

3249
02:05:16,439 --> 02:05:18,719
mean it's got a cool name how did you

3250
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,980

3251
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:24,599

3257
02:05:31,738 --> 02:05:35,519

3258
02:05:33,719 --> 02:05:37,920

3280
02:06:23,399 --> 02:06:27,658

3289
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:50,279

3290
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:51,840
gonna be a flavor town right

3291
02:06:50,279 --> 02:06:53,579
yeah [ __ ] yeah

3292
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:55,039
so I forgot to ask you a little bit

3293
02:06:53,579 --> 02:06:57,300
earlier when we were talking about

3294
02:06:55,039 --> 02:07:00,060
concentrates what's your thoughts on

3295
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:01,739
Vape carts they themselves are quite

3296
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:03,780
polarizing and I think the most

3297
02:07:01,738 --> 02:07:05,459
interesting thing to think about in

3298
02:07:03,779 --> 02:07:07,139
regards to all the Vape carts is like

3299
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:09,899
obviously there they flood the market

3300
02:07:07,139 --> 02:07:12,300
they're very prevalent but someone made

3301
02:07:09,899 --> 02:07:15,779
this comment where it was like you don't

3302
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:19,139
really see posts about buds with PM

3303
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:22,019
anymore you just see lots of cards

3304
02:07:19,139 --> 02:07:24,800
oh yeah man nobody gets PM anymore I

3305
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:28,380
thought you knew that

3306
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:30,900
well yeah nobody gets PM anymore and

3307
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:33,480
carts are mostly Miss for the most part

3308
02:07:30,899 --> 02:07:35,339
I actually have a good cart right here

3309
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:37,919
because I have buddies that make them

3310
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:41,340
and I get them you know from one hand

3311
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:45,118
only you know instead of you know a farm

3312
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:47,039
to here to hair to there but uh they're

3313
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:48,960
mostly Miss and and it's not my

3314
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:51,719
preferred way of consuming because it's

3315
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:53,880
just not it just doesn't feel right I

3316
02:07:51,719 --> 02:07:56,819
rather drive around town with the joint

3317
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:58,679
in my mouth than a vape cart and uh

3318
02:07:56,819 --> 02:08:00,118
[ __ ] cross my fingers I don't get

3319
02:07:58,679 --> 02:08:03,179
busted

3320
02:08:00,118 --> 02:08:05,519
a good good call good philosophy as well

3321
02:08:03,179 --> 02:08:08,039
so a lot of The Vape carts we see

3322
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:10,199
entering the market are often as you

3323
02:08:08,039 --> 02:08:12,420
alluded from new producers that there's

3324
02:08:10,198 --> 02:08:13,919
a whole supply chain behind things and

3325
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:14,940
and usually it's not high quality

3326
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,440
because it's going through all these

3327
02:08:14,939 --> 02:08:18,539
different hands

3328
02:08:16,439 --> 02:08:20,759
what's your thoughts overall on someone

3329
02:08:18,539 --> 02:08:23,698
coming into the market wanting to do a

3330
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:25,320
vape company or wanting to just start a

3331
02:08:23,698 --> 02:08:27,299
new sort of company because I think that

3332
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:29,219
there's often a lot of distrust and a

3333
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:30,840
lot of dislike from people who are just

3334
02:08:29,219 --> 02:08:33,359
entering the scene now because it's

3335
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:35,099
often kind of painted as though like

3336
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:37,198
they're just trying to do a cash grab

3337
02:08:35,099 --> 02:08:38,340
sort of thing what are your thoughts on

3338
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:40,019
that do you think it's possible for

3339
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:41,039
someone to come in and to want to do

3340
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:43,020
something like that and to do it

3341
02:08:41,039 --> 02:08:45,658
properly or it's inherently like a bit

3342
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:49,260
of a sketchy situation

3343
02:08:45,658 --> 02:08:51,658
uh there's always a harder worker so

3344
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:53,880
like there's always room for that you

3345
02:08:51,658 --> 02:08:55,859
know don't don't be discouraged like oh

3346
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:57,719
man the Cannabis scene is saturated

3347
02:08:55,859 --> 02:08:59,880
they're not going to want to [ __ ] with

3348
02:08:57,719 --> 02:09:01,739
me there's a thousand shovels to this

3349
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:03,900
cannabis industry you just gotta find

3350
02:09:01,738 --> 02:09:06,598
you know where you belong you know like

3351
02:09:03,899 --> 02:09:09,299
look at look at sticker farmer he he he

3352
02:09:06,599 --> 02:09:10,739
doesn't sell weed but he's a big part of

3353
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:13,380
it you know what I mean as far as

3354
02:09:10,738 --> 02:09:15,839
Instagram is concerned uh things like

3355
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:18,000
that so as far as you know a vape cart

3356
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:20,099
like you would have to do a lot of

3357
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,599
homework to to get into a vape card

3358
02:09:20,099 --> 02:09:23,340
scene because [ __ ] it's not just

3359
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:25,079
something you do because it's to this

3360
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:27,300
day it's I still think there's a lot of

3361
02:09:25,079 --> 02:09:29,158
work to do on those because everyone has

3362
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:30,599
a [ __ ] different one and you don't

3363
02:09:29,158 --> 02:09:31,679
know which one's the good one and I

3364
02:09:30,599 --> 02:09:33,539
don't want to find out either because

3365
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,940
[ __ ] most of the time they're bad so

3366
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:37,800
it's like [ __ ] you already know

3367
02:09:35,939 --> 02:09:40,559
you're stepping into a trap so it's it's

3368
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:44,279
hard to r d on those as far as you know

3369
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:46,800
mass-produced ones are concerned uh

3370
02:09:44,279 --> 02:09:49,198
stepping into the Cannabis game if it's

3371
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:51,539
a cash crab and that's what you're going

3372
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:53,279
in for [ __ ] good luck I'll power to

3373
02:09:51,539 --> 02:09:55,260
you and if you [ __ ] figure it out

3374
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:56,698
it's because you're a harder worker and

3375
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:58,260
you fit and somebody was on their ass

3376
02:09:56,698 --> 02:10:00,678
and you caught them slipping

3377
02:09:58,260 --> 02:10:03,119
uh if you're in it with good intentions

3378
02:10:00,679 --> 02:10:04,739
well remember there's the guy with the

3379
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:07,139
cash grab [ __ ] attitude out there

3380
02:10:04,738 --> 02:10:09,118
that's trying to work [ __ ]

3381
02:10:07,139 --> 02:10:11,219
you know trying to Outsource work do

3382
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:13,319
whatever the case and wait till the

3383
02:10:11,219 --> 02:10:14,460
institutions come in and you think these

3384
02:10:13,319 --> 02:10:16,380
little guys are trying to figure out

3385
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:17,819
these institutions are gonna [ __ ]

3386
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:19,079
everybody up now I sound like a crazy

3387
02:10:17,819 --> 02:10:21,179
person like what's he talking about

3388
02:10:19,079 --> 02:10:22,920
these institutions like yeah man there's

3389
02:10:21,179 --> 02:10:25,500
people with a lot of money that can just

3390
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,420
buy everything and [ __ ] hire

3391
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:29,698
lobbyists to prevent other people from

3392
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:33,060
setting up shop so but we're not in that

3393
02:10:29,698 --> 02:10:35,399
in that stage yet but eventually you

3394
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:37,320
know we will be and [ __ ] it's going

3395
02:10:35,399 --> 02:10:40,339
to be even harder for people to

3396
02:10:37,319 --> 02:10:42,779
setup shop via marijuana

3397
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:44,460
yeah I mean a brilliant point you

3398
02:10:42,779 --> 02:10:46,380
mentioned there and a discussion which

3399
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:50,399
we've had with a few previous guests is

3400
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:52,560
like what is the sort of incoming big AG

3401
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,839
movement gonna do in regards to shaping

3402
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:57,480
the Cannabis scene and one of the ideas

3403
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:59,400
we've heard expressed is that there'll

3404
02:10:57,479 --> 02:11:02,519
be like a distinction between like The

3405
02:10:59,399 --> 02:11:04,859
Connoisseur or like the Craft Market and

3406
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:06,840
then just like the mass produced sort of

3407
02:11:04,859 --> 02:11:08,339
thing what's your thoughts on the big

3408
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:09,840
AGS involvement and do you think it'll

3409
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:12,060
pan out as though like there'll always

3410
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:14,219
be this connoisseur Craft Market that we

3411
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:16,080
kind of currently exist in and then the

3412
02:11:14,219 --> 02:11:18,599
big AG will just be booth for the masses

3413
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:21,000
or how do you predict it plays out

3414
02:11:18,599 --> 02:11:23,219
yeah man there'll be Bud Light weed for

3415
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,139
everybody there'll be some dudes that

3416
02:11:23,219 --> 02:11:27,599
end up with a sculpin company they get

3417
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:29,699
bought out by Bud Light and then they'll

3418
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:31,560
be the heady beers that get bought out

3419
02:11:29,698 --> 02:11:34,439
by all the heady boys all the time same

3420
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:36,780
thing with weed you know [ __ ] there's

3421
02:11:34,439 --> 02:11:39,299
gonna be a lot of boof and hopefully

3422
02:11:36,779 --> 02:11:41,399
like like if you love weed you're gonna

3423
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:45,779
learn about it and you're gonna go look

3424
02:11:41,399 --> 02:11:48,960
for you know the small batch great [ __ ]

3425
02:11:45,779 --> 02:11:52,738
yeah good sentiment a good sentiment

3426
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:56,279
so the question that we've received the

3427
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:58,799

3428

02:14:02,819 --> 02:14:09,359
Matt Riot so I'm Matt right now

3484
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:11,400
wow what a what a ton of events there so

3485
02:14:09,359 --> 02:14:13,979
I guess the the follow-up question to

3486
02:14:11,399 --> 02:14:15,960
that is do you plan to release strains

3487
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:18,059
that are using the names of strains he's

3488
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,219
done or do you plan to make crosses with

3489
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:22,199
them what's the situation now we're

3490
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:24,658
doing it quick we're doing it quick so I

3491
02:14:22,198 --> 02:14:27,238
none of my strains have names on them

3492
02:14:24,658 --> 02:14:29,219
so blueberries cement shoes Times Wilson

3493
02:14:27,238 --> 02:14:30,299
cross back to Wilson is now a blue

3494
02:14:29,219 --> 02:14:34,078
bonnet

3495
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:36,659
uh orange Skittles uh times banana punch

3496
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:39,059
Times Wilson is now Clockwork Orange

3497
02:14:36,658 --> 02:14:42,479
Girl Scout cookie Polynesian thin mint

3498
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:44,340
Wilson is now 26 cookies

3499
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:45,839
and I'm gonna have to figure out what

3500
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:47,940
other uh strains are going to take what

3501
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,560
names for uh and we're going to sell way

3502
02:14:47,939 --> 02:14:51,598
more seeds than he has and people are

3503
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:53,760
gonna be like I'm growing Blue Bonnet

3504
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:56,460
and and [ __ ] they're gonna tag Blue

3505
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:58,920
Bonnet and we're gonna have a thousand

3506
02:14:56,460 --> 02:15:01,139
Wilson hybrids as Bluebonnet and [ __ ]

3507
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,420
everybody's Gonna Know Blue Bonnet

3508
02:15:01,139 --> 02:15:06,659
belongs to the real riot Seed Company

3509
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:09,840
so and and do you think that people

3510
02:15:06,658 --> 02:15:13,138
would rightly or incorrectly get upset

3511
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:15,360
with how like lineages are like kind of

3512
02:15:13,139 --> 02:15:17,279
a bit muddied when you do that not with

3513
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:19,559
me Sonic they know what's happening they

3514
02:15:17,279 --> 02:15:22,139
know what time it is there you go okay

3515
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:24,960
kind of a more meta idea to what we've

3516
02:15:22,139 --> 02:15:26,460
been discussing is that I'm I'm a part

3517
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,500
of obviously the Cannabis scene along

3518
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,000
with yourself but I'm also a part of a

3519
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:31,738
few other different online communities

3520
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,439
and something that I've noticed over the

3521
02:15:31,738 --> 02:15:36,118
past year or so is that the Cannabis

3522
02:15:34,439 --> 02:15:38,759
Community seems to have a bit of a

3523
02:15:36,118 --> 02:15:41,039
disproportionate amount of drama in it

3524
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:43,020
considering it's like a bit of an

3525
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:45,179
oxymoron like we all smoke weed we're

3526
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:46,860
meant to be chill and calm and yet

3527
02:15:45,179 --> 02:15:48,779
there's almost more drama than other

3528
02:15:46,859 --> 02:15:50,939
communities where there isn't this sort

3529
02:15:48,779 --> 02:15:53,939
of this psychoactive chemical that helps

3530
02:15:50,939 --> 02:15:56,339
calm you out what's your take on that

3531
02:15:53,939 --> 02:15:58,259
so you know it used to be you smoke weed

3532
02:15:56,340 --> 02:16:00,179
you're cool you know what I mean now

3533
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:01,679
it's all like I smoke weed cooler than

3534
02:16:00,179 --> 02:16:04,139
you or something like that I don't know

3535
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:06,420
what it is uh I like to think my

3536
02:16:04,139 --> 02:16:08,400
demographic I'm kind of Open Arms you

3537
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:10,560
know as opposed to you know you got to

3538
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:12,479
know this much before you enter here I

3539
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:14,880
like to think you know I cover every

3540
02:16:12,479 --> 02:16:17,879
every demographic you know [ __ ] I

3541
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:19,920
don't care what you know like I'm I

3542
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:22,199
never answer questions seriously on my

3543
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:24,899
life so like you're never gonna and if I

3544
02:16:22,198 --> 02:16:26,460
do it's like it's like feeding a dog uh

3545
02:16:24,899 --> 02:16:28,500
medicine you know like I'm being funny

3546
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:31,139
and every now and then I'll put some

3547
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:32,760
medicine in the dog food so you know it

3548
02:16:31,139 --> 02:16:34,439
goes to people every now and then next

3549
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:36,599
you know you got people interested in

3550
02:16:34,439 --> 02:16:39,840
actually wanting to know about breeders

3551
02:16:36,599 --> 02:16:42,599
you know so and [ __ ] like that but uh

3552
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:44,579
yeah [ __ ]

3553
02:16:42,599 --> 02:16:46,920
I got off I got off topic on the

3554
02:16:44,579 --> 02:16:49,799
question but [ __ ]

3555
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:51,359
yeah that's all good that's so good I

3556
02:16:49,799 --> 02:16:53,579
guess my question like the follow-up

3557
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:56,519
would be is do you think that the sort

3558
02:16:53,579 --> 02:16:58,799
of you know dramas we see play out will

3559
02:16:56,519 --> 02:17:01,260
continue or eventually people will maybe

3560
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:03,539
chill out a bit and um kind of be a bit

3561
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:05,939
more like the The Stereotype and just

3562
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:09,120
become a bit of a chill stoner

3563
02:17:05,939 --> 02:17:11,579
you know what dude I was chill bro the

3564
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,800
the problem was I was chill till till

3565
02:17:11,579 --> 02:17:16,200

I'm cool dude I'm I'm like the guy that

3567
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:20,579
would throw rocks at everybody but but

3568
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,978
not because I was being malicious but

3569
02:17:20,579 --> 02:17:25,319
maybe a little bit but like it was

3570
02:17:22,978 --> 02:17:27,358
mostly to poke fun and to laugh at

3571
02:17:25,319 --> 02:17:29,519
because like if they said something that

3572
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:31,319
I didn't agree with I would like poke

3573
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:33,420
fun at them and it's the internet and

3574
02:17:31,319 --> 02:17:34,978
that's what you can do on internet so I

3575
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:37,138

3634
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:47,219
back to something you referenced a

3635
02:19:44,519 --> 02:19:48,840
little earlier at the start of uh this

3636
02:19:47,218 --> 02:19:51,659
sort of little answer to this section

3637
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:53,520
here is that I noticed you have been

3638
02:19:51,659 --> 02:19:56,520
posting recently about Pokemon and

3639
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:58,200
Yu-Gi-Oh cards and uh it all makes sense

3640
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:59,280
now because we're about the same age and

3641
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,840
so I realized you would have been

3642
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,260
growing up with it about the same time

3643
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:05,760
as me and I I likewise very into Pokemon

3644
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:08,520
and you go I thought it was a bee's

3645
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:09,780
knees have you ever played the games or

3646
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:11,220
were you more of like like did you

3647
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:12,600
actually play the game the card game

3648
02:20:11,219 --> 02:20:14,398
were you just more of like a collector

3649
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:15,659
and do you collect any other sort of

3650
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:18,840
stuff like that

3651
02:20:15,659 --> 02:20:21,659
uh I played the game as a kid I wasn't a

3652
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:23,700
collector so I played and uh whatever

3653
02:20:21,659 --> 02:20:27,898
was meta at the time that's what I was

3654
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:29,880
playing so like a Pokemon we played as

3655
02:20:27,898 --> 02:20:32,699
kids not serious but we got him to

3656
02:20:29,879 --> 02:20:34,739
Yu-Gi-Oh and you know we got Yu-Gi-Oh

3657
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:36,420
serious business like we go to the

3658
02:20:34,739 --> 02:20:39,299
trading card store every weekend mom

3659
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:41,219
would give us both 20 to 40 dollars and

3660
02:20:39,299 --> 02:20:43,019
we'd make it work and we'd have to

3661
02:20:41,219 --> 02:20:45,779
really learn and my I have an older

3662
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:47,939
brother so I always had a mentor and uh

3663
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:49,800
he would always get first place and I

3664
02:20:47,939 --> 02:20:53,280
would always you know get fifth or

3665
02:20:49,799 --> 02:20:55,500
something but uh I got better and

3666
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:57,180
and uh I don't know how to play the TCG

3667
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:58,500
anymore I just played my son that

3668
02:20:57,180 --> 02:21:00,840
Pokemon right now I just opened two

3669
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:03,000
starter decks and uh the Charizard theme

3670
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:05,159
Decks that came out and we played so I

3671
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,799
still know how to play but Yu-Gi-Oh I

3672
02:21:05,159 --> 02:21:09,420
bought a deck box a blister box the

3673
02:21:07,799 --> 02:21:11,159
other day and I'm like looking through

3674
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:13,559
the cards and I'm like [ __ ] no I can't

3675
02:21:11,159 --> 02:21:15,898
do this no more but I did recently stop

3676
02:21:13,559 --> 02:21:18,359
playing when uh whenever dark Strike

3677
02:21:15,898 --> 02:21:21,199
Fighter was banned on Yu-Gi-Oh so yeah

3678
02:21:18,359 --> 02:21:25,079
I'm I did play a little bit

3679
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:26,700
oh man I love it I I remember spending a

3680
02:21:25,079 --> 02:21:28,920
good chunk on my youth playing that one

3681
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:31,260
it was it was good for the meta

3682
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:34,200
yeah man it's it's a

3683
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:37,380
I still I still I'm into it and uh I

3684
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:39,600
noticed a lot of people like uh logic

3685
02:21:37,379 --> 02:21:41,459
and I think it's Jake Paul is that

3686
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,079
YouTube sensation's name I guess they

3687
02:21:41,459 --> 02:21:45,898
started collecting them amongst

3688
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:47,700
themselves again and right before that I

3689
02:21:45,898 --> 02:21:49,619
had put out a big calling on my

3690
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:52,680
Instagram I'm like dude anybody have

3691
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:55,500
Pokemon cards trade them to me and I did

3692
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:57,659
it right before like boof [ __ ] prices

3693
02:21:55,500 --> 02:22:00,059
went up now people don't even they think

3694
02:21:57,659 --> 02:22:01,799
they're in [ __ ] and and rolling in

3695
02:22:00,059 --> 02:22:03,779
Gold they're just like oh this is a

3696
02:22:01,799 --> 02:22:06,000
million dollars and I'm like dude relax

3697
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:07,140
that's like a couple dollars they're not

3698
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,898
even graded they're probably not even

3699
02:22:07,139 --> 02:22:12,358
mint condition and but uh everybody has

3700
02:22:09,898 --> 02:22:14,279
their Pokemon cards and and you know

3701
02:22:12,359 --> 02:22:17,520
everybody's looking for them because of

3702
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:18,659
the you know prices are skyrocketing

3703
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:20,100
right now

3704
02:22:18,659 --> 02:22:22,439
show

3705
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:24,840
so the next thing I happen to notice

3706
02:22:22,439 --> 02:22:27,120
which was like a bit of a rare Niche

3707
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:28,978
sort of thing is that unlike a lot of

3708
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:31,319
people in the Cannabis Community who are

3709
02:22:28,978 --> 02:22:33,000
really into dogs it appears as though

3710
02:22:31,318 --> 02:22:34,978
you're more of a cat person and you even

3711
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:37,020
wrap the chicken a little bit which I

3712
02:22:34,978 --> 02:22:38,760
think was kind of cool what's the

3713
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:41,579
backstory behind that with the chicken

3714
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:43,859
and with the cats and is that where your

3715
02:22:41,579 --> 02:22:46,260
animal passion sort of Lies

3716
02:22:43,859 --> 02:22:47,760
oh man I got dogs too I just don't rep

3717
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:49,620
them they just don't sleep in the house

3718
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:51,540
man so you know you don't get to see

3719
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:54,240
them as much and it just so happens

3720
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:56,640
you're comfortable in on the phone the

3721
02:22:54,239 --> 02:22:58,500
dogs uh Dusty sleeps in the house but

3722
02:22:56,639 --> 02:23:01,079
you know he's not as photogenic as the

3723
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:03,359
cats but I love dogs just as much so

3724
02:23:01,079 --> 02:23:06,120
let's not let's not confuse that I love

3725
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:07,800
all my animals the chickens actually

3726
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:09,780
before this interview I have to put my

3727
02:23:07,799 --> 02:23:11,938
chickens away so I have to put them all

3728
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:14,640
in their Coop I got a lot of chickens

3729
02:23:11,939 --> 02:23:17,639
and the cats I've always loved cats

3730
02:23:14,639 --> 02:23:19,439
chickens I uh would go to my grandma's

3731
02:23:17,639 --> 02:23:21,779
Farm in Mexico every summer and winter

3732
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:23,220
and they had chickens so I grew up

3733
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:26,579
around chickens in my whole childhood

3734
02:23:23,219 --> 02:23:28,978
and I even had Ducks when I was a kid so

3735
02:23:26,579 --> 02:23:31,020
I've always been a fan of chickens and

3736
02:23:28,978 --> 02:23:32,099
now they give me eggs and [ __ ] so that's

3737
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:34,439
cool too

3738
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:36,720
then the pandemic I already had my

3739
02:23:34,439 --> 02:23:37,559
chickens and nobody had eggs but I had

3740
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:39,239
eggs

3741
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:40,739
and all my friends wanted chickens

3742
02:23:39,239 --> 02:23:41,879
everybody was asking me about chickens

3743
02:23:40,739 --> 02:23:44,159
like I was the [ __ ] chicken

3744
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:46,438
Ambassador I'm like [ __ ] go read

3745
02:23:44,159 --> 02:23:47,879
a book next you know they're [ __ ] way

3746
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:49,520
more adverse than me and I'm like good

3747
02:23:47,879 --> 02:23:52,079
you know

3748
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:55,620
love it I love it

3749
02:23:52,079 --> 02:23:56,818
so I forgot to ask you earlier you

3750
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:59,040
mentioned you do obviously a lot of

3751
02:23:56,818 --> 02:24:00,898
growing Outdoors but we didn't and you

3752
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:03,660
and you mentioned that you use salts for

3753
02:24:00,898 --> 02:24:05,939
the seed production but what sort of

3754
02:24:03,659 --> 02:24:07,619
medium do you like to use Outdoors it

3755
02:24:05,939 --> 02:24:09,239
just just soil from the ground or you

3756
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:10,859
bring in a medium and do you have a

3757
02:24:09,239 --> 02:24:12,478
preferred brand of nutrients you want to

3758
02:24:10,859 --> 02:24:13,859
mention or you prefer just to leave it

3759
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:15,659
unsaid

3760
02:24:13,859 --> 02:24:19,200
oh man

3761
02:24:15,659 --> 02:24:21,959
I'll go grab a bag of roots Organics uh

3762
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:24,359
and [ __ ] run Mills you know I get

3763
02:24:21,959 --> 02:24:26,639
Mills for free so I run it easy does it

3764
02:24:24,359 --> 02:24:28,859
if if I didn't have that I'd probably go

3765
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:30,959
grab veg bloom or something or you can

3766
02:24:28,859 --> 02:24:32,399
always make a super soil and just

3767
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:34,500
[ __ ] Plug and Play let that Super

3768
02:24:32,398 --> 02:24:36,119
Soul feed the whole time uh I had a

3769
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:38,100
bunch of bags of living soil from Red

3770
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:40,740
Bud soil that I ran but I'm not over

3771
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:42,899
here like dechlorinating anything I'm

3772
02:24:40,739 --> 02:24:45,079
just running straight from the hose so

3773
02:24:42,898 --> 02:24:47,939
it's like it's kind of you know

3774
02:24:45,079 --> 02:24:51,120
oxymoronic to be growing like that but

3775
02:24:47,939 --> 02:24:52,800
uh yeah it's uh easy does it for me like

3776
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:56,399
uh seed production you don't need to do

3777
02:24:52,799 --> 02:25:00,119
much uh besides make sure the plants are

3778
02:24:56,398 --> 02:25:02,099
healthy and and [ __ ] you're not over

3779
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:04,620
there

3780
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:06,239
pruning and picking making sure [ __ ]

3781
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:10,140
looks sexy

3782
02:25:06,239 --> 02:25:13,559
sure sure sorry I wanted to ask you

3783
02:25:10,139 --> 02:25:15,840
about your thoughts on some of the

3784
02:25:13,559 --> 02:25:17,579
festivals like the weed festivals and

3785
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:19,380
just selling seeds at them in general

3786
02:25:17,579 --> 02:25:21,478
because over the past few years we've

3787
02:25:19,379 --> 02:25:23,459
seen a decline of the emerald Cup in

3788
02:25:21,478 --> 02:25:25,799
terms of people being able to sell their

3789
02:25:23,459 --> 02:25:27,599
seeds legally and more recently people

3790
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:30,358
are kind of like Oh The Vibes not really

3791
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:32,700
where it used to be and then lo and

3792
02:25:30,359 --> 02:25:35,460
behold I managed to catch up with you in

3793
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:37,319
person at the ego Clash last year and

3794
02:25:35,459 --> 02:25:39,779
that was a cool event and so I guess my

3795
02:25:37,318 --> 02:25:41,818
thoughts is sorry my question is what's

3796
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:43,200
your thought on the emerald cup and it's

3797
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:45,478
sort of trajectory and do you think

3798
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:46,979
there's smaller Boutique events like the

3799
02:25:45,478 --> 02:25:48,260
ego Clash are going to become more

3800
02:25:46,978 --> 02:25:53,039
popular

3801
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:57,600

around Emerald cup

3807
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:10,319
supposedly my buddy had a spot I could

3808
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:12,540

3810
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:17,460

Emerald cup you know and and it's like

3816
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:32,818

3817
02:26:30,659 --> 02:26:35,039
Masonic people are here to visit me you

3818
02:26:32,818 --> 02:26:37,079

3819
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:39,060
over here like lugging a box around

3820
02:26:37,079 --> 02:26:41,639
looking like a [ __ ] chump you know

3821
02:26:39,059 --> 02:26:43,439
like embarrassed almost like I don't got

3822
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:45,959
Booth space you know it's like it's

3823
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:47,639
almost impossible only cap and exotic

3824
02:26:45,959 --> 02:26:49,799
can apparently get Booth space here and

3825
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:52,019
whoever else you know but uh whatever

3826
02:26:49,799 --> 02:26:54,719
you grow and you make more money and now

3827
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:56,700
you in a position to maybe now I can you

3828
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:59,719
know what I mean get Booth space if if

3829
02:26:56,700 --> 02:27:03,120
Money Talks you know but then I wasn't

3830
02:26:59,719 --> 02:27:06,179
and and and and and [ __ ] supposedly I

3831
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:07,680
had a a buddy that had a booth and he's

3832
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:09,359
like hey man set up right here that's

3833
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:11,520
cool and I set up

3834
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:13,318
and apparently they were doing something

3835
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:15,720
they weren't supposed to be doing and

3836
02:27:13,318 --> 02:27:16,920
like the emerald cup [ __ ] the

3837
02:27:15,719 --> 02:27:18,539
daughter that was running the whole

3838
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:21,960
thing is like you guys got to get out of

3839
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:24,000
here and like I I like uh dbg was there

3840
02:27:21,959 --> 02:27:26,219
or yeah yeah and and like they had all

3841
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,540
their stuff on the table and and I think

3842
02:27:26,219 --> 02:27:29,938
they were like trying to like kick them

3843
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:32,340
out of the whole festival entirely and I

3844
02:27:29,939 --> 02:27:33,600
was there but I had all my [ __ ] tucked

3845
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:36,239
under the table a little bit more

3846
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:37,680
low-key and like they kind of overlooked

3847
02:27:36,239 --> 02:27:40,439
me and I just kind of grabbed my stuff

3848
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:43,318
and like went to the side and dude like

3849
02:27:40,439 --> 02:27:45,780
[ __ ] embarrassing and and yeah that

3850
02:27:43,318 --> 02:27:47,939
is The Vibes I got I Emerald cup but uh

3851
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:50,280
somehow some way I managed to like on

3852
02:27:47,939 --> 02:27:52,079
the outskirts of you know people that

3853
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:54,840
weren't peeping too hard I managed to

3854
02:27:52,079 --> 02:27:56,579
backpack backpack a little bit of seeds

3855
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:58,920
and not have my whole catalog with me

3856
02:27:56,579 --> 02:28:00,840
and managed to you know push some seeds

3857
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:03,120
pedaling them on my feet around Emerald

3858
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:05,939
cup which is something I didn't really

3859
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,859
want to do like [ __ ] I should be able

3860
02:28:05,939 --> 02:28:11,100
to have a booth you know [ __ ] this is

3861
02:28:07,859 --> 02:28:12,960
this is dumb you know

3862
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:14,939
yeah definitely I think that's a

3863
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:17,579
sentiment that many of the former

3864
02:28:14,939 --> 02:28:19,620
breeders have expressed do you think

3865
02:28:17,579 --> 02:28:21,600
that things like the ego clash and

3866
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:24,359
smaller events that maybe invite only

3867
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:25,800
sort of situation will become the more

3868
02:28:24,359 --> 02:28:27,659
popular and predominant sort of thing

3869
02:28:25,799 --> 02:28:29,099
that the real heads are going to or do

3870
02:28:27,659 --> 02:28:30,478
you think it's like the emerald cup's

3871
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:32,460
still so big it's going to draw the

3872
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:35,039
crowds

3873
02:28:32,459 --> 02:28:37,438
uh I think I think we got to do some

3874
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:39,180
some more of that ego class [ __ ] but not

3875
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:41,460
to the point where it's you know where

3876
02:28:39,180 --> 02:28:43,139
we ring it too much because if you do

3877
02:28:41,459 --> 02:28:46,978
something too much people get fed up

3878
02:28:43,139 --> 02:28:50,398
with it too so recently I I did a a

3879
02:28:46,978 --> 02:28:53,639
pop-up at a hydroponics store

3880
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:56,818
and uh you know it was kind of it wasn't

3881
02:28:53,639 --> 02:28:59,519
no Eagle Clash but you know you didn't

3882
02:28:56,818 --> 02:29:02,159
have to go to a [ __ ] Festival to go

3883
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:04,920
pick up seeds you know so we can do a

3884
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:07,260
derivative of that in whatever

3885
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:09,600
you know like an eagle Clash you could

3886
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:10,739
have an ego clash in your city it

3887
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:13,140
doesn't have to be ego class you could

3888
02:29:10,739 --> 02:29:15,379
just be a sesh and grab some like-minded

3889
02:29:13,139 --> 02:29:18,358
guys and maybe bring a star or something

3890
02:29:15,379 --> 02:29:20,879
because uh little by little

3891
02:29:18,359 --> 02:29:24,059
foods are coming out the woodworking

3892
02:29:20,879 --> 02:29:25,559
you know people want to associate with

3893
02:29:24,059 --> 02:29:27,478
others amongst themselves that smoke

3894
02:29:25,559 --> 02:29:28,739
weed too so you got to give them that

3895
02:29:27,478 --> 02:29:30,299
power you can't be like oh you guys

3896
02:29:28,739 --> 02:29:32,159
aren't good enough to talk about

3897
02:29:30,299 --> 02:29:35,099
breeding because nobody breeds in Ohio

3898
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:36,780
but you know that's that's not fair they

3899
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:39,180
can all gather and

3900
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:42,000
have seeds too and make a cool Cedar in

3901
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:44,639
their state you know so whatever the

3902
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,139
case be it's it's early shit's growing

3903
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:49,559
people are getting bigger there'll be

3904
02:29:46,139 --> 02:29:51,959
more breeders from more places and

3905
02:29:49,559 --> 02:29:55,439
there will be more like Eagle Clash

3906
02:29:51,959 --> 02:29:58,139
things I'd imagine yeah sure and I guess

3907
02:29:55,439 --> 02:30:00,120
final question before we get into some

3908
02:29:58,139 --> 02:30:02,699
of the fan submitted ones on the tail

3909
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:04,920
end of things I remembered thinking that

3910
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:07,439
it was very just you know weird

3911
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:09,719
situation to be in that cave at the um

3912
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:11,700
at the ego clash and like people had the

3913
02:30:09,719 --> 02:30:13,079
booths and you had your table set up and

3914
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:14,280
you're selling seeds and stuff and I

3915
02:30:13,079 --> 02:30:17,520
thought this is like a really like

3916
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:19,319
unpredicted sort of experience what are

3917
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:21,479
some of the most weird or standout

3918
02:30:19,318 --> 02:30:23,639
experiences you've had while being in

3919
02:30:21,478 --> 02:30:25,920
the industry or selling seeds

3920
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:28,318
well that one is one of them sure enough

3921
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:31,379
being in a [ __ ] cave selling seeds

3922
02:30:28,318 --> 02:30:34,619
you know that was one of them uh

3923
02:30:31,379 --> 02:30:37,199
I was in Adelanto one time [ __ ]

3924
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:38,640
selling seeds you know on the outskirts

3925
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:40,800
of this huge

3926
02:30:38,639 --> 02:30:43,978
free dab Festival that was a pretty

3927
02:30:40,799 --> 02:30:47,159
nasty one I uh one time I set up shop

3928
02:30:43,978 --> 02:30:49,019
outside of a Target in Compton in the

3929
02:30:47,159 --> 02:30:51,420
parking lot and I just had people come

3930
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:54,420
to me like if I was selling mixtapes out

3931
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:57,000
my trunk and I like nitpickingly invited

3932
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:59,879
people like like uh you you look okay

3933
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:02,459
boom you know so I took that and just

3934
02:30:59,879 --> 02:31:04,019
expanded that into my pop-up so I just

3935
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:06,539
screened more people via Instagram

3936
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:09,000
because you can tell a lot through

3937
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:10,979
somebody's Instagram like come on like

3938
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,959
if you see some dude called Robin

3939
02:31:10,978 --> 02:31:16,379
[ __ ] like you're not gonna let

3940
02:31:12,959 --> 02:31:18,000
him go to your to your pop-up you know

3941
02:31:16,379 --> 02:31:20,039
like dude your name is Robin

3942
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:24,600
[ __ ] like why would I let you

3943
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:26,640
come with me you know so you know no no

3944
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:28,739
no discrimination but if you look like

3945
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:31,199
you about to Jack somebody and you have

3946
02:31:28,739 --> 02:31:33,119
no pictures of your grow on your your

3947
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:37,260
weed you probably will never get invited

3948
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:40,439
to any local Masonic Shin digs

3949
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:43,380
there you go guys words so on the tail

3950
02:31:40,439 --> 02:31:45,180
end of things we've just got a few uh

3951
02:31:43,379 --> 02:31:47,699
fans submitted questions before we get

3952
02:31:45,180 --> 02:31:50,460
to the final five or six uh quick fire

3953
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:54,540

02:31:58,318 --> 02:32:03,000
they'll put you in your place you know

3957
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:04,799
uh I I even micro dosing man they'll

3958
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,719
make me Shut the [ __ ] up and just go to

3959
02:32:04,799 --> 02:32:09,059
my room and lock myself up for a bit and

3960
02:32:06,719 --> 02:32:11,219
just put my phone down for a second I

3961
02:32:09,059 --> 02:32:14,398
think they're a good reset

3962
02:32:11,219 --> 02:32:17,699
uh I wouldn't tell you to go to a heroic

3963
02:32:14,398 --> 02:32:19,619
dose like like that but uh

3964
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:22,740
nibble at it see how you like it some

3965
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:23,899
people like him better than others I'm I

3966
02:32:22,739 --> 02:32:27,059
get

3967
02:32:23,898 --> 02:32:29,159
uneasy with them so I do them

3968
02:32:27,059 --> 02:32:30,719
spontaneously I'll nibble at them never

3969
02:32:29,159 --> 02:32:33,659
more than

3970
02:32:30,719 --> 02:32:35,579
more than a [ __ ] point one because if

3971
02:32:33,659 --> 02:32:38,760
I eat a 0.3 I'm like hugging the floor

3972
02:32:35,579 --> 02:32:41,639
like it's that bad for me there you go

3973
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:43,500
good answer so next one was do you

3974
02:32:41,639 --> 02:32:46,939
currently have any plans to work with

3975
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:46,939
any males besides Wilson

3976
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:56,818
maybe maybe in this new uh Fino hunt

3977
02:32:53,040 --> 02:33:00,180
that I'm doing I have a bunch of elite

3978
02:32:56,818 --> 02:33:02,459
crosses crossed into Wilson but it ended

3979
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:06,300
up being a Wilson hybrid so

3980
02:33:02,459 --> 02:33:07,919
maybe maybe maybe so the next one which

3981
02:33:06,299 --> 02:33:12,119
I thought was interesting is would you

3982
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:12,898
ever consider doing a Wilson F2 or F3 I

3983
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:15,240
don't know what it would be classified

3984
02:33:12,898 --> 02:33:17,779
as where it's like your will soon cross

3985
02:33:15,239 --> 02:33:21,119
to oni's Wilson zero

3986
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:23,159
uh that's a good idea

3987
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,740
maybe that we haven't even thought of

3988
02:33:23,159 --> 02:33:27,780
that that's crazy that's a good idea

3989
02:33:25,739 --> 02:33:30,799
yeah what we're for sure doing that

3990
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:30,800
tomorrow I'm gonna hit him up

3991
02:33:33,898 --> 02:33:38,099
so the next question we had submitted

3992
02:33:36,059 --> 02:33:39,659
was are you more of an intercour or a

3993
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:42,659
sativa fan

3994
02:33:39,659 --> 02:33:46,680
I'm more of an indigo person

3995
02:33:42,659 --> 02:33:48,739
yeah sure if you had to pick Hazel Kush

3996
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:52,439
I'll do it

3997
02:33:48,739 --> 02:33:55,260
so next one was out of all your strains

3998
02:33:52,439 --> 02:33:58,200
what's the most potent to you and what's

3999
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:59,760
the biggest Yoda

4000
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:01,800
well I've got uh

4001
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:04,020
out of the biggest Fino hunt out of

4002
02:34:01,799 --> 02:34:06,019
anybody that I've got I got the chem d95

4003
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:08,460
was probably one of the heaviest healers

4004
02:34:06,020 --> 02:34:12,359
md95 Wilson

4005
02:34:08,459 --> 02:34:15,059
and out of personally that I smoked I

4006
02:34:12,359 --> 02:34:17,340
hate to like be cliche or put cream on

4007
02:34:15,059 --> 02:34:19,318
my taco but I smoke some Wilson F2 that

4008
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:21,960
really blew my socks off

4009
02:34:19,318 --> 02:34:24,180
no good answer a bit of a more random

4010
02:34:21,959 --> 02:34:25,978
one to round out the fan submitted one

4011
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:27,239
what's your thoughts on the new Aesop

4012
02:34:25,978 --> 02:34:30,000
album

4013
02:34:27,239 --> 02:34:32,520
oh ASAP rock yep

4014
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,500
oh man I I have I bro I don't listen to

4015
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:36,300
ASAP rock like that that fool uses too

4016
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:39,359
many words for me Doug I need to go pull

4017
02:34:36,299 --> 02:34:41,818
up a dictionary there is no way in God

4018
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:43,979
anybody could recite a whole Aesop Rock

4019
02:34:41,818 --> 02:34:45,898
song and if they can Jesus Christ your

4020
02:34:43,978 --> 02:34:47,938
ass is really sitting there digesting

4021
02:34:45,898 --> 02:34:50,879
that [ __ ] you have to practice I'm gonna

4022
02:34:47,939 --> 02:34:53,040
[ __ ] a hundred times that guy's dope

4023
02:34:50,879 --> 02:34:54,299
though man Aesop Rock's cool I should

4024
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:56,580
probably check it out

4025
02:34:54,299 --> 02:34:58,340
no worries and the final fan submitted

4026
02:34:56,579 --> 02:35:01,500
question before we do the final five

4027
02:34:58,340 --> 02:35:03,000
what do you think are the genetics in

4028
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:06,719
cookies

4029
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:08,219
I have no idea it's a it's F1 dirt

4030
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:10,438
there you go I think that's what we'll

4031
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:13,139
always be told

4032
02:35:10,439 --> 02:35:16,260
all right so final five quick fire ones

4033
02:35:13,139 --> 02:35:19,439
from me what is the best or most

4034
02:35:16,260 --> 02:35:20,939
memorable weed you've ever smoked

4035
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:24,960
um

4036
02:35:20,939 --> 02:35:28,079
[ __ ] deserbert man I'm I'm it's pretty

4037
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:30,419
memorable because I had a really uh I

4038
02:35:28,079 --> 02:35:33,840
was smoking nothing but concentrate like

4039
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:35,639
to today at ego and uh I was just like

4040
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:39,840
man weed's not cutting it like Flour's

4041
02:35:35,639 --> 02:35:42,779
not cutting anymore and I my buddy uh

4042
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:44,280
who's my buddy now he he had a buddy

4043
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:46,620
he's like hey man you should talk to him

4044
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:47,700
he saw me in the cave and he let me hit

4045
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:50,100
his pipe

4046
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:51,840
and uh it was a zerbert and I'm like

4047
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:54,359
what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] he's like

4048
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:56,159
that zerbert fool and and I'm like can I

4049
02:35:54,359 --> 02:35:59,460
grab some and he like literally points

4050
02:35:56,159 --> 02:36:01,379
at uh 365 he was right there or canopy I

4051
02:35:59,459 --> 02:36:03,539
think his name is and I and I went home

4052
02:36:01,379 --> 02:36:06,719
with an ounce and ever since then like

4053
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:09,240
you know I was smoking nothing but hash

4054
02:36:06,719 --> 02:36:11,159
but uh I went back on flower on that

4055
02:36:09,239 --> 02:36:12,719
date and to this day it just so happens

4056
02:36:11,159 --> 02:36:16,020
you're asking me about it because uh

4057
02:36:12,719 --> 02:36:18,059
Cali kosher they grew a bunch of it and

4058
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:19,979
randomly I'm like hey like I like that

4059
02:36:18,059 --> 02:36:22,139
strain a lot and they're like sure we'll

4060
02:36:19,978 --> 02:36:24,000
we'll give you some and like randomly

4061
02:36:22,139 --> 02:36:28,559
they [ __ ] brought me a quarter pound

4062
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:30,478
of that [ __ ] uh lovely synchronous so on

4063
02:36:28,559 --> 02:36:32,760
the other end of the spectrum was there

4064
02:36:30,478 --> 02:36:34,559
ever a strain where like everyone you

4065
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:36,180
know was hyping it up and saying it's

4066
02:36:34,559 --> 02:36:38,818
the bee's knees and then you finally try

4067
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:41,579
and you were like this isn't that good

4068
02:36:38,818 --> 02:36:44,159
I tried some perf S1 that [ __ ] was

4069
02:36:41,579 --> 02:36:46,439
terrible dog all that pip [ __ ] they need

4070
02:36:44,159 --> 02:36:48,840
to shut the [ __ ] up and sit down I don't

4071
02:36:46,439 --> 02:36:51,059
care like it's okay it's like it's

4072
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:53,579
nostalgic and it's reminiscent but it's

4073
02:36:51,059 --> 02:36:55,500
far from good I'm just [ __ ] around

4074
02:36:53,579 --> 02:36:57,659
I'm gonna piss a lot of people out it

4075
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:59,760
has this place you know it's all for the

4076
02:36:57,659 --> 02:37:01,818
influes with the timbos the dead ass BS

4077
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:04,978
foods but yeah

4078
02:37:01,818 --> 02:37:06,659
all right so the next one you're about

4079
02:37:04,978 --> 02:37:08,639
to get dropped off at a desert island

4080
02:37:06,659 --> 02:37:10,020
and you can only take three strains with

4081
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:12,358
you you've got to smoke for the rest of

4082
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:13,859
your life what are they going to be

4083
02:37:12,359 --> 02:37:17,220
oh

4084
02:37:13,859 --> 02:37:20,100
I'll take some Skittles with me

4085
02:37:17,219 --> 02:37:22,500
I'll take uh some GMO

4086
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:25,200
and some Wilson [ __ ] it

4087
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:27,898
lovely all right now flip side of the

4088
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:29,939
coin you're about to drop someone you

4089
02:37:27,898 --> 02:37:32,039
don't like very much off on the island

4090
02:37:29,939 --> 02:37:33,600
and you get to pick the three strains

4091
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:36,020
they're stuck with what are you gonna

4092
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:36,020
leave them

4093
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:41,100
they're gonna get some uh

4094
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:44,640
some Super Lemon Haze

4095
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:46,979
they're gonna get some Malawi Panama Red

4096
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:49,500
and [ __ ]

4097
02:37:46,978 --> 02:37:52,760
what's and whatever soapy strain that

4098
02:37:49,500 --> 02:37:52,760
was that I smoked at Colorado

4099
02:37:54,620 --> 02:38:00,240
so final question is if you could go

4100
02:37:57,478 --> 02:38:02,818
back in time to anywhere any place any

4101
02:38:00,239 --> 02:38:04,680
time collect either seeds or a clone

4102
02:38:02,818 --> 02:38:06,719
where would you go and what are you

4103
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:07,620
getting

4104
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:10,019
um

4105
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:11,760
[ __ ] I would just for my uh you know

4106
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:13,979
just for the culture I'd probably go in

4107
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:16,559
Mexico and find some [ __ ] over there

4108
02:38:13,978 --> 02:38:18,779
just because I could speak Spanish too

4109
02:38:16,559 --> 02:38:20,519
figure it out over there

4110
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:21,960
oh yeah that's a good answer we

4111
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:23,700
definitely need some more land races

4112
02:38:21,959 --> 02:38:25,379
from down there

4113
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:27,600
yeah that'd be dope
