man right now we're getting into some of

75
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:09,659
the uh some of these new flavors but I

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,860
mean I'm most excited about the

77
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,419
well I don't know Harry what do you like

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,640
most I mean I like out of these whole

79
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,859
batch I like Samurai tears yeah I think

80
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,598
the samurai taste that's the most potent

81
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,060
of all of them

82
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,359
um that's the cold heat by swish so it's

83
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,280
got runs it's got triangle F2 and then

84
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,159
we cross that to our kind of hash plant

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,039
Fino that's kind of our washer so

86
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,179
yeah this it's strong but really tasty

87
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,400
so

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,140
incredible trying to bring gas back you

89
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,539
know we've had a lot of fruity flavors a

90
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,639
lot of funky flavors and now kind of

91
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,639
want to go back into some of the ogs

92
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,719
some of the cushes some of the cams

93
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,119
you know

94
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,139
create interesting mixes between sort of

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,700
the new

96
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,039
the new fruit flavors and some of the

97
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,259
old Funk and find something you know

98
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,298
just keep it interesting

99
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,679
that's really cool I love the uh the old

100
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,719
school meets the new school sort of

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,659
approach I noticed uh on your Instagram

102
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,799
you had a few uh label tags of some

103
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:06,840
different strains and there are a few

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,340
different ogs in the mix there given you

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,400
just mentioned that what's your favorite

106
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,860
OG cut oh man favorite OG

107
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,680
probably the lumpus headband right the

108
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,479
the underdog right the diesel that's

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,620
that was one of the first ones that I

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,459
grew

111
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,500
by myself that absolutely smashed and I

112
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,418
was like really proud to show people

113
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,220
that bag

114
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,319
you know because like OG was always

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,820
tricky to grow right I had a homie who

116
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,339
was up in Chatsworth who taught us how

117
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,079
to grow sfv and like at that time we

118
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,359
were feeding I mean we fed it [ __ ]

119
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,978
cool Bloom and cow mag you know like

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,300
nothing but nothing but yeah I mean the

121
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,039
thing just ate calm and that was the

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,600
secret right I remember like I was like

123
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,280
talking to someone and like lumpo like

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,300
overheard me talk talking about calmac

125
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,559
and he was like bro don't give out the

126
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,120
[ __ ] secrets you know like that's

127
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,040
that's the magic that's how we Crush

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,500
OG's because everyone else would grow OG

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,080
and they'd yield nothing you know pound

130
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,699
to light pound and a half these thin

131
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,379
little Twiggy plants it was still fire

132
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,000
but you couldn't get to like pack on

133
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,159
weight then the first time we started

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,560
pulling like two pounds of light like

135
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,960
you know 2.2 with you know straight OG

136
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Cuts like that was that was one we were

137
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:17,339
really excited about it but the headband

138
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,380
Skywalker TK hardcore the hardcore which

139
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,179
I mean now I'm actually I hadn't grown

140
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,060
the hardcore until recently I just got I

141
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,560
like went and got all of my old OG Cuts

142
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,079
back and a bunch of other stuff so I can

143
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,339
like re-rework some of the flavors but

144
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,959
that hardcore

145
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,899
but it doesn't look like all the classic

146
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,538
OG's it's definitely a bag seat or a

147
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,060
hybrid or something but that one has out

148
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,379
of all the OG's as the most unique

149
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,720
twist

150
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,279
right like a lot of them are really they

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,960
taste almost identical they look almost

152
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,019
identical you can see the little subtle

153
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,698
differences but that one is like

154
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,918
it's quite different

155
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,978
yeah I noticed it's had like a bit of a

156
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,379
Resurgence I um I'm trying to remember I

157
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,538
think it's Nasha is a breeder who I'd

158
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,399
seen do some hybrids with the the

159
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,139
hardcore and it got me interested in it

160
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,698
do you think you'll do any

161
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,019
um seed releases using the hardcore

162
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,720
going forward

163
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,620
yeah 100 as long as the crosses come out

164
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
fire

165
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,720
you know the only problem I watched

166
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,459
hardcore in the past which now now that

167
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,440
like solvent extract is kind of gone

168
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,899
where it's gone

169
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,538
um I'm really trying to focus on

170
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,159
products that will grow like genetics

171
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,259
that will grow well in flower form and

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
then also will wash well right they have

173
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,038
the right type of resin and everything

174
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,900
else the hardcore I remember we washed

175
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,860
it got like less than one percent didn't

176
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,418
melt you know it was tough and I

177
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,060
definitely wasn't as good at making hash

178
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:45,538
back then as I am now like we didn't

179
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,339
know anywhere near what we do now but

180
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,740
you know that's definitely going to be

181
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,318
some work to get something that's going

182
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,660
to melt in a high enough rate where as

183
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
it might be a cross of Hardcore and then

184
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,400
find a dope Fino then cross that again

185
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,899
with something else right that's got at

186
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,179
least carries the flavor but then will

187
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,339
give us you know the yields that we want

188
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,139
yeah because I mean nowadays people are

189
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,599
upset if it doesn't yield like four

190
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,780
percent you know five percent in the

191
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,699
bags and then press at 80 plus percent

192
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,799
you know

193
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,500
yeah the the market has certainly

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,538
dictated some certain minimums around

195
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,060
um you know returns and what's going to

196
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,019
make it worthwhile out of curiosity I'm

197
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,120
sure we're going to delve down the

198
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,000
rabbit hole or concentrates and extracts

199
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,620
quite a bit just to start off what's

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,240
your what's your favorite type of

201
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,639
extract you know are you like a dry

202
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,960
sieve guy a bubble hash where what's

203
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,180
your favorite thing I mean I'll probably

204
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,519
get some Flack for it but like

205
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,800
BHO applesauce

206
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,198
yeah stripped straight up you know I

207
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,120
love rosin I love rosin but you know

208
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,340
pour one out for all the mono terpenes

209
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,740
that get lost in the water like you

210
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,060
don't get the exact same profile and you

211
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,680
know like some people would argue that's

212
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,120
better because some of those mono

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
terpenes are

214
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,319
you know they're not as good or they're

215
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,399
this or they're that but like nothing

216
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:08,879
captures the absolute Essence like a

217
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,859
butane propane blend super cold cold

218
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,500
cured like I always hated diamonds and

219
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,038
sauce because especially back before we

220
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,939
were using like cold hot Tech on nails

221
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:23,579
right where if you hit like a hot dab of

222
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:27,120
like rocks and Terps

223
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,439
Terps melt off the thca first yeah those

224
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,538
are supposed to be dabbed at the lowest

225
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,059
temperature right so it's exactly the

226
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,218
opposite right so it's not you know the

227
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,478
flavor profile gets totally screwed but

228
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,399
yeah blend that up and make some

229
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,860
applesauce like

230
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,200
all all day

231
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,580
yeah definitely I think there's a lot of

232
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,720
like sort of

233
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,240
um

234
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,519
I don't know mantras that exist in the

235
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,919
states that don't escape it outside of

236
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,879
the US and so I guess like

237
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,559
um you know yeah there are a lot of

238
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,759
people who don't like BHO here there's

239
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,379
like a lot of people who don't like Jack

240
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,419
Harrah here and train wreck and all that

241
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,939
and blue dream

242
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:04,740
um yet in the rest of the world we

243
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,959
haven't been so fortunate to have that

244
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,120
exposure and so I'm still like man [ __ ]

245
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,799
give me that Jack Herer give me that BHO

246
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,659
I love it

247
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,120
um and I agree some of the best dabs

248
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,278
I've ever had were uh BHO for sure so

249
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,320
that's really interesting to hear

250
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,320
um I wanted to ask because you guys do

251
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,420
breed for extracts and for Terps

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,100
specifically just as a general

253
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,439
recommendation I always like to ask

254
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,240
breeders this if I don't give you any

255
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
information about the buyer because I

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
know the answer is you want it you're

257
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,860
going to want to know more information

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,860
but I want to ask if you can recommend

259
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,539
one strain out of your catalog and I

260
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,680
guess by implication I'm sort of saying

261
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,139
like what do you just think is a good

262
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,278
all-rounder what would you recommend to

263
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,720
someone if you don't know anything about

264
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,879
their grow style but you're just like

265
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,379
those people would be pretty happy at

266
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,879
the end of The Grow what do you

267
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,338
recommend

268
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,399
um for like a recent release foam

269
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,700
probably you know phone smashes it

270
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,799
yields well it's frosty it's purple

271
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,278
um it'll do really well in the in a wash

272
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,659
both solvent and non-solvent stacks it's

273
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,480
easy to grow

274
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:11,699
you know like in terms of just like

275
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,860
grabbing some seeds and you know being

276
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,660
able to throw down round one without

277
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,539
really having to tweak anything too hard

278
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:21,179
like she's just a [ __ ] monster all

279
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:22,620
the fenos are just big and blocky and

280
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,778
Crush

281
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,240
and they all wash well because swish the

282
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:29,700
Fino that I reversed that one washes at

283
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,500
like four and a half almost five percent

284
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,740
um which I picked that plant because

285
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,200
it's super Iced Out purple Hello PM

286
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,019
resistant squatty quick you know

287
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,379
flowering time that one is done at 60

288
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,060
days like done you can go longer but

289
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,278
there's absolutely no point you get no

290
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,719
higher yield the flavors ultimately a

291
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,539
lot of the flavors like start to mute

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,980
out and change the longer you run them

293
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,778
kind of like Skittles if you're running

294
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,220
like Skittles yeah bro you pull Skittles

295
00:10:54,778 --> 00:11:01,019
at day 53 yeah 50 some people even like

296
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,639
that's when you get the candy then the

297
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,440
longer you go the gassier it gets it'll

298
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,480
get the bag appeal goes through the roof

299
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,240
once you go like 70 days on Skittles

300
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,139
it'll be purple like it totally changes

301
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,519
but the Terps are just gone

302
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,838
I mean it doesn't last long by the time

303
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,759
you've cured it

304
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,279
that flake just starts to disappear

305
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,379
every day and there's no like

306
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,240
oh I've got the Skittles and curing for

307
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,240
like three months it's amazing like no

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,620
like it's you want to look like lawn

309
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,360
clippings

310
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,919
like straight up

311
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,240
because it's getting rolled up or it's

312
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,620
you know it's turned into hash like

313
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,419
you're not looking at it while you smoke

314
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,700
it flavor over everything that was my

315
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:41,338
whole thing I don't care about anything

316
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,600
else the whole ethos is Flavor so if I

317
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,519
get lost or I'm like trying to figure

318
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,959
out what we want to cross or where are

319
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,778
we going to go next

320
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,599
flavor I don't care about anything else

321
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,220
interesting we'll delve into some sort

322
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,839
of related questions a bit after I just

323
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,019
want to loop back quickly to the the

324
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,420
foam recommendation what sort of um

325
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,459
terpene profiles would people sort of be

326
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,439
thinking they might get out of that so

327
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:08,578
foam is

328
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,760
I mean I describe foam as like vanilla

329
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:13,379
stripper perfume Terps when you say

330
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,600
strippy you mean like like a solvent

331
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,458
sort of no I mean like a strip club okay

332
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,899
cool I mean that like Britney Spears

333
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:23,639
vanilla like really trashy

334
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,980
perfect cheap perfume like just if you

335
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,838
walk by you know I've never been in a

336
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,339
strip club wink wink

337
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,500
um but like if you walk by and you can

338
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,140
kind of Imagine like what that smell

339
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,360
mixed with like some sweat and like just

340
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,399
kind of some grungy it's also got like a

341
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,259
little bit like the soap is more like

342
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,139
cushy like the soap definitely doesn't

343
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:45,419
really smell that much like soap

344
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,399
um but it's a little bit more like I

345
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,620
don't know it just helps round out the

346
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,539
sweetness and like kind of the upper

347
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,879
notes that are more like perfumey

348
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:56,399
because any flavor that's like too

349
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,320
one-dimensional like you know for

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,600
example I'm not a huge fan of Jack or

351
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,760
some of those hazes because it's just

352
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
straight to paneling that's all I can

353
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,100
smell and you know like

354
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,958
that it's too one-dimensional I want to

355
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,579
be able to smell multiple things taste

356
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,958
multiple things if you hit it at

357
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,179
different temperatures you can kind of

358
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,399
change the flavor a little bit like it's

359
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,319
a little more interactive I guess

360
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,940
yeah definitely definitely I can

361
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,440
understand what you're saying and an

362
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,079
interesting Trend that I've only just

363
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,519
sorted to pay more attention to is that

364
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:31,919
I've seen and heard a lot about in

365
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,980
recent competitions that people are

366
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,599
submitting like blends of extracts

367
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,459
because it's trying to achieve what

368
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,100
you're talking about that more complex

369
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:44,219
profile sort of different

370
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,040
um sort of facets to the overall Turpin

371
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,660
profile do you think this is a trend

372
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,778
we'll see continuing have you heard of

373
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:54,480
this yourself uh yeah absolutely

374
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,458
um which we started doing that

375
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,740
I mean we'd always done it with like BHO

376
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:01,259
especially because we never had you know

377
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,700
like back in the Trap days we're early

378
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,519
in the Trap days we didn't have any

379
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,560
anything one flavor in bulk right and

380
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
that you always wanted to have a mixture

381
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,278
of stuff so usually in order to like do

382
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
any sort of sizable run it would have to

383
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,039
be a mix

384
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,540
um the problem with a lot of those is

385
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,338
like you lose

386
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:18,659
you know it's not like the whole is

387
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,300
greater than the sum of the parts in

388
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,980
this case it's usually just like this is

389
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,899
kind of like a little a few notes from

390
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,399
this or a few notes from that but it

391
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,559
doesn't work well

392
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,839
um but sometimes like that GMO papaya

393
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,879
that filthy papaya blend that's when you

394
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,019
start to blend especially like like I

395
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,179
don't know what it is with solvent

396
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,919
extracts but like the non-solvent

397
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,379
extracts is where the mixes start to

398
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,059
shine which we would see especially when

399
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,860
I was making water hash and bulk back in

400
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,778
the day some phinos wouldn't wash as

401
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,339
well right but if you took a Fino that

402
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:49,078
washed well and mixed it with something

403
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:53,100
that I didn't you could actually start

404
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:55,019
to make that wash like viable right to

405
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,579
spend the time energy flavors and then

406
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,679
you know you get like an interesting mix

407
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,078
yeah um and then if you have a bunch of

408
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,299
like sift or like you know water hash

409
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,919
that's dry ready to get pressed mixing

410
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,838
those in different ratios and kind of

411
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,019
like finding what ratios work really

412
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,180
well you can you know you have a

413
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,399
a whole new menu of flavors that are

414
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,778
cool which would otherwise take you I

415
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,120
mean a breeding project for me takes

416
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:19,500
like well over a year so like I could

417
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,299
take these two things and press them

418
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,799
three or four times over the course of

419
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,299
an hour and then we can taste all those

420
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,458
flavors and find out what's a cool mix

421
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:30,359
and what ratios work well or we could

422
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:33,179
spend a year and a half trying to create

423
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,519
that flavor like naturally

424
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,778
but I I like it I think it's cool you

425
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,120
know I think it

426
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:41,100
brings in a lot of creativity and you

427
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,720
know you can kind of like invent your

428
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,940
own flavor profile and if you never tell

429
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
anybody the exact ratio of what you're

430
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,040
doing now you have sort of a proprietary

431
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,000
recipe to make a cool flavor especially

432
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,698
if you're making it with like two

433
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,159
in-house cuts that no one else has you

434
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:58,439
know kind of sets yourself apart

435
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,000
yeah that's really interesting I mean a

436
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,579
lot of people are having a focal

437
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,720
discussion at the moment around how uh

438
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,159
people who've been in the game for a

439
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,778
while maybe we'll call them Legacy

440
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,659
farmers who are feeling like they're

441
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:12,360
being pushed out can reinvigorate their

442
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:14,278
brand and stay relevant that does sound

443
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,800
like an interesting way to do it do you

444
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,360
think that it's possible that

445
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,919
um that that someone could pursue that

446
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,199
or do you think you need to be a bit

447
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,059
more inventive than just that and try to

448
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,319
come up with a few different ways to

449
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,599
sort of stay

450
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,760
I don't want to say relevant but to to

451
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
keep your Niche from the bigger

452
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
companies

453
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,958
I mean I think there's so many different

454
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,419
avenues for people in the space that

455
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,739
there's no limits you know the only

456
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,419
thing that matters is if people like

457
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,639
what you're doing

458
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,860
so if you know if you can create an

459
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,659
angle and enough people like you don't

460
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,579
get to decide I don't get to decide any

461
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,500
of this the market decides everything

462
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,838
what we make what we release what's

463
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,940
popular What cracks off like it's not up

464
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,500
to me it's up to them

465
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,720
you know it's up to me to kind of read

466
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,039
the room and try and figure out my best

467
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,959
guess as to what people are going to be

468
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,178
excited about and I can help guide them

469
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,918
one way or another but ultimately we

470
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,780
make no decisions you know we're

471
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,839
absolutely the mercy of what people want

472
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:16,259
when and I just try to supply

473
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:18,779
my best version of that

474
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:21,179
I guess so there's plenty of room for

475
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,918
everybody yeah definitely definitely and

476
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,298
I mean and if we take that premise in

477
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,699
the other direction

478
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:30,240
with the Advent of Blends the first

479
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:33,960
thing I started thinking about is that

480
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,940
surely one day we'll have like a Jack

481
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,880
Daniels equivalent where it's like this

482
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,580
company that can buy bulk distillate or

483
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,400
whatever it is bulk material blend it to

484
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,558
consistently put out this mass-produced

485
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,360
sort of product that's like you know on

486
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,599
the palette or the affected sort of

487
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,399
consistent do you think that's a

488
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,319
foreseeable future or do you think

489
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,059
there's too much variation in the

490
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,918
cannabinoids to ever really be able to

491
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,720
put out something super consistent on

492
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,820
that level of production

493
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,079
no I think the consistency will be there

494
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,139
and I think there's plenty of people

495
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,720
that want that and seek that out and

496
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,900
that's fine you know like

497
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,740
people like let people like stuff you

498
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,538
know like they let Coors Light cool

499
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,339
you can have Coors Light and then

500
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,440
there's also plenty of like bougie more

501
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:24,240
exclusive different flavors like you

502
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,558
know if that if that speaks to them or

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,259
not like

504
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,298
they have the freedom to choose and you

505
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,919
know try what they want and if people

506
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,319
want that then like

507
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,538
great that's fine you know Phil's there

508
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,579
fills their needs but usually those

509
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:40,079
people that's your step like most of

510
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:41,460
those people should say most but there's

511
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,839
a good enough percentage of those people

512
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,179
where that's a stepping stone for them

513
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,159
and then they start to wonder what else

514
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,019
is out there what's different what's

515
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,120
unique and then they start to come in

516
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:53,279
you know like basically you know they

517
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,899
mature as a consumer right and then

518
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,579
they're like their flavor profile like

519
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,160
that they like starts to change and then

520
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,839
they start to open up into what's what

521
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,538
else is there right what other flavors

522
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,519
might might I find and then you know me

523
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,319
and plenty other breeders are you know

524
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,220
sitting there going come on like we'll

525
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,678
show you

526
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,740
there's a lot of flavors like every

527
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,660
flavor you ever thought possible

528
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,640
that's uh that's a beautiful segue

529
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,380
you've given me because I was gonna ask

530
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,640
you you were talking about flavors and

531
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,960
in the question before you were saying

532
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,700
you know what I'm not sure what to do I

533
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,440
just I revert back to flavor because

534
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,440
that's that's my whole thing

535
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
what flavor are you chasing next what

536
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,740
don't we have that you would like to

537
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,798
make if possible

538
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm trying to find flavors

539
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,538
that I cannot describe with words and

540
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,519
that I've never tasted before

541
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,259
that's like the goal of every breeding

542
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,519
for me the goal of breeding project is

543
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,400
one

544
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:50,099
the crop hybrid has to be better than

545
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,740
both parents otherwise what's the point

546
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,119
and ideally I'm trying to mix and match

547
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,940
flavors that are going to create and

548
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:00,239
generate something unique and different

549
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,798
that can help set me apart where you

550
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,019
know people try that and they go it's

551
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,700
not like oh that's cushy or that's you

552
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:07,200
know that's got that's some Skittles or

553
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,960
that's got this or that's got like no no

554
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,700
like what the [ __ ] was that

555
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,759
I've never smelled that smell before

556
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,319
there's not words that I know how to

557
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,319
describe that smell that's what I'm

558
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,200
after that's the whole like Umami right

559
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:25,019
sweet sour salty and savory

560
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,160
Umami it's it's not it can't be

561
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,839
described with any of the other ones

562
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,860
it's that sort of

563
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,480
un you know it's intangible

564
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,918
like the the blend of flavors create

565
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,140
something new and unique and different

566
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,720
that you can't you know

567
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,820
you can only describe as like oh that's

568
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,519
it's almost a Feeling

569
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,379
yeah truly well you know what's

570
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,139
interesting is like

571
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,559
um research shows that feelings actually

572
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,179
start as a as a physical sensation so

573
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,099
you don't feel anxious and then get

574
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,538
tight you feel that you're tight and

575
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:59,879
you're like oh [ __ ] I'm feeling anxious

576
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:01,619
and so it's exactly what you said it's

577
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,600
like it's a physical stimulus that then

578
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,879
causes you to feel away

579
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,279
that's that's really cool I like that so

580
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,559
tell me a little bit about what inspired

581
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,359
the Genesis of umami what was it that

582
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,918
caused you to think you know I want to

583
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,939
start this company

584
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,820
well let's see I started growing in 2006

585
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,038
I always knew that I wanted to have a

586
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,079
seed company I thought that was it

587
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,640
anything like in early on in the canvas

588
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:30,359
game like it was either you were growing

589
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,400
or you were making hash or you were

590
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,519
making seeds I thought wouldn't it be

591
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,019
cool to do to start from seeds and make

592
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,579
your own product and make your own

593
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,740
strains and then make your own hash

594
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:42,720
create something new and different and

595
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,480
just having something to call call your

596
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,240
own so I the plan was always to make a

597
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,400
seed company I mean really there wasn't

598
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,279
you know I hadn't had enough time in the

599
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,320
game to really start and put my name on

600
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,759
something and be proud of what it could

601
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,158
be you know I wasn't good enough at

602
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,019
growing I certainly wasn't you know good

603
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,880
at breeding I was you know I still don't

604
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,599
really consider myself a breeder like we

605
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,520
make seeds we hunt seeds we do the job

606
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:11,339
but the whole point was find something

607
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,619
cool and unique and different so I gamed

608
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,959
up I finally had the skills to the point

609
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,779
I had the library you know I'd collected

610
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,259
seeds for a decade you know before that

611
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,298
and then the timing was right to start

612
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,679
the company and launch

613
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:29,519
we did

614
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,980
and you know it worked here we are

615
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,119
that's brilliant let me let's go back a

616
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,860
little bit then we're going to do it in

617
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,918
reverse order to what we normally do it

618
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:39,000
so then tell me your first cross you

619
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,179
ever made

620
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,940
was that intentional was it an accident

621
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,038
and what were the genetics involved

622
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,679
it was intentional

623
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,500
um I don't really know what it was it

624
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,700
was there was a family vacation in

625
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,240
Mexico

626
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,179
and then somehow seeds ended up in Salt

627
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,759
Lake City Utah and

628
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,320
we pop those seeds we really got my

629
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,819
homie's backyard

630
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,740
you know you spend that much time

631
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,779
growing the plants and then you have a

632
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,120
male and you're like well I mean

633
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,639
I'm not going to kill off the the mitt

634
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,259
like come on you know it's I spent so

635
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,820
much time and energy to get this thing

636
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,960
to this point

637
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,678
um so it was just some like open

638
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,480
pollination whatever and uh that was I

639
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,340
mean I was hooked [ __ ] the first

640
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,980
second those plants popped out of the

641
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,720
soil that was it for me you know I knew

642
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,000
I knew what I was going to be doing

643
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,140
but it was some Mexican you know sativa

644
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,359
or something or other

645
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,538
not good was that the first grow you

646
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:42,359
ever did as well yeah yeah nice okay and

647
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:44,940
then so let's fast forward a bit when

648
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,678
you got more serious about growing what

649
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,140
was the first thing you started growing

650
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,940
like say under a light

651
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,400
so the first ones we were growing under

652
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,919
a light were

653
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,640
let's see

654
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,640
it was a

655
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:05,220
um

656
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:07,319
there was a blue cheese by Cali brains

657
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,000
there was uh let's see what else we were

658
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,339
doing back then it was this one my buddy

659
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,359
gave me called it Hyperion which was

660
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,538
some

661
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,819
some hazy you know Indica hybrid or

662
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,279
something that was it smelled it tasted

663
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,980
kind of like coconut it was funky like

664
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,779
and the hash tasted very much like

665
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,819
coconut which was unique I've never

666
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:28,259
stumbled upon anything even remotely

667
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:31,319
similar to it ever

668
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:32,759
you know since then but so there's

669
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,500
there's still some flavors that I'm

670
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,179
looking for that I remember because I

671
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,980
like to think I remember every single

672
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,220
bag I ever smoked

673
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,140
nice one good memory like I just you

674
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,419
know that I remember what the flower

675
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,820
looks like I remember the flavor profile

676
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,220
I definitely remember a lot of them that

677
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,178
I grew that sucked you know that were

678
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,900
just

679
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:58,019
no dice like you know just like what did

680
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,240
I do wrong and you know now looking back

681
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:02,519
it's like hilariously apparent like just

682
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,019
how [ __ ] terrible you know I was at

683
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,220
cultivation early on and like we just

684
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,379
didn't know

685
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,839
enough back then you know it's a lot of

686
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,360
like Bro Science and don't do this don't

687
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,158
do that and we'll we'll do the same

688
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,839
don't worry don't worry but so you're

689
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,179
learning the ropes and you're starting

690
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,639
to refine your craft were there any

691
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,500
breeders or specific Growers you sort of

692
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,240
looked up to in those early days and

693
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,339
were taking advice from

694
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,859
uh I mean I always liked so like

695
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,019
Greenhouse Seed Co drop their like land

696
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,058
race you know

697
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,639
videos that they had right where they'd

698
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:38,099
go to the bush and Hunt

699
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,320
um and so like I was dming Franco like

700
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:42,719
way back when and he was always super

701
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,759
cool and friendly and like you know I'd

702
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,980
ask him questions and like he was but

703
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,720
she had no need to do any of that like

704
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,179
wow I'm just some [ __ ] off random dude

705
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,500
on Instagram like sending a DMs like you

706
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,759
know asking for advice or whatever and

707
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,019
he was always really cool and really

708
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,960
friendly

709
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,480
um so yeah definitely uh definitely

710
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,259
Franco from from Greenhouse

711
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,538
um

712
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,819
I mean Mr Nice was you know like it was

713
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:07,798
a lot of like the OG Dutch dudes you

714
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:10,439
know who were like going hard

715
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,700
um especially because like early on you

716
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,100
know some of the things I started seeing

717
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,140
was Mr Nice out in Switzerland right

718
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,959
running the old pillow play and they had

719
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,700
just the biggest cultivations you'd ever

720
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,000
seen at the time where you're like where

721
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,038
on Earth can you possibly do this you

722
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,900
know this is at a scale that is just

723
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,759
mind-boggling

724
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,500
um so that was always really cool to see

725
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,759
see some of those dudes and I always

726
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,220
thought I'd end up somewhere in Europe

727
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,599
you know building a company because I

728
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,919
was like well I don't see this happening

729
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,558
in the states right a lot of the

730
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,299
California dudes left you know DNA guys

731
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,278
were out there because you know weren't

732
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,679
really doing it in California

733
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,538
um and then luckily for me

734
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,880
you know the rules in California started

735
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:52,980
to shift where now we could actually get

736
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,539
like I mean it wasn't a licensed by any

737
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,759
means but we were covered under under

738
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:58,200
medical we had the 99 plant racks and

739
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,740
you know we were in counties where we

740
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,880
could grow you know at scale and that

741
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,000
was kind of the first time we started

742
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,980
running like big well not big but bigger

743
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,038
operations

744
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,380
yeah nice one and so after you had uh

745
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,599
started the company what was the first

746
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,000
sort of project that you felt really

747
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,379
helped establish your identity within

748
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the public eyes where even you yourself

749
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,340
are like man we're like we're really

750
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,460
doing this so

751
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:27,599
my homies in Arizona

752
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,058
they own a company called grow science

753
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,480
which is a pretty big

754
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:36,000
cultivation outfit out in Phoenix and

755
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,759
they bought a bunch of my seeds for my

756
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,259
very first drop ever which went the

757
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,519
first drop went pretty well you know all

758
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,278
things considered I was a brand new

759
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,079
breeder you know like I had no

760
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:47,400
you know there was really no Legacy I

761
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,259
didn't like Leverage any of my other

762
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,600
companies or Brands because I wanted the

763
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,879
thing to stand on its own what was the

764
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:58,439
the mile or what was like the project so

765
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,720
that was a the mail was Mac mints

766
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,580
um and then I cross that to pretty much

767
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,400
everything so that was a thin mint

768
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,500
cookie crossed with the Mac Mail

769
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
that I got yeah so then I crossed that

770
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,380
with

771
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,480
you know the whole menu

772
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,260
um and the grow science had the Frozen

773
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,538
and eighth right yeah yeah we uh yeah

774
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,798
River cat posted a thing and this was

775
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:21,480
like back when they were doing drops of

776
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,940
like piece of grain and he was like hey

777
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,919
there's you know I'm doing a thin mint

778
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,860
drop of flour

779
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,778
go you know go scoop the flower and

780
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,058
there's also like some seeds in there so

781
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:36,119
like you know a whole bunch of eighths

782
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,579
were purchased and then ground up to

783
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,619
find like six or seven seeds and I

784
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,418
hunted those seeds then I found the mail

785
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,339
and then that was kind of what

786
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,038
kick-started it because it was a frosted

787
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:49,079
ass it's like just big giant medium

788
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,940
monster male I was like this is the one

789
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,259
we start with you know hit up cat we're

790
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,120
like is it cool if we breed with this

791
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:56,519
he's like yeah you found it in the seats

792
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:57,719
yeah like and so I said those we went we

793
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,480
went to work

794
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,519
wow that's that's sick so you know I

795
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,440
guess fairly safe to say probably no one

796
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,220
else really has a male from that

797
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,019
particular cross no no certainly not out

798
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,519
of curiosity how many eighths did you

799
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,980
buy like a ton or just like a couple

800
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,139
twenties three eighths wow yeah so most

801
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,480
of them didn't even have one too yeah no

802
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,460
we found like six seeds total

803
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,220
there you go that's good marketing from

804
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,960
cap yeah no it worked it worked out well

805
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,579
you know I like I couldn't believe it

806
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,558
and like I said I found that no I made

807
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:29,819
f2s and like I never released any of the

808
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,639
Mac mint stuff

809
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,859
um only only crosses but they were uh

810
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,038
they were fire you know we did the lime

811
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:39,959
souffle which was a Mac mint female

812
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,398
um that one smashed that one washes

813
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,259
really well

814
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,599
um what was that female like in terms of

815
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,700
like turbine profile and effect it was

816
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,278
like uh I always described the Mac Vince

817
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,860
as like gelato it's like heavy on the

818
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,419
gelato where it's very similar to gelato

819
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,219
um because it's got the cinnamon cookie

820
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,200
and it's got Max it's got Starfighter in

821
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,480
it but it's so it's pretty hashy but

822
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,340
it's definitely got this I mean I always

823
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,319
described it as like solventy but like

824
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,658
the type the exact type of solving is

825
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,460
like rubber cement so like if you you

826
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:11,039
know I don't know if they still use that

827
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,778
in school but way back when you know you

828
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,460
just like crack open that jar of rubber

829
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,659
cement and you just get hit with this

830
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,360
noxious

831
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,600
fumes so that was what I got I got like

832
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,759
chocolate and that super super nice

833
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:27,199
stringent

834
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:29,579
chemi like sour like yeah solvent Funk

835
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,778
so that was that was the that was the

836
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,460
third profile

837
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:35,579
nice yes

838
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,100
nice one and so where did you go from

839
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,058
there next oh man let's see what'd we do

840
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,158
after

841
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:43,500
so we did the Mac mint drop

842
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,840
and we did right and we did the key lime

843
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,398
that's right and then that I did then I

844
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,819
went to Femmes

845
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,819
um so I did the key limeade which is the

846
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:56,519
sunset sherb cross to the burning bush

847
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:59,339
cut of key lime pie so that was a quick

848
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:02,759
flowering purple super creamy kind of

849
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:07,259
soapy little skittles-esque

850
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:08,940
um but that that that femuron I hit to I

851
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:11,158
don't know I think that menu was like

852
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,259
10 or 12 strands

853
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,140
um and that stuff still sought after

854
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:17,819
like people yeah 710 Labs runs a bunch

855
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,440
of those yeah 710 has a couple of those

856
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:21,058
like on the menu

857
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,980
um I mean a lot like that was one of the

858
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:24,359
first big femrons that went you know

859
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,220
really really well especially because

860
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:27,119
here in the states like people don't

861
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,519
like

862
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,798
Rags at least like they they could they

863
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,500
could tolerate red seeds back then but

864
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,440
you know like probably sell like 10 10

865
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,079
or 20 to 1 Femmes to regs so I really

866
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,120
wanted to like go back and focus on

867
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,699
um Femme seeds although when stuff is

868
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,839
when you find a really amazing male it's

869
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,000
just like

870
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,939
you can't do it the disservice of never

871
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,159
you know making any seeds with it so

872
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,240
when I found zuchi and like kantuchi and

873
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,460
some of the other ones it was like okay

874
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,399
obviously I'm gonna do we'll sprinkle

875
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,140
drops of these in in there

876
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,418
that's nice I wanted to touch on that

877
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,100
specifically because I noted you do as

878
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,080
you mentioned do both regular and firm

879
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,298
seeds do you find yourself gravitating

880
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,359
more towards one than the other just on

881
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:15,119
a personal level and as a follow-up do

882
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,398
you think there's Merit to some of the

883
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,819
age-old criticisms of Femme seeds you

884
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:23,099
hear no I think a lot of the

885
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:24,720
I think a lot of the anti-feminized seed

886
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,980
crowd is uh

887
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,960
either

888
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,220
just parroting a lot of you know this

889
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,399
narrative that they've heard in the past

890
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,120
that's not really rooted in in science

891
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,339
um

892
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,859
and you know to some degree I think if

893
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:41,819
you constantly if you go you know Femme

894
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:43,619
them down the line I can see how

895
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,720
it would make sense that the genetics

896
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,000
could shift maybe in a way that's not

897
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,940
like ideal because that is about as far

898
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,700
from the natural order as you can get so

899
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,000
for me as a breeder I'm always going to

900
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,580
do like I usually I'll never cross two

901
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,259
whatevers and just do the seed line like

902
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:04,500
the the pollen donor is something that

903
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:07,500
I've made and worked like or found like

904
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,599
you know something unique to me period

905
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,159
um but I'm never gonna take like

906
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,639
something that comes from a femme line

907
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,500
and then Femme that again like yeah and

908
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,480
then fem it I hit it to another clone I

909
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,099
like to inject a male in there like and

910
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,720
I've got a couple males that I like that

911
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,599
I work with you know that I've worked

912
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,460
with for a long time so I know exactly

913
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:28,319
what they're gonna do right and like a

914
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,940
good male I mean one of my buddies

915
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,819
always says a good male is literally

916
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,340
Priceless because

917
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:36,778
you know I know I know what kind of

918
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,639
Finos we're gonna find I know what it's

919
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:40,859
going to do I know what progeny is going

920
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,720
to look like so then we'll hit that to

921
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:45,119
you know something that's cool

922
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,220
find it female in that generation and

923
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,398
then that can get reversed but like I'm

924
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,940
not doing feminism

925
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,798
yeah yeah interesting I we had a an auto

926
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,360
breeder on the show recently flying line

927
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,519
research he's cool dude he's in his

928
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,898
Terps as well and he he said this

929
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,038
analogy about orders but it sort of

930
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:03,359
applies what you're talking about he

931
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,220
said it's like a zipper light you sort

932
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,959
of unzip it and then zip it back up and

933
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,240
when you Femme stuff you're sort of

934
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,918
closing it and zipping it up and hitting

935
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,598
something else to it is like unzipping

936
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,980
it and opening it and I sort of have

937
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,338
been thinking about that analogy it's

938
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,740
it's cool I wanted to um ask because

939
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:21,418
it's a you may not have too much

940
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,819
thoughts on it but we do talk about it

941
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,679
from time to time on the show a lot of

942
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,480
some some people still have some

943
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,338
question marks around the lineage of

944
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,159
Skittles you know it's still there's

945
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:33,299
there's obviously that you know grape

946
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,800
grapefruit sort of thing that you hear

947
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,359
but then there's still like a strong

948
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,700
amount of people who believe that it's

949
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,639
like maybe a sherbet S1 and the fire

950
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,739
loss test said it was a sherbet S1 and

951
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,419
so that's like I've never really been

952
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,459
able to get my head around that because

953
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:50,098
it's sort of my gut instinct is like

954
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,500
doesn't seem like a sherbet S1 to me but

955
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,599
then you've got guys like inspector from

956
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,398
CSI Humboldt who just does like these

957
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,320
big hundred seed Vino hunts of like

958
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,940
sherbet s1s and he reckons he finds

959
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,800
plants similar to Skittles in there

960
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,980
what's your thoughts on the lineage of

961
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,619
Skittles I mean the terp profile is very

962
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,119
similar right they're they're at the

963
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,280
very least in the same neighborhood if

964
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,640
not on the same street right

965
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,220
um the structure wildly different wildly

966
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,719
different I've grown I've grown both I

967
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:21,598
have both

968
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,519
um I've grown a lot of sherbert hybrids

969
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,059
I've grown a lot of skills hybrids I've

970
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,679
not seen as much crossover as I would

971
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,139
have thought

972
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,539
um there's the structure is so different

973
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,819
and like everything you cross Skittles

974
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,920
to I can almost immediately identify

975
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,960
whether or not it has Skittles in it

976
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,119
because of the leaf structure because of

977
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,099
the stack the the stem structure like

978
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,740
it's it sticks out like a sore thumb at

979
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,380
least you know to my eye but with sherb

980
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:50,578
crosses I don't see that as much

981
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,160
so

982
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:55,800
I mean could they be related absolutely

983
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,179
are they probably but what are the

984
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,339
actual genetics

985
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:01,319
who the [ __ ] knows

986
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:03,960
I agree some things will will probably

987
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,059
never actually find out

988
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,240
so while we're talking about Skittles I

989
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:11,338
noticed on the website you have an array

990
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,838
of interesting mothers many of them

991
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,659
incorporating Skittles it got me

992
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:18,838
wondering what's your process like of

993
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:20,399
acquiring mothers do you have like if I

994
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:23,460
had to guess I'd say You must have these

995
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,500
like vast networks where you can get new

996
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,880
and emerging clones or have I got

997
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,858
something wrong what's your process you

998
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,039
seem like you got new stuff all the time

999
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:33,420
yeah no there is a there's a vast

1000
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,500
Network

1001
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,659
um

1002
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,480
you know like-minded

1003
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,759
people who are always chasing like the

1004
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,679
newest flavors and you know I've been

1005
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,980
fortunate enough to be in space for long

1006
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:50,578
enough to have you know friendships with

1007
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,960
you know a lot of Legacy dudes who a lot

1008
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,660
of them are like just as excited about

1009
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,858
getting them to me as I am about getting

1010
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:57,960
them because they're like hey I got this

1011
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:00,779
new one like what are you gonna do with

1012
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,599
it you know so uh yeah a lot of those

1013
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,820
genetics like I luckily I don't have to

1014
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,579
go looking for them so much as like they

1015
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,900
find me which also helps me to know like

1016
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,640
okay this is

1017
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,280
clearly something people are interested

1018
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,219
in so this might be worth a look right

1019
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,560
yeah and what sort of things impress you

1020
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:22,500
about a plant in terms of if you're

1021
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,960
thinking about maybe breeding with it is

1022
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,880
it mostly about like the flavor profile

1023
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,980
and structure presented in front of you

1024
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,780
or do you want to breed with it a few

1025
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,519
times and sort of see how it breeds like

1026
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,380
what what are your considerations in

1027
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:38,159
general I mean the number one thing is

1028
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,240
Flavor as always so all the any new cuts

1029
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,819
that show up

1030
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,819
they get run you know at least once or

1031
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,320
twice to kind of pre-vet

1032
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,760
whether or not this is something I'm

1033
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
even interested in you know goofing

1034
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,180
around with because some of them you

1035
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,159
know they have a bunch of hype somehow

1036
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:57,118
and you know I grow them out it's like

1037
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:59,159
no like for whatever reason you know and

1038
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,880
it might not necessarily be because

1039
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:04,739
sometimes the flavor can be really good

1040
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,619
but it's not worth some of the grow

1041
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:10,559
characteristics right like Skittles is I

1042
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,400
mean it's a unique strain because it

1043
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,519
sucks

1044
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,579
grow it is the worst plant in the world

1045
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,639
it grows so slowly you basically just

1046
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:23,400
don't water it at all and somehow it

1047
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,199
lives yeah twice as long five times as

1048
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,200
long yeah you know and like people

1049
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,819
wonder I've never done a like an exam I

1050
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,039
never I've never released a skittles

1051
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,800
cross like direct Skittles cross and I

1052
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:36,480
probably won't because one a ton of the

1053
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,780
progeny are going to grow like Skittles

1054
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,240
does and people you know don't love that

1055
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:45,540
style of Rogues it's difficult and they

1056
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:48,419
yield low and they take forever but

1057
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,460
um you know hybrids of it you're able to

1058
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,960
kind of bring in some of that like I

1059
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,519
like I like the terp profile that it

1060
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,500
brings on you know especially with the

1061
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,300
crosses like it's a little creamy

1062
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,099
and it just helps like round out some of

1063
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,800
the other like more harsh intense

1064
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,140
flavors where also some of those harsh

1065
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,700
intense flavors are too one-dimensional

1066
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,578
for me where you're wanting something

1067
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,199
else you know either on the exhale or on

1068
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,700
the back end or like something else

1069
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,338
you're just kind of like

1070
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:15,659
you know make it a little bit more well

1071
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:17,159
I mean literally to make it a little

1072
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:19,019
more palatable

1073
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:22,199
you know to be entirely honest

1074
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:23,820
yeah no I I agree with you there and I

1075
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,919
just sort of looping back to that point

1076
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,900
you made about growing stuff out and

1077
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,820
thinking God how did this get big if I

1078
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,920
had to Hazard a guess based on your

1079
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,960
Instagram I see a fair few memes about

1080
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,940
Oreos was that one that maybe fit into

1081
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,400
that category for you guys all right I

1082
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,960
mean you know it's just when a ton of

1083
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,180
people are super excited about something

1084
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,099
that I don't really find that

1085
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:46,440
special or unique at all I think it's

1086
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,760
kind of fun to poke a little fun at

1087
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,920
Oreos

1088
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,980
um structurally I mean it looks visually

1089
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,480
it's peeling right but it has and I mean

1090
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,059
I was really surprised to learn that it

1091
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,320
actually washed pretty well but there's

1092
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,299
no flavor

1093
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,400
you know so for me if I ever found a

1094
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,140
female like that or you know I got I had

1095
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,660
access to the Oreos cut but I would

1096
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:09,420
never breed with it just because it has

1097
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:11,519
it's the antithesis of flavor you know

1098
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,838
and there's plenty of people who argue

1099
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,280
like oh it's got a lot of flavor you

1100
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:15,599
just haven't had a good batch yet and

1101
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,780
like I've tried

1102
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,400
a fair few from dudes that you know I

1103
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,540
consider to be some of the top growers

1104
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,099
in existence and it was good but it was

1105
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,019
not special

1106
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:31,079
you know and Life's too short to smoke

1107
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:33,239
something that's just good

1108
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,640
I want something that's cool I want to

1109
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,219
remember that experience

1110
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,379
I feel you that's a good one one of my

1111
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:43,919
favorite quotes from past guest on the

1112
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,539
show skunk VA I've only got so many lung

1113
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,980
breaths in this lifetime I'm not gonna

1114
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:49,199
waste

1115
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,880
um yeah so I mean I was interested to

1116
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,578
ask because a lot of your menu comprises

1117
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,619
these really sort of cutting-edge new

1118
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,680
genetics that like most people maybe

1119
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,920
aren't even familiar with yet and um I

1120
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,019
was wondering do you have any soft spots

1121
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,880
in your heart for some like maybe unique

1122
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:07,320
old world flavors like for example you

1123
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,059
know you mentioned you're not a fan of

1124
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,920
Jack Herer all good

1125
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:13,440
um you know are there any other things

1126
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,720
because I noticed you did um some collab

1127
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,639
hybrids where one of the parents in the

1128
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,078
mail was Soma's lavender and I was like

1129
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,578
oh that's that's a bit old world that's

1130
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,839
kind of cool is there any other old

1131
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,760
world flavors you're like that's

1132
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,279
actually a pretty good one

1133
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,260
um yeah I mean I like so the the

1134
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,000
Affinity that a lot of the people that

1135
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,520
came up before me like probably five ten

1136
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,320
years before me have for Hayes right I

1137
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,559
don't have that because I didn't like I

1138
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,260
missed it but I have that for OG it

1139
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,940
cushes and so when I got when I like

1140
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,980
dived down deep onto the cushes I got

1141
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,320
more into like some of the Afghan stuff

1142
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,780
and you know some of the

1143
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,200
um like you know stuff from the Middle

1144
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,599
East ultimately and so yeah gani like

1145
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,739
especially those like really hashy like

1146
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,280
you know

1147
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:00,659
coffee funky like land race I mean the

1148
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,940
the black

1149
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,699
right like uh the blackhead or not the

1150
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:09,780
black Haze it's um cute blackheads no no

1151
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:11,819
no no black domino black Afghan oh wow

1152
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,800
yeah yeah yeah yeah the black ass yeah

1153
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,480
the black half he is like because the

1154
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,700
fruity affees I was like yeah they're

1155
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,619
good but they're they're a little that

1156
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:22,559
coffee one yeah yeah I like the like

1157
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:24,780
really deep hardcore subtle flavors

1158
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,699
where you like you know most people are

1159
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,160
only gonna smell one thing which like

1160
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:31,319
maybe that's how the haze aficionados

1161
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,179
are they can actually smell all the

1162
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,740
different dimensions of that I don't

1163
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:36,960
either I can't or I don't have that

1164
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:39,419
ability but I can with some of the lower

1165
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,920
end stuff and I mean like not lower end

1166
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,019
quality I mean lower end on the flavor

1167
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,559
and like you know those really

1168
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:49,199
earthy chocolate coffee funky flavors

1169
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,639
where you're just like I don't know like

1170
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,679
it's hard to describe because you start

1171
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,420
getting into like every time you smell

1172
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,578
it you smell something different you

1173
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,400
start to pick up different notes and as

1174
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,839
you smell more things in the world you

1175
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,740
start to have like a better reference of

1176
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,139
like

1177
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:06,838
you know smells which is why I describe

1178
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:09,779
things the way that I do because those

1179
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:11,759
are those are things I've smelled and

1180
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,540
that's you know your set memory like

1181
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,540
that's what I pick up

1182
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,299
that's cool while we're talking about

1183
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,519
smells

1184
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,220
you and Harry were kind enough to bring

1185
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,420
some nice little jars for me to sniff on

1186
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:26,818
say let's talk about these for a little

1187
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,220
bit so is this the the current release

1188
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:30,960
the next release when can everyone

1189
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:33,179
expect to be able to get their hands on

1190
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,159
the next drop and then after we talk

1191
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,159
about it a bit I'll um we can talk a

1192
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:39,960
little bit about the smells so I think

1193
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,879
probably January that's where we're

1194
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,380
going to start dropping dropping some of

1195
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,160
these we've got

1196
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,800
I mean there's a lot slotted for release

1197
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,000
um what we try and do is select the bet

1198
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,160
you know just the ones that would like

1199
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,440
the most fun and cool and relevant for

1200
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,779
that for that Friday right which

1201
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,760
normally do we'll do a series we'll do a

1202
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,780
drop every Friday or every other Friday

1203
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:07,200
for you know four Fridays or six Fridays

1204
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,519
and then you know plan a couple weeks

1205
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,139
and then we'll do some other drops but

1206
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,619
like I want to keep it like fun keep it

1207
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:15,239
fresh and then make sure that you know I

1208
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,460
mean best case scenario is where the

1209
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,739
drops actually sell out like day one or

1210
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,659
in the first week which is fun

1211
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:23,039
especially for the buyers because now

1212
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,679
you've got something that no one else

1213
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,940
has and there's only I mean I only do

1214
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,759
one batch

1215
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,619
there's only like one big drop and then

1216
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,680
once all the seeds are gone they're

1217
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,720
they're gone so do you ever remake stuff

1218
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,480
or it's all one time

1219
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:42,598
never remake anything nice okay yeah one

1220
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,460
big batch which could have you know

1221
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,140
however many hundreds of packs sometimes

1222
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,240
it's small I mean some some of the

1223
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:49,500
crosses like they don't they don't make

1224
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,719
many packs they don't make many seeds

1225
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,420
you know it drops as little as like 10

1226
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:56,759
15 20 packs and those sell out really

1227
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,338
really quickly which is great but you

1228
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,119
know then they're gone just kind of sad

1229
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:06,299
and I've decided to not remake stuff

1230
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,059
because there's not enough time

1231
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,460
to go back to something there's so much

1232
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:13,318
more to like dive in and discover I'd

1233
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,079
rather keep looking for something else

1234
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:17,880
something cool something unique

1235
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,140
yeah that's interesting it raises this

1236
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,380
point of like do you think the market

1237
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:24,239
would actually allow you to let's just

1238
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,039
say you you were testing some seeds you

1239
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,959
made and you find this plant in it

1240
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,759
that's like the equivalent of Skittles

1241
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,579
before Skittles like it was like wow

1242
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,319
this is totally different and you were

1243
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:36,539
like we've got to breed this into a Pure

1244
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,338
Line do you think the market sort of

1245
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,139
allows breeders to do that sort of

1246
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:41,639
project where it like takes longer or do

1247
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:43,078
you think it's just too fast paced like

1248
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,019
you're just going to be left behind if

1249
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,519
you tried to like do a like a Pure Line

1250
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:49,500
sort of project

1251
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,400
I think there's a lot of breeders that

1252
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,159
have

1253
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,079
stuff like that on their menu and they

1254
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,078
have you know they found tried and true

1255
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,940
varieties that people like and they'll

1256
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,380
keep making those and remaking them and

1257
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,700
there's nothing there's nothing wrong

1258
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,960
with that especially if they find

1259
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,059
something cool and they really want to

1260
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,559
focus on on that

1261
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:09,599
um that's great but there's enough

1262
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,179
people who are doing that

1263
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,700
you know I would rather continue the

1264
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:16,940
exploration to find something new

1265
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:19,199
something different something better

1266
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,300
you know that's what makes me that's

1267
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,739
what makes it interesting for me you

1268
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,200
know if I just had to grow the same

1269
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,598
thing over and over again it'd just end

1270
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,059
up like a job you know it's the reason I

1271
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,859
like walked out of my sales job way back

1272
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,838
when you know I was doing this and I was

1273
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:37,318
doing that and one day I was like

1274
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:40,199
[ __ ] this you know I'm out and I moved

1275
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:42,239
up into the woods that was that

1276
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:43,500
that's great I love it all right so

1277
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,598
let's talk about this the first time

1278
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,300
we've got uh

1279
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,359
uh bath house now I did want to ask you

1280
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:54,599
about this obviously has the bath water

1281
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,699
in it which is a very unique name and

1282
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,920
description obviously an homage to the

1283
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:01,139
infamous Bel Delphine gamergirl bath

1284
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,940
water but I was wondering what's the

1285
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:04,618
Terps on that one what's bath water

1286
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,539
smell like

1287
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:09,358
I mean

1288
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:10,739
It's A Hard One to to like describe what

1289
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:14,098
the smell is of bath water it's

1290
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:16,279
definitely like gassy and funky but like

1291
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:19,079
I mean you know

1292
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,980
imagine what Dell you know whatever her

1293
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,839
name is

1294
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,059
um imagine what her dirty bath water

1295
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,759
might smell like like

1296
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:28,559
that's that'll get you close enough

1297
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,839
you know because it is gassy it is Cushy

1298
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:34,559
it's creamy but it's definitely it's got

1299
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:37,199
this weird like soapy like kind of you

1300
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,199
know not the GMO Bo like it's more of

1301
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,719
like a sweaty like gross shirt you know

1302
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,419
I got it like a I don't yeah it's hard

1303
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,519
to describe like not quite hockey bag

1304
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,318
like I don't know if anyone's played

1305
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,739
hockey but those bags have

1306
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:54,960
a unique ripeness to them after uh a

1307
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,578
couple weeks

1308
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,858
nice one I love it I mean it got me

1309
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:01,079
wondering in general what what are some

1310
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:04,259
of like the more weirder smells you've

1311
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:07,380
come across while Fino hunting Fizz the

1312
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,480
Fizz yeah Fizz is one of my favorites

1313
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,700
um the

1314
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,139
oddly enough the compound apples and

1315
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:16,799
bananas kind of smells a little bit like

1316
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:20,578
the Fizz does but the Fizz is the

1317
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,619
loudest grape chemical

1318
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:24,119
I mean it's it's fizzy it's acidic it's

1319
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,140
like you know the feeling you get when

1320
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,599
you like

1321
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:29,519
put your mouth into a soda cup it's too

1322
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,318
fizzy and a bunch of the Fizz goes up

1323
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,659
your nose like that's how it makes you

1324
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,358
feel when you smell it it's like really

1325
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:39,179
like it leaps out of the jar and then it

1326
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:41,940
it will stain anything you put in it

1327
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:43,440
like any jar if you mix up like a couple

1328
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,420
buds in a jar like they're all going to

1329
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,338
taste like this like forever the jar is

1330
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,619
gonna smell like fizz forever and like

1331
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:53,818
you can crack a jar like a year plus

1332
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:56,460
later and it's still reeks there's very

1333
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:59,159
few flavors that actually hold on to

1334
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,599
that kind of a smell and that doesn't

1335
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,639
like because usually those kind of

1336
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,880
intense jumpy Ones Will mute out

1337
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,618
relatively quickly but this one is just

1338
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,300
I mean it seems like it will stay

1339
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:12,660
forever

1340
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,980
yeah wow that's cool like uh one of

1341
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,739
those ones that just yeah overpowers

1342
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,500
everything but not not Tangy something

1343
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:23,879
different oh it's it's too bad I tried

1344
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:26,760
to Fem it twice and out of like

1345
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,980
I mean the Run we did how many seeds did

1346
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,119
we get in that bag in total out of that

1347
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:35,579
whole run oh 50 50 seeds all pretty in

1348
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,559
like 10 different varieties some some

1349
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,180
had none seeds some had one some had

1350
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,039
like four yeah it was like four lights

1351
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:43,199
worth and it was like ten seats it was

1352
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,480
oh it sucks so bad it's like that maybe

1353
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,219
the pollen just didn't did some things

1354
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,019
just don't film well it's just yeah

1355
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:51,059
really hard to Femme certain varieties

1356
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:53,039
for whatever reason it's it just doesn't

1357
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:55,679
work sometimes it's true we got a lot of

1358
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,900
theories about why but it's like I don't

1359
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,598
I've I've had plenty of femerons

1360
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,180
absolutely flop and you know you're like

1361
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,859
excited about something and then you're

1362
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:06,960
like I said it takes about a year at

1363
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:08,940
least from when you're like cool here's

1364
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,500
what we're gonna work on to the point

1365
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,780
where it's actually ready to release

1366
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,239
maybe a year and a half

1367
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,400
um so yeah when when a run fails you

1368
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,479
know you're immediately three to six

1369
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,639
months

1370
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,619
behind that again

1371
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,539
meanwhile everyone else is crossing

1372
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,740
because it's not like that I'm not like

1373
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:27,480
the only person in the network right

1374
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:29,098
it's the network so a lot of my friends

1375
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,539
competition it was like I mean

1376
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:32,338
technically we're competition but like I

1377
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:33,659
like you know I like everybody

1378
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:35,400
um they're all working on their [ __ ] too

1379
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:37,980
at the same time so it's kind of like

1380
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,900
Who's Gonna Get You know who's gonna get

1381
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,880
there first with something that's

1382
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,200
actually like solid

1383
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,940
because anyone could just make a cross

1384
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,739
and like just film something and drop it

1385
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,079
and whatever that's that's cool and

1386
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:50,399
that's fine but who's gonna like bring

1387
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,640
something to the table that's actually

1388
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,338
like different and special and unique

1389
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:59,039
well yeah I mean you're sort of getting

1390
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:01,318
towards this topic I was hoping we could

1391
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:04,318
touch on which is that there are a

1392
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:06,480
number of uh Growers and smokers in the

1393
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,639
community who feel like in a sense we're

1394
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,880
sort of backing ourselves up against the

1395
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,799
wall in regards to the genetics we use

1396
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,780
do you what's your thoughts on this take

1397
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,539
do you think it's true

1398
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,519
to some degree sure you know

1399
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:24,000
um I think

1400
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:26,699
part of that opinion is a very narrow

1401
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,679
view of

1402
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:31,139
everyone in the Cannabis space who's

1403
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,960
breeding for making seeds in any

1404
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:36,358
capacity where they're like yeah you're

1405
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,240
looking at a small subset of that entire

1406
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:40,980
population that is absolutely doing tons

1407
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,078
and tons of poly hybrids and all this

1408
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,760
other stuff but that's because that's

1409
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,339
what people want right like I said

1410
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,720
there's a lot of that we don't get to

1411
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,880
make the decisions like you want to have

1412
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,219
a business that actually like works and

1413
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,720
pays for itself and hopefully like keeps

1414
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:56,098
gas in your car and like gets your May

1415
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:59,098
to be and let you keep doing the thing

1416
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,900
you have to sell seeds right and like so

1417
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:02,760
if that's what buyers wanting then you

1418
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,980
know a lot of people you kind of have to

1419
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,380
run down that that line or at least like

1420
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:10,260
close enough where you're still going to

1421
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,780
be around but there's a lot of people

1422
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,880
who aren't in the like standard breeder

1423
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,380
you know like when they think of canvas

1424
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,318
breeders there's a lot of people who are

1425
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:21,838
not in that space publicly at all who

1426
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,940
are doing all kinds of other work so I

1427
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,779
think in terms of the global genetics

1428
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,220
like there's no issue but if you know

1429
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,839
like a small network of Growers is

1430
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:32,338
growing the same thing and hyperizing

1431
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:34,318
the same thing like yeah they were gene

1432
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:35,940
pool might not be that great and then

1433
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,639
growing it with the same nutrients under

1434
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,619
the same lights same media having all

1435
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,719
the environment the same wondering why

1436
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,119
the pound price is going down that might

1437
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,419
be a slight problem but you know I still

1438
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,818
have a ton of land race stuff that

1439
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,740
I I mean I I don't know how many fridges

1440
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:54,719
I have full of seeds now but it's a

1441
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:56,219
quite a few because we've just been

1442
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,318
collecting genetics from everywhere

1443
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:01,078
always in trading and trying to find you

1444
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,539
know new and unique stuff and I'm I mean

1445
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:07,200
luckily we're I'm upgrading now

1446
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:10,318
um I'm gonna have a a small 7 000 square

1447
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,719
foot spot for hunting and popping like

1448
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,880
just straight old school like I'm gonna

1449
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,279
germinate everything in my library and

1450
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,539
try and find some cool cool old stuff

1451
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,660
because a lot of it is getting to the

1452
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:24,119
tail end of its like survivability you

1453
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:25,139
know those haven't been stored or at

1454
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,780
least I don't know how they were stored

1455
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:29,400
before I got them so

1456
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,680
you know the germination rate on a lot

1457
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,039
of the stuff might not be very good if

1458
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,299
at all so it's kind of time to start you

1459
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,639
know hunting those seeds and if we find

1460
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,400
something cool open pollinate make

1461
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,679
bigger population you know preserve all

1462
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,780
that stuff but it's not going anywhere

1463
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:49,139
yeah that's cool would we ever see like

1464
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:52,200
any cool F1 hybrids with like modern

1465
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:54,598
verses like maybe land race or heirloom

1466
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,338
or something oh for sure yeah that's

1467
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,380
absolutely in the plant

1468
00:53:56,338 --> 00:54:00,779
that's really cool probably not until

1469
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:04,500
2024

1470
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,579
25 realistically it's going to take it's

1471
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,659
going to take time

1472
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,460
yeah

1473
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:10,379
sure you know

1474
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,300
and then so I guess just the sort of

1475
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,059
final question on this discussion Point

1476
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,818
people have this comment that they'll

1477
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:20,099
say everything like sort of feels the

1478
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:21,420
same do you do you think there's Merit

1479
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:24,180
to that or do you think there's still

1480
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,220
like quite a bit of diversity within the

1481
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:28,318
sort of range of effects you can get

1482
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:29,480
from the the current varieties that are

1483
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,338
really popular

1484
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,079
I'm not the best person to ask on effect

1485
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:36,659
because

1486
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,260
listen for me it's flavor is the number

1487
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:41,639
one and the older I get the busier you

1488
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,440
know it's like there's a lot of stuff I

1489
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,299
would like to smoke but I you know it's

1490
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,740
not something I can do in the day and

1491
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,700
still get you know get everything done

1492
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:49,679
yeah

1493
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:53,039
um but no I feel like there's still a

1494
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:55,259
very wide variety in effect

1495
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,420
um from a lot of different flavors and

1496
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,400
sometimes I get bummed out when a flavor

1497
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,079
is like really good but it affects me

1498
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,760
like

1499
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,260
just my body chemistry or whatever

1500
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,119
affects me in a way that I'm like well

1501
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,220
this I really want to smoke more of this

1502
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,480
but I physically can't you know and then

1503
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:10,858
there's other flavors that are like I

1504
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,960
could smoke this all day but I don't

1505
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:17,098
really want to it's not that great yeah

1506
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,740
sure sure so I mean sort of on the other

1507
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:22,559
side of that topic are there any

1508
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:24,899
varieties you think that you would like

1509
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,700
to use maybe from your library stash

1510
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,760
maybe from other sources that you think

1511
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:31,379
would inject some sort of fresh blood or

1512
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,839
reinvigorate things a little just

1513
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,059
because they're a bit different

1514
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,578
um yeah I said I'm trying to pop a lot

1515
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:40,619
of a lot of this land Ray stuff what do

1516
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:42,599
you got you got like some cool malays

1517
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:44,760
I've got a lot of stuff from Africa a

1518
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,920
lot of stuff from Afghanistan

1519
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,980
um are we I've got a bunch of stuff from

1520
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:53,400
Nepal yeah I did recently get some land

1521
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:55,440
race from Japan nice one it's apparently

1522
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,000
I've got to grow it out and like you

1523
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,440
know I promised a dude I would grow it

1524
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,179
out and do an open pollination and make

1525
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,119
more of the genetics um because there

1526
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:06,539
was a there's a lot of hemp in Japan

1527
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,940
yeah but there's not a lot of like wild

1528
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:11,099
drug cannabis and I mean for a lot of

1529
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:13,800
people would say there absolutely is not

1530
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:15,180
yeah my homie has been has spent a lot

1531
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,720
of time in Japan

1532
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:20,460
um and he his buddy lives I can't

1533
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,459
remember where exactly they were saying

1534
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:26,818
they live but there are there's a drug

1535
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,760
type of wild cannabis in Hokkaido which

1536
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:31,380
is the northernmost Island Japan uh and

1537
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,119
they were

1538
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,800
I can't remember how many what do you

1539
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,380
say like it was like a three-day hike

1540
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,480
yes or something some like this was like

1541
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,338
bushwhacking to get out to these like

1542
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,900
wild Fields

1543
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:44,940
um and they would you know the homeboy

1544
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,160
would always collect as much as he could

1545
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,599
shove in his bag and then bring it back

1546
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:49,858
and then when people would go and you

1547
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:52,318
know hang out or whatever he'd always

1548
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:54,539
have this like wild herb that they would

1549
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:56,000
smoke and that was you know this crazy

1550
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:58,739
Japanese

1551
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,480
sativa or some sort of hybrid who even

1552
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:02,039
knows what it is and there'd be snow on

1553
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,179
the ground and the plants would still be

1554
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:04,920
able to be alive when you get there to

1555
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,679
harvest them still be alive in the snow

1556
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,838
full of seeds apparently the bricks

1557
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,239
content was through the roof so there

1558
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,578
was somehow they didn't freeze right my

1559
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:18,000
theory is always if the because I've got

1560
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:19,440
some varieties that like bleed red and

1561
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,420
you know having high levels of

1562
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,280
anthocyanin and bricks in there you know

1563
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,800
the theoretically acts like an

1564
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,059
antifreeze so the cells won't actually

1565
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,119
burst

1566
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:32,099
that quickly so some of those could well

1567
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:34,440
and survive like Frost and freezing

1568
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:36,539
which is pretty is very uncommon because

1569
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,460
most plants if you freeze them like you

1570
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:40,800
can put clones in the fridge for a

1571
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,019
surprisingly long time but if you put

1572
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,099
them in the freezer the cells burst and

1573
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:46,980
they die

1574
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:50,099
you can cry I'll freeze plants though

1575
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,139
interesting I did want to talk about

1576
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:55,619
that so like you know tissue culturing

1577
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:57,539
and germs so utilization is on the rise

1578
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:01,140
within cannabis do you foresee a time

1579
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:02,579
when that may surpass like the demand

1580
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:06,358
for seeds

1581
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,800
possibly I think the

1582
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,318
I've never

1583
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,000
actually done the synthetic seeds I've

1584
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,558
seen you know they're it's not very

1585
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,719
common that people make them and the

1586
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,000
cost is probably prohibitive for most

1587
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:19,618
people especially now maybe in the

1588
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,338
future that'll become more more common

1589
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:26,579
as long as it's relatively simple for

1590
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:29,219
the Layman or just a grower to go from

1591
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:31,380
that step to actually having like a

1592
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:33,959
plant that's growing in a pot because

1593
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,358
the the amount like you have to know

1594
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,940
exactly what you're doing to pull a

1595
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:42,239
rooted clone out of tissue culture and

1596
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,920
actually get it to survive early on and

1597
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,558
that's that's not

1598
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,440
it's not common knowledge and I would

1599
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:53,040
guess like 95 of even you know Growers

1600
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,740
would mess that up to the point where it

1601
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,000
just doesn't make any sense to spend any

1602
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:59,759
extra amount of money on something

1603
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,179
that's like yeah it's definitely better

1604
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,240
in terms of plant Health sterility right

1605
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:07,980
no bugs know this no that but it just

1606
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,798
the other the level of knowledge needs

1607
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,719
to be you know at the next step next

1608
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:15,179
stage which is it's very reasonable we

1609
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:18,659
get there in the next 5 10 15 years you

1610
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:20,519
know even the like the lowest

1611
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:23,098
you know then even the newest employee

1612
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,719
in any space would probably have

1613
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:25,980
some of that knowledge if it becomes

1614
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,259
more you know it just becomes more more

1615
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,699
commonplace and then it's just yet uh

1616
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,319
like everyone knows how to cut clones

1617
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,578
it's not you know you could look it up

1618
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,679
in five minutes and they'll be a simple

1619
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:37,140
enough explanation but right now for

1620
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:40,739
tissue culture that that does not exist

1621
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:43,019
yeah sure and while we're on the topic

1622
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:45,838
of dirty clones and pathogens and

1623
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:47,280
whatnot on a on a personal note for you

1624
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,019
guys have you had much issue with

1625
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,240
hoplate and virus have you had to clean

1626
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:54,179
house or have you guys been able to get

1627
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:57,899
through relatively unscathed uh we've

1628
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:59,098
been very fortunate yeah we do tests a

1629
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,039
lot

1630
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,960
um the entire mother stock gets tested

1631
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:06,779
I mean it used to be every two weeks but

1632
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,400
now it's pretty much once a month which

1633
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,960
I mean it just kind of got expensive to

1634
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,059
do it every two weeks uh to be quite

1635
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,740
honest but we do work with the lab uh in

1636
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:16,319
Utah that's really really good and they

1637
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:19,439
test for pop latent lettuce sclerosis

1638
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:21,900
and a couple of the other ones but yeah

1639
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,119
we've I've never actually seen it in any

1640
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,420
of my facilities which is very very

1641
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:29,099
lucky it's kind of a nightmare

1642
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:32,099
um not kind of a nightmare it is a

1643
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:34,680
nightmare and it's it's put a lot of

1644
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:35,940
people out of business quite frankly you

1645
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:38,039
know it's tough

1646
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,500
it's not we're also really careful about

1647
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,659
it our scissors are always sitting in

1648
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,280
hypochlorous acid all the time we have

1649
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:45,980
hypochloric acid in a spray bottle that

1650
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,000
gets sprayed on everything tools

1651
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,740
autoclaved they clean everything with

1652
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,179
chlorine like alcohol doesn't kill it

1653
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:53,159
chlorine's the only thing that kills it

1654
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:55,318
yeah heat doesn't kill it um but yeah

1655
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:57,000
we're very very careful and my

1656
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,338
quarantine process like when you know

1657
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,619
say we have the network to get stuff in

1658
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:04,259
part of the delay is that it takes me

1659
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:07,500
like three plus months

1660
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:10,920
to get it cut out of my quarantine into

1661
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,239
the main area where it can then go on

1662
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,818
and you know enter like any of the

1663
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,318
breeding programs but it yeah it takes

1664
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:18,599
quite some time and I'm hoping to speed

1665
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,159
that up uh because now I've gotten like

1666
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,200
I mean I do all my tissue cultures

1667
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,239
in-house like we do everything ourselves

1668
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:25,500
uh and we're slowly getting back to the

1669
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,598
point where

1670
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,858
I feel confident enough that we can just

1671
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,019
you know

1672
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:33,058
throw everything into TC as long as it

1673
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:35,039
comes back with a clean lab test like

1674
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:36,480
for pathogens then then we're good to go

1675
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,338
so we'll probably shorten that down

1676
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,920
though yeah nice streamlining things

1677
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:43,380
then while we're on the topic what style

1678
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,659
of growing do you guys lean towards more

1679
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:48,059
are you salt guys organic what sort of

1680
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:50,279
medium you prefer give us the lowdown I

1681
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:52,559
run it's a blend

1682
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,019
um just organic and synthetic hybrid has

1683
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,940
always been you know I always think the

1684
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:57,960
best of both worlds grow everything in

1685
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:00,599
rockwool

1686
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,639
it's easy simple I always make the it's

1687
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,700
a dumb joke but you can't spill a rock

1688
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:08,239
wool Cube you know because I started in

1689
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:10,739
the soil like most people I ran cocoa

1690
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,719
and then once I started growing in in

1691
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:14,459
rockwool it was just

1692
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,379
it made more sense it was easier it was

1693
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:19,079
quicker I don't want to spend a ton of

1694
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,940
time worrying about the pots or the soil

1695
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:22,318
or this sort of that you know cleaning

1696
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,760
up messes like I want to be able to

1697
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,338
focus on

1698
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,440
the plant itself or like you know some

1699
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:30,058
of the other aspects but still keeping

1700
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,858
that organic element and bringing it

1701
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:34,200
into Rocco yeah and I still maintain

1702
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:35,818
some of the best weed me or anyone ever

1703
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,899
smoked was

1704
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:42,420
OG Kush grown in the grossest rock wall

1705
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,338
you have ever seen because it was filled

1706
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,380
with all kinds of organic crap and this

1707
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:50,099
and that and salts and for some reason

1708
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,440
like that's that's the magic so we run

1709
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,880
it's a product called exotic AG it's a

1710
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,380
salt based

1711
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,798
um product it's got a bunch of different

1712
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,640
biostimulants as well and then my homie

1713
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:04,798
Jasper has this company more and they do

1714
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:06,539
it's uh like a archaea bacteria so it's

1715
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:11,780
kind of like I mean it's like any

1716
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:11,779
beneficial but it's found in um

1717
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:27,899
free bacteria

1718
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,119
um and it can survive like 98 degrees C

1719
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,720
and like two pH and so it's like it's

1720
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,980
just a [ __ ] shit's bulletproof yeah

1721
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:36,899
uv's the only thing that kills it so it

1722
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,119
doesn't take over the planet but it yeah

1723
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,619
it eats it eats the algae off the rock

1724
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,660
wool so it keeps the Rockwell clean

1725
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,579
keeps the lines clean it's gangbusters

1726
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:47,098
just chelates everything but yeah the

1727
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:49,980
flavor the flavor on the Blended organic

1728
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:52,440
and synthetic is the only like that's

1729
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:55,380
the win period you know just straight

1730
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,019
straight salt grown is it's still good

1731
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,338
for the first like five days but I don't

1732
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:02,519
know what it is about the shelf life but

1733
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:04,798
it just drops and some stuff will hold

1734
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:06,599
longer than others but I've never had a

1735
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:10,139
run without you know some sort of Bio

1736
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:12,599
stimulants that was amazing and still

1737
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:14,519
tasted good you know weeks after you'd

1738
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:17,880
chopped it down

1739
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:20,099
yeah nice one and look crop steering is

1740
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,019
like the trendiest word in the industry

1741
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:23,039
at the moment what's your thoughts on it

1742
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:24,659
do you think it's just going to become

1743
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,099
like super commonplace and if you're not

1744
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,598
doing that particular style of

1745
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:30,240
production you just like sort of get

1746
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:33,240
pushed out of the market

1747
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:35,338
um to some degree yeah like it's it's

1748
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:38,459
scientifically sound it's it's highly

1749
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,900
functional it keeps the root Zone in the

1750
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,280
right conditions keeps the moisture in

1751
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,740
the right conditions it keeps the EC in

1752
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,298
the right conditions it you know it

1753
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:47,519
saves a ton of water

1754
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:49,798
it makes I I do it with everything it

1755
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,960
makes the most sense like it's you know

1756
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:53,338
I mean cannabis a lot candles people

1757
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,500
like to think that cannabis is super

1758
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:57,539
unique and special and no commercial AG

1759
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,480
you know has any relevance to it because

1760
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:02,579
it's its own thing but like that's you

1761
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,858
know I think that's a little naive

1762
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:06,900
like there's a lot to learn from large

1763
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:08,279
commercial operator and if that if it's

1764
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:12,240
functional and it works well then it's

1765
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:15,359
great people can overdo it like anything

1766
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:17,639
yeah look I noticed that you guys offer

1767
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:20,219
consulting services on your website so I

1768
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:22,139
wanted to ask you what some of the

1769
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:23,219
things that you think people commonly

1770
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:25,858
get wrong

1771
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:28,259
people over water their plants

1772
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:30,659
um people to feed their plants to high

1773
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,359
EC their light is too low their

1774
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:35,279
environment is off I mean it's you know

1775
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,558
like you can look at a room and diagnose

1776
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,559
five things that are wrong like in one

1777
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:42,480
and a half seconds right it's not

1778
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,220
it's very obvious and a lot of people

1779
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,400
they just don't they don't realize that

1780
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:49,558
all of these things need to work

1781
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,900
there's certain proportions I guess you

1782
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:54,119
would say that everything has to be at a

1783
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,980
certain level and if you change one then

1784
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,380
the others need to be adjusted

1785
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,420
for that you can't just change one thing

1786
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:03,720
and have everything else work well like

1787
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:05,639
it all works off of itself and off the

1788
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:07,679
other things so like

1789
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:09,900
if you have too much light your plants

1790
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,279
need more fertilizer because they can't

1791
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,139
eat the light well enough because they

1792
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,420
don't have enough nutrients but then

1793
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:17,519
they also need CO2 right it's just it's

1794
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:18,960
balancing at yeah it's the interplay of

1795
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,420
them all together one thing is out of

1796
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,179
whack you know it's like a

1797
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:26,700
um what if some gear in the cogs what's

1798
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:29,519
that phrase like a spanner in the engine

1799
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:31,259
sort of thing yeah like it's it's a kink

1800
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:33,538
it's like a race car the faster you

1801
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:35,280
drive the higher chance something could

1802
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:37,619
go wrong but the higher performance you

1803
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,720
could possibly have you know there's

1804
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,519
plenty of people who don't do anything

1805
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:43,439
crazy and they come out with great crops

1806
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,239
driving nice and slow in a Honda Civic

1807
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,798
but if you want you can really crank up

1808
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:49,558
all those parameters and get a race car

1809
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,759
it's just chance you're gonna crash man

1810
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:52,798
at the end of the day there's only so

1811
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,559
much carbon to go around right so you

1812
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:58,818
want to grow the biggest frostiest

1813
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:01,200
terpiest like pick two

1814
01:06:58,818 --> 01:07:02,038
you know like you can't you can't have

1815
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,439
it all

1816
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:06,180
and what what sort of an increase did

1817
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,740
you personally see when you switched to

1818
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:09,899
this style of production like how

1819
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:13,259
dramatic was the improvements

1820
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:15,480
I mean a lot like laughably so I mean

1821
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,460
we've started to see yields that

1822
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,199
I mean I wouldn't believe it if I didn't

1823
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,480
if we didn't have to legally like put

1824
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:23,578
those numbers in a metric you know like

1825
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,260
no one's no one's inflating their

1826
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:26,940
numbers into metrics you know what I

1827
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,859
mean right so when you start running

1828
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:32,818
some of these and you're like okay we're

1829
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:35,519
casually getting 75 80 like 90 grams a

1830
01:07:32,818 --> 01:07:38,400
square foot on these plants and we used

1831
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:41,038
to do the pounds per light math way back

1832
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:45,539
when and we're like we're in like a five

1833
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:48,539
pound range now which is just absurd on

1834
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:50,700
a 5x5 yeah 25 square foot which is back

1835
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:52,440
at least when I was running Des or HPS

1836
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:53,818
everything was on a five by five we

1837
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,500
didn't do four by fours until we started

1838
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:57,420
getting into LED

1839
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,460
well yeah that was going to be in my

1840
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,680
next question was that have you guys

1841
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,298
swapped to LED yet and I suspect the

1842
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,980
answer is yes so the follow-up question

1843
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:07,019
is what do you think about the people

1844
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:09,179
who are discussing and saying like oh

1845
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:11,038
it's not good I'm going to swap back do

1846
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:13,019
you think they need to dial it in more

1847
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:16,219
or do you think that the older lights

1848
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:19,738
may have something over the newer ones

1849
01:08:16,219 --> 01:08:22,500
the older spectrums well there's there's

1850
01:08:19,738 --> 01:08:25,198
kind of two schools of thought a lot of

1851
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:29,219
people are of any impression that some

1852
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:32,698
of the older lights had more or a

1853
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:34,798
different spectrum that contributed to

1854
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:36,000
different flavors higher yield this that

1855
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,600
the other

1856
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,539
um so it very well could be that the LED

1857
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,940
technology is not caught up or has not

1858
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:46,698
found and mimicked the best Spectrum

1859
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:50,039
just yet

1860
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:53,579
there's also the possibility that so

1861
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:56,100
epigenetics is uh you know a thing in in

1862
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:57,778
Plants where if they're grown under a

1863
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,239
certain environment or they exhibit a

1864
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:02,759
certain stressor they can change a

1865
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,218
little bit where ultimately a one Fino

1866
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,500
could suffer you know

1867
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:10,319
uh shift and then it will Express itself

1868
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:12,000
differently moving forward and forever

1869
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,759
basically one gene turns off and another

1870
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,198
one turns on so it's also quite possible

1871
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:19,619
that some of these varieties that were

1872
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:21,899
grown under that started to adopt more

1873
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:24,238
to that Spectrum like some of the older

1874
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,639
strands which is in the older ogs where

1875
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,539
you know you're throwing them under a

1876
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,338
new light they're not going to perform

1877
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:32,219
as well because they've become

1878
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:38,039
accustomed to This Light having been

1879
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:40,259
under it for I mean hell 20 30 years

1880
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:41,460
yeah no I it's interesting because I

1881
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,259
think we haven't really explored that

1882
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:45,359
epigenetic aspect have we and you get a

1883
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:47,219
lot of anecdotal experiences from

1884
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,739
Growers and breeders in the community

1885
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:52,079
who say you know vegging a plant

1886
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:54,718
outdoors for a season pulling it in

1887
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:57,539
before flower can sort of revitalize it

1888
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,939
so I mean it's it's there is anecdotal

1889
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:01,679
evidence out there of people saying that

1890
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:05,219
you can Revitalize and I think every

1891
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,359
grower can uh relate some anecdotal

1892
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:08,460
experience to a plant that's

1893
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:10,679
deteriorated in some less than ideal

1894
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:12,000
conditions they may have come across

1895
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:14,940
themselves

1896
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,198
I wanted to know though in terms of your

1897
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:18,059
room right

1898
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:21,839
let's just say you've dialed in all the

1899
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:23,179
aspects and on paper everything's like

1900
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,500
dialed in

1901
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:27,658
where where would you what sort of

1902
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,279
things do you think help differentiate

1903
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:31,079
producers at that point because

1904
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:33,000
obviously it's not all homogeneous you

1905
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:34,439
know you still get variation from grower

1906
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,359
to grower

1907
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,819
um what sort of aspects do you think

1908
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:41,579
come into play at that point is it is it

1909
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:43,559
down to like the type of LED Spectrum

1910
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:45,719
versus the the other guy's LED Spectrum

1911
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,760
or do you think there's tiny differences

1912
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:51,779
we may not pick up on

1913
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:54,480
I think the magic is you like for I I

1914
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:57,179
have a basic template right that I use

1915
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,859
for pretty much everything and the point

1916
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:01,500
of the template is not to exclusively

1917
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:03,059
use the template but when you're running

1918
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,979
different varieties it's to identify

1919
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,880
what changes in the template need to be

1920
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:08,459
made

1921
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,159
so that you can grow this plant to the

1922
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,158
best of its possible you know that's its

1923
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:15,960
best potential right so some are going

1924
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:17,639
to need a little more food and a little

1925
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,779
more light or someone need a little less

1926
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,280
and you know some are going to need to

1927
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:22,920
be watered less and it you know there's

1928
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:24,719
it's not it's easy to write like the

1929
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,399
crop steering recipe it's easy to write

1930
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,319
that down and say this is what you

1931
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:30,719
should do but if you follow that exactly

1932
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,759
the way that it's written the chances of

1933
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,739
you finding a ton of success or you know

1934
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,860
not super high it's going to need to be

1935
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:40,619
tweaked a little bit so the best Growers

1936
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:42,779
are the ones who know what to do know

1937
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:44,640
why what they do Works they don't do

1938
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:46,380
redundant things like that's really

1939
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,060
common you see people use especially

1940
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,440
with fertilizer and nutrients they use

1941
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,239
the same

1942
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,619
like two different bottles of the same

1943
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:54,539
active ingredient like the same thing

1944
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:57,059
and you're like

1945
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:58,920
what are you doing like what is why why

1946
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:01,199
are you doing this yeah you know this is

1947
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,480
the same right what what like yeah look

1948
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,339
so people who have

1949
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:07,198
who know exactly what they're doing know

1950
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:10,199
why they're doing it and can actually

1951
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:12,719
make one change at a time and see the

1952
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:14,399
adjustment because if you change like if

1953
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,560
you run the same experiment more than

1954
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:18,599
once you want to make a shift you have

1955
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,159
to only change one parameter because if

1956
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,560
you change more than one you don't know

1957
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:24,000
which one of those things it was and

1958
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,620
it's really hard to do experiments on

1959
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,520
living plants because no two runs are

1960
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:28,519
like exactly the same

1961
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,219
it's definitely it's definitely

1962
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,479
something where it's hot I've tried to

1963
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,939
explain this bill it's hard to do side

1964
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:37,678
by sides with plants because you have to

1965
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:39,419
do them in your same facility like even

1966
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,719
if we both took a clone from the plant

1967
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:43,859
today and took them to our respective

1968
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:45,779
locations and went from there like

1969
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,179
you're getting all this environmental

1970
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:49,679
change it's so even if you do them in

1971
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:51,359
the same room and you have two tables

1972
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,779
that are side by side

1973
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:57,000
it's not really a side by side because

1974
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:58,619
the the airflow's different airflow's

1975
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,779
different so you know like there's just

1976
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:03,539
it's literally impossible to have it be

1977
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:05,519
an exact one-to-one match all these

1978
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:07,979
variables do make a meaningful impact on

1979
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,360
the plant long term doesn't it yeah so

1980
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:10,619
you have to do it at a scale that's big

1981
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,539
enough to actually take like an average

1982
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,519
that's kind of the only way that makes

1983
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:16,439
sense right that's as close as you're

1984
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,940
ever going to get is where you've done

1985
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:19,500
because if you're only doing a few

1986
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,299
plants here or there like you don't have

1987
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,800
enough variation so you just how do you

1988
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,600
minimize the variation well have like

1989
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,239
enough of a population that you can take

1990
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,460
you know your average and see if they're

1991
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:31,319
different enough and if they're not then

1992
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,198
you know it depends on what you're

1993
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:35,519
looking for whether it is or it isn't is

1994
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:36,839
you know that that's the only thing

1995
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,420
that's relevant

1996
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:42,179
nice nice well

1997
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,800
let's get off the um the growing segment

1998
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:45,600
for a second and let's take a sniff of

1999
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,000
these jars we I mentioned it earlier and

2000
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,280
then we just totally moved on so let's

2001
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,738
start with the bath house I'm gonna take

2002
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:56,579
a big half of this

2003
01:13:52,738 --> 01:14:00,839
I get a lot of old school OG and by that

2004
01:13:56,579 --> 01:14:02,760
I mean not like TK but like maybe more

2005
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,239
like ghost or something it's got more

2006
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:10,140
earthy pininess to it maybe even a touch

2007
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:12,419
of like that eucalyptusy

2008
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:16,380
um really nice Cush

2009
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:18,300
yeah to me that's like super nostalgic I

2010
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:20,819
love that how would you guys describe it

2011
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:23,460
I definitely get gas you know it's got

2012
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:25,738
no sweetness which there's a few ogs

2013
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:27,539
that have a little bit of like a sweet

2014
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:29,158
aftertaste

2015
01:14:27,539 --> 01:14:31,439
um or on the sweeter side I always

2016
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:34,859
preferred you know

2017
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:37,919
pine tree salt water gas like just that

2018
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:39,719
deep this is the bath house by the way I

2019
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,800
can't remember if I mentioned that we

2020
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:42,119
have a swish that would mean that was

2021
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,159
part of the reason I picked swish is

2022
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:46,500
because it was just funky Gap and it has

2023
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:47,939
like a little bit of fruityness to it

2024
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,000
which sometimes comes through on some of

2025
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:53,460
them um but it's not like sweet fruit

2026
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,380
um it's hard to describe

2027
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,658
more of a

2028
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,579
like a diet fruit leather is that even a

2029
01:14:57,658 --> 01:15:03,000
thing

2030
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:06,658
yeah like a half is a sugar-free sweet

2031
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,800
fruit leather that's not made with fake

2032
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:10,619
sugar

2033
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,179
no I I love the fruit letters

2034
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:13,260
the next one I've got here how do I

2035
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:16,020
pronounce this I don't know how to say

2036
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:17,880
the second word London fish oh London

2037
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:20,780
beach oh I just I didn't I didn't have

2038
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:24,480
it lined up probably I was like oh shoot

2039
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:26,340
London [ __ ] cool I like that so this

2040
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,519
one's got more going on

2041
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:32,340
so that's the one in pound cake 75 by

2042
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,840
the swish yeah if you know you

2043
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,480
definitely get a little bit of gas but

2044
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,420
it's more

2045
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:41,639
eucalyptusy more like almost Citrus but

2046
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:44,760
not Citrus like a bit of like nasal

2047
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:47,760
flaringness yeah there's definitely like

2048
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,460
a bit more to it but it's like um

2049
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,640
different angles to the smell because

2050
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:55,500
yeah there's gelato lemonade uh I can't

2051
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,940
remember what the other crosses with the

2052
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,079
London pound cake

2053
01:15:56,939 --> 01:16:00,479
um

2054
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,059
but the yeah the lemon comes through a

2055
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:05,039
lot yeah the The Lemon Diesel has always

2056
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:07,679
been one of my my very favorite strains

2057
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,840
like we grew that way back when and it

2058
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,920
was always super funky and unique and

2059
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,079
different

2060
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,520
it wasn't very gassy it was like at the

2061
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:16,619
time we couldn't really sell it because

2062
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,300
it was cushy enough it wasn't like OG

2063
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:20,158
enough it had like a you know a

2064
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,079
different Funk to it

2065
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:25,559
um back in the day everyone just wanted

2066
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:28,198
gas like 50 different OG's on the menu

2067
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,179
you know comes in waves right I feel

2068
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:31,559
like we're getting back there so I mean

2069
01:16:30,179 --> 01:16:33,658
on that note next one we've got is the

2070
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,100
Geisha breath this one's interesting

2071
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:37,619
it's um it's got a few different things

2072
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:40,920
in it the Me Breath TK cherry pie

2073
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:42,960
gorilla glues wish I definitely get a

2074
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,940
bunch of this wish the gorilla glue and

2075
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,960
a little bit of the meat breath and the

2076
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:51,899
TK really unique sort of smell it's like

2077
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,880
it's cushy but it not so much gas here

2078
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:57,779
but there's a lot of other

2079
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,159
like sort of aromatic and earthy notes

2080
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,779
in there I can't put my finger on them

2081
01:16:59,158 --> 01:17:03,299
at all which is

2082
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:05,519
unusual for me we said it kind of smells

2083
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:08,340
like the dragon fruit refresher from

2084
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,420
Starbucks I haven't had that

2085
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,699
um yeah it's kind of got that like

2086
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:13,619
sourdy

2087
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:15,359
um edible makeup

2088
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:17,939
what do we call it animal vanilla

2089
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,859
smoothie yeah it's like a sourdie and

2090
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:21,839
then a softer part the animal smoothie I

2091
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:24,299
like that because yeah that gorilla the

2092
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,920
gorillas fire and then yeah the Cherry

2093
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,600
Pie on this I mean there weren't a ton

2094
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,699
of Finos on this the Cherry Pie Terps

2095
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,440
came through which was

2096
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:32,759
kind of a bummer

2097
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,339
um there was a few but it was a little

2098
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:38,640
it was too light but the meat breath the

2099
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,900
meat breath TK for sure comes through I

2100
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,239
mean the Cherry Pie comes through even

2101
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:44,939
like visually it comes through

2102
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:47,399
although this Stacks crazy hard it's

2103
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:50,460
super purple it's a giant purple Spears

2104
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:52,859
it's iced out so I mean as far as

2105
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:55,079
production goes it crushes and then it

2106
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:56,698
did I mean this Fino did like three and

2107
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:58,260
a half percent or four somewhere in

2108
01:17:56,698 --> 01:18:00,238
there like almost four percent which is

2109
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:02,219
you know for rosin production does

2110
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:04,799
really really well but for flower

2111
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:09,000
production this one bangs and they're

2112
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:13,380
super super potent like super Stony all

2113
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:16,020
this stuff on that note do you pay much

2114
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:18,779
weight or consideration to

2115
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,820
the ability for your strains to be

2116
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:22,979
purely flower produced or is there more

2117
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:25,799
focus on the concentrate potential so

2118
01:18:22,979 --> 01:18:27,658
like maybe the flowers are like you know

2119
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,940
not as great as we want but like it it

2120
01:18:27,658 --> 01:18:32,158
produces incredible concentrates so like

2121
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:35,698
that's the goal like how do you see that

2122
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,799
one uh the best ones you can find a

2123
01:18:35,698 --> 01:18:40,799
phenol that does or you can find more

2124
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,940
than one female and like I'll select a

2125
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,460
hash female and then I'll select a

2126
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:46,619
flower Fino that that's my favorite not

2127
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:48,300
all varieties will do that but some of

2128
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:51,779
them you can actually find really really

2129
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:55,320
really good flour flour Finos which they

2130
01:18:51,779 --> 01:18:56,880
have this my homie Watson Dustin who did

2131
01:18:55,319 --> 01:19:00,179
the uh the cold heat he always described

2132
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:03,300
it as like a rosebud sort of structure

2133
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:05,279
um I like to think of it more like uh

2134
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:07,340
what's that [ __ ] called

2135
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:07,340
um

2136
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:13,080
brussels sprouts where you just have

2137
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:14,460
these giant fully shaped nugs growing

2138
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:17,460
off this plant and instead of having

2139
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:19,380
this one huge homogeneous Cola which you

2140
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,060
can't break down and when you do it

2141
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,159
looks terrible right but if you have

2142
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,840
these like perfectly shaped flowers that

2143
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:26,219
just go all the way up the stem I think

2144
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,539
that's kind of my ultimate favorite but

2145
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:29,420
those are they don't wash as well

2146
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:32,698
because they're dense they don't open up

2147
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:34,619
so sometimes especially you find these

2148
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:36,119
more they really look like older kind of

2149
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:38,519
sativa ones where they're bigger they're

2150
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:41,819
more open they're a little airier which

2151
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,860
not structurally or visually appealing

2152
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:46,019
for like most people but in terms of

2153
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:48,059
hash production they bang if you're only

2154
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:50,520
ever going to grow this for hash or grow

2155
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:52,620
them hot a lot of CO2 I want them to

2156
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,440
Foxtail I want as much surface area as

2157
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:57,658
possible so we can get big numbers on on

2158
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,919
the watch where no one cares what the

2159
01:19:57,658 --> 01:20:01,920
flower is going to look like it's only

2160
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:05,039
ever going to be released as hash

2161
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,619
yeah incredible and what sort of

2162
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,779
varieties do you recommend for anyone

2163
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:12,238
who's listening right now who wants like

2164
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:14,460
a really good washer specifically out of

2165
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,319
your catalogs maybe from the upcoming

2166
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:18,300
line I mean I know they're all designed

2167
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:20,399
to wash well but what do you think if

2168
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,159
someone is like dude I I get the flower

2169
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:25,379
I immediately turn it into heads like

2170
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:28,500
what do you recommend cheetah chew

2171
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:30,840
washes really well the Terps are super

2172
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:33,238
fire I love the cheater chill

2173
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,579
um anything with that Lemon Diesel in it

2174
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:39,419
is killer it's got this

2175
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:42,119
lemon honey mustard peppery it's it's

2176
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,880
funky it's a weird smell uh but that one

2177
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:46,679
washed it like a little over four uh

2178
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,500
yeah the cheating shoes banging super

2179
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:51,539
purple gorgeous flower I've got a collab

2180
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,520
up in Washington right now so that's

2181
01:20:51,539 --> 01:20:55,260
going to be coming out actually people

2182
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,480
who are in Washington state will be able

2183
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:00,539
to go get flour and hash of the the

2184
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:02,639
cheetah chew here very very shortly

2185
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:06,539
the other one would be the the gummy

2186
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:08,940
that jelly Zona Zoda so both jelly

2187
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:12,060
donuts is a huge washer that Fino that

2188
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:14,339
we crossed is a monster and the Zoda

2189
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,320
that Fino of Zoda that I picked is

2190
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:19,079
another another washer four or five

2191
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:21,179
percenter so that one did

2192
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:25,679
what was that that was five or over five

2193
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:27,899
yeah it was big big washer a lot yeah so

2194
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,119
gummy will come out in January we

2195
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:33,420
haven't set a date yet but

2196
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:35,399
January I think the gummy is my my

2197
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:37,079
personal favorite of them they're all

2198
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:39,299
they're all amazing of the five people

2199
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:41,880
around but yeah the gummy hits that

2200
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:44,219
sweet spot for me it's like it's got gas

2201
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,960
but it's got a lot it reminds me in some

2202
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:48,600
ways of

2203
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,819
um the pine Soul cut of go gog from

2204
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,100
Bodhi it's just like it's like gassy but

2205
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:55,619
it's got this interesting beriness to it

2206
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,579
that comes out here in a unique way

2207
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,960
where it's not just like through the

2208
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:00,179
middle it's almost like around the size

2209
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,840
it's like gassy in the middle and then

2210
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:05,279
like this sort of more sophisticated

2211
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,560
perfuminess around the edges I I really

2212
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:11,579
like the gummy a lot yeah the gum is

2213
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:14,880
kind of like a like a acidic acai kind

2214
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:18,679
of you know Berry Floral

2215
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:22,380
you know grapey Skittles and then gas

2216
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:24,480
biscotti gas biscotti gas

2217
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:26,460
which is interesting because the Zoda

2218
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:30,299
cut that I that I use for all these

2219
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:32,760
crosses is uh the most offensive

2220
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,199
dead animal

2221
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,780
like

2222
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:39,299
yeah rotten dead animal

2223
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:41,519
at a truck stop that like had a bunch of

2224
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:44,100
you know oil spilled on it and it's just

2225
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,199
it's it's ranked and it's weird and it

2226
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,340
smells nothing like any of the parents a

2227
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:49,919
lot of the parents were a lot more

2228
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:51,960
fruity floral and kind of Sherby and

2229
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,300
kind of berry and then I was like I was

2230
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,219
almost certain that that seed I'd [ __ ]

2231
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:58,320
up cleaning the seeds and it had gotten

2232
01:22:56,219 --> 01:23:00,300
you know just from something else and

2233
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:02,158
then I grew it and I looked at like the

2234
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:05,039
photos like at the structure of it I was

2235
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:07,019
like well I mean it's definitely

2236
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,359
you know it's definitely soda like no

2237
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:11,100
question but this was one of

2238
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:12,719
I don't know it was like a hundred and

2239
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,219
hundred plus females that I looked at

2240
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,140
and this was the only one that smelled

2241
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:17,819
anything like this

2242
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:19,079
it was also the washer so it was kind of

2243
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:20,759
an easy choice

2244
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:23,039
yeah I wanted to know I was looking

2245
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,460
through your Instagram and I was sort of

2246
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:30,420
trying to get a sense for myself of like

2247
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:32,158
what's one strain would I guess you

2248
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:34,380
would be most known for so to speak and

2249
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,759
I thought the Zoda it appeared enough

2250
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:38,640
that I was like maybe it's in contention

2251
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,739
what strain do you think most represents

2252
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,940
the brand just in terms of like the

2253
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:44,158
Public's perception what do you think

2254
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:47,219
people most associate with you guys thus

2255
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:49,198
far I think Zelda for sure

2256
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:52,579
um Zelda's one of the the heavier

2257
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:55,139
producers that's in you know in rotation

2258
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:57,300
at the most

2259
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:59,280
you know wrecking bed shops and most

2260
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,840
Growers that was you know relatively big

2261
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,000
release

2262
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,100
um I mean I saw a seed pack of Zoda at

2263
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,619
auction cell for like five grand

2264
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:09,120
which is awesome it would have been

2265
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:11,519
super awesome if they shared some of

2266
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:13,679
that with me but hey you know

2267
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,679
the fact that it went for that which is

2268
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,600
outrageous is yeah [ __ ] awesome

2269
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:20,219
yeah look on that topic I noticed on

2270
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,840
your side there's probably only about

2271
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:23,698
three or four strains that are in stock

2272
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,860
by the looks of it I was wondering do

2273
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:28,919
you find it hard to keep up in terms of

2274
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:32,158
seed production matching the demand yes

2275
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,760
yes I do it is very difficult

2276
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:35,279
um

2277
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:38,579
yeah you know the The Feeding Frenzy

2278
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:41,579
that can sometimes occur is awesome but

2279
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:43,319
it's hard to keep up with and trying to

2280
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:45,658
make enough

2281
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:47,519
I mean really like having since I have

2282
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:48,960
to test everything and I'd have to grow

2283
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,580
it out and then I have to have it tested

2284
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,079
by the tester Network like the release

2285
01:24:50,579 --> 01:24:55,198
said it takes me a year a year and a

2286
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:57,679
half to do the release and 95 get cut

2287
01:24:55,198 --> 01:25:01,678
and if not more yeah well

2288
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:03,480
maybe yeah 95 90 95 of the stuff that I

2289
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,279
make just doesn't make it for whatever

2290
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:08,339
reason because it's not

2291
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:10,738
it's not good enough it's you know if it

2292
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:12,840
say I get a cut that makes it through

2293
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:14,579
quarantine makes it into rotation I grow

2294
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,319
it out it's like cool enough that I

2295
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:18,000
think maybe this will maybe this will do

2296
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,619
well we'll make the crosses of it we'll

2297
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,658
grow some of them out and then if

2298
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:24,599
they're kind of like I mean either they

2299
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:27,420
get discarded entirely or they get

2300
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:29,039
thrown back in the fridge for a rainy

2301
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:31,679
day like well maybe we'll come back to

2302
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:33,359
it in five years whatever and then stuff

2303
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:35,039
that hits that everyone you know

2304
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,698
everyone on the round table is excited

2305
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:40,800
about that's what makes it a release

2306
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:42,178
nice one and do you think that there'll

2307
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,739
ever come a time where you'll look to

2308
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:45,239
ramp up the production or do you think

2309
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:47,039
you'll always sort of keep it this small

2310
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:49,738
scale sort of vibe

2311
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:52,920
I mean probably ramp up to some degree

2312
01:25:49,738 --> 01:25:55,500
just to keep like as as the market gets

2313
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,539
bigger I want more people to be able to

2314
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:01,020
have and smoke more in unique different

2315
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:03,000
Terps but I do like

2316
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:04,920
that you know the community of people

2317
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,100
who grow Mommy it's like a smaller group

2318
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:11,279
of people who really you know appreciate

2319
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:14,039
what I'm trying to do and I think part

2320
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,059
of you know like I'd never got into it

2321
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:17,819
to make

2322
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:20,820
this giant mega seed Corp that is just

2323
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:23,099
gonna bang out the same variety over and

2324
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:24,299
over and over again that's it's been

2325
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,460
done

2326
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:29,279
there's people that want that and that's

2327
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:31,020
great but I want to make you know we'll

2328
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:34,259
keep it relatively small

2329
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:36,719
plus you know at one point I had like 30

2330
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:39,239
employees and that was uh it was really

2331
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,760
hard that was insanely difficult now

2332
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:44,759
it's you know being Harry a few others

2333
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,840
it's a lot easier to manage you know and

2334
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,900
having

2335
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:51,600
direct access and functionally doing all

2336
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:53,759
of the work makes more sense especially

2337
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,960
if I'm gonna put my name on it like I

2338
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,619
don't want the company to get too big

2339
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,420
where we like create something and I

2340
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:03,000
never grew any of it then it gets

2341
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:05,100
released and it's just like you've lost

2342
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,719
you've lost it you know

2343
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:09,539
the Personal Touch

2344
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:13,859
of it you've lost the

2345
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:16,979
yeah it's just not for me not for us

2346
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:19,559
yeah sure thing look you mentioned a few

2347
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:22,500
times that you'd done some co-labs and

2348
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:25,020
maybe even some in the future what

2349
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:27,179
collaborations do you have coming up and

2350
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,920
what sort who are some breeders who you

2351
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:31,139
want to do some collapse with

2352
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,539
let's see we've got some more super seed

2353
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:35,219
collabs coming up

2354
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:37,560
um I think we've got a couple Tiki

2355
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:38,579
collabs in the works what else we have

2356
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,139
going on

2357
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:42,719
the super seed is going to be the next

2358
01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:45,000
one to drop social soda yeah super seed

2359
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,500
Coco collab which I love I love super

2360
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,359
seeds they're

2361
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:51,238
we've done them for a long time tell me

2362
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:53,158
about that is it Seattle soda yeah tell

2363
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:56,698
me a bit about that strain that one's

2364
01:27:53,158 --> 01:28:00,899
out of control fire it is it's kind of

2365
01:27:56,698 --> 01:28:03,960
like a sherb esque sort of purple I mean

2366
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:05,939
it's a it's uh the UV perp

2367
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,460
um and so delicious which is another

2368
01:28:05,939 --> 01:28:10,738
cross that the holy made which has got

2369
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:12,779
like it's funny it has train wreck and

2370
01:28:10,738 --> 01:28:15,059
like lemon haze in it but it doesn't I

2371
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:18,179
don't get any of those flavors from it

2372
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:21,480
um but it's definitely yeah the Seattle

2373
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:23,520
soda is like a cushy grapey

2374
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:25,979
it's definitely fizzy it definitely has

2375
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,420
that like not it's not got the same

2376
01:28:25,979 --> 01:28:29,519
grape tarp that the Fizz has because

2377
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:33,060
that's like grape gas this is more like

2378
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,100
grape cream like uh

2379
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:37,739
like a grape creamy chapstick or

2380
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,940
something it's got this like and yeah I

2381
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:40,799
don't know if anyone remembers those

2382
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:43,559
like old flavored chapsticks it doesn't

2383
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,060
have that chapsticky waxy bit but it

2384
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:47,580
does have that definitely like kind of

2385
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:49,860
artificial grape with this uh I mean

2386
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:52,279
it's acidic right it's very like

2387
01:28:49,859 --> 01:28:54,539
prominent in the nose

2388
01:28:52,279 --> 01:28:56,279
you feel it like right up in your next

2389
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:57,600
your eyes you know like it's all up in

2390
01:28:56,279 --> 01:28:59,698
your sinuses

2391
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,239
that's cool and so when you're doing

2392
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:05,158
collabs do you ever consider like

2393
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:07,138
working those lines forward or is it

2394
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:09,479
generally more of like a one-off special

2395
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:11,940
thing because like you know like the

2396
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,559
fans can't really get it from you know

2397
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:14,939
the hybrid you can't get it from either

2398
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,100
Camp individually it has to be the

2399
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:18,419
collab or do you think that if you found

2400
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,699
something cool you'd like you'd just

2401
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:23,100
work it Forward yeah yeah for sure

2402
01:29:20,698 --> 01:29:24,899
because I would never for me it doesn't

2403
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:28,560
make sense to make the same crossover

2404
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:30,658
again but to make an F2 or a back Cross

2405
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,800
or any of that like that that's still

2406
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:34,559
open game

2407
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:36,420
you know I I think that's it's different

2408
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:40,260
enough it's not exactly the same thing

2409
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:41,699
so in terms of like my sort of rules for

2410
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:44,760
Umami that I like to follow that doesn't

2411
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:46,319
break a rule and it still helps to

2412
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,659
inject something different and unique

2413
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:50,880
and you can still dive in and hunt and

2414
01:29:48,658 --> 01:29:53,460
find if someone wants that exact same

2415
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,139
pheno they could find or if they want

2416
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,658
something else I kind of draw the line

2417
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:59,100
at s1s

2418
01:29:56,658 --> 01:30:01,279
I'm not really sure why I think I've

2419
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,280
just

2420
01:30:01,639 --> 01:30:07,679
yeah okay like I wouldn't do a Zoda S1

2421
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:09,658
for example and that's I if we did I'm

2422
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,219
sure they would well seed banks tell me

2423
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:15,479
all the time I should do that because it

2424
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:17,639
would do really well but I'm that's not

2425
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:19,859
I don't know that I'm not interested in

2426
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:21,420
that I'm not excited about that you know

2427
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:23,519
and I haven't done it enough where maybe

2428
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:25,079
I maybe if I do it and I find some super

2429
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,120
awesome phenos and it's like what have I

2430
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:28,859
been missing but there's so much you

2431
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:32,340
know there's so many other things that I

2432
01:30:28,859 --> 01:30:34,619
want to work on that's definitely on you

2433
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:37,139
know on the tail end of

2434
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:38,460
projects that we might uh we might go

2435
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:40,679
forward with

2436
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:42,960
sure sure a back cross is far more

2437
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:44,039
interesting to me yeah I can I can

2438
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,739
understand where you come from with that

2439
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:48,238
one for sure before we jumped into the

2440
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:49,859
interview we were talking about it and I

2441
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:52,079
had it as a question so we may as well

2442
01:30:49,859 --> 01:30:55,738
jump into it now but I wanted to ask you

2443
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:58,800
about your thoughts on sort of the the

2444
01:30:55,738 --> 01:31:00,839
conventions of naming strains because I

2445
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,300
notice a lot of your Australians have

2446
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,760
the words are or z in them because you

2447
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,380
know relating to the parentage do you

2448
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:10,020
find it hard to come up with names do

2449
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:12,060
you think you're gonna find it easy or

2450
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:13,860
is it just getting more infinitely

2451
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:16,020
harder to come up with names as each

2452
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:19,380
sort of year goes by

2453
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:21,920
depends on the the hybrid to be entirely

2454
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:24,300
honest sometimes they the name just

2455
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,100
materializes comes to you it's perfect

2456
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:29,340
you don't even really have to think

2457
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:30,960
about it it just presents itself I wish

2458
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,239
that was the case more often because

2459
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,460
normally there is a lot of effort

2460
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:38,399
expanded on figuring out a good

2461
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:39,239
applicable name for the thing that is

2462
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,939
unique

2463
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:44,519
doesn't step on anyone's toes hasn't

2464
01:31:41,939 --> 01:31:49,019
been used before and

2465
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:53,460
you know you like early on it was always

2466
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:55,020
like someone crossed uh black I think it

2467
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:57,480
was black uh

2468
01:31:55,020 --> 01:32:00,239
Black Widow and Jack Herrera and they

2469
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:02,099
called it Blackjack because right so but

2470
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,559
eventually we ran out of the ability to

2471
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:06,179
take both of the you know some

2472
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,920
combination of the name and there's only

2473
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:10,460
so many things that you are even

2474
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:14,039
remotely creative or like sound you know

2475
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:15,840
interesting enough to use so then we

2476
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:17,880
started doing a lot of the Z stuff

2477
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,319
because people and really I was a little

2478
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,819
against it early on so I'm like well

2479
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:23,279
that's kind of dumb like you know

2480
01:32:20,819 --> 01:32:24,359
whatever everyone's using the Z I was

2481
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:26,399
like well it

2482
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:28,619
you know from a scientific perspective

2483
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:31,198
it helps for people to have some

2484
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:33,000
familiarity with what is in the thing so

2485
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,039
if there's a z in there

2486
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,539
really it should have Skittles in it to

2487
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:39,060
some degree

2488
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:42,060
um but I think that's been like I did

2489
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:45,420
that more than I like so now I'm really

2490
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:47,039
trying to get more creative on naming

2491
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:50,399
but it takes

2492
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:53,279
a village literally so we'll have like

2493
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:55,319
10 or 12 people hang out smoke The

2494
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:58,380
Strain talk about it look at the

2495
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:59,939
genetics dive into the you know long

2496
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,800
history on the genetics and really like

2497
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:04,138
try and identify something that's unique

2498
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,420
and cool but it's so hard

2499
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:07,859
it's a hugely and I mean on the other

2500
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,440
end of it

2501
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:13,019
how do you feel the name game affects

2502
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:15,719
the commercial success of a strain do

2503
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,400
you feel like a catchy name is sort of a

2504
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:19,020
fundamental part of a strain really

2505
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:19,920
getting traction with the broader

2506
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:21,659
community

2507
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,539
absolutely

2508
01:33:21,658 --> 01:33:27,420
absolutely it does and some of them

2509
01:33:24,539 --> 01:33:30,899
especially if it's a smaller release

2510
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:33,600
where I like a name because it's funny

2511
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:35,479
like bath water for example you know

2512
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,860
like will bathwater sell at a shop

2513
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:40,079
possibly and one of the thoughts what

2514
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:43,500
we're naming stuff is like hey if if

2515
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:45,119
this is on the menu at a dispensary

2516
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,020
is someone ever going to want to smoke

2517
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,119
this

2518
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,960
it has to you know like the name has to

2519
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:51,738
be

2520
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:54,300
good enough that someone's interested or

2521
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:55,919
appealing in some way you know I think a

2522
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:58,079
lot of even like a lot of strains that

2523
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:02,239
are really really good they kind of fall

2524
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,238
off or you just end up renaming them

2525
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:07,559
yeah definitely look

2526
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,659
you have such a variety of unique

2527
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:12,360
strains in Your Arsenal I wanted to just

2528
01:34:09,658 --> 01:34:13,439
like basically interrogate you on a few

2529
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:16,198
of them to find out more because I'm

2530
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:19,559
just genuinely curious so

2531
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:21,479
um kiwi sure grab my eye on your website

2532
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,100
because I think you sort of said like

2533
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:26,039
it's maybe like a backseat or something

2534
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:28,800
like people aren't 100 sure what that

2535
01:34:26,039 --> 01:34:29,939
one is but I think you've made hybrids

2536
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,320
with it

2537
01:34:29,939 --> 01:34:32,399
um do you know do you have much info on

2538
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:34,198
that one

2539
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,539
I think you're talking about that was

2540
01:34:34,198 --> 01:34:37,919
from Tiki is that kiwi shirt cut and I

2541
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:40,380
think that was from the tiki Club so

2542
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:43,199
when we gave him our Sushi he headed to

2543
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:46,440
a clone only okay yeah I wasn't sure

2544
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:48,539
because yeah I sent him my zuchi cut

2545
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:50,039
our mail and then yeah yeah he had a

2546
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:51,719
bunch of his clones and he sent me one

2547
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:53,819
of his females and I reversed it and I

2548
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:56,579
made the Femmes and I sent him a mail

2549
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:59,460
and then he made the rags that zuchi

2550
01:34:56,579 --> 01:35:01,619
that zuchi male is bulletproof tell me

2551
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,380
about the zuchimao I've heard the name

2552
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:08,460
before what's it like as a strain

2553
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:11,039
so zuchi is let's see how to best

2554
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:15,000
describe the tsuchi the zuchi is a

2555
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:17,039
monster and I don't I never was a big

2556
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,139
fan of any of the females in that line

2557
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:22,859
that I found they were really good but

2558
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:28,020
nothing blew me away except the male the

2559
01:35:22,859 --> 01:35:31,500
male is this big monster stacky giant

2560
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:33,000
Cola making male that like I'm sure

2561
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,679
you've seen males that have like a lot

2562
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,960
of little bananas and they're like kind

2563
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:40,679
of sparse all the way up the top this

2564
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:42,658
makes giant bananas out of all of the

2565
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:45,060
pollen sacks like it makes like full it

2566
01:35:42,658 --> 01:35:46,619
looks like bananas made of little tiny

2567
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,480
bananas it's the craziest thing ever and

2568
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:50,340
it's just Iced Out from tip to toe yeah

2569
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:53,099
so when I found that mail

2570
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:55,619
I actually misidentified it as a female

2571
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,000
first time because it didn't look good

2572
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:58,380
it didn't have any male traits

2573
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,359
whatsoever when I was sexing the first

2574
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:03,179
population I was like okay cool and then

2575
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:04,979
I threw it in to a room

2576
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:06,719
um to test it out for flowering and then

2577
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:09,119
it turned into a male and I was like

2578
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,020
looking at it was all Frosty it was like

2579
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:11,819
well

2580
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:13,620
we're definitely keeping this cut you

2581
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:14,819
know that's going to be a definite win

2582
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:17,099
because I've been running that

2583
01:36:14,819 --> 01:36:20,639
generation for a while so that one

2584
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:24,179
started back on the original release of

2585
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:28,619
the Mac mint male pollinating all my

2586
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:31,199
stuff I found a male Froyo which was the

2587
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:33,840
Mac meant by the sunset sherb so it

2588
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:35,158
started started enactment that I made

2589
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,480
for Froyo

2590
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:41,819
then on the Froyo mail that was

2591
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:43,559
crossed a tube biscotti that became

2592
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:46,259
kentuchi

2593
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,820
and then I crossed that to Skittles that

2594
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:49,739
became zuchi

2595
01:36:47,819 --> 01:36:52,859
and then I found another male from that

2596
01:36:49,738 --> 01:36:54,000
crossed that to ailments that became

2597
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:55,859
swish

2598
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,539
and then I found the female from swish

2599
01:36:55,859 --> 01:36:59,399
who made the reversal so I've been

2600
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:03,359
working on that male like population

2601
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:06,119
since like 2016 2017. so I know

2602
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:09,119
everything about it like

2603
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:10,738
it's easy to pair stuff now because I I

2604
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:12,238
know exactly what it's going to do yeah

2605
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:14,939
I know exactly what the females I'm

2606
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:17,279
looking for are and it's I guess it's

2607
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:19,198
Bulletproof that's cool that you've like

2608
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,139
continued on the project in that regard

2609
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:24,899
you got me wondering in general do you

2610
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:26,940
have a specific process or traits you

2611
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:28,920
look for When selecting a mail or is it

2612
01:37:26,939 --> 01:37:31,079
more like a certain one just sort of

2613
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,158
speaks to you

2614
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:34,319
um

2615
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:37,500
it definitely speaks to you

2616
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:39,179
they a lot of people think stem rub is

2617
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,800
something to go off of

2618
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:42,119
kind of gone back and forth on it I

2619
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,039
don't think it's really

2620
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:45,779
like it doesn't give me enough of an

2621
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:47,219
indication one way or another I've had

2622
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:49,019
plenty of things that had no stem rub

2623
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:51,060
that came out really really good and you

2624
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:54,960
know the other way around as well

2625
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:56,219
um selecting males for me primarily was

2626
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,579
vigor

2627
01:37:56,219 --> 01:38:02,219
structure

2628
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:05,960
no signs of flowering in veg any

2629
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:08,279
Autoflower tendency is gone I can't do

2630
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:10,260
anything that has any like hardcore

2631
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:12,479
Autoflower tendency in my because I'm

2632
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:15,539
not growing out of flowers not viable

2633
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:17,218
for me so none of that

2634
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:18,600
structure like I said I mean structure

2635
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:20,460
so like veg structure and then flower

2636
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:23,060
structure like what's its stack what's

2637
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:25,739
the stretch look like and then

2638
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:27,719
ideally this doesn't all not always the

2639
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:29,939
case and not necessarily indicative of a

2640
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:33,600
male that's kind of you know when you

2641
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:36,000
Awards or you know destroy destroy chef

2642
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,280
and just be [ __ ] killer is uh Frosty

2643
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,300
Frosty males because I've had males that

2644
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:42,238
have tested

2645
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:44,460
seven nine ten percent

2646
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:46,138
which they're iced out there's tricones

2647
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:49,980
all over them have you ever tried to

2648
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:53,340
smoke them no I would probably die I'm

2649
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:55,738
deathly allergic to pollen I've had

2650
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:58,920
um what's hay fevers I was a kid yeah

2651
01:38:55,738 --> 01:39:02,879
yeah so all pollen I'm allergic to and

2652
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:06,539
then cannabis pollen I uh I have to wear

2653
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:09,480
my like big giant respirator that like

2654
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:11,579
covers my eyes too and I'll wear like a

2655
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:13,439
tie deck and then I will literally like

2656
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:15,179
walk that hole after I'm done

2657
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:17,579
pollinating or like cleaning seeds or

2658
01:39:15,179 --> 01:39:20,279
whatever I'll walk that whole rig in

2659
01:39:17,579 --> 01:39:22,380
like under like a shower and I'll like

2660
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,899
rinse myself down and try and like knock

2661
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:26,819
the pollen down after having taken a

2662
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:28,859
bunch of like Benadryl or whatever

2663
01:39:26,819 --> 01:39:31,319
because it'll just yeah I could never

2664
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:33,960
smoke a male I would probably die yeah

2665
01:39:31,319 --> 01:39:35,698
look understandable I um I had a few

2666
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,219
more unique females I wanted to ask you

2667
01:39:35,698 --> 01:39:40,319
some questions about I wanted to ask you

2668
01:39:38,219 --> 01:39:43,380
about the lemon pepper that sounded very

2669
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:45,119
unique lemon pepper is super fire so

2670
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:49,319
that is a I didn't make that one that's

2671
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:50,039
a cut that I got from my homie from the

2672
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:52,799
network

2673
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:57,000
and the lemon pepper is one of the only

2674
01:39:52,800 --> 01:40:00,300
strains that smells exactly like what

2675
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:03,359
lemon pepper smells like it's super

2676
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:06,320
super floral and this like lemon mustard

2677
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:08,819
Funk that also is really really peppery

2678
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:11,279
it doesn't have hardly any bag appeal

2679
01:40:08,819 --> 01:40:12,719
it's like a really ugly plant which is

2680
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:16,019
kind of unfortunate because the Terps

2681
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:20,579
are out of control but it breeds really

2682
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:23,940
really well and probably 75 of the the

2683
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:27,600
progeny look amazing but you do get like

2684
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:29,519
25 percent that are ugly as hell they're

2685
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,560
big but the lemon berry what we made out

2686
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,600
of the lemon pepper the the cross that

2687
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:36,719
we did the ugly one was the tastiest one

2688
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:40,020
the ugly yeah the lawn clipping one like

2689
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:42,239
I I saw the Fino I discarded it I was

2690
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:44,460
like this thing is so horrible looking

2691
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:46,439
it's the ugliest thing ever but I had a

2692
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:48,719
couple ounces so like everything else we

2693
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:50,960
dried it threw into bags and then yeah

2694
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:54,719
the lemon Dairy number three

2695
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,920
how I wish I I'll find that Fino again I

2696
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,060
just gotta hunt through the seeds but

2697
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,219
that was

2698
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:01,080
the ugliest I mean literally look like

2699
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:02,698
lawn clippings like it was horrible

2700
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:04,500
looking and I didn't trim it and we

2701
01:41:02,698 --> 01:41:07,198
smoked that stuff and it was

2702
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:08,158
amazing like the most lemon like actual

2703
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:10,799
lemon

2704
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:12,179
people describe Jack as lemon I kind of

2705
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,039
get like a little upset about that

2706
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:15,420
because I don't like there's a lot of

2707
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:17,698
strains that are like lent like true

2708
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:19,560
lemon like lemon peel yeah like not like

2709
01:41:17,698 --> 01:41:21,839
the sweet zesty but the like more like

2710
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,400
funky lemon yeah like bitter with the

2711
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,139
pith and all that yeah

2712
01:41:23,399 --> 01:41:28,799
that's interesting you got me wondering

2713
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:30,179
what's the most memorable terpene you've

2714
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,760
ever smelled like when you think in your

2715
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:34,260
mind like what's just if I say what's

2716
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,760
the craziest term so you know what I

2717
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:38,699
mean like what jumps to mind for you

2718
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,560
first there was a The Strain way back

2719
01:41:38,698 --> 01:41:42,960
when I don't actually remember what it

2720
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:45,560
was it was some diesel cross uh but it

2721
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:48,359
tasted exactly like dryer sheets

2722
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,699
exactly like dryer sheets and I had like

2723
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:53,698
maybe two grams of water hash that I got

2724
01:41:50,698 --> 01:41:56,399
at the emerald cup and I smoked

2725
01:41:53,698 --> 01:41:58,399
the tiniest abs of that for like six

2726
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:02,279
months

2727
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:05,839
I will look until the day I die and find

2728
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:08,099
that same turp profile again but

2729
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,719
like if you just crunched up a bunch of

2730
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:11,880
dryer sheets and started chewing on them

2731
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:13,560
that is what it tasted like it was

2732
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:16,560
amazing

2733
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:18,900
so weird so delicious

2734
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,520
interesting and it gets we sort of get

2735
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:22,799
into this territory of like do you think

2736
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:26,100
that the strain's name should at least

2737
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,719
try to accurately represent the flavor

2738
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,880
profile or do you think like it doesn't

2739
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:32,219
really matter

2740
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:35,100
um I think I don't think it matters that

2741
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:37,560
much I think it's very difficult

2742
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:40,679
to not make it

2743
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:42,600
if you only Chase those types of names

2744
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:45,840
that will make more sense on the

2745
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,920
description than everyone like a lot of

2746
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,000
the names are going to be really the

2747
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,800
same because a lot of the flavor

2748
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,380
profiles are pretty similar so like how

2749
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,500
do you differentiate the thing

2750
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:58,139
it's it's tough you know we need to have

2751
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:01,139
the more people get into

2752
01:42:58,139 --> 01:43:03,659
like higher end products and like one of

2753
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:04,739
the things legalization in Vegas did

2754
01:43:03,658 --> 01:43:06,359
which

2755
01:43:04,738 --> 01:43:08,399
is kind of interesting is that they have

2756
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:10,439
mandatory terp testing on everything so

2757
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:12,179
a lot of people they won't necessarily

2758
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:14,879
only look at the Canterbury profile

2759
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:17,940
they'll look at the terpene profile and

2760
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:21,779
like though the the terpene profile is

2761
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:24,299
about as unique as anything else like if

2762
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:26,819
you wanted to map genetics you can just

2763
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:29,639
as easily map them with their terpene

2764
01:43:26,819 --> 01:43:33,359
profile ratio as you can with like their

2765
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:35,900
jeans yeah or at least like you know for

2766
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:39,420
for our purposes it's close enough

2767
01:43:35,899 --> 01:43:42,179
so I'm hoping we have like enough like

2768
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:44,219
Flavor indicators or something else that

2769
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:45,840
people could look at and say okay I have

2770
01:43:44,219 --> 01:43:48,420
kind of a good idea as to what that

2771
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:51,360
these are flavors that I like so I could

2772
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:54,480
make a selection based off of those

2773
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:56,698
parameters not just based off the name

2774
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,799
yeah look that's really interesting like

2775
01:43:56,698 --> 01:44:00,419
the way the Market's going to evolve to

2776
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,739
influence the way they select things and

2777
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:03,719
I noticed on your website you had

2778
01:44:01,738 --> 01:44:05,939
something really unique on the pineapple

2779
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:07,980
soda description you sort of talked

2780
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:10,618
about the different flavors you get from

2781
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:11,638
your puffco at different temperatures I

2782
01:44:10,618 --> 01:44:13,079
actually thought this was really cool it

2783
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:15,179
was kind of Novel I hadn't really seen

2784
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:17,819
it before do you think providing this

2785
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:20,158
extra sort of focus description maybe

2786
01:44:17,819 --> 01:44:22,139
Focus towards like concentrates given

2787
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,759
that's what you guys breed for

2788
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:25,380
um do you think that'll become like a

2789
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,699
more normal thing going forward or is

2790
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:29,940
that just like a fun little thing you

2791
01:44:26,698 --> 01:44:32,279
did for that one that was Harry yeah I

2792
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:34,500
mean we try to incorporate more of the

2793
01:44:32,279 --> 01:44:36,059
hash before the seed drops now so like

2794
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,859
all these flavors in front we already

2795
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:39,719
have them in big hash production because

2796
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:41,579
we want people to know exactly what it

2797
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:44,158
can do what's a reasonable hash number

2798
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:46,500
like how can you move forward so

2799
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:47,939
yeah having that and then yeah some

2800
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,939
things definitely have different flavors

2801
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:54,178
depending on the heat that you hit it at

2802
01:44:50,939 --> 01:44:56,158
so like between 400 Degrees to like 550

2803
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:58,079
might be a totally different experience

2804
01:44:56,158 --> 01:45:00,960
and like you might be able to really

2805
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:02,219
taste it more at the 400 but that higher

2806
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,139
heat can give you like some different

2807
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:06,239
flavors you might be missing in a

2808
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:07,980
different way depending on like what

2809
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:10,019
temperature those Terps burn at I'm

2810
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:12,059
assuming but I mean have you noticed

2811
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:14,760
that oh yeah that definitely different

2812
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:18,360
Terps have different boiling points and

2813
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:19,380
if they flash off too quickly then you

2814
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:22,079
only get

2815
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:25,079
some portion of the the total chirping

2816
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:26,698
profile so temperatures is very

2817
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:28,679
dependent

2818
01:45:26,698 --> 01:45:30,779
um on Flavor I guess I should say flavor

2819
01:45:28,679 --> 01:45:33,060
is very dependent on temperature

2820
01:45:30,779 --> 01:45:34,259
yeah look definitely and you just

2821
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,940
reference like you know having these

2822
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:38,820
strains in production before the seed

2823
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:42,359
drops happen what's your sort of ideas

2824
01:45:38,819 --> 01:45:44,519
on the breeding in sorry on the testing

2825
01:45:42,359 --> 01:45:46,618
landscape in terms of do you just prefer

2826
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:48,300
to do it all in-house do you ever give

2827
01:45:46,618 --> 01:45:50,219
stuff out to the public and say send us

2828
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:52,020
your results and do you think it's

2829
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:53,340
possible to test everything in the

2830
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:55,320
current breeding landscape because a lot

2831
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:57,420
of other guests have sort of said it

2832
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:58,738
moves so fast like maybe you can test a

2833
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:01,079
few things and be like you know what

2834
01:45:58,738 --> 01:46:02,519
this male seems pretty solid but

2835
01:46:01,079 --> 01:46:04,859
sometimes it might be hard to test

2836
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:07,380
absolutely everything where do you fall

2837
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:10,079
in terms of your beliefs on testing

2838
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:12,539
well the product has the name on it

2839
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:14,579
right a lot of that

2840
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:17,340
like the brand I want I always want the

2841
01:46:14,579 --> 01:46:19,559
brand to have integrity and

2842
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:22,319
so if I'm going to release something

2843
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,940
we're going to drop something it has to

2844
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,158
be

2845
01:46:23,939 --> 01:46:28,379
it has to have integrity and it has to

2846
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:32,519
have been tested and it has to you know

2847
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:35,819
sort of fit within the the values of

2848
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:37,199
umami Terps and so we test everything we

2849
01:46:35,819 --> 01:46:40,979
release

2850
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:42,839
ourselves myself and you know in-house

2851
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:45,019
we also send it out we've got like a

2852
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:48,000
pretty big tester Network on Discord now

2853
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:49,920
uh and we've got a good set of people

2854
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,560
who are really really capable and really

2855
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,118
you know able to give us an accurate

2856
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:56,219
look at what

2857
01:46:54,118 --> 01:46:59,099
someone who might receive a pack of

2858
01:46:56,219 --> 01:47:01,618
seeds is going to experience so

2859
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:04,980
that's very helpful to know how they're

2860
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:06,420
going to do because sure I bred them uh

2861
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:08,339
we're gonna be able to grow them

2862
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:11,100
really well

2863
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:12,480
will someone else who doesn't have the

2864
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,380
same setup doesn't have the same

2865
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:14,638
knowledge

2866
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,779
it's going to grow in a different media

2867
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,118
it's going to grow under a different

2868
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:20,519
light like I they need to they need to

2869
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:23,939
be workable for enough people where then

2870
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:26,400
we can release release something so

2871
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:30,238
yeah everything gets gets tested

2872
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:31,618
and ideally we do everything in-house

2873
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:33,118
forever

2874
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:36,960
which

2875
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:38,579
it's I mean there's a lot to do so you

2876
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,198
know I don't as long as it all gets

2877
01:47:38,579 --> 01:47:43,198
tested and I have multiple people

2878
01:47:40,198 --> 01:47:45,479
running it at you know at least a large

2879
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:48,238
enough population where I know there's

2880
01:47:45,479 --> 01:47:50,279
not going to be any major issues

2881
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:54,059
because I don't see how you can last in

2882
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:56,399
the space if you have a major flop you

2883
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:58,739
know if you do a drop and everything

2884
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:00,539
harms and there's a million problems

2885
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:03,000
then like

2886
01:48:00,539 --> 01:48:05,100
was it worth it to do the drop

2887
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,179
or would it have been worth it to maybe

2888
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:09,020
wait

2889
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:12,480
six months a year and then do the Drop

2890
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:16,260
Like is is being first with the latest

2891
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:17,599
whatever that important and for us it's

2892
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:20,520
not

2893
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:22,739
plus I I can't because I have to make

2894
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,619
you know a hybrid or create something

2895
01:48:22,738 --> 01:48:26,939
else and then run the you know grow them

2896
01:48:25,618 --> 01:48:29,819
out which why it takes like a year and a

2897
01:48:26,939 --> 01:48:33,299
half before we have a release but then I

2898
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:37,799
have all of 2023 and the first two

2899
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:39,300
quarters of 2024 already mapped out

2900
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,380
so that's why when I was saying some of

2901
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:42,900
those land races aren't going to come

2902
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:45,960
until 24 25 because that's the next

2903
01:48:42,899 --> 01:48:47,579
available time they can come out

2904
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:49,319
that's interesting I like that it's

2905
01:48:47,579 --> 01:48:51,539
mapped out you've definitely got to have

2906
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:52,920
a goal to be able to reach it I wanted

2907
01:48:51,539 --> 01:48:56,238
to ask specifically you know you guys

2908
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:58,679
have got an impressive uh 28 Cup wins

2909
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,419
what's it like to have that level of

2910
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:02,520
competition success and does it result

2911
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:03,779
from you guys submitting stuff or is it

2912
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,760
from like people who have bought your

2913
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:07,679
gear and then they've submitted it so

2914
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:10,139
I'm actually really proud to say that is

2915
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:12,600
all collaborative works with people

2916
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:15,060
growing Umami genetics and then

2917
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,199
submitting them to shows and winning you

2918
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:18,480
know and that's I mean that's the

2919
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:21,539
coolest thing ever right the one that

2920
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:23,399
they can take something that it's very

2921
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:26,158
proof positive that what I've worked on

2922
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:28,920
some of those flavors are awesome

2923
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:31,079
because I like them but does the

2924
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:32,940
community like them are they workable

2925
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:33,779
enough that you know someone's going to

2926
01:49:32,939 --> 01:49:34,979
grow

2927
01:49:33,779 --> 01:49:36,359
there's a lot of different people that

2928
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:37,919
make seeds there's a lot of you know

2929
01:49:36,359 --> 01:49:41,219
there's a lot of Great Cuts out there so

2930
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:43,440
that had enough to stand on its own to

2931
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:45,960
make it through anyone's selection

2932
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:48,839
process of staying around and then be

2933
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:51,300
the entry and then be the entry that

2934
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:52,980
took first second or third it's like

2935
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,960
it's killer

2936
01:49:52,979 --> 01:49:57,238
that's amazing so I mean on that note

2937
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:59,279
what advice would you give to someone

2938
01:49:57,238 --> 01:50:01,859
who's sort of interested in getting into

2939
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:03,300
breeding how would you advise them in

2940
01:50:01,859 --> 01:50:04,920
terms of like you know what to do and

2941
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,560
what not to do

2942
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:09,779
just start

2943
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:12,360
just start making making crosses make

2944
01:50:09,779 --> 01:50:14,819
hybrids hot seeds find something cool

2945
01:50:12,359 --> 01:50:15,899
probably give them out at first see if

2946
01:50:14,819 --> 01:50:18,420
you can get some people to grow them for

2947
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:21,118
you yeah you know find I mean it's going

2948
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:23,460
to be easier if you know someone who has

2949
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:25,920
like any sort of scale who can grow who

2950
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:28,920
can help get you off the ground because

2951
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:31,500
it is I mean unless you have a ton of

2952
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,679
money uh it's not an easy thing to break

2953
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:37,920
into especially now where the demand I

2954
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:39,420
mean the requirements for people

2955
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:41,940
producing seeds or people running

2956
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:43,980
genetics are so high they've never been

2957
01:50:41,939 --> 01:50:47,158
higher they want

2958
01:50:43,979 --> 01:50:50,158
biggest strongest frostiest terpiest

2959
01:50:47,158 --> 01:50:52,019
that and you're just like you know to

2960
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:54,118
you have to have you have to start with

2961
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:57,179
those genetics as well right you can't

2962
01:50:54,118 --> 01:50:59,039
just find whatever [ __ ] off gear at your

2963
01:50:57,179 --> 01:51:00,480
local dispensary and then like make a

2964
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:03,960
cross and think that that's gonna like

2965
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:05,459
run like you if you want to put your kid

2966
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,960
and you know if you want your kid to be

2967
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,760
a D1 athlete you better make sure like

2968
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,219
you're a D1 athlete and your wife is a

2969
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:13,079
D1 athlete

2970
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:15,600
yeah genetics definitely probably the

2971
01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:18,658
biggest factor in the sort of success of

2972
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:21,000
a newbie grow so on that topic what

2973
01:51:18,658 --> 01:51:22,920
genetics excite you what do you want to

2974
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,260
get into next

2975
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:27,300
well I'm kind of diving back into some

2976
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:29,340
of the old the old school right I got a

2977
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:30,659
lot of the OG's back

2978
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:33,420
um we're popping a lot of land race

2979
01:51:30,658 --> 01:51:35,039
stuff trying to find

2980
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:38,579
I mean there's there's sort of this

2981
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:40,979
homogeneous structure and terp profile

2982
01:51:38,579 --> 01:51:42,539
that has become

2983
01:51:40,979 --> 01:51:46,259
you know

2984
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:48,539
very popular now which is great signal

2985
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:51,119
for me to start to shift away from that

2986
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:53,399
and find something else I've always

2987
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:57,000
tried to find like our own lane

2988
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:58,738
still close enough that it's you know an

2989
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,560
easy

2990
01:51:58,738 --> 01:52:03,000
uh easy move for people to go from where

2991
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,199
they're at to you know where I want to

2992
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,819
be

2993
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:07,799
um but the last thing you want to do is

2994
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:09,960
go like too far left or too far right

2995
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:12,000
where you're just like super excited

2996
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:13,079
about some flavor profile and like no

2997
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,179
one else is

2998
01:52:13,079 --> 01:52:17,158
which is fine for small projects and

2999
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:19,440
like just for for you and your friends

3000
01:52:17,158 --> 01:52:20,638
or whatever but if you actually want to

3001
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,219
impact like

3002
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,199
the the space right the whole because

3003
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:28,198
it's a global Community right I mean

3004
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:30,599
that's 28 event like worldwide and like

3005
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:32,698
10 of those are in South America or

3006
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:34,139
seven or in South America that we you

3007
01:52:32,698 --> 01:52:37,319
know my homie we're doing a collab with

3008
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:39,539
uh Suga seeds and they've been winning

3009
01:52:37,319 --> 01:52:42,118
every event that they enter

3010
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:43,618
which is you know there's not as much

3011
01:52:42,118 --> 01:52:45,420
competition down there

3012
01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:47,039
you know and having West Coast genetics

3013
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:48,600
certainly certainly helps so it's going

3014
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:50,639
to be exciting when there's a lot you

3015
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:53,520
know higher level of competition and we

3016
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:55,319
can still you know compete win and it's

3017
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,119
fun the events are fun

3018
01:52:55,319 --> 01:52:58,799
no you touched on an interesting point

3019
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:00,238
because it's like it's one thing to make

3020
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,159
a cross but then it's another thing to

3021
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:03,839
actually have people want to grow it out

3022
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:06,599
and want to grow it out maybe around the

3023
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,860
world and I guess you're giving me a

3024
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:10,260
good opening to ask this question

3025
01:53:07,859 --> 01:53:11,460
because I do want to ask you like do you

3026
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:13,679
think you would ever breed something

3027
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:16,139
without cookies in it in the sense that

3028
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,420
like do you think like a project like

3029
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:20,340
that could really succeed or do you

3030
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:22,618
think like these days like it's sort of

3031
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:24,119
you're not really playing to the market

3032
01:53:22,618 --> 01:53:25,738
so to speak

3033
01:53:24,118 --> 01:53:28,500
I mean

3034
01:53:25,738 --> 01:53:33,178
to breed something that doesn't have any

3035
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:35,100
cookie genetics in it at all is

3036
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:36,600
I mean there's still plenty of crosses

3037
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:38,340
that I've you know that I've made that

3038
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:40,860
don't have don't have cookies in it and

3039
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:43,800
I've got so there's fridges full of

3040
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:45,359
stuff we've never released because it

3041
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:48,000
wasn't necessarily the right time the

3042
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:50,759
market wasn't in the right place uh

3043
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,639
you know that said there's how many you

3044
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:56,460
know it eventually becomes a backbone to

3045
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:58,380
some degree right just like OG like some

3046
01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:00,600
of these other like you know oh is

3047
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:02,340
anyone gonna stop breeding with like

3048
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,560
anti genetics or like you know

3049
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:07,319
eventually when you go all the way back

3050
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:09,060
I I wonder in 20 years is it going to be

3051
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:12,000
like NL or it's like nl's just in

3052
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:14,039
everything it's just accepted it's yeah

3053
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,198
right it's just like I I think we're

3054
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:18,539
just it's too early to be able to look

3055
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:20,879
back and go oh that's just the new

3056
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:22,859
paradigm that's just because there was

3057
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,440
probably a bunch of afghanis got wiped

3058
01:54:22,859 --> 01:54:27,420
out by no and people were probably not

3059
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:29,279
happy about it but now it's just like it

3060
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:31,380
is what it is and when cookies is

3061
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:32,880
however many generations back it

3062
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:35,639
comprises

3063
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,260
what percentage you know very very small

3064
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:40,079
ultimately

3065
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:42,000
you know you can get that down to 20 you

3066
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:44,340
know 20 of the genetics five percent of

3067
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,979
the genetics it doesn't take that long

3068
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:49,860
yeah true true and then it's merely one

3069
01:54:46,979 --> 01:54:51,238
small fraction in you know this big poly

3070
01:54:49,859 --> 01:54:53,279
hybrid that's just like a structural

3071
01:54:51,238 --> 01:54:55,799
component or something almost yeah so I

3072
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:57,539
wanted to ask you I've been weirdly

3073
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:59,579
feeling not weirdly but like it sort of

3074
01:54:57,539 --> 01:55:01,859
surprised me I get the vibe that like

3075
01:54:59,579 --> 01:55:04,380
Sunset sherb and gelato are like making

3076
01:55:01,859 --> 01:55:07,019
a comeback do you guys get that Vibe am

3077
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:09,719
I out of touch or is it the children

3078
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:11,880
um I always like sure the Sun the sunset

3079
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,618
shirt was one of my favorites of all

3080
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:16,139
time for the first time I smelled it

3081
01:55:13,618 --> 01:55:17,639
still one of my all-time favorites

3082
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:19,079
um I will smoke that

3083
01:55:17,639 --> 01:55:20,279
forever

3084
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:21,420
but

3085
01:55:20,279 --> 01:55:23,939
I don't know here what do you think

3086
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:25,500
people are getting more back into

3087
01:55:23,939 --> 01:55:27,419
I think it's just been around and it's

3088
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:29,340
gonna stay around it's just it's such a

3089
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:31,980
good flavor profile especially for

3090
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:33,779
someone who's just getting into cannabis

3091
01:55:31,979 --> 01:55:35,399
like it's almost like having them smell

3092
01:55:33,779 --> 01:55:37,800
of Tangy when someone doesn't really

3093
01:55:35,399 --> 01:55:40,079
know like they can only describe

3094
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,639
cannabis as smelling like like weed like

3095
01:55:40,079 --> 01:55:43,198
they like I don't know it smells like a

3096
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:45,359
plant but if you can give some like a

3097
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:47,158
real like Tangy orange you're like oh I

3098
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:48,839
think I can smell the orange in that I

3099
01:55:47,158 --> 01:55:51,000
feel like with like a good gelato or a

3100
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:53,100
sherb when you smell that bag it's like

3101
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,100
whoa I can actually smell some like

3102
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:58,440
sweet like candy like this is different

3103
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:00,119
this isn't this isn't just weed you know

3104
01:55:58,439 --> 01:56:02,039
so I feel like for that reason it's just

3105
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:03,539
always going to stay around but I also

3106
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:05,519
love shirt like

3107
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:07,979
I mean there's troops maybe a desert

3108
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,659
island strain for me there's Staples and

3109
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:12,599
the people people get to decide what

3110
01:56:09,658 --> 01:56:14,638
becomes a staple and what falls out

3111
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:16,320
yeah fully fully while we're on the

3112
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,600
topic of gelato I wanted to ask you

3113
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:20,519
Lemon Cherry gelato another like hot

3114
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:23,460
name in the community a lot of people

3115
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:25,860
talk about it just being runs but then I

3116
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:28,020
talk to other Growers who are like

3117
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:29,698
actual Growers and they're like oh I've

3118
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,920
grown them side by side they look a

3119
01:56:29,698 --> 01:56:34,859
little different what do you guys think

3120
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:37,079
well I've grown The Lemon Cherry I've

3121
01:56:34,859 --> 01:56:40,139
grown white runts

3122
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:43,439
two different cuts of runts pink runts

3123
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:45,600
I mean who's to say what is actually

3124
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:47,099
what you know there just becomes too

3125
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:49,440
much like it's like the game of

3126
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:51,480
telephone where someone passes the cut

3127
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:53,759
and then it's it's this and it's that

3128
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:55,198
and so like I've seen I've seen cuts of

3129
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:57,060
Lemon Cherry that were not the cut of

3130
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:58,559
Lemon Cherry that I ran like the cut of

3131
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:01,199
Lemon Cherry that we have is this like

3132
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,639
kind of the more prominent ones from you

3133
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:04,079
know we got it from the bay like my

3134
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:07,260
homie up in uh

3135
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:08,279
the Grass Valley and I've grown them you

3136
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:10,980
know like I said two different cuts of

3137
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:12,719
runs one looks very similar to The Lemon

3138
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:14,638
Cherry and one looks nothing like it

3139
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:15,719
grows totally different different stem

3140
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,520
structure different Leaf structure

3141
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:19,920
different flower structure

3142
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,239
um but it's so hard to tell plus if you

3143
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:23,579
grow it in a different environment with

3144
01:57:21,238 --> 01:57:25,259
different feed the you know physically

3145
01:57:23,579 --> 01:57:26,819
it'll look different they they'll appear

3146
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:28,440
to be they could be the exact same cut

3147
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:33,000
and they'll look like wildly different

3148
01:57:28,439 --> 01:57:35,879
females so it's just so hard to tell

3149
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:38,219
could be could be the same thing yeah

3150
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,380
interesting I wanted to ask you guys

3151
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:42,359
about like your thoughts on the lag time

3152
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:43,859
between like strains being released and

3153
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:45,719
then like maybe when it actually starts

3154
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:47,839
to get some public traction I think this

3155
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:51,118
is sort of exemplified by the fact that

3156
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:53,639
Leafly just recently announced that um

3157
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,679
JB's he's jealousy was like that clone

3158
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:57,440
of the year or whatever and I thought

3159
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:00,539
that was interesting because I remember

3160
01:57:57,439 --> 01:58:02,339
jbz did like the huge clone drop of that

3161
01:58:00,539 --> 01:58:03,539
it was like about a year so I was like

3162
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,699
okay so you could sort of say it was

3163
01:58:03,539 --> 01:58:08,039
about a year you know or sometime

3164
01:58:05,698 --> 01:58:09,779
between that between like it getting out

3165
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:13,139
into mass circulation and then the

3166
01:58:09,779 --> 01:58:14,880
public being like this is it so would

3167
01:58:13,139 --> 01:58:17,639
you agree that like you're reckon 12

3168
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:19,139
months is about the time lag from sort

3169
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:21,659
of when you maybe start getting it out

3170
01:58:19,139 --> 01:58:24,179
there to when maybe the end consumer is

3171
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:25,920
starting to maybe get hyped and and

3172
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:27,480
what's your thoughts on that time lag is

3173
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,859
it like does it make your job as a

3174
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:33,118
breeder harder

3175
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:36,839
I think it's some strains will come out

3176
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:39,319
like they come out of the gate hot and

3177
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:42,060
there's no there's virtually no lag time

3178
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:44,819
which is you know not not always the

3179
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:46,800
case but some come out hot some I think

3180
01:58:44,819 --> 01:58:49,079
you know 12 months is probably or like

3181
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:51,420
10 to like 10 to 15 months is probably

3182
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:53,219
your average but what's interesting is

3183
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:55,618
you see strains it'll be out for like

3184
01:58:53,219 --> 01:58:57,599
two or three years for like four or five

3185
01:58:55,618 --> 01:59:00,179
years and then all of a sudden for

3186
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:02,400
whatever reason back one they blow up

3187
01:59:00,179 --> 01:59:04,199
that and you're just like what hap where

3188
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:07,439
where did this come from this has been

3189
01:59:04,198 --> 01:59:10,259
around and now all of a sudden it's

3190
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:11,579
hype and everyone's after it

3191
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:15,300
um so it's kind of interesting to see

3192
01:59:11,579 --> 01:59:17,279
like some of those get rediscovered what

3193
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:19,260
had been you know they've been in hiding

3194
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:21,359
which sometimes it's just coming up with

3195
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:24,000
a clever new name and

3196
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:25,259
some fancy logo and you know some bubble

3197
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,020
letters but

3198
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:29,940
not always I betray rs11 will be the

3199
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:32,159
next Leafly strain of the year that was

3200
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:34,319
the next big clone drop by that gang so

3201
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:38,158
I wouldn't be surprised if in a year

3202
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,960
from now it's RS 11. right should uh it

3203
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:42,719
probably will you're right hey

3204
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:44,520
so on the tail end of the questions I

3205
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:46,618
wanted to ask you are there any breeders

3206
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:48,719
you haven't worked with you're maybe not

3207
01:59:46,618 --> 01:59:50,219
necessarily friends with heck maybe

3208
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,139
maybe they don't even breed anymore

3209
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:54,420
they're like super old school any

3210
01:59:52,139 --> 01:59:56,760
breeders you like wish you could do

3211
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:58,020
collaborate with or like use some of

3212
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,760
their work

3213
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:02,040
um sort of like you know fantasy

3214
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:05,159
football style question

3215
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:07,618
and it's it's so funny because they say

3216
02:00:05,158 --> 02:00:09,839
you should uh hustle hard enough until

3217
02:00:07,618 --> 02:00:13,920
your Idols become your rivals

3218
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,699
which you know is is a true statement

3219
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,440
um

3220
02:00:14,698 --> 02:00:17,759
and there's

3221
02:00:16,439 --> 02:00:20,238
I mean there's a lot of breeders in the

3222
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:23,340
space who've like contributed like a lot

3223
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:24,959
but once I got so like five or six years

3224
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:26,940
like if you ask me that question like

3225
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,279
early on in career I would have been

3226
02:00:26,939 --> 02:00:31,979
like oh this person this person this

3227
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:33,599
person this person but maybe it's just

3228
02:00:31,979 --> 02:00:35,759
kind of silly and like

3229
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:37,860
I just the more I get into like my own

3230
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,199
my own gear and like finding like my own

3231
02:00:37,859 --> 02:00:42,179
stuff there's so much in there that like

3232
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:44,460
I haven't had the proper time to really

3233
02:00:42,179 --> 02:00:47,880
go through the rest of the fridge and

3234
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:48,480
hunt all of my other flavors and you

3235
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:50,400
know

3236
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:53,399
find something new and different in in

3237
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:57,238
that in that category but

3238
02:00:53,399 --> 02:00:58,259
I mean who who like for you who do you

3239
02:00:57,238 --> 02:01:01,979
think would be

3240
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:03,239
would mesh well with Umami Terps

3241
02:01:01,979 --> 02:01:05,698
yeah I don't know that's a good question

3242
02:01:03,238 --> 02:01:07,079
about who you know if we could just tap

3243
02:01:05,698 --> 02:01:08,519
on the shoulder and ask him because

3244
02:01:07,079 --> 02:01:10,738
we've been lucky enough to do collapse

3245
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:13,139
with big you know big names

3246
02:01:10,738 --> 02:01:15,359
um the Stravinsky collab [ __ ] crushed

3247
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:18,118
that was awesome

3248
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,859
um yeah you know Tiki super seeds I like

3249
02:01:18,118 --> 02:01:21,299
collabing with people that I I know and

3250
02:01:19,859 --> 02:01:23,460
I've worked with in the past you know

3251
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:24,300
who are super cool

3252
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:26,939
um

3253
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:29,219
I like soulfire's gear I'd do something

3254
02:01:26,939 --> 02:01:31,319
with so fire so far would be cool like I

3255
02:01:29,219 --> 02:01:33,179
mean you know might like [ __ ] you

3256
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:34,738
know we have a couple cups but like

3257
02:01:33,179 --> 02:01:38,099
[ __ ] hell no one has more Cups than

3258
02:01:34,738 --> 02:01:39,059
exotic Mike he's got that cups for days

3259
02:01:38,099 --> 02:01:41,520
and they've been in the space since

3260
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:42,239
forever you know he's he's a g

3261
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,619
um

3262
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:46,618
that would be you know I don't know

3263
02:01:43,618 --> 02:01:48,658
maybe that'd be kind of cool like

3264
02:01:46,618 --> 02:01:51,359
those are some solid answers

3265
02:01:48,658 --> 02:01:53,460
I think that's cool I I wanted to ask

3266
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:55,759
because I'd be curious to know

3267
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:58,380
I'll get an answer from both of you

3268
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:00,739
what's your favorite strain for head

3269
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:00,739
stash

3270
02:02:02,039 --> 02:02:07,198
Fez it's just it's so unique and so

3271
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:10,440
different than anything else it doesn't

3272
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:12,598
grow very good it doesn't look very good

3273
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:14,460
like got kind of a strange structure but

3274
02:02:12,599 --> 02:02:15,900
just the smell when you break it down

3275
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:18,000
it's like

3276
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:21,479
yeah like fresh

3277
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:24,800
fresh cherries but like injected with

3278
02:02:21,479 --> 02:02:24,799
CO2 somehow

3279
02:02:25,139 --> 02:02:29,639
uh I mean I like the Fizz I like cherry

3280
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:31,319
pie cherry pie is one of my like desert

3281
02:02:29,639 --> 02:02:34,980
island all time all-time favorites

3282
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:36,779
cherry pies gas super heat the Fizz is

3283
02:02:34,979 --> 02:02:38,399
kind of like cherry pie it's similar but

3284
02:02:36,779 --> 02:02:40,019
it's like a more intense cherry pie yeah

3285
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:42,238
it's like it's more cherry pie than

3286
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:44,580
cherry pie dude I love cherry pie dude

3287
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:47,399
that's cool to eat uh yeah more grapey

3288
02:02:44,579 --> 02:02:50,880
but mine right now is probably the uh

3289
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:53,698
so my homie hunted this cut of poison

3290
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:56,460
gushers which is the F1 derb by the

3291
02:02:53,698 --> 02:02:58,319
gusher and that one's out of control

3292
02:02:56,460 --> 02:03:00,300
like some of the most Umami Terps of all

3293
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:03,960
time and then I crossed that with swish

3294
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:05,099
so we call that poison with a z which

3295
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:07,260
you know I don't know if we'll release

3296
02:03:05,099 --> 02:03:08,279
it as that because I'm kind of getting

3297
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:10,199
sick of

3298
02:03:08,279 --> 02:03:12,238
going down the Z Rabbit Hole too with

3299
02:03:10,198 --> 02:03:14,158
too much but the poison

3300
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:16,759
um right now I mean right now it's just

3301
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:20,279
PP number six yes

3302
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:22,619
Pastor poison number six right so pp6 is

3303
02:03:20,279 --> 02:03:25,380
my my current favorite right now I love

3304
02:03:22,618 --> 02:03:27,179
that all right now something that's

3305
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:29,279
maybe going to be a little left of field

3306
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:31,319
but I love doing this

3307
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,179
um what's something you're passionate

3308

3363
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:45,239
brilliant brilliant whoa look that

3364
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:48,239
brings us to the final five questions we

3365
02:05:45,238 --> 02:05:50,698
ask everyone uh so the first one being

3366
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:52,559
what is the single most memorable

3367
02:05:50,698 --> 02:05:54,479
experience you've had with cannabis so

3368
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,099
it doesn't necessarily mean like the

3369
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:57,899
strongest dab you've had but just like

3370
02:05:56,099 --> 02:05:59,579
maybe you're at a concert and like it

3371
02:05:57,899 --> 02:06:01,618
just hit right like you're like what's

3372
02:05:59,579 --> 02:06:02,698
the most memorable thing to you with

3373
02:06:01,618 --> 02:06:04,979
cannabis

3374
02:06:02,698 --> 02:06:07,678
so when I first moved to California I

3375
02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:11,759
was living in Utah and I was growing and

3376
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:14,460
trapping and being a goof and I you know

3377
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:16,500
pushed my parents to the Limit and they

3378
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:18,960
were like you need to get the [ __ ] out

3379
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:20,219
like go to California maybe like we

3380
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,819
don't know what to do with you so leave

3381
02:06:20,219 --> 02:06:25,260
so I just got into California and I

3382
02:06:23,819 --> 02:06:27,479
spent my first night out here and we got

3383
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:30,420
a bag of OG Kush seventy dollars an

3384
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:32,399
eighth from my buddy's homie and I

3385
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:35,099
remember waking up on the couch at this

3386
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:38,219
place in Orange and I was smoking out of

3387
02:06:35,099 --> 02:06:40,199
this like stupid pipe that had like a

3388
02:06:38,219 --> 02:06:42,000
like a lion or something on the front

3389
02:06:40,198 --> 02:06:43,979
like one of the like kid dumb you know

3390
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,899
like a leopard Panther I think it was a

3391
02:06:43,979 --> 02:06:47,279
black and it was just weird but I was

3392
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:49,019
sitting there smoking this pipe and I

3393
02:06:47,279 --> 02:06:50,880
was just like okay

3394
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:53,219
this is going to be great

3395
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:55,020
like this is this is going to work this

3396
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:56,279
is what we're gonna do

3397
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:58,139
and I didn't I didn't have it all

3398
02:06:56,279 --> 02:07:00,479
planned out at the time but like that

3399
02:06:58,139 --> 02:07:03,000
was the first moment where I was like

3400
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:05,759
okay I can I can kind of start to see

3401
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,039
how I want this to go

3402
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:11,159
that's awesome I love it Harry what

3403
02:07:08,039 --> 02:07:13,618
about you so in college I lived in the

3404
02:07:11,158 --> 02:07:15,420
Caribbean for a semester I sold bed

3405
02:07:13,618 --> 02:07:16,738
sheets to people who came in on cruise

3406
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:19,618
ships

3407
02:07:16,738 --> 02:07:21,899
weird time but um I lived on St Thomas

3408
02:07:19,618 --> 02:07:24,839
really pretty Island

3409
02:07:21,899 --> 02:07:26,399
um so got a bag Master Splinter was the

3410
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:28,500
name of my drug dealer there never

3411
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:31,738
learned his name but just give him a

3412
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:34,079
call you home yeah drive by he'd just be

3413
02:07:31,738 --> 02:07:37,919
sitting in a lawn chair out front walk

3414
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:39,000
up dime bag 10 bucks good to go

3415
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:40,380
um and then we went up to like the

3416
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,719
highest point on the island and just

3417
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:44,520
smoked a joint up there but

3418
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:46,980
I don't know just yeah just hit right

3419
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:48,540
like you said that's amazing I love it

3420
02:07:46,979 --> 02:07:50,879
all right on the other end of the

3421
02:07:48,539 --> 02:07:52,859
spectrum okay all your homies are hyping

3422
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,900
up this strain you're like oh [ __ ] can't

3423
02:07:52,859 --> 02:07:57,960
wait to try this finally comes around

3424
02:07:54,899 --> 02:08:02,059
super unimpressive how did people rate

3425
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:02,060
this what strain is it for you

3426
02:08:02,279 --> 02:08:07,738
blue dream

3427
02:08:04,198 --> 02:08:09,359
yeah the blue dream I was uh

3428
02:08:07,738 --> 02:08:11,158
I was unimpressed

3429
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:13,979
what's up I was a little upset I was

3430
02:08:11,158 --> 02:08:16,198
still hooked on oh geez so the blue

3431
02:08:13,979 --> 02:08:18,059
dream was kind of meh and then we got a

3432
02:08:16,198 --> 02:08:21,118
cut of double dream

3433
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:23,099
which was basically just Blue Dream 2.0

3434
02:08:21,118 --> 02:08:26,460
and uh

3435
02:08:23,099 --> 02:08:28,319
still upset about that one I love it but

3436
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:31,020
it yielded well and it paid the bills so

3437
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:33,899
we kind of had to you know

3438
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:36,420
had to run it that's it that's it

3439
02:08:33,899 --> 02:08:39,000
I don't want to keep hating on Oreos but

3440
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:40,679
I've seen some Oreos hash that looked

3441
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,319
incredible and someone was hyping up and

3442
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:44,579
I smelled it and I just got

3443
02:08:43,319 --> 02:08:47,039
um

3444
02:08:44,579 --> 02:08:48,960
what do we call it uh Lacroix like

3445
02:08:47,039 --> 02:08:52,439
YouTube Oreos is kind of what I

3446
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:54,599
described like hint of hint of Oreos

3447
02:08:52,439 --> 02:08:56,219
um and the flower the same way I saw the

3448
02:08:54,599 --> 02:08:57,719
jar sitting there and I was like oh I've

3449
02:08:56,219 --> 02:08:59,639
got to get some of that yeah look at

3450
02:08:57,719 --> 02:09:02,760
that yeah and then I remember smoking

3451
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:06,179
and just being like oh this like Obama

3452
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:08,179
yeah sorry to Oreos lovers nice all

3453
02:09:06,179 --> 02:09:10,380
right something you referenced earlier

3454
02:09:08,179 --> 02:09:12,239
uh I'm gonna drop you off on a desert

3455
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:13,340
island you can take three strains what

3456
02:09:12,238 --> 02:09:16,319
three

3457
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:19,980
oh okay let's see we're definitely

3458
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:21,840
taking an OG cut I'm not gonna say which

3459
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:24,539
one because you know I don't want to

3460
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,940
it's too difficult but an OG cut

3461
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:31,679
um definitely taking either Fizz or

3462
02:09:26,939 --> 02:09:31,678
cherry pie and then probably

3463
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:38,339
oh that's I mean honestly like I've been

3464
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:40,500
smoking on this rainbow belts 2.0

3465
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:42,840
recently and

3466
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:47,479
I could probably smoke that hash

3467
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:50,639
every day until I died it tastes it's so

3468
02:09:47,479 --> 02:09:52,859
overpoweringly soapy and weird and it

3469
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:55,819
gets me the same weird that's as close

3470
02:09:52,859 --> 02:09:58,198
to the dryer sheet terp as I've found

3471
02:09:55,819 --> 02:10:02,158
like definitely in the profile of

3472
02:09:58,198 --> 02:10:04,019
cleaning products but yeah it's I always

3473
02:10:02,158 --> 02:10:05,879
joke like I thought Skittles or you know

3474
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:08,820
rainbow belts tasted like if you made a

3475
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:12,300
butter croissant but used Dawn soap

3476
02:10:08,819 --> 02:10:13,679
instead of like water in the dough like

3477
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:17,699
it's just it's got this really creamy

3478
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:20,219
delicious but just soapy like well soapy

3479
02:10:17,698 --> 02:10:21,598
well there you go

3480
02:10:20,219 --> 02:10:23,939
um I'd say probably the rainbow sugar

3481
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:25,679
which is a cross we did a Fizz so it's

3482
02:10:23,939 --> 02:10:29,158
got those same kind of fish Terps but

3483
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:30,118
it's got maybe like a little more Stony

3484
02:10:29,158 --> 02:10:31,618
um

3485
02:10:30,118 --> 02:10:33,059
probably like something like a rainbow

3486
02:10:31,618 --> 02:10:35,098
belts or the Skittles just because

3487
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:35,820
that's such a unique flavor I'd want to

3488
02:10:35,099 --> 02:10:38,719
have

3489
02:10:35,819 --> 02:10:38,719
and then

3490
02:10:39,118 --> 02:10:42,899
I don't know what for my third one

3491
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:45,360
um

3492
02:10:42,899 --> 02:10:46,979
yeah maybe like an OG like a Larry OG or

3493
02:10:45,359 --> 02:10:50,819
just something like totally different

3494
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:52,859
yeah something green I love it I love it

3495
02:10:50,819 --> 02:10:54,899
all right final question for each of you

3496
02:10:52,859 --> 02:10:57,118
guys you go to time machine you can go

3497
02:10:54,899 --> 02:10:59,279
back anywhere Anytime Anyplace you can

3498
02:10:57,118 --> 02:11:01,259
get either seeds or a clone where you

3499
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:04,079
gonna go what are you gonna get oh I'm

3500
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:05,460
gonna go I mean how long do I have

3501
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:07,500
because I want to do the whole hippie

3502
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:09,480
hash Trail I want to do the old school

3503
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:12,599
[ __ ] I want to smuggle a bunch of hash

3504
02:11:09,479 --> 02:11:13,979
in the surfboard I wanna I wanna do all

3505
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:16,560
of the things that I always read about

3506
02:11:13,979 --> 02:11:19,079
you know like my parents friends doing

3507
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:21,179
and just going into parts of the world

3508
02:11:19,079 --> 02:11:24,000
that are like absolutely inaccessible to

3509
02:11:21,179 --> 02:11:26,520
this day and tasting and finding stuff

3510
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:30,359
that is definitely extinct at this point

3511
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:32,760
like and maybe it's

3512
02:11:30,359 --> 02:11:34,198
awesome and maybe it's just like oh yeah

3513
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:36,420
we have all these flavors today like

3514
02:11:34,198 --> 02:11:38,638
this wasn't you know like because part

3515
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:40,679
of the scent memory you like fan you

3516
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:42,000
romanticize flavors I don't know if

3517
02:11:40,679 --> 02:11:43,440
you've had this where like you don't

3518
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,658
have something for a long time and then

3519
02:11:43,439 --> 02:11:46,859
you try it again and you're like oh man

3520
02:11:45,658 --> 02:11:49,019
it's just like

3521
02:11:46,859 --> 02:11:51,299
it's not as good you know it doesn't

3522
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:53,880
taste as good like is it or did you just

3523
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:56,699
like romanticize it and make it better

3524
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:58,199
in your head and it's I mean it's hard

3525
02:11:56,698 --> 02:12:00,719
to say

3526
02:11:58,198 --> 02:12:03,719
so Emily and Harry

3527
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:05,760
yeah I

3528
02:12:03,719 --> 02:12:07,079
I really don't know

3529
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,060
um

3530
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:12,800
can you go to the future with this time

3531
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:12,800
machine I guess so why not

3532
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,158
um I probably wrote kill skunk I

3533
02:12:15,118 --> 02:12:18,000
probably just want to know like is it

3534
02:12:17,158 --> 02:12:19,439
something that everyone just

3535
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,599
romanticized and they thought really

3536
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:23,759
smelled like that and we do have it now

3537
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:25,800
or is everyone just lying now and it's

3538
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:28,139
something that did exist and is now gone

3539
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:30,420
so I mean Lupa told me it spelled like

3540
02:12:28,139 --> 02:12:32,340
like a dead animal skunk he was like no

3541
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:34,199
it didn't he's not skunk one it wasn't

3542
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:35,159
this fruity sweet skunk he's like it

3543
02:12:34,198 --> 02:12:38,098
smelled

3544
02:12:35,158 --> 02:12:39,719
like legitimately it smelled like a

3545
02:12:38,099 --> 02:12:41,579
skunk like a dead animal and I've only

3546
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:43,319
smelled a couple things that were even

3547
02:12:41,579 --> 02:12:46,738
remotely similar that were like diesels

3548
02:12:43,319 --> 02:12:48,420
and like some sours that Zoda is about

3549
02:12:46,738 --> 02:12:51,899
as close to dead animal scone because

3550
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:52,739
I've gotten that that zone is 16.

3551
02:12:51,899 --> 02:12:55,679
um

3552
02:12:52,738 --> 02:12:57,658
that I would I would want to smell that

3553
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:59,639
actually something that was verified

3554
02:12:57,658 --> 02:13:01,319
because that's the that's the mystery on

3555
02:12:59,639 --> 02:13:03,618
the you know everyone claims to be that

3556
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:07,319
I Am The Keeper of the skunk you're like

3557
02:13:03,618 --> 02:13:09,598
I don't know about that like I wish I

3558
02:13:07,319 --> 02:13:10,979
wish Whoever has it they're not on the

3559
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:12,480
internet you know there's some old dude

3560
02:13:10,979 --> 02:13:15,000
living in the woods like

3561
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:17,279
don't have the internet some guy offline

3562
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,979
for sure and he's just sitting there in

3563
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:22,139
his backyard smoking his roadkill skunk

3564
02:13:19,979 --> 02:13:24,839
without a care in the world

3565
02:13:22,139 --> 02:13:26,279
