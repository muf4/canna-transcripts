101
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,660
um I'm we're in the process of Fino

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,740
hunting so I mean we I mean uh we did

103
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,259
like

104
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,660
I don't know like maybe like a thousand

105
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,220
seeds or I don't know exactly the exact

106
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,259
count but

107
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:55,919
um I think we did about 200 200 of the

108
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,960
mango uh Black Mac black Pips I'm sorry

109
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,399

110
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,239
and so

111
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:06,359
um that was the first release and so I

112
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,019
think out of the 200 I think we had

113
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,560
a little over a hundred females

114
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:16,740
so uh just you know going through all

115
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,160
the different uh phenotypes you know uh

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,400
judging them by smell

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,240
um you know the way that they grow uh we

118
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,099
did some uh test washing and

119
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,560
um you know just doing overall

120
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,439
evaluation of the flower and everything

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,079
so we had to do that with the black pith

122
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,779
and now this week we just released the

123

136

137
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,300
mentioned so many strains that I was

138
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,478
interested to talk to you about so thank

139
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,400
you for that the mango piff that's an

140
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,918
interesting one do you feel like there's

141
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,679
a growing demand for those sorts of

142
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,799
sativas nowadays

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,360
uh yeah well I mean the pith has always

144
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,639
been a staple in New York city so I mean

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,960
it's always been you know the people

146
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:52,079
that grew up in the New York metro area

147
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:55,439
most of them know about that he's and so

148
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,418
I mean it's always had a reputation

149
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,100
um kind of like the sour diesel I mean

150
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,978
it's really you know comes from the

151
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,220
scene the seam uh area that the sour

152
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:08,099
diesel blossomed out of

153
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,900
and uh so I just think that a lot of

154
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,240
people just you know they might have

155
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:16,500
heard about it read about it but never

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,139
got to experience experience it so you

157
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,899
know I was breeding I had done you know

158
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,300
a lot of breeding with some of the mango

159
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:27,478
stuff and then

160
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,879
um you know I had the Black Keys

161
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:34,800
um years ago and I did a breeding with

162
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:39,000
it and so um I had uh acquired the pith

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,860
S1 uh clone so I thought it would be you

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,519
know the perfect choice for the the

165
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,460
mango the mango Nigerian

166
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:50,879
um black Haze and that was the male

167
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:53,339
times the the pith S one so that was

168
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,159
that that's what made the the black pith

169
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,519
that were uh currently uh that we

170
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,500
currently released

171
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,418
wow that's that's great to hear I'm I'm

172
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,918
one of those people you describe who's

173
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,439
heard so much about the pith that

174
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,939
obviously never tried it I guess the the

175
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,699
first question that I sort of think

176
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:14,339
about is you hear a lot of names thrown

177
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,800
around like um we're like Uptown Haze

178
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,839
Cuban black Haze the pif are they all

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,900
the same thing or are they different

180
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,198
yeah no they're all the same thing uh

181
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:29,038
they're just different kind of slang uh

182
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,360
terms for for that for that strain but

183
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,838
also

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,719
um it's the same as the E5 the E5 from

185
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,880
Amsterdam or the same genetics they're

186
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,919
they're a little bit different you know

187
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,038
the E5 is

188
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,919
um was a little bit meatier I think but

189
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:51,600
it was still kind of that same Colombian

190
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:54,000
pissy type of genetics uh which was very

191
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,139
rare I don't think that you know Neville

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,480
ever really commercially released uh

193
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:04,019
that strain I think that was something

194
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,320
that you know he had a small release of

195
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,539
at the time and you know and these are

196
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,080
and this is what had survived out of

197
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:17,099
that you know obviously they have the E5

198
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,320
I think the cat shoe in Amsterdam has

199
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,440
that's one of their house streams

200
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,260
and it's been a staple you know for

201
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,019
Amsterdam for a long time and then the

202
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:31,679
same could be said for the the black

203
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,139
Haze you know which was you know um came

204
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,239
out of Florida originally that's where

205
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,299
they you know originally started growing

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,899
it and then commercial shipments would

207
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:46,199
come up to New York City and so

208
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,659
um there was always a New York Miami uh

209
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,700
there was always a uh that was always uh

210
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:56,579
like a a cocaine route uh with guns and

211
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,580
drugs Etc so

212
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,620
um a lot you know back then you know all

213
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,959
that was just you know balled into one

214
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,899
so they were trafficking stuff back and

215
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:10,799
forth bringing up you know

216
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,259
um a lot of that up into New York and

217
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,719
then once they got established uh I

218
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,059
think they started producing you know

219
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,519
some of this stuff up up into New York

220
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:23,338
in New York City area area so I remember

221
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,940
hearing a couple busts back in the day

222
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:30,060
and it was up Uptown and it you know it

223
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,860
was the Dominicans and and and those

224
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,619
guys up there that were were running

225
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,800
that stuff so I mean even to this day

226
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,839
they still have a Stranglehold on that

227
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,879
on that strain

228
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,040
yeah that's I think that's one of the

229
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,379
most interesting aspects about it is how

230
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,019
it's still so tightly held and so

231
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,240
elusive I guess another thing which came

232
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,339
out about your previous answer was that

233
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,620
you work with the S1 and it made me

234
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,839
wonder do you think that the real one

235
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,820
still exists or maybe the S1 is the best

236
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,820
we have

237
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,640
no no I think that the

238
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,519
um you know the real one still exists

239
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,860
um I think you know I just reacquired

240
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,500
the black Haze

241
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,139
um cutting I haven't finished it out so

242
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I can't verify it but

243
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:22,199
um it seems to be a lot more people in

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,980
the community that are using it now it's

245
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,040
getting passed around a lot more now but

246
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,740
you know that's you know uh that was

247
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,539
around you know 10 years ago so you know

248
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,560
I had done some work with it you know

249
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:41,278
maybe nine ten years ago and um

250
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,979
it you know people just you know weren't

251
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,919
really interested in Hayes really uh you

252
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,980
know there were a few people but really

253
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:53,819
since the death of of Neville it seems

254
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:57,720
that there's been a a re you know uh

255
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:01,740
reviolation of uh of interest of the

256
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:06,000
haze so uh you know and then you know

257
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,159
with you know with uh with people now

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,220
um you know talking about The Black Keys

259
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,039
and the pith a lot more and it being a

260
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,560
little bit more available

261
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,719
um people I think are you know and once

262
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,518
they try it you know then they're you

263
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,940
know they're interested in growing it

264
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:28,919
and and my funerals are going about 70

265
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,899
to 77 days you know so um you know with

266
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,399
the you know with the breeding that I've

267
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:38,940
done you know it originally started with

268
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:42,000
nl5 Haze times the Nigerian and then

269
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,940
back Frost into the Nigerian and then

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,519
crossed into the the mango Haze and

271
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,180
that's what made the mango Nigerian and

272
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,240
that was basically you know um uh an

273
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:57,059
earlier uh sativa strain because there

274
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,899
was a little bit of indigo with the nl5

275
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:03,179
in it and then and then and also the uh

276
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:07,200
the Nigerian was an early finishing

277
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:09,239
sativa and then crossed into the mango

278
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,600
um and that was kind of early finishing

279
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:17,000
because that was um I you know that was

280
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,920
the A5 time skunk one I believe

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,759
and so that was a little more indicate

282
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:26,819
in there so uh you know the lines

283
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,819
um basically have been kind of bred with

284
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,000
a little bit of indigo and um but you

285
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,440
know they were way more sativa leaning

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,259
and just really just cut down the

287
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,300
flowering time on on a lot of those long

288
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,578
flowering sativas

289
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,399
you know so then I you know you know

290
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:48,059
then I crossed that into the black into

291
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,778
the black Haze and then obviously I

292
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:56,099
crossed that into the the um

293
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:58,379
the S1 which was an early finisher but

294
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,399
the S1 I felt

295
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:05,519
um kind of fell short for me on I mean

296
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,820
it was really crystally and it finished

297
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,278
it early and when you smelled it and it

298
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,360
was grown it smelled really piffy and

299
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,958
everything

300
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:21,600
but when you smoked it it didn't have

301
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:24,599
that that psychedelic sativa uh effect

302
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,159
to it and when I say that when you smoke

303
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,940
this

304
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:34,019
um it's pretty much like a head high and

305
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,320
you can take a big hit and blow it out

306
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:42,600
and close your eyes and you'll just feel

307
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:45,540
the effect of of the third eye and a lot

308
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,420
of moving parts inside of your head

309
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:50,879
almost you know it's kind of hard to

310
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:53,338
describe when you

311
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,100
um you know when you smoke some of these

312
00:14:53,339 --> 00:15:00,660
psychedelic sativas you know they're

313
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,639
more of an up high a more clear

314
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,399
um you know you'll get a little race see

315
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,339
a little a little heart race you know

316
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,039
you feel your heart you know beating a

317
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,560
little bit and you know for the cheese

318
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,838
and smoke or you know you're able to

319
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,379
handle that but if you give that to

320
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,720
someone that's not a seasoned smoker you

321
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:25,259
know they'll get uh you know they'll

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,879
start to get anxiety the racy effect and

323
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,819
what I call

324
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,559
um cannabis overdose you know when you

325
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,019
it's almost like when you eat too much

326
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,659
Edibles you know you get the feeling

327
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:40,320
that you're almost gonna die your heart

328
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:43,679
is raced in you're breathing heavy you

329
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,720
feel uncomfortable and you know you just

330
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,879
got you know with you know experienced

331
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,220
smokers know that you know that you know

332
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,860
uh that you just gotta kind of just

333
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,040
chill out and relax action you know it's

334
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,320
it's gonna go away but for people that

335
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,559
you know don't really know they start

336
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,740
getting more uh they just contribute to

337
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,539
the paranoia of the whole thing and they

338
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,799
don't you know instead of trying to

339
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:13,620
relax they go in and start getting more

340
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,379
um you know upset about it and and it

341
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,919
just contributes to their you know some

342
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,639
people go to go to the hospital and

343
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,019
um

344
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,379
so

345
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,698
yeah a great answer you know I hope all

346
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,500
of our listeners have been there at

347
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:31,139
least once

348
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,778
well if you eat too much Edibles we've

349
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,940
all been there at one point or another

350
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,559
yeah it's interesting that like the

351
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,600
positive feedback loop you describe it's

352
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,819
hilarious yeah I think we've all been

353
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,500
there at some point or another something

354
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,180
interesting that you just referenced is

355
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,759
like it's it's so impressive that you're

356
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,799
able to cut down the flowering time to

357
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,139
you know like 70 days-ish because those

358
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,819
strains often go a lot longer but

359
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,740
something I specifically wanted to ask

360
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,899
you in relation to that anxiety feeling

361
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,299
is I think I'm one of the only people

362
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,720
who says this but I get that feeling

363
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:05,578
from the C5 and I love it I like I love

364
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,798
anxiety and juicing weed I know it's a

365
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:10,619
very like non-popular opinion to express

366
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:14,578
but I think I'm the only one who prefers

367
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,078
the C5 over the A5 where do you fall on

368
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,198
that one do you prefer one over the

369
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,198
other

370
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,389
um I'm more of an A5 guy because I like

371
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,639
that pissy kind of

372
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,660
[Music]

373
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,679
um

374
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:32,340
yeah Colombian where the C5 is kind of

375
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,259
more of that floral tie and which is

376
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:37,139
nice

377
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:41,700
um but I get more of the Psychedelic

378
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:44,400
feelings from from the A5

379
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,220
um yeah and I guess you know the

380
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,220
combination of the both would be you

381
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,160
know equivalent to the Neville's Hayes

382
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,259
yeah gosh I guess that's that's one I've

383
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,679
yet to try but it would be be really

384
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:01,200
nice I'm betting you know I mean I've

385
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,140
been able to try some good samples in

386
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,679
the past and you know the the real good

387
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:11,700
ones you kind of get a blend of both you

388
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,980
know surprisingly enough yeah and um

389
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,679
yeah that's the only way to describe it

390
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,259
yeah lovely stuff there lovely stuff

391
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,759
okay to bring us back to sort of the

392
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,019
original question about like sort of

393
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,940
what are you smoking and you mentioned

394
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,220
the facilities I guess another question

395
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm interested in asking you is if a

396
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,200
facility was to come to you and ask to

397
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,058
use some of your genetics what are some

398
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,980
of the genetics that you think would do

399
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,319
better in a facility as opposed to say

400
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,058
just like a home grower where you know

401
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,740
certain factors aren't as big of a deal

402
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,200
what are the ones you go to straight

403
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,960
away for facilities

404
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,919
well I mean you got to go to you know

405
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,740
the the store dogs the guavas the

406
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,240
original New York City diesels you know

407
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,240
a lot of that a lot of the stuff that's

408
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,900
been a staple you know of the brand for

409
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,279
for for the you know for a long time

410
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,259
um you know and it depends on what

411
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,440
direction they want to go with it you

412
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:10,319
know a lot of it depends on you know uh

413
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,320
what the facility you know like the guys

414
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:16,918
that I'm working with now are more into

415
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:19,980
Fino hunting and looking for

416
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:24,600
um phenos that that are going to produce

417
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,220
Terps and hash and good flour and so

418
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,798
they're doing some research and

419
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,079
development you know so

420
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,119
um you know each play you know not a lot

421
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,159
of places are really willing to do that

422
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,279
they want to you know they have a

423
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,538
certain amount of space dedicated to to

424
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:45,480
their canopy and really uh they want to

425
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:48,419
you know match maximize you know every

426
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,460
square inch of that and so you know

427
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,000
depending on you know

428
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,160
um

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,519
you know it really depends on you know

430
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,679
the the business model of of of of the

431
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,119
business you know of of the businesses

432
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,759
itself

433
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,439
yeah that's that's so promising to hear

434
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,538
that they're willing to do that Veno

435
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,640
hunting because I mean I think a

436
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,619
sentiment expressed by many guests in

437
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
the past is that by doing that you sort

438
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,459
of create your own brand image because

439
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,200
you've got this unique thing that like

440
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,519
no one else has because you you went and

441
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,919
found it and then on top of that it's

442
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,139
you know like a star dog from JJ like

443
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,840
what more could you ask for

444
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,299
right and it becomes almost an exclusive

445
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,319
so it'd be become your own exclusive

446
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,879
house

447
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:35,819
strain or phenol of that strain and so

448
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,100
you can call that your own and be

449
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,339
exclusive with it and you know you know

450
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:45,359
as well as I do you know if you get you

451
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:48,119
know really popular uh phenotype that's

452
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:51,779
really special that you know and like

453
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,159
just say just like a GMO for for example

454
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,460
you know if you're able to find

455
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:59,400
something of something of that magnitude

456
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,620
and keep that you know in-house as your

457
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,660
own now obviously you're going to be

458
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:09,000
able to uh attract that you know you

459
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,220
know that market to you because of that

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,919
so and I think that's really going to be

461
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,919
the the future of cannabis is really

462
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,640
going to be branding

463
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:24,960
and and strains and really kind of on

464
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:28,200
the level of wine and beer as in micro

465
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,860
brewing and you know you really you know

466
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,259
as a as a cannabis brand you know you

467
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:37,918
really got to Define yourself on who you

468
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:40,500
want to be who who are your customers

469
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,320
who your customers want to be do you

470
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,380
want to be a Gucci or do you want to be

471
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:51,000
a Walmart you know so I mean you know

472
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:53,280
each each model can be profitable and

473
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,980
you know so

474
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,980
um but you know you have to you know

475
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,659
um Define on who you want to be and you

476
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,720
want to be a you know the on The

477
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,600
Connoisseur you know and attract

478
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,700
knowledgeable people or do you want to

479
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,219
be the kind of business that's just

480
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,440
going to you know attract people that

481
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,259
they're that are not you know that are

482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,720
not regular smokers they come in in

483
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:22,319
their one and done and you'll never see

484
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,659
them again and so and a lot of it is you

485
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,119
know based on

486
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,580
um price point you know so you know a

487
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,579
lot of people are just beast on you know

488
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:35,038
they only want to spend so much money

489
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:38,579
um maybe they only smoke once or twice a

490
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:41,279
week so you know quality to them is not

491
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:43,740
going to be a big difference where you

492
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,819
have a guy that's you know smoking every

493
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,440
day and or if they're a medical patient

494
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:53,279
so you know it you know when you really

495
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,519
you know break down the customer pull uh

496
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:59,399
it gets quite intricate in in the

497
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,798
different type of people that can be

498
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,620
your customer so you really got to you

499
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,259
know think about who you want to be

500
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,298
yeah most definitely that's a nice run

501
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:10,500
down there and I guess the last sort of

502
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,379
question before we move to a different

503
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,880
topic is we see um a few different

504
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,700
breeders working with facilities

505
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,620
nowadays do you suspect that not just

506
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,240
for you but sort of across the board in

507
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,099
the industry that this will be the way

508
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,319
breeders move in the future where they

509
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:29,538
try to pair up with facilities or do you

510
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,538
think it's maybe not a big Trend per se

511
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,459
um well I think you know it's really

512
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,640
going to be up to the facilities and how

513
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,659
they want to Brand themselves

514
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,360
and so

515
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,880
um you know if you know if they just

516
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,759
want to create their own brand

517
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,120
you know and which is quite difficult

518
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:54,960
but possible you know built on quality

519
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,359
or whatever your selling point is going

520
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,519
to be

521
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:02,219
uh you know otherwise you know you're

522
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,519
going to have to go with a recognized

523
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,179
brands in the industry and

524
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,220
um

525
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,880
you know you know I've said this before

526
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:15,900
you know uh you know good weed comes

527
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,960
from good strains good strains come from

528
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,880
good clones and good clones come from

529
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,360
good seeds

530
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,720
so you know a lot of you know the a lot

531
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,538
of corporate people don't really you

532
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,538
know understand this concept and just

533
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:35,819
think you can just go out and get get

534
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,859
some weed get you know get whatever you

535
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:40,678
know weed is weed and

536
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:43,798
so you know you know it really gonna

537
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,720
really goes down to you know the the

538
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,779
type of people that are running the

539
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,819
business and you know do they smoke pot

540
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,240
themselves or they connoisseurs

541
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:57,119
themselves or are they just you know uh

542
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,819
a corporate fund just you know just

543
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,939
counting the money so you know there's a

544
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,918
big difference between the two and you

545
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,100
know when you're in touch and out of

546
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,500
touch with the culture so

547
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:14,038
um you know it depends on you know who

548
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,919
you want to appeal to and but you know

549
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:21,058
for me I see you know like I said I see

550
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:24,000
as being as branding as being uh you

551
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,460
know like like you're gonna go into you

552
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,380
know like the New York structure is

553
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,019
going to be

554
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,380
um you know it's it's not going to be

555
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:37,200
integrated so you know as a dispensary

556
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,720
you're going to be able to buy wholesale

557
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,080
from anyone across the board

558
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,620
so you know so and you know so if that's

559
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:50,220
the case now you know you know what's

560
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:52,739
going to separate each each brand from

561
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:56,100
itself you know it's just really going

562
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,980
to be the name and reputation on how

563
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,899
good the product is so you know in the

564
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,538
end that's really you know you know

565
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,860
what's going to win out is you know who

566
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:10,440
has the best product consistently and uh

567
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:13,139
so you know so I mean and that's the way

568
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,740
that I see you know the market you know

569
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,520
eventually moving to because you know uh

570
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,419
you know you know when I go shopping you

571
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:27,839
know in in a dispensary you know I'm

572
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:30,900
looking for the Diesels the cams the

573
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:34,798
kushes you know anything uh with the

574
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,659
fuel the high end you know and so you

575
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,658
know that's just the kind of and I'm

576
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:42,059
willing to uh travel and that's just a

577
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,480
kind of customer that I am and I'm

578
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:49,259
looking for certain types of strains and

579
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,960
certain types of quality so uh you know

580
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,839
it doesn't pay for me you know just to

581
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,500
get some average you know some average

582
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:00,538
stuff for for cheap you know because you

583
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,359
know it doesn't matter how much I smoke

584
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:06,179
of it I'm not going to be satisfied you

585
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:10,199
know but when you smoke some cam or some

586
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,778
uh some some fire you know you could you

587
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,960
just got to take one or two good Puffs

588
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:19,798
you know once you blow that out you just

589
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,079
get that warm fuzzy feeling and it's

590
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,619
almost like that you know warm blanket

591
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:27,418
you know over you know over you and you

592
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,599
know it's just something that you know I

593
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:34,259
can't really you know get from something

594
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:36,778
else that you know even if I smoke you

595
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,460
know a pound of it I I won't you know so

596
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,859
it just does not have the same effect

597
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,579
for me so

598
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:47,099
yeah great sentiment Express there so

599
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,740
I'd love if you could take me back

600
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,219
what's your first experience with

601
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,220
cannabis

602
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:01,919
um I was about 13 years old

603
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:04,019
and it was it I think it was it might

604
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,860
have been Christmas day and it had

605
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:10,619
snowed and when we were kids we used to

606
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:13,079
go out

607
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:16,678
you know shovel sidewalks and driveways

608
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:19,740
for money so we had snowed you know in

609
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,720
my next door neighbor called me up you

610
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,599
know and again let's go out you know

611
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,298
let's do some shoveling so you know we

612
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,879
go out you know we had our regular

613
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:33,000
people that we used to you know shovel

614
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,940
on a regular basis so we were heading

615
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,919
over to the one people's house and we

616
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,480
decided you know we cut through some

617
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,480
woods and we stopped and uh he pulled

618
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,960
out a joint you know and he had older

619
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,480
brothers and so um and I was the oldest

620
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,278
one in my family so

621
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,620
um you know I had never seen any you

622
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:59,460
know weed before or anything like that

623
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:03,778
so you know we uh you know

624
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,360
he he lit it up and and we smoked it and

625
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:09,538
you know I was kind of feeling a little

626
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,240
silly and everything and we started

627
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:15,298
shoveling and

628
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,899
uh we couldn't finish the job you know

629
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:21,778
we got like you know we were just so you

630
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:24,599
know kind of silly and you know it was

631
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:27,119
just so much work we just kind of bailed

632
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:31,139
out of it and just and just walked away

633
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,519
uh from the job so um and then after

634
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,940
that I don't know I might have been in

635
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,940
like seventh grade and you know uh and

636
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,580
you know I was in Middle School so

637
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,100
um I you know there were maybe a couple

638
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:47,220
other times that you know we had gotten

639
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:49,439
weed I remember uh we had bought a

640
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,980
nickel bag from someone and that was

641
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,500
like five dollars worth and so

642
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,440
um we all you know there's three of us

643
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,099
so we all you know chipped in bought

644
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:05,340
this nickel bag from an older guy in the

645
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:08,038
neighborhood and you know we smoked a

646
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:10,619
couple bowls of it we were down by the

647
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:13,558
river and you know so we smoked a couple

648
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:16,439
bowls and then a bunch of these older

649
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,000
kids started you know

650
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,240
um coming around and they were having

651
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,558
this big party down where we where we

652
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,659
were hanging out

653
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,480
and so you know we were started hanging

654
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,640
out with them and so we were smoking a

655
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,819
little bit and some guy was like who's

656

we got some so we showed them the bag

658
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:40,139
he's like I'll give you 15 bucks for it

659
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:42,359
and so we were like yeah sure you know

660
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,360
so we had already smoked you know like

661
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,959
three or four bowls and now we sold it

662
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:51,298
for 15 bucks so you know we we each

663
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,659
wound up you know getting high for free

664
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:57,658
and getting five bucks each you know and

665
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:00,480
so we were really psyched about that and

666
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:04,140
so you know that was one of the other

667
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,720
um you know early experiences I had but

668
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,899
I really didn't start using regularly

669
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,600
until I I got into high school you know

670
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:15,599
when I got into ninth grade and once I

671
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:19,019
got there I mean there was like a

672
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,538
smoking area on the school grounds and

673
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:24,359
there was a tree there and it was on a

674
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:25,919
little bit of a Knoll so it was like a

675
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,038
little bit of a whole a little bit of a

676
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,880
hill there and so all the kids used to

677
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:35,460
just you know gather up in the morning

678
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,980
before school and everyone used to smoke

679
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,500
cigarettes there and everyone used to

680
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,079
just crowd it was like a circle around a

681
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,359
tree and so you know you can get into

682
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,759
that Circle and everyone would be

683
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,500

684
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,980
back then

685
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,019
um they used to sell joints for a dollar

686
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,200
and they would and they would have them

687
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:00,058
in cigarette packs so you know someone

688
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,798

706
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,019
then so when you had you know three four

707
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,120
five kids you know and you each put up a

708
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,879
dollar or two you know all of a sudden

709

10 or you know so you'd be able to cut

712
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,139
deals and so uh yeah that's how you

713
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,640
survived when we were kids you know

714
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,740
going to school we did this with our

715
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,740
lunch money and you know we didn't work

716
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,220
and just got money from our parents and

717
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,319
yeah we were just trying to get high

718
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,839
great answer what a nice little stroll

719
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,398
down memory lane I mean I don't fault

720
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,439
you if you don't know the answer to this

721
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,739
but do you know what you were smoking at

722
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,740
the time

723
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:30,480
um early on

724
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,460
um you know there was really no names

725
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,140
you know there was really kind of like

726
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,058
Mexican and Colombian and you know so

727
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:43,080
that was like early on but there was

728
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:46,379
always uh some Hawaiian and there was

729
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:49,859
exotic around you know uh it was really

730
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:54,360
hard to get uh there was a lot of uh

731
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:55,918
blonde hash uh the the red hash black

732
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,398
hash

733
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:04,200
um but around in the Earl I'd say I

734
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:07,500
don't know 81 82 and that's when the

735
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,838
real first uh we call the Christmas tree

736
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,739
sense so that was really when the first

737
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:17,699
real kind buds started coming around and

738
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:20,759
I remember I think it was used to be

739
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:23,158
able to get it for like 200 bucks an

740
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,879
ounce you know which was a lot of money

741
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:30,419
back then and uh you know people I mean

742
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:34,500
you could maybe sell a gram for 10 bucks

743
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:38,638
back then you know so you know it wasn't

744
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:42,059
really you know you know much of you

745
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,460
know of a profit margin uh because you

746
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:47,759
know back then you know like I was

747
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,639
telling you there were dollar joints and

748
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,940
you know uh half ounce it would be like

749
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,280
twenty dollars an ounce would be forty

750
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,980
dollars and that would be kind of this

751
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,920
year typical

752
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,500
commercial type of weed you know out of

753
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,800
an ounce you can maybe you should be

754
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,619
able to roll I don't know 50 to 60

755
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,599
joints depending how big they were so

756
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:17,160
that's how people would sell and you

757
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,380
know for a dollar each you know so um

758
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,659
so yeah the Christmas tree scents used

759
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,260
to you know come around and used to be

760
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:27,679
good Hawaii and and stuff like that but

761
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:31,920
you know and I also remember

762
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:35,699
when I was in school the janitor start

763
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,880
was selling weed and he used to get and

764
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:41,159
he had his brother uh lived in Harlem

765
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,900
and up in New York City and I know that

766
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,500
he used to get the weed was coming from

767
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,720
Harlem and he used to get this stuff I

768
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,659
think it you know and it was I think it

769
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:55,139
was fifty dollars an ounce which they're

770
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:58,799
either 50 or 60 I forget I know that it

771
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:01,500
was more expensive than your regular you

772
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,519
know standard commercial stuff and

773
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:08,460
originally he came in and he started he

774
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,800
handed my friend a packet

775
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,139
um you know a pack of joints to sell for

776
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,300
them and there were these little tiny

777
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:17,460
like Pinhead joints I mean they were

778
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,099
ridiculous you know I mean like people

779
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,858
used to laugh at him because there used

780
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:26,160
to be this guy stying me and he used to

781
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:30,000
sell these joints and I mean people used

782
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:32,159
to we used to know his route to school

783
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,739
and they would like they used to wait

784
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,139
for him to cut they cut him off before

785
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,479
he got onto the grounds because when he

786
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:42,118
used to get stymy joints there were

787
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,820
these big huge bombs and you could

788
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,880
actually unroll them and get two joints

789
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,760
out of the one you know I mean so you

790
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,180
know so you know so but you know I had

791
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,099
these little skinny pin heads and like

792
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,480
you know that people used to ridicule

793
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,519
them they're like oh that's a toothpick

794
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,940
this and that you know but when you

795
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:05,639
smoke that man it [ __ ] you up so you

796
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,420
know a lot more than than the regular

797
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:11,159
stuff and so you know the the janitor

798
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,200
was you know you know then my friend

799
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,179
showed me what he was getting from the

800
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,059
janitor and then I hooked up with them

801
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:20,519
and so I was just getting like you know

802
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,578
I was just getting ounces from them and

803
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,219
just selling it myself and I remember I

804
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,380
just pulled that rainbow weed and but it

805
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:31,919
had all different colors and it had like

806
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:35,160
some red some green some brown some gold

807
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,619
and all different colors but I suspect

808
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:40,858
that was some type of Thai weed or

809
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,740
something like that because I just

810
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:45,960
remember that just being you know some

811
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,819
of the strongest stuff around like I was

812
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,800

smoked it they were just like oh let me

814
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,400
get some more of that stuff so uh that

815
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,380
was you know another memorable you know

816
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,900
strain a day and also I remember getting

817
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:05,400
like some some real gold some real

818
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:08,039
Colombian gold the Santa Marta gold

819
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,940
um a friend of mine he had an older

820
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,079
brother

821
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:15,480
he had two older brothers and so

822
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,420
um yeah I guess one of the older

823
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,579
brothers I I think it just came down the

824
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,920
line of Brothers the older brother got

825
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,440
it gave it to the gave it to the other

826
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,960
brother and then he gave it to the

827
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,320
younger brother who was my friend so we

828
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,780
wound up getting like I think we got an

829
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,300
ounce of it and we split at half and

830
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,000
half and

831
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:43,619
um yeah I remember that just being

832
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,900
bright gold like you know like and back

833
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,420
then there was the real gold and then

834
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,559
the fool's gold which they called so the

835
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,838
the fool's gold was the stuff that

836
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,338
look gold but it was just trash it

837
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,299
didn't get you high so I used to call

838
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:02,159
that fool's gold with a real gold was

839
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,240
kind of

840
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:09,539
um hazy it had like this hazy type of

841
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:12,539
um you know tip to it and so I just

842
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:15,838
remember that and uh I just remember it

843
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:19,380
being a seedless and this kind of bright

844
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:23,639
yellow gold and you know just kind of

845
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,880
having that real sativa type of look to

846
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:30,960
it and um if you ever uh if you're

847
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,900
familiar with Lawrence chernak he has a

848
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,260
cannabis book and he actually has a

849
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,660
picture of some some gold in there and

850
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,760
it looked exactly the same you know when

851
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:44,699
I saw that picture I was like that's

852
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,640
what you know we got back in the day and

853
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:49,679
I was only able to get it once but it

854
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,420
was memorable and that's how things were

855
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,440
back then you know you would see some

856
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,599
something you'd get it once and

857
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,980
that was it you know and uh

858
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,559
so

859
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,079
wow what a great little history lesson

860
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,059
right there I mean something people

861
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,640
probably notice when they look at the

862
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,139
collective work done by Top Dog and you

863
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,118
can see that there's obviously sort of

864
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:13,739
this Indica side of things with you know

865
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,260
the chems and whatnot but there's also

866
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:19,139
the sativa side of things do you think

867
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,940
that this sort of exposure to these

868
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:23,039
really sort of quite legendary strains

869
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,079
at the young age instilled in you as

870
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,179
sort of a love for those sativas or is

871
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,220
it more so you just want to provide a

872
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:31,919
bit of everything

873
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,319
no you kind of you know hit it on the

874
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:38,280
head you know I really built the brand

875
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,440
on things that I like and experienced

876
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,780
so you know I know that I'm a little

877
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,119
older than most of the people so I was

878
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,599
like be able I was able to experience

879
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,000
you know a lot of things early on you

880
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,300
know I was able to catch kind of what I

881
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,960
call the the late 70s Cheech and Chong

882
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:00,900
air era of what I explained to you of

883
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,780
you know twenty dollar halves and forty

884
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:07,139
dollar ounces and all that kind of stuff

885
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:12,119
where that kind of changed in the early

886
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:15,779
80s or in early to mid 80s once

887
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,880
um you know the drug War uh really

888
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,540
stepped up and that's what really

889
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,780
cultivated the whole indoor scene

890
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:27,358
because in the early 80s you know I

891
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,380
remember that's when Ronald Reagan came

892
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,598
into

893
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,720
um he came he was the president you know

894
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,800
and I was in high school from 80 to 84.

895
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:41,159
and that's when he first took over

896
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,339
so you know within the first two years

897
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:46,920
you know uh things started to change and

898
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:49,019
by the last two years you know you know

899
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,440
like I said things you know started to

900
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:55,920
change a little bit more and you know by

901
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,619
the time I got out of high school uh by

902
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,338
1985

903
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,380
um the government really put a halt on a

904
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:06,078
lot of the Imports that were coming into

905
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,680
the country

906
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:14,720
and that prompted a whole a whole shift

907
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:18,960
in the drug trade to where they started

908
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:20,219
importing cocaine instead of bales of

909
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,400
marijuana

910
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:31,799
so by 1985 1986 the streets just became

911
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:34,740
flooded with imported cocaine and uh and

912
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,760
there wasn't much import marijuana

913
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:41,519
coming in and looking back at that time

914
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,520
in history you know

915
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:47,699
um up in the Pacific Northwest that's

916
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:51,739
kind of like when

917
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:57,960
um the indoor grows of Seattle

918
00:42:51,739 --> 00:43:01,139
uh Greg McAllister the NL guys up there

919
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,300
you know they they were they started you

920
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:05,759
know those indoor grows in the in the

921
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,400
early 80s during during that during

922
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,720
those times

923
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,180
and uh

924
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:15,059
yeah so that just really kind of

925
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:17,098
prompted the whole indoor thing where

926
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,880
you know that's where that's where it

927
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:23,160
began because of the the pressure you

928
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,079
know of you know of the Imports so

929
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:28,139
people just like well we'll just start

930
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,720
producing it ourselves you know to the

931
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:33,838
point you know to where you know we you

932
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:37,078
know uh we just started to become a self

933
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:40,440
a self-efficient you know uh producing

934
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,740
company uh country ourselves a lot of

935
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,280
people have never uh experienced what I

936
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:50,279
uh a drought you know meaning where you

937
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,740
couldn't get weed I mean like I said you

938
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,220
know back in the 80s it was easier to

939
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:59,338
get cocaine than it was to get weed and

940
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:01,618
so uh yeah it became very you know

941
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:04,318
difficult uh

942
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,260
yeah so I mean and that just kind of

943
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:10,139
prompted the whole indoor the whole

944
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:13,140
indoor scene to you know to where it's

945
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:15,659
kind of evolved into today you know to

946
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:18,358
where you know it's kind of amazing if

947
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:20,519
you you know really kind of look back at

948
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,380
the history of it or really know know

949
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,199
anything about it

950
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,760
what a fascinating sort of way to view

951
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,379
back on things and it all makes perfect

952
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,020
sense right with the rise of the drug

953
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,420
war and whatnot if we think back to when

954
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:35,579
you were talking about uh you know how

955
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,019
to saw you befriended the groundskeeper

956
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:39,300
and you sort of got access to the better

957
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:41,039
quality stuff it's it's clear that

958
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,839
you're quite a good networker which I'm

959
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,619
sure has helped you a lot over the years

960
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:49,139
do you remember any of the strains that

961
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:52,200
you were seeing from those indoor grows

962
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:55,019
say before chem came out sort of you

963
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,519
know like 80s super early 90s were there

964
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,960
any memorable ones that you can remember

965
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:02,400
at all

966
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,699
well I remember seeing my first grow and

967
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,559
uh this was a guy who was in Times

968
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:14,299
Square in New York City on 47 46th

969
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:18,299
Street and he was in between Broadway

970
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:20,700
and uh Sixth Avenue so I mean that was

971
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:25,318
like a block away right from the center

972
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:27,299
of of Times Square and he was a weed

973
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:31,019
dealer and

974
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:34,980
um so you know I I had hooked up with

975
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:39,960
him in the late 80s

976
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:41,639
um yeah mid to mid to late 80s and so

977
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,280
you know I was just that's where I used

978
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,400
to go and buy my weed from you know and

979
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,839
he would have you know regular

980
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:55,019
um Mexican weed that which was green and

981
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,299
and sellable you know and like an upper

982
00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:00,239
mid we used to call them and then he

983
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,760
would get you know exotic strains and

984
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:06,199
different stuff like that

985
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,420
but you know he wound he wound up like

986
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:12,480
monopolizing his building and wound up

987
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,420
getting like I don't know like the

988
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,539
building itself maybe had only like

989
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,780
I think it had an apartment on each you

990
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:24,779
know I had two apartments on each floor

991
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,760
and so there was one guy that was in the

992
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,400
building and he rented one of the places

993
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,680
but he also lived up in Albany so he

994
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,858
wasn't in the building much and then

995
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,559
there was like a music uh repair store

996
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:40,259
downstairs and then he wound up getting

997
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:43,920
the next three Apartments all the way up

998
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:46,560
and so he sold weed out of one he had

999
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,720
one that he's had storage out of that's

1000
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:52,559
where he stored his weed and then the

1001
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:55,500
other one he had a little grub and so uh

1002
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,578
this was probably like in the late 80s

1003
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:01,739
like 89 90

1004
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:05,060
somewhere in that range and so these

1005
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:08,239
guys were going to Amsterdam and getting

1006
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:13,259
uh the Early Skunk

1007
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:16,379
uh the silver Pearl uh a lot of the

1008
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,020
Scentsy type of strains and they were

1009
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:23,280
growing them you know and they had this

1010
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:27,539
uh little Hydro set up and so that was

1011
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,720
you know some of the first uh indoor uh

1012
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:34,259
you know stuff that I had seen and uh

1013
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:36,419
yeah and so most of that stuff was seeds

1014
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,180
that came over from Amsterdam and so

1015
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,119
they were going back and forth and you

1016
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:45,838
know I you know back then you know I was

1017
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:48,559
really green and wet behind it years and

1018
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,179
you know I I didn't really have a lot of

1019
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:54,719
knowledge about it but I had an interest

1020
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:57,059
in it and so it was probably about that

1021
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,578
time that I actually started collecting

1022
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:02,578
seeds you know I would get a bag of good

1023
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:04,740
weed and find the seed out of it and and

1024
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:08,400
shave it and I was like yeah maybe one

1025
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:11,699
day I'll be a grower and so um

1026
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,380
yeah unfortunately that that seed

1027
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:19,799
collection I got seized by by the police

1028
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,579
and one of my many uh brushes with the

1029
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,780
law

1030
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:28,920
but uh yeah and that was even before I

1031
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:31,380
really decided to be a grower too so

1032
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,900
okay I mean I guess the next question

1033
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,420
for me is what was it that stimulated

1034
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,700
you to start growing as opposed to just

1035
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,800
sort of being involved in it all

1036
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:43,500
well you know

1037
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,900
um you know so you know I'll go back you

1038
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,760
know even a little bit farther than that

1039
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,920
you know I mean like I said I had this

1040
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,619
guy in Times Square who was my pot

1041
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,400
dealer and everything so

1042
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,260
um

1043
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,160
you know when everyone from my town was

1044
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:02,339
going to this guy and everything so uh

1045
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:06,000
and then I had heard that

1046
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:09,719
one one of the kids from our town was

1047
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,380
was selling weed up in Central Park

1048
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:16,139
and I was like really I was like if that

1049
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,300
kid can do it I was like I can do it too

1050
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:20,818
because the guy was a total loser you

1051
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:23,700
know so I

1052
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:26,400
so I went up there and I checked out the

1053
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:29,519
steam you know and it but it was late it

1054
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,260
was late it was late in the summer so

1055
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,500
you know I went up there and it was up

1056
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:37,920
in sheep met up in Central Park and it

1057
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,900
was just the open free drug Market

1058
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,220
that's the only way I could describe it

1059
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:45,920
of people just walking around selling

1060
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:50,279
acid mushrooms

1061
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,940
weed hash uh there's it would sell beer

1062
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,460
I mean you could just sit down and this

1063
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:59,159
you used to be able to smoke and people

1064
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,980
used to you know they'd have Circles of

1065
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:04,679
kids just all around different Circles

1066
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:07,019
of people some people would bring uh

1067
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:10,259
guitars and drums and have little

1068
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:12,719
circles and it was just it was just a

1069
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,119
really cool scene I was just like blown

1070
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,739
away I was like wow I can't believe this

1071
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,380
you know but it was it was late in the

1072
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:21,239
seasons I was like well I'm gonna come

1073
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,960
out next year so

1074
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:28,858
you know I wound up you know getting

1075
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,318
um some really good uh you know some

1076
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:34,259
really good green came in and we used to

1077
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:37,920
call it pretendica because it was almost

1078
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:41,520
like real Indigo but it had a few seeds

1079
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,159
in it you know I mean so the real Indigo

1080
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,679
was seedless but this stuff was like

1081
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:50,098
kind of like

1082
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:51,960
squishy and like spongy but there was a

1083
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,180
little bit few there was a little there

1084
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,039
were a few seeds in it you know it was

1085
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:58,318
more expensive than your regular

1086
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,779
commercial but it was well worth it

1087
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:03,119
because you know the price you can kick

1088
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:05,099
up the price out of it and if you can

1089
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,619
find you know someone that wasn't really

1090
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:10,019
in the know and you could squeeze all of

1091
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:13,079
them seeds out of it you could you know

1092
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:15,960
sell that off as you know as you know as

1093
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,000
kind buds so you know you know I was

1094
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,760
able to get you know I think like five

1095
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,639
pounds of it you know and I uh and I

1096
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,140
just squirreled that away thinking all

1097
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:26,960
right this is going to be what I'm going

1098
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:31,078
to bring out to the park in the spring

1099
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:33,599
so that's what I did so you know the the

1100
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,660
day came you know

1101
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,838
um you know I might have scouted out you

1102
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:41,759
know and went up there one day and seen

1103
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,818
it was happening then I was like all

1104
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,099
right I'm gonna go out there so and I

1105
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:50,759
got I had all my my you know had my

1106
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:53,579
pretend to go with me you know and I hit

1107
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,980
the park I you know I go through one of

1108
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:58,859
the side Gates and I start walking

1109
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:02,719
through and I see some guy sitting under

1110
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:05,880
a tree with a guitar with his girlfriend

1111
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:08,459
listening to the Grateful Dead on on a

1112
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,818
little radio and I think to myself oh

1113
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:14,039
wow this guy's got to be cool you know

1114
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:16,679
what I mean so I go over to him and then

1115
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:18,058
I try you know hustling them and I'm

1116
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:20,578
like yeah you know I'm trying to sell

1117
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:23,339
them weed this and that and then he says

1118
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:26,160
to me well let me show you what I have

1119
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:28,558
that when I'm selling and he he whips

1120
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,719
out some real kind bud you know I'm just

1121
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,640
like whoa you know I'm blown away you

1122
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,799
know so I'm like you know so I get

1123
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,739
friendly with the guy and everything and

1124
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,900
so you know we've become friends and and

1125
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:42,659
so you know and I was you know just

1126
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,579
trying to learn the ropes out there so I

1127
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:46,739
was kind of hanging with him and he

1128
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:49,260
would tell me you know this guy's but

1129
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:52,318
watch out for this one or that one or

1130
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:55,079
you know so um you know we were sitting

1131
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:58,019
there one day and some guy come

1132
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,960
strolling up and the guy's name was Ben

he's like hey Ben he's like you know and

1134
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,159
I guess that someone had sent him out

1135
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:12,119
there to look for Ben because Ben was a

1136
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:15,838
known kind bud dealer in Central Park

1137
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:18,358
so uh this guy comes up and he's like

1138
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,519
hey you know I got some kind bud that I

1139
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:24,659

1140
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:27,239

1141
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:30,539

1142
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:32,338

1143
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:34,318
he looks to me and he's like do you want

1144
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:36,058

you know I'm like I'll buy some you know

1146
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:41,160
I mean yeah because back then like

1147
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:44,160
trying to find someone you know to try

1148
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,139
to find a grower was just like you know

1149
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,539
I was like hitting a gold mine you know

1150
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:50,279
because it was just so you know you know

1151
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:53,099
there were people out there were doing

1152
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:57,420
it but finding those people were just so

1153
00:53:53,099 --> 00:54:00,180
far and few in between that you know uh

1154
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:03,358
you know it was very hard so you know

1155
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:05,759
when I really got the first chance other

1156
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,960
than the guy that knew in central I mean

1157
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,880
in um Times Square who grew but you know

1158
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,940
I was you know really excited you know

1159
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,519
to be able to buy some so you know maybe

1160
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:21,179
like a week or two later I'm out there

1161
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:23,460
by myself you know Ben's not around but

1162
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:27,299

you know what I'll I'll take it all I

1170
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,960
think he used to come in with quarters

1171
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:49,679
there were like six grand quarters where

1172
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,240
he used to come in with you know so uh I

1173
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,598
was like I'll take them all you know

1174
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:57,358
what I mean and so you know

1175
00:54:54,599 --> 00:55:01,260
um you know I hooked up with a guy and

1176
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:02,279
you know unfortunately for Ben he wound

1177
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,880
up

1178
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,740
um getting all [ __ ] up on drugs and so

1179
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,980
you know I was just out there on a

1180
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:13,379
regular basis just grinding away and

1181
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,019
started working with this guy

1182
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:18,358
and so you know this guy wound up being

1183
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:22,199
the weasel you know this was this was

1184
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:26,098
the guy he came out originally which um

1185
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:28,799
uh he used to call it the RFK skunk and

1186
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:31,140
the story behind that was that him and a

1187
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,200
friend had gone to a dead show down and

1188
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:38,578
down at RFK Stadium down in Washington

1189
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:42,480
DC and bought a bag of kind and they had

1190
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:45,780
some seeds in it and they uh they split

1191
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,780
up the seeds and then they both decided

1192
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,460
to grow so you know they both started

1193
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,980
growing

1194
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:55,559
and they needed a place to get rid of it

1195
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,740
so they came out to the park you know so

1196
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:03,059
you know his original product was the

1197
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:06,479
RFK one two and three and

1198
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:09,240
um after that he wound up

1199
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:13,260
um going to a fish uh

1200
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:17,159
and meeting Greg chemdawg Greg

1201
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:19,920
and so I guess you know uh they uh you

1202
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:22,199
know back then like one grower meeting

1203
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,900
another grower was another big thing

1204
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,899
because all right now I have someone

1205
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,220
that I can trust

1206
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:35,639
trade uh genetics and information with

1207
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:39,799
so uh you know that's you know Greg was

1208
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:43,679
growing the chem 91 in the super skunk

1209
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,359
and you know my friend had the RFK and

1210
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,779
you know I don't know if you might have

1211
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:50,940
had some stuff from Amsterdam but

1212
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:54,540
um he wound up driving up to

1213
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:58,559
Massachusetts from Staten Island uh

1214
00:56:54,539 --> 00:57:01,619
bought you know traded enough for the

1215
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:04,800
chem 91 and super Mass super skunk and

1216
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:08,818
then he brought that down to uh to

1217
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,079
Staten Island you know and um and by

1218
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:15,058
that time I had kind of you know uh

1219
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,460
cornered that whole Market meaning like

1220
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:20,579
I told him listen you know I'll buy

1221
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:24,059
everything you got I got cash I'll pay

1222
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:27,359
you Cod you know what I mean so he he

1223
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:29,339
loved that you know idea so he was like

1224
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,199
Hey listen you know doing you know

1225
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:33,659
business up here in the park isn't

1226
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:37,139
really a good idea we should go down to

1227
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:40,019
Wetlands and so he's like down in

1228
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:42,000
Wetlands you know it was a bar and you

1229
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:44,338
know on Tuesday nights you have Grateful

1230
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,559
Dead night you know and so you can go

1231
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:49,799
downstairs and they had like drum

1232
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,559
circles and guitars and stuff like that

1233
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:55,559
but they they they let you you know

1234
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:58,619
smoke weed down there so you know we

1235
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:01,380
would you know meet up down there and um

1236
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:03,420
you know we wound up meeting AJ down

1237
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,180
there and you know he just kind of just

1238
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:09,420
sniffed us out because you know I would

1239
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:12,179
I would wait for him you know and people

1240
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,099
you know people knew who I was and

1241
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:16,440
they'd be asking me for weed and I'd be

1242
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,660
like you know wait wait wait wait you

1243
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,838
know and so I I'd be waiting for him

1244
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:24,299
they would see him come over to me you

1245
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,179
know we would do our business you know

1246
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,500
what I mean and you know and once you

1247
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:30,598
know when we were doing our business

1248
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,358
obviously you know I would take a bag

1249
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:36,180
out and open it up as soon as I would

1250
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:38,338
open that bag I would just permeate the

1251
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:41,159
whole room and so people would just be

1252
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:43,619
there like standing there like staring

1253
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,420
at us you know the whole time you know

1254
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,539
and then eventually that's how kind of

1255
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:49,920
AJ caught on to us and then you know I

1256
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:52,798
reached a point where he'd be like Hey

1257
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,139
listen that's going to the back office I

1258
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:59,099
have access to it let's go back and do

1259
00:58:55,139 --> 00:59:01,259
do do our deals back there so you know

1260
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:03,240
so we you know all started you know

1261
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:06,859
getting friendly and we used to smoke

1262
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:10,739
back there and it became exclusive

1263
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:11,400
and so you know I was able to you know

1264
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:13,979
um

1265
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,960
you know that was just the beginning of

1266
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,298
the whole you know the whole chem story

1267
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,798
when I you know when you know he you

1268
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:20,519
know he started

1269
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,039
um

1270
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:25,079
doing a little bit of breeding you know

1271
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:29,579
he created you know the under the

1272
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:35,280
underdog which was you know NL Super

1273
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:38,220
Skunk times chem 91 and uh he had that

1274
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,859
and then you know he was running that

1275
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:42,659
um he was also running some others some

1276
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:46,679
other strains in there

1277
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:49,379
and you know that's where we suspect the

1278
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:52,078
you know the sour diesel came out of

1279
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,000
because you know I told you earlier that

1280
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,859
I you know I used to collect seeds so

1281
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,719
you know once the chem started coming

1282
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:00,900
around I used to collect seeds out of

1283
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:03,239
the chem and you know once I started

1284
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:06,059
growing when I first started growing I

1285
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:09,358
had to pop some of them chem seeds and

1286
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:10,798
they came out you know very sour you

1287
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,639
know and I remember

1288
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:17,780
um I wound up giving remember I sexed

1289
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:19,379
the plant and knew it was a female

1290
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:23,460
and

1291
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:25,880
um and I gave it to my friend and I told

1292
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:28,740
them that you know that this is a female

1293
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:31,980
and you know we didn't we were we

1294
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:35,519
weren't able to finish it and so when he

1295
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:39,059
finished it you know he wound up uh coin

1296
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,940
that the guava cut and so you know that

1297
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:44,760
was that was the original guava but not

1298
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:47,099
the guava that we know today you know

1299
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:51,000
and uh

1300
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:53,818

1332
01:02:25,798 --> 01:02:32,338

1349
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:23,338
and they knew the people that owned the

1350
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,160
building and they were like the

1351

maintenance workers of the building

1352
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:32,279

1357
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:47,539
and they were uh you know they had seen

1358
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:52,139
something in the High Times magazine

1359
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:55,558

1362
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:04,798
were trying to do and it was just

1363
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:06,720
failing and so uh you know they asked

1364
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,780
you know and I had told them about what

1365
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:12,419
I was doing and so they didn't had known

1366
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:15,059
that I had a little thing and so

1367
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,519
um when my apartment went down I told

1368
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,180
them Hey listen you know

1369
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,759

1370
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:22,858
you know I you know I I have a whole

1371
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,599
bunch of plants they're gonna die and

1372
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:27,659
they're like well just bring them bring

1373
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:30,480
them down here and he and they were like

1374
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:33,000
and then we made an agreement to where I

1375
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,639
was going to help them you know get that

1376
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,159
room turned around and try to help them

1377
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:41,039
get their money back so we we you know

1378
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:43,639
formed a partnership and so I moved

1379
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,019
those plans down to Fifth Avenue

1380
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:47,298
and they had

1381
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:50,659
um

1382
01:04:47,298 --> 01:04:55,559
this maintenance area

1383
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:57,838
that was a pretty big space and it was

1384
01:04:55,559 --> 01:05:01,079
like they made it into like a locker

1385
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:04,440
room but they made it to where where you

1386
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:07,019
open one of the lockers you walked into

1387
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,659
through into another room and that's

1388
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:12,298
where the grow room was so they had

1389
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:15,899
built a wall and then they had these

1390
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:19,019
lockers that you walked through and so

1391
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:22,099
that's where the grow room was and you

1392
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:24,780
know it was just kind of like

1393
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:28,079
improperly put together and everything

1394
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:31,079
and they were splicing into the electric

1395
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,599
all over the building and eventually

1396
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,880
what happened was

1397
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,940
I helped them get their money back and

1398
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,798
everything and you know what we were

1399
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,380
having problems in a room it was getting

1400
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:46,440
too hot during the summer time and you

1401
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:49,500
know working out the bugs and they you

1402
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:52,260
know had ran some new wires and and

1403
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:55,739
tapped into the

1404
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:58,319
um the hallway electric which was on the

1405
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:59,399
other side of the wall they spliced into

1406
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,460
that

1407
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,798
so I go in there on a hot day and it's

1408
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:08,818
really hot you know and I you know I

1409
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,780
turn on a an air conditioner and walk

1410
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:12,960
out

1411
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:15,420
you know not knowing anything that I

1412
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,539
just you know overloaded to Circuit you

1413
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:22,200
know so I'm in the city

1414
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:26,038
down at my apartment or office and then

1415
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:28,759
I get a phone call saying that the the

1416
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,200
fire department in front of the building

1417
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:35,460
and that there's a fire in the building

1418
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:38,038
so you know I hop in my car I drive past

1419
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,440
and sure enough the fire department's

1420
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:45,720
out front

1421
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:48,780
and um so lucky for us you know uh they

1422
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:52,919
located you know I guess in the hallway

1423
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:57,059
where the fire was and it was up in the

1424
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:59,338
ceiling and uh lucky for us it wasn't on

1425
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:01,859
the other other side of the wall and

1426
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:03,838
that's where the grow was so they popped

1427
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:07,380
their head up there they saw where the

1428
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:11,279
fire was and so they didn't discover the

1429
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:13,079
the grow but you know but needless to

1430
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,559
say that was kind of the beginning of

1431
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:18,480
the end to that spot uh you know they

1432
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,298
were we were getting complaints of

1433
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,880
people in the building that were you

1434
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:25,559
know like 20 stories up and they were

1435
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,720
smelling weed because we were just

1436
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:30,960
exhausting out we were on the bottom

1437
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:34,199
floor and just exhausting out of a um of

1438
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,179
a window and this is before uh charcoal

1439
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:38,519
filters and all that stuff so we were

1440
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:42,358
just you just had raw exhaust is going

1441
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:45,838
up and the thing was it was like uh they

1442
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,818
had like Courtyards and in these in

1443
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:50,338
these buildings and so where the

1444
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:53,219
buildings kind of like they all kind of

1445
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:56,279
come together it almost becomes like a

1446
01:07:53,219 --> 01:07:58,379
shaft in between so and it just goes

1447
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,000
straight up you know until it you know

1448
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,700
but there's like a little space in

1449
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,099
between you know the buildings and so

1450
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:07,739
that's where we were pumping out of so

1451
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:09,720
the people upstairs it was just it was

1452
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:11,879
just shooting up so when they opened

1453
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:14,219
their Windows you know they could smell

1454
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,159
weed and I had a kid in the building

1455
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:19,619
that that I used to sell weed to and

1456

1458
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,500

01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:34,380
know he didn't he didn't know it was

1463
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:38,100
actually us that were that was doing it

1464
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:40,798

know my first uh my first real

1466
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:47,939
experience in in in in in in growing and

1467
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,579
then and then after that you know that

1468
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:52,559

1469
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:56,039
uh you know that lasted like a year or

1470
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:59,279
two and then I think and after that

1471
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:01,979
ended you know it took me like a year to

1472
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:05,640
get my [ __ ] back together on my own and

1473
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:07,979
I just wound up going uh Upstate uh New

first room you know uh you know did it

1488
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:54,179
correctly the rate set up you know gave

1489
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:57,599
me uh gave me Sour Diesel clones which I

1490
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:59,819
had given them originally because you

1491
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,239

1492
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:05,939
selling the weed so you know I would be

1493
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:09,599
like all right I know what streams sell

1494

I know what people want you you do what

1495
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,620
what I tell you if I give you these

1496
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:16,198
clones you've grown and not it's gonna

1497
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:17,698
it's gonna help us all so you know

1498
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:20,158
that's what I ever you know that's what

1499
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:23,099
I had started to do was getting you know

1500
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:25,500
I started networking and I was able to

1501
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:28,020
get the sour diesel and so I gave that

1502
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,640
to them and then they gave it back to me

1503
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,719
and that was one of the first strains

1504
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:37,079
that I started growing uh well on my own

1505
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:41,279
was the sour diesel and then um

1506
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:46,079
and then eventually I wound up meeting

1507
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:51,119
uh chem dog Greg and I wound up trading

1508
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:54,420
him the sour diesel for the candy

1509
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:57,059
and so uh and then when I first you know

1510
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:59,699
and then once I got my own place you

1511
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:03,179
know and I had been you know uh

1512
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:05,219
selling weed all these years and

1513
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:06,779
and like I was saying I would tell these

1514
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,698
people what to grow

1515
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:10,679
and uh

1516
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:13,198
a lot of times

1517
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:14,819
I'd be like you know we'd have certain

1518
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:17,819
screens I'd be like well what happened

1519
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:20,158
to this kush or this NM they'd be like

1520
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:21,779
oh we lost it you know we don't have it

1521
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:23,519
anymore I'd be like man that [ __ ]

1522
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:26,099
[ __ ] you know I was good what happened

1523
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,460
you know well whatever whatever reason

1524
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:32,520
we lost it so once I started growing

1525
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:36,960
myself and getting these Elite clones

1526
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:40,020
that's when I decided I wanted to start

1527
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,939
um in you know preservation and it was

1528
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:44,400
really you know all right I got this

1529
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:47,399
Sour Diesel and I was like all right now

1530
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,920
you know the Clone only strain you know

1531
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:53,639
so we don't have no there is no sour

1532
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,158
diesel now so you know so I was just

1533
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,860
like well you know I was just like well

1534
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:02,099
I'm gonna make my own mail you know so

1535
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:04,799
you know so I was growing the chemd you

1536
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,840
know all these different scenes so I was

1537
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,199
like well if I'm gonna make my own mail

1538
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm gonna use whatever the best weed the

1539
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:14,939
strongest we read that I have you know

1540
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,979
and back then it was the chem weeds so I

1541
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:20,158
decided all right chemd is what I'm

1542
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:22,259
gonna you know Beast my mail off of and

1543
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,639
so you know and then I was like well

1544
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,079
what are you going to use for a donor

1545
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,800
mail

1546
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:31,019
so I had a guy going to to uh Amsterdam

1547
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,179
and I gave him you know a bunch of money

1548
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:35,100
and I'm like you know get you know I

1549
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:38,940
gave him a whole bunch of lists of

1550
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:41,400
streams to get me from Scentsy seeds and

1551
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:44,519
and that's what he did so he he comes

1552
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:47,579
back and he had he had the Hindu Kush

1553
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,159
the Afghan one

1554
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:51,960
um skunk

1555
01:12:49,158 --> 01:12:55,079
NL a whole bunch of different ones but

1556
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:57,119
you know I you know I was like no I'll

1557
01:12:55,079 --> 01:13:00,119
I'll have to grill these out to see what

1558
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,859
they are how and how they grow so I I

1559
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:05,238
grew all you know well really I just

1560
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:08,880
grew the Hindu Kush and Afghan out

1561
01:13:05,238 --> 01:13:13,439
and decided that the Afghan would be a

1562
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:17,520
better choice uh of a male donor because

1563
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:20,819
it was uh it wasn't very dominant in in

1564
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:25,560
taste and smell it kind of had like a a

1565
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:29,279
Piney uh you know like a yeah like a

1566
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,840
kind of like a Piney kind of um

1567
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,179
I'm trying to think of the different

1568
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,920
word to describe it but

1569
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:37,560
um

1570
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:40,679
yeah it wasn't really dominant you know

1571
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,880
it was kind of blandish you know it it

1572
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:48,239
grew really thick stemmed and single

1573
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:51,779
Cola you know it's just a really big top

1574
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:54,059
single Cola and so I decided you know

1575
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:57,119
that would probably be the best you know

1576
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:59,820
uh male donor for you know the cross

1577
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:02,579
into the chemd and so that you know

1578
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:07,859
that's what I did like I did the first

1579
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:11,219
cross the Afghan candy and then I uh

1580
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:14,880
back crossed into the uh chemd again and

1581
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:17,399
made the double dog and then did the

1582
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,560
third uh cross which would have been the

1583
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:22,139
second back cross would would have made

1584
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,420
the trade dog and so once I made the

1585
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:26,699
trade dog you know I decided that you

1586
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:30,060
know that that would probably be a good

1587
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:32,879
representation of the chemd a good you

1588
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,920
know strong male and so you know I

1589
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,679
decided you know one of the first you

1590
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:40,079
know breedings that I was going to do

1591
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:42,480
um I had just gotten the chem four at

1592
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:45,000
that time so I was like well you know

1593
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,399
combine two different chems and see what

1594
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,679
what happens

1595
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:53,939
and you know that eventually became a

1596
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:56,640
store dog and when I made those seeds

1597
01:14:53,939 --> 01:14:59,039
um you know I just wound up you know I

1598
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:02,219
grew some out myself and found the

1599
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:04,920
Quarry cut within the first I think I

1600
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:07,619
only I only pop like maybe like 4 four

1601
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:10,319
or five seeds and I found a quarry cut

1602
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:14,640
and then I wound up

1603
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:18,000
um giving some seeds to people that were

1604
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,219
affiliated with high times and some of

1605
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,079
the seeds got into the hands of Carl

1606
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:29,039
Cushman he grew up the store dog found

1607
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:31,880
his Fino keeper which he entered I think

1608
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:37,679
it was in the San Francisco medical Cup

1609
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:39,960
in 2010 in one second place with that so

1610
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:42,420
that really kind of you know put the

1611
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,880
star dog you know on the map people

1612
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:48,719
started noticing it

1613
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:52,140
um some some of the other seeds got into

1614
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:55,380
um Andre Grossman he was a freelance

1615
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:58,579
photographer who had a farm in New York

1616
01:15:55,380 --> 01:16:02,520
City he was affiliated with high times

1617
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:05,880
and he held the and always grew the

1618
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:08,940
strawberry cough and so that was Kyle

1619
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:12,179
cushman's strain that he brought to High

1620
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:15,299
Times and that became the the office

1621
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:17,100
strain so at any time you know you could

1622
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,739
used to be able to go down to the park

1623
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:22,199
avenue office and they might even have

1624
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:24,359
had a mother of the of the Strawberry

1625
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,639
Cough in the office and you used to be

1626
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:28,920
able to get clones from it and they

1627
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,800
didn't have it there they had it like

1628
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,060
really close by so you you used to be

1629
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,679
able to go down there and be like you

1630
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,360
know yeah I want some strawberry cough

1631
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,500
and they would get it to you within an

1632
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,158
hour or two

1633
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:43,219
so Andre started growing in the guava I

1634
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:46,679
mean a star dog and found a guava cut

1635
01:16:43,219 --> 01:16:49,020
and so uh he brought that into the

1636
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:52,859
office and that also became an office

1637
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:55,440
stream and accessible to people uh to

1638
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:59,158
High Times and so

1639
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,839
um when Andre started growing it you

1640
01:16:59,158 --> 01:17:05,219
know he started obviously taking

1641
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:07,560
pictures of it they did a a centerfold

1642
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:08,420
of it they did a write-up on it and

1643
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,420
everything

1644
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:15,359
and so uh getting back to the the

1645
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:18,020
original guava thing so that that

1646
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:22,859
cutting started getting out around town

1647
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:25,260
and my friend who I had given the

1648
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:28,139
original guava to wound up

1649
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:30,960
getting that cutting and he calls me up

1650
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:33,000
one day and he's like all excited he's

1651
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,239
like I got it I got it back I got it

1652
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,899
back I got the guava back and so you

1653
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:44,698
know I first saw the guava from him not

1654
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:47,759
knowing that it was my seeds that I had

1655
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:49,279
given to uh you know so it was like a

1656
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,980
whole

1657
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:56,279
eventually it all came full circle and

1658
01:17:52,979 --> 01:17:59,519
we figured out everything and and that's

1659
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:02,219
been kind of like the the the story of

1660
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,080
of the chem dog and a lot of the stuff

1661
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:07,859
that's been on the internet because a

1662
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:10,019
lot of it has come full circle because a

1663
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:12,059
lot of these people have popped up on

1664
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:15,360
the internet and we've been able to

1665
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:19,560
connect and we've been able to figure

1666
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:21,658
out you know the chem dog story and you

1667
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,239
know all of that now that's really

1668
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:27,119
become Legend

1669
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:28,738
wow what a phenomenal answer I think uh

1670
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,658
everyone's gonna have to go listen to

1671
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:32,639
that a few times you just hide so many

1672
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:35,279
pieces of the puzzle together for me so

1673
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,840
thank you so much I guess one of the

1674
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,179
first questions and I'm gonna have about

1675
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,159
a million questions for you I think I

1676
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:44,158
read somewhere that you were involved in

1677
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:47,399
being able to help reconnect peabut and

1678
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:50,639
Joe brand with chemdog is that correct

1679
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:51,479
yes it is originally

1680
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,239

years and stuff so you know and then

1706
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:10,259
that's kind of like when Soma came out

1707
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:14,399
with the New York City Diesel which we

1708
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:17,880
were you know quite offended by and

1709
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:22,139
um so you know I I you know I decided to

1710
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:24,600
you know to create uh an account and set

1711
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:29,840
the record straight so you know that's

1712
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:34,320
where you know I I I became uh JJ uh NYC

1713
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:38,340
uh I logged on there and my very first

1714
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:41,219
post was just this kind of a rant that

1715
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:45,960
just kind of you know kind of set the

1716
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:48,960
record straight and called out Soma and

1717
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,060
you know people are kind of like shocked

1718
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:54,658
by it and being like who the [ __ ] are

1719
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:57,440
you you know what I mean and so you know

1720
01:20:54,658 --> 01:21:01,439
eventually you know um

1721
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:05,639
uh the you know the whole chem thing

1722
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:10,259
started you know started out on over bro

1723
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:12,840
and and all that and then um and then

1724
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:17,039
and then it went down it got it got shut

1725
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:20,880
down and you know I got all kind of

1726
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:25,279
freaked out by it and I kind of dropped

1727
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:28,440
offline for six months to a year

1728
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:33,000
and you know and then you know decided

1729
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:35,158
you know to pop back on and you know

1730
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,500
found out that everyone had moved to

1731
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:40,559
icmag

1732
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:44,340
so you know I started you know uh

1733
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,500
posting on I see mag and uh this was

1734
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,920
probably right around the time that I

1735
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:53,819
had gotten the chemd and

1736
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:56,940
uh so you know I remember the you know

1737
01:21:53,819 --> 01:22:01,279
the very first time I I did a search on

1738
01:21:56,939 --> 01:22:05,399
chemdog and this guy this guy's account

1739
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:08,759
popped up it was called Joe brand and he

1740
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:10,559
made a post saying does anyone know

1741
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:14,100
anything about

1742
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,539
chem or dog or I feel what it was you

1743
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:18,420
know I mean so

1744
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:22,319
you know I started a whole dialogue with

1745
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:25,440
him you know I mean and uh

1746
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:28,139
yeah I mean eventually it just kind of

1747
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:29,158
led to the you know

1748
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,960
um

1749
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:33,658
you know getting those guys back

1750
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:37,619
together now we figured out the whole

1751
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:40,019
you know I mean and you know when it was

1752
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:42,960
coming you know when it was happening it

1753
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:45,840
was you know it was really it was really

1754
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,198
incredible to really you know start

1755
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,719
piecing all that history together and

1756
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:54,960
figuring out the puzzle

1757
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:57,480
um so yeah I was able to you know we

1758
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,119
figured out that you know it had you

1759
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:04,559
know that you know that Greg had gotten

1760
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:08,460
it was Greg and uh that Greg still had

1761
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:10,800
some of those original seeds left and so

1762
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:15,679
I had you know I hooked those guys up

1763
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:20,219
and they reunited and and Greg wound up

1764
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:23,279
sending uh Joe uh for the original siege

1765
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:25,439
that he found in in that dog bud and

1766
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:27,479
that wound up being the chem one two

1767
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:31,099
three four

1768
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:35,639
so yeah I was uh you know very

1769
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:38,640
instrumental in in doing all all of that

1770
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:41,280
yeah wow it's it's so impressive how

1771
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,659
interconnected all the relationships and

1772
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:45,119
stories are

1773
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:47,219
if I could just go back a moment to when

1774
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:49,198
you were talking about you know how the

1775
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:51,480
the Staten Island crew first sort of

1776
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:53,399
linked with mass G and all those sorts

1777
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:56,218
of things I guess something I'd love to

1778
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:58,500
ask you is what was your first

1779
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:01,460
experience like when you first smoked

1780
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,460
the camera 91

1781
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:07,140
uh it was just kind of game changing

1782
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,179
because we've never saw anything like

1783
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:12,000
that you know and even like the super

1784
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:14,880
skunk too I mean when you when you would

1785
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,300
crack a jar of that super skunk it would

1786
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,699
just it would just permeate the room it

1787
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:22,440
was just something that you know it's

1788
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:25,139
just something you just cannot find

1789
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:28,619
today you know and so when people talk

1790
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:33,420
about roadkill and all this other stuff

1791
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:36,300
you know you know I I know what it is I

1792
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:39,920
I experienced it you know it was

1793
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:43,619
something at one time and why it's

1794
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:45,658
changed and and it's gotten lost

1795
01:24:43,619 --> 01:24:49,439
um you know no one really knows the

1796
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:53,698
reason why and a lot of it you know is

1797
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:57,839
people you could say it's genetic drift

1798
01:24:53,698 --> 01:25:00,479
um you know and and which could be a

1799
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:04,079
part of it uh I think it was really hard

1800
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:06,599
for people to really hold on to a lot of

1801
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:10,140
these genetics because they were so loud

1802
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:13,320
so many people had gotten busted uh with

1803
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:15,960
those genetics over the years and

1804
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:18,119
um I mean yeah I mean if you if you

1805
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,658
really think about it you know a lot of

1806
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:24,238
the streams that we have today were are

1807
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:26,698
really responsible

1808
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:29,039
because they're one person you know I

1809
01:25:26,698 --> 01:25:31,139
mean if you look at the chem the cams if

1810
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:33,658
it wasn't for Greg we wouldn't have the

1811
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:36,780
cams you know if you look in and you can

1812
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:41,039
go down a list of different strains that

1813
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:43,198
people are associated with and enough so

1814
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:47,460
if it really wasn't for those people who

1815
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:49,379
who preserved and then shared them you

1816
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:53,158
know we wouldn't have what we have today

1817
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:56,460
so I mean you know we did have those

1818
01:25:53,158 --> 01:26:00,119
genetics were you know plentiful at one

1819
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:03,539
time but unfortunately you know that was

1820
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:05,238
during a time of of the drug war and

1821
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:08,579
heavy prohibition

1822
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:11,359
and a lot of that stuff just got snuffed

1823
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:14,340
out unfortunately

1824
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:16,079
yeah yeah it's a real shame isn't it and

1825
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,619
I guess some of the more smelly stuff

1826
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:21,420
before carbon filters is obviously just

1827
01:26:18,619 --> 01:26:24,000
logistically hard to sort of manage long

1828
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,560
term I had a question or two about the

1829
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,319
sour diesel for you that I was hoping

1830
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:30,659
you might be able to shed some light on

1831
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:32,819
back when around that time when you know

1832
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:35,339
the sour first came out were people

1833
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:37,019
running primarily just like one strain

1834
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,340
in a room or where they're multiple

1835
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:40,679
because I guess I'm trying to figure out

1836
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:43,079
is it more likely that it was just an S1

1837
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:46,199
or like some sort of cross pollination

1838
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:49,619
and then as a little follow-up do you

1839
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:52,138
accept the versions given by people like

1840
01:26:49,619 --> 01:26:53,340
weasel or vondo on say the Adam Dunn

1841
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,840
show when they talk about the sour

1842
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,340
diesel history or do you think it would

1843
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,340
maybe went down a little differently to

1844
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:02,279
what we see online

1845
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:04,020
well I I do know you know what he you

1846
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:06,059
know what what he was growing at the

1847
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:08,280
time because I was selling it you know I

1848
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:13,260
know that he had the 91

1849
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:16,880
he had the um Mass Super Skunk uh he had

1850
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:21,360
the RFK stuff I think he had the the DNL

1851
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:24,420
and so you know uh you know that's you

1852
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:27,000
know you know what you know I suspect

1853
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:31,279
you know something in the room hermied

1854
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:34,319
and got into the into the 91 obviously

1855
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:35,420
and uh that's where the sour diesel came

1856
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,399
from

1857
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:40,079
now I mean there's a lot of speculation

1858
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:44,099
on

1859
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:47,219
you know is a super skunk is it DNA you

1860
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:50,159
know or but you know the the one thing

1861
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:50,939
that I can point to is

1862
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,960
um

1863
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:57,238
the skunk VA and he's very adamant and

1864
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,840
I'm sure you're familiar with some of

1865
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:05,158
his early uh Super Skunk photos that

1866
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:07,520
kind of show big stretchy kind of sour

1867
01:28:05,158 --> 01:28:09,059
like plants

1868
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,960
and

1869
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:13,820
um

1870
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:17,579
from what I remember in what's also

1871
01:28:13,819 --> 01:28:18,899
documented in High Times when they did

1872
01:28:17,579 --> 01:28:22,340
the

1873
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:27,238
um photo shoot of the mass super skunk

1874
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:30,960
and of the chem dog uh from Greg back in

1875
01:28:27,238 --> 01:28:34,799
the day that that plant was more of a

1876
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:38,460
more medium squat plant you know the the

1877
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:42,960
plant that that the the weasel had was

1878
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:46,219
the same exact one that Greg had and I

1879
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:51,960
mean I sold the butt of it I saw it grow

1880
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:55,139
and it was not the big super stretchy uh

1881
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,920
Fino that skunk VA

1882
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:59,699
um

1883
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:02,579
uh had so I don't know if it was the

1884
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:03,658
same genetics I know that you know

1885
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:07,859
um you know there's a whole different

1886
01:29:03,658 --> 01:29:11,579
story on that super skunk

1887
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:15,899
um it was down in Virginia originally

1888
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:19,500
um it I think that it yeah I think it

1889
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:23,519
came there was a trade me the super

1890
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:24,500
skunk came up from Virginia to

1891
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,900
Massachusetts

1892
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:29,300
and then the chem dog was picked up from

1893
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:32,759
Massachusetts

1894
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:37,320
and brought out to California to skunk

1895
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:40,500
VA and that was the 91. and so

1896
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:44,340
um yeah I don't really know what if that

1897
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:48,960
was a the a different Fino that they

1898
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:51,480
gave him or what you know I know at that

1899
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:54,658
time I think skunk VA was out in

1900
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:57,479
California I think he set up the deal

1901
01:29:54,658 --> 01:30:01,138
with his friend

1902
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:05,579
um so what was actually brought up and

1903
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:08,159
traded I mean is anyone is anyone's

1904
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:11,760
guess because I think there's a big

1905
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:14,698
discrepancy between the super skunks

1906
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:17,579
that Greg had and then the super strong

1907
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:21,178
the skunk VA had because they were two

1908
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:24,658
totally different genotypes I mean if

1909
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:28,500
you want to do your research on Greg's

1910
01:30:24,658 --> 01:30:31,920
Mass super skunk and and you know find

1911
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:34,439
out the characteristics of it you can

1912
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:38,760
but you will find that it's not that

1913
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:41,460
really tall stretchy sour like Fino that

1914
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:45,480
skunkier had so

1915
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:49,020
who's right who's wrong I mean we'll

1916
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:52,698
never know I mean I mean I guess if you

1917
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:56,040
can really get into some uh

1918
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:57,599
sequencing and and stuff like that maybe

1919
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:59,639
some of that stuff

1920
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:04,320
could you know come out in the future

1921
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:08,340
but you know uh you know it could to me

1922
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:13,920
it's just speculation and I can only go

1923
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:15,900
by with what I know in in new at the

1924
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,179
time so

1925
01:31:15,899 --> 01:31:19,738
um I mean I have my doubts on it just

1926
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:22,679
because I think they're they're two

1927
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:25,678
different femos I mean I could be wrong

1928
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:29,760
uh there's another a whole nother story

1929
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:31,560
behind that which I don't know so I mean

1930
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,600
there's more I guess there's more

1931
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:36,120
investigating

1932
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,539
um facts that need to come out you know

1933
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:43,819
from I guess the Virginia for the

1934
01:31:39,539 --> 01:31:46,439
Virginia Beach Crew in Skunk VA

1935
01:31:43,819 --> 01:31:48,479
yeah look I think you might be on the

1936
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:51,359
money there because when I've spoken to

1937
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:53,879
skunk VA more recently he's sort of said

1938
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:56,399
to me that now that he thinks back on it

1939
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:59,579
the the skunk cutting he got back from

1940
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:01,138
Greg years later he goes I was so

1941
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:02,698
excited to have it back you know like

1942
01:32:01,139 --> 01:32:03,659
I'm like oh the super skunk's back and

1943
01:32:02,698 --> 01:32:05,219
he goes but now that I really think

1944
01:32:03,658 --> 01:32:07,138
about he goes I'm not sure it was the

1945
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:09,480
same plan which is sort of what you're

1946
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:12,060
saying that the plant Greg got might not

1947
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:13,619
have been the original one skunk VA had

1948
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,420
it's not

1949
01:32:13,619 --> 01:32:18,658
it's not

1950
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:21,179
and so that's why and I and I S and I've

1951
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:25,198
seen fianos that came out of that skunk

1952
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:29,819
you know that that Underdog it was NL

1953
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:33,779
Scott NL Super Skunk times 91 and that

1954
01:32:29,819 --> 01:32:37,319
was not a big stretcher it kind of grew

1955
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:39,840
kind of kind of like the Kush but not as

1956
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:43,019
stretchy uh it was more of the bud

1957
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:46,920
structure it was more of a medium Stout

1958
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:49,440
plant uh it didn't yield very well but

1959
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:54,000
unfortunately

1960
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:57,119
um that that Underdog uh we killed it

1961
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,119
because of genetic drift uh it just

1962
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:04,380
petered out after a while and we had the

1963
01:33:00,119 --> 01:33:06,960
original cut and it just changed I I

1964
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:10,859
mean I I've seen it with different

1965
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:13,920
strains over the years not only strength

1966
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:16,679
strains that I've grown but strains that

1967
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,039
I've sold you know and I can remember

1968
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:23,219
the stuff the wheelchair used to be in

1969
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:26,760
in the city and uh I mean the early

1970
01:33:23,219 --> 01:33:28,920
wheelchair was exactly that wheelchair

1971
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:32,280
we I mean you would smoke that [ __ ] and

1972
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:34,639
you you were incapacitated uh towards

1973
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:38,460
the end it just kind of gotten like

1974
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:42,359
Bland and just kind of petered out and

1975
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:46,800
so uh yeah I I've seen genetic drift in

1976
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:48,238
in in strange just kind of just dud out
