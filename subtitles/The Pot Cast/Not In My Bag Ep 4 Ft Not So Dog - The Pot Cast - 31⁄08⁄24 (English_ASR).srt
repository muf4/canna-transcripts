36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,280
are you guys smoking

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,759
on what you smoking on there Francis you

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,000
know my buddy just down the street from

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,640
me me pulled down a bunch of his summer

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,159
depths and so he gave me like 10

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,118
different things to try and they're

42
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,920
about they got harvested maybe a month

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,280
ago so they're like right at the point

44
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,920
of like being you know good at this

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,439
point so just a bunch of a little bit of

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,879
he grew a little bit of my Sour Diesel

47
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,438
he grew some lemon haze he grew some

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,319
cookie hybrids because that's what the

49
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,398
market is and stuff like that so I've

50
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,919
just been puffing on all that fresh weed

51
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,000
that he was kind enough to want me to

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,960
try it's kind of been going down nice

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,680
yeah I'm in the same boat I just I'm

54
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,719
just hitting the point where uh I had

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
some plants that were at the top of my

56
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:17,598
potential keeper list and I wanted to

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,479
rev them so I went ahead and uh cut them

58
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,719
a little bit earlier than I would have

59
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,199
normally probably let them like max out

60
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,400
but they were good enough to really know

61
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,238
what they are but I wanted to give the

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,400
plants the best shot at revegging you

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,560
know because I like have good results

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,239
like they really quick if you don't let

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,560
them get all the way done um and so uh

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,959
those first tops that I cut off there's

67
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,840
probably like I don't know maybe 20 of

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,800
them or something that are just like

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,120
nice you know like long sticks of weed

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,159
with just those nice pieces building up

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,480
to the top it was so hot this summer

72
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:57,239
when they were flowering that the very

73
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,119
tops of the buds actually look like they

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,000
were like too close to a grow light or

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,920
something they don't look look very good

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,680
so the buds that are right I always like

77
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,559
the buds that are right a little lower

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,280
anyway more but um it's crazy because if

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,799
I judged by what the tip of the bud

80
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,360
looked like I'd be like this [ __ ] all

81
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,439
sucks you know because it was like a 100

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,799
plants were budding and and getting

83
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,759
close to finish week six week seven was

84
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,120
100 degrees 105 degrees 110 degre every

85
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,798
day for like two and a half weeks yeah

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,959
it was harsh yeah so um anyway so now

87
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm pulling off like the little branches

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,719
that are the driest off of those

89
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,879
and um just bonging some of those to see

90
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:40,479
which ones are uh are really cool and uh

91
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:42,919
so that's like Hindu s1's which are

92
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,798
really neat there'll be some types I got

93
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,359
one that's kind of similar to

94
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,040
like I mean it's been so long to really

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,120
say for sure but it's like kind of

96
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,598
similar like to the

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,200
effects that kind of like old like

98
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,399
Afghani with the really big features and

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,039
it's like was ugly in my gr but I can

100
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,438
tell if I could grow it right it's that

101
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,719
old it's the purplest it has the fattest

102
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:10,158
leaves it has the whitest resin and it

103
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,680
smells like kind of like gelato without

104
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,959
this without the sweetness or the cookie

105
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,959
part quite of it but it's like that kind

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,879
of like old meno humble Afghani smell

107
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,680
but like but not like monkey balls it's

108
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,680
different it's more gelato but it's

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,959
really cool that one I really like and

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,600
it's looking like it's going to rev and

111
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,478
uh and then you know like random other

112
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,840
Hindu hybrids and those are all the ones

113
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,839
that I have that's like my fresh weed

114
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,638
and as they dry like it's a lot easier

115
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,319
to keep up with sampling them it's like

116
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,079
okay this one's dry enough to smoke and

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,599
this one let's try these and then as

118
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,639
they go because at a certain point I'll

119
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,120
wind up swamped and be like okay now

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
there's 600 plants to try and at that

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,478
point you kind of have to sniff your way

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
through the wires and see what's the

123
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:00,240
most promising and because you know it

124
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
just gets like overwhelming but uh but

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,639
it's cool because there's more you see

126
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,279
the identity better and that's what

127
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,600
where I'm at right now with this time of

128
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,478
year it's pretty

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,160
sweet that's awesome I I love that I

130
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:17,439
love that I'm actually puffing on some

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,319
Abracadabra from my buddy Eli cash who I

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,120
did a little collab with making this one

133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,120
but he's done an awesome job growing it

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,079
it's like sour TK cross to uh chem

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
sister by Neville's Hayes which comes

136
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,439
from Wick's family farm so really like

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
chem sort of structure overall I thought

138
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,680
there'd be a bit more sativa influence

139
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,519
in it but like I guess the sour TK is

140
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,319
just such a solid looking structure

141
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,000
beautiful stuff I'm loving it shout out

142
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,000

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,639

analyzed the situation and they don't

165
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,439
feel it's in their financial interest to

166
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,038
pursue the case and that is the only

167
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,079
reason they're withdrawing it uh they

168
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,399
just don't feel like they're going to be

169
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,680
able to get enough money and they even

170
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,198
went so far as to say that they think

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
pursuing this case would end up

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,598
increasing the cost of the product

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,959
passed on to the end consumer and their

174
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,279
overall philosophy is to offer the

175
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,519
lowest price

176
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:08,559
possible I guess this does make me

177
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,598
wonder uh what does this say does this

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
suggest that maybe they weren't able to

179
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,639
prove that their product was not making

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
it into unlicensed cannabis markets or

181
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,038
do we believe them that it simply just

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
wasn't financially worth their time to

183
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,719
pursue the case what do we

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,079
think what what do you think there oh I

185
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,160
have a lot of thoughts on this one I

186
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,120
suppose I mean I will freely admit that

187
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,280
I did not read all of the legal filings

188
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,439
by any means I did follow it because it

189
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,878
is it is interesting um how all this

190
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:46,279
kind of stuff is shaking out and

191
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,960
um I

192
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:52,079
mean what is Glass House supposed to do

193
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,158
right like you get Elliot goes out there

194
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,120
and says you're one of the largest black

195
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:59,839
marketeers in American

196
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,038
history right like you have to sort of

197
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,318
act

198
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,439
outraged especially if you're one of the

199
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,759
large larger black marketeers in history

200
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:12,240
you know you really have to sort of like

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:16,680
um and I mean I I would say

202
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,240
that that glass house was created for

203
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,800
federal legalization and I think a lot

204
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,639
of the big big farms made a play in

205
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
California that Federal legalization

206
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,478
would come faster than it has and

207
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,680
there's just not the market to absorb

208
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,519
ABB all these giant

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,879
Farms so then the question becomes like

210
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,038
where do all these giant Farms excess go

211
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,799
to and that is a great unanswered

212
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,720
California question right now it's not

213
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,439
just glass house there's something like

214
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,040
1 1600 licensed acres in Santa

215
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,680
Barbara right uh glass house isn't even

216
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,480
in there they're like in Ventura or

217
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,639
something so if I had to guess what

218
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
happened is that neither company really

219
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,360
wanted Discovery or bunch of like on

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,959
record digging around and what's going

221
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,200
on behind the

222
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:10,439
scenes you know what I mean because uh

223
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,759
California legal is like it's it's a

224
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,800
little weird and I mean I as far as

225
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,519
glass house goes obviously their

226
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,719
products make it all kinds of places

227
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,240
they

228
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,040
shouldn't and you know whether or not

229
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
they have plausible deniability or

230
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,039
whether or not they know or don't

231
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,040
know you know they're obviously never

232
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,639
going to admit that they

233
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,639
know they have to act

234
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,519
shocked in a way right so it's like I

235
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,360
but but I mean I I'll tell you that

236
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,519
probably like if you looked at all the

237
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,039
legal sales in California probably like

238
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:55,360
one or like one 100 Acre Farm could

239
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:58,319
probably Supply most of California's

240
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,959
needs you start adding up one huge farm

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,800
with all the little Legacy farms and

242
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,199
then all the like two three four 500

243
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,519
lighters around and stuff that are

244
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,759
licensed

245
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:10,720
like you know there's a big thing with

246
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:13,078
glass house that has 100 acres and it in

247
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,720
green houses and it pops off multiple

248
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:18,639
rips a year and where does it

249
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,160
go and that's essentially the fight

250
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,838
between Catalyst and glass

251
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:28,519
house is he just called out the where

252
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,519
does it go part

253
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,360
yeah I

254
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,879
mean yeah like numbers wise I mean I

255
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,879
don't know anything about how

256
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,759
everybody's everybody's um you know I

257
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,480
don't know all I can't crunch the

258
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,480
numbers with any of that but I do know

259
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,039
that like one of my buddies up here is

260
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,879
like the number

261
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,240
two um

262
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,320
wholesaler in

263
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,600
California and he buys all of his weed

264
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,519
from small farms

265
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,480
and he buys it at a very low price and

266
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,440
he sells it at a very low

267
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,839
price so basically what he does is he

268
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,320
buys like quality outdoor and depth

269
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,000
mostly depth but you know whatever's

270
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,959
good and he sells e and he doesn't have

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,720
fancy marketing he basically has weed

272
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,879
that is consistently what we would

273
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,440
consider to be pretty good weed from

274
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,200
people who have been growing weed for a

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,519
long time people who we would know from

276
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,759
the old days and basically buys untrim

277
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,959
weed for $100 a

278
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:38,519
pound and uh comes in and takes

279
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,359
everything from people and it's

280
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,039
basically from people who otherwise

281
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,480
wouldn't be able to sell weed at all and

282
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:49,319
would have quit so they wind up still

283
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,879
having a fairly functional um business

284
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,278
because it's not that hard to grow a

285
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,278
thousand pounds when nobody's trying to

286
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:00,559
stop you so um if you can grow a 100

287
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,200
pounds and th000 pounds and not have to

288
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:08,319
trim it and sell it for $100 a pound

289
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,160
then it's not so bad compared to being

290
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,480
completely out of the game like a lot of

291
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,278
people are so he's actually him and his

292
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,639
brother have been able to keep people in

293
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:16,958
and I didn't know any of this was going

294
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,360
on it's been going on for years but I

295
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,719
didn't know it even existed so I was

296
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,360
talking to him and um he was like yeah

297
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,160
you know I'm we're we're doing good I'm

298
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
proud of my brother and you know he's

299
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,240
good good really good at business and

300
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,959
I'm really good at finding the good weed

301
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,360
and everything and

302
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,719
you know nobody like for me like I don't

303
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,480
wanna I don't I won't do that I don't

304
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,360
want to grow weed for $100 a pound but

305
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,519
some people um it's it actually gives

306
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,079
them something they can do but now

307
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:51,679
imagine that the guy who is the number

308
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:55,719
two provider of weed in California to

309
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:59,278
all the shops buys all his weed from

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,278
guys like us who probably the bigger of

311
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,000
them only grow maybe a ton of weed a

312
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,679
year which sounds a lot if you don't

313
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,559
grow a lot of weed but if you grow a lot

314
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,519
of weed you laugh at a ton of year a ton

315
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,000
of we I knew people in Humble who were

316
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:16,759
pumping out five tons a year under prop

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,639
215 and they were making a dent in any

318
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:23,159
kind of a market but in the legal Market

319
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,039
within California trapped within these

320
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,240
boundaries that you have to stay within

321
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:32,198
my buddy who's buying weed from small

322
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,839
farms is number two in the state yeah

323
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,719
and he is truly legit getting weed from

324
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,560
the small farms who people like Gavin

325
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,079
Newsome said would be the people who

326
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,719
would provide all the weed to everything

327
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:47,239
and then other than them who were number

328
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,720
two who are probably buying

329
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,560
supplying the second most amount of weed

330
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,120
in all of the state with probably a

331
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,958
pretty small acreage I imagine they're

332
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,519
probably buying all their weed from you

333
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,278
know 20 acres worth of people at the

334
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,360
most and that's number two so now when

335
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,360
you're saying these numbers like 160

336
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:12,440
acres in one County where 1600 acres in

337
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,600
one County 1600 Acres 1600 Acres so and

338
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,480
glass house isn't even in Santa Barbara

339
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,120
they're in ventera they don't even count

340
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,039
towards that total so just just imagine

341
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,720
that so are they so are they so these

342
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:28,480
other guys who have whatever they

343
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,519
have five times as much the acreage as

344
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,959
whose number

345
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,159
two where's the they're they're all

346
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:41,159
number one are they all number one

347
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,559
together are they and how is number just

348
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,360
if you think about the numbers it

349
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,758
doesn't make a lot of sense so and

350
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,879
that's basically what yeah I don't know

351
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,680
how CEO would rant about is he would

352
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,679
just screen because he has all the

353
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,958
numbers and he put him up on his

354
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,039
whiteboard because he's in the industry

355
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,679
and he knows what sales are he goes and

356
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:05,240
looks at like it's all public right and

357
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,359
I mean I will say maybe I I'll say this

358
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,159
before I forget about it it just came

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,519
out recently that glass house has

360
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:16,439
announced they're making a big move into

361
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,679
hemp right which is curious because it

362
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,120
comes right after like the Catalyst

363
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,519
going what are you doing with this 100

364
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,159
acres of green houses and weed and hemp

365
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,560
is something that they can actually sell

366
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,240
in all 50 states and maybe it's thca

367
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,638
if yeah so there might so there might be

368
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,720
a situation where they pivot because

369
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,480
like my opinion is is that if you set up

370
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,800
a huge scene intending on things going

371
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,680
National you can't sell enough in the

372
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,559
legal California Market to sustain

373
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,479
itself so you're burning investor money

374
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:50,838
and how many years can you burn investor

375
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,519
money you might have investors that are

376
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,680
like oh we'll wait it out but one year

377
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,278
turns into three turns into four and

378
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,519
they just keep burning and they don't

379
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,600
see any legislation coming down the pipe

380
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,159
that makes it look like it's going to be

381
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,959
soon and you have to

382
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,600
Pivot so I don't know I don't know if

383
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,359
we'll ever know because they dropped the

384
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,000
lawsuit on on they didn't want to move

385
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,440
it forward but um they changed their

386
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,958
practices after the lawsuit because now

387
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,440
they're going big into

388
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,919
hemp yeah and I mean that's the question

389
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,600
the hemp the hemp thing is really

390
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,599
interesting because I keep hearing

391
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,120
people talking about oh yeah thca hemp

392
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,720
and I'm like yeah

393
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,720
um weed before you heat it up in general

394
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,240
I mean I've had stuff that if it's you

395
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,720
know the certain strains it sits around

396
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,759
for a little bit of time like you'll

397
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,079
you'll start to see some some

398
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,839
numbers uh that aren't thca but in

399
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,359
general when you see people's weed get

400
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,399
tested it's just all

401
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,680
thca I heard there's laws dude that they

402
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:02,039
might block the THC from hemp as a

403
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,838
pathway I mean they already have is

404
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,879
what's crazy is that it's this it's this

405
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:10,078
little detail of people going well it's

406
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,280
thca and I'm like yeah I mean my whole

407
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:16,720
Al the I grow is thca hemp like OG Kush

408
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:22,359
you heard of that thca hemp Sour Diesel

409
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:25,078
pretty good thca hemp like until it has

410
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,000
actually turned into to Delta 9 which

411
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,720
only happens sometimes like and it

412
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,038
doesn't generally happen while it's in

413
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,919
the field you know so that's all the

414
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,879
funny thing and now what's really weird

415
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:41,280
was I go to I go to um the store in

416
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:46,960
Willets where I buy dog food and on the

417
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:51,000
counter is a thing that is THC Delta 9

418
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:55,400
hemp Edibles and I'm like I've heard of

419
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,038
Delta 8 and I know a a Trippy trick with

420
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,559
the hemp but Delta 9 Edibles on the the

421
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:05,119
counter at a store that has no kind of

422
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,839
anything there I'm like I don't know if

423
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,558
it's a typo or what but like this is

424
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,399
just weed guys so the regulation I'm

425
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,440
like What's even what are what the [ __ ]

426
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,679
is anybody doing right now it's crazy to

427
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,000
see like okay thca hemp THC Delta 9

428
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,559
Edibles and the store you know like it's

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,640
just like I don't know the the whole

430
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,000
thing's really weird it's a lot of um I

431
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,520
don't know there's not a lot of clarity

432
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,720
on what the

433
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:38,038
um the real lines and andies of all of

434
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,519
it are so all this to say that yeah I

435
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,599
mean like you know like if you're if

436
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:46,639
hemp is easier to produce and hemp you

437
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:49,079
can ship Nationwide then like you know

438
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,200
then just ship whatever weed Nationwide

439
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,158
and say it's thca because it probably is

440
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,159
and so I'm I'm sure at a certain point

441
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,679
they'll go wait THC it's like back in

442
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,000
the day they're like oh no this isn't

443
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,519
Cannabis sativa this is cannabis

444
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,480
IND and for a little while people got

445
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,960
away with being like no no no look at

446
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,640
these plants are not the illegal one

447
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,558
this is cannabis indica and that's

448
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,240
what's going on right now and I wouldn't

449
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,119
even want to talk about it except that

450
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,038
it's so ridiculous that it even exists

451
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,279
that there's no way it has any legs on

452
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,279
it the time frame here is like the

453
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,119
windows gota it's the windows already

454
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,720
basically got to be closed and it's

455
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,000
happened to certain people in certain

456
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,919
places already but like uh the whole

457
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,038
thing's weird it's it's really a weird

458
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,400
weird time and um you know everybody can

459
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:38,558
always figure out some kind of a Trippy

460
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
loophole and then everybody just blows

461
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,678
it out and then it's shot and like by

462
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,558
the time I know about it because I'm not

463
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,038
involved in any of it I'm like it's it's

464
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,480
got to be shot I don't see how this is

465
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:51,919
Gonna Keep um going like that but hey

466
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,839
great way to Pivot right now to go yeah

467
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,360
H I mean yeah the the funny part about

468
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,839
that would even be is if they just kept

469
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,000
doing what they were doing but then they

470
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,959
just brought it above board and they're

471
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,519
like oh yeah we're shipping it

472
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,240
everywhere but it's

473
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,679
hemp yeah so this this whole time as

474
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,839
long as we've had a hemp permit we've

475
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,320
been shipping thca hemp

476
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:16,639
everywhere you know and then it's like

477
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:20,240
oh what kind of THC hemp oh I don't know

478
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,000
runs I would I I would and the only

479
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,640
closing thought I really have on it

480
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,558
would basically be is that glass house

481
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,159
is a funny name to be talking about or

482
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:31,079
whatever because the

483
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,760
California weed industry is kind of a

484
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,798
glass house where you're not supposed to

485
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,879
look around certain corners and like

486
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,079
there's a blind eye turned to like a lot

487
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,799
of the inefficiencies and a lot of just

488
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:46,199
the reality of what they've created you

489
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:49,759
know and and so yeah I think that

490
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,960
um uh obviously glass house is not like

491
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,679
us you know whatsoever they're not

492
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,000
stocked by People Like Us they're kind

493
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,919
of the people that are trying to come in

494
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,679
and take it from us and they might have

495
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,679
just timed it wrong I think they opened

496
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,559
up Glass House in an already sat

497
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,120
completely saturated California Market

498
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:13,240
when all the news was already on how

499
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,678
much more Supply there was than demand

500
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,640
and then they brought a 100 acres of

501
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,440
greenhouse on and so they obviously I

502
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,278
think they thought that legalization was

503
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,600
a good chance within a year or two and

504
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,558
it's just stretched and now they're

505
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,038
stretched because they're not returning

506
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,240
their money to I think there's a bunch

507
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,798
of not just glass house I think there's

508
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,919
a bunch of huge California cannabis

509
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,918
companies that their investors are

510
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,600
starting to get nervous about the lack

511
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,559
of returns and the money

512
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,319
expended and we could see a lot of

513
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,839
weirdness in the next five or 10 years

514
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,240
that that that shakes out yeah and with

515
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,240
some of the biggest you've already seen

516
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,839
it you know we already um I think the

517
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,679
last one we already talked about you

518
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,519
know medmen gone Vegas the biggest the

519
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,720
biggest thing ever it's GNA they own

520
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,519
Vegas you go everywhere you go it's the

521
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,360
those are the stores you want to get

522
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,599
something pretty much you ask somebody

523
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:08,079
where's the the store that's the store

524
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:09,719
and they're shot like it's loana by us

525
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,678
yeah right here that one was done that

526
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,120
was the biggest one up here and the one

527
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,200
that was like 275 million they raised

528
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,959
you know and then yeah we talked about

529
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,240
before I think cookies and cookies

530
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,960
investors getting all mad at them and

531
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,599
different lawsuits filed and then

532
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,759
dropped quickly kind of like this one

533
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,759
where there's a lot of money sloshing

534
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,919
around and there's not a lot of money

535
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,879
being made yeah and it's all yeah it's

536
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,520
those huge those huge machines you know

537
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,120
and it's like I'm talking about my buddy

538
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,440
um who comes from a family who's like

539
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,798
you know like his his dad's like like a

540
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,679
world famous weed guy from like the 60s

541
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,519
from down south like the whole like all

542
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,360
kinds of lore in their family and all

543
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,679
this and um that he got into it and I

544
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,319
didn't you know I always see him doing

545
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,960
his little hustle and stuff and I never

546
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,798
talked to him and knew what was going on

547
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,480
and he's like yeah we basically we're

548
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:07,480
selling weed to stores by the eth buying

549
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,720
it by the pound buying it really cheap

550
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,519
by the pound selling it really cheap by

551
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,000
the eth and it's good weed and we don't

552
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,839
do any of the fancy [ __ ] and we don't

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,400
even they don't even white label it they

554
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,399
put it in the stores on the shelves in

555
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,559
their simple little bags and it's the

556
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,759
best value it's good value weed and that

557
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,000
is actually working and it's keeping all

558
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,679
these little Farmers going and they

559
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,319
actually still have pretty good income

560
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:38,559
relative to what's going on for

561
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:41,480
everybody else and they're really really

562
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:45,399
big in the scheme of what is actually

563
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,360
going on at the stores and um the same

564
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,320
with some of the Buddies like from up in

565
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:53,798
um humble you know like um you know like

566
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:56,278
uh to up there redwood redwood Roots

567
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:58,679
like they put together little stuff and

568
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:00,960
uh what's the other one humble homegrown

569
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,360
like they're able to like just keep

570
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,880
going there's always like you'll see

571
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,479
these posts where he's like dude I'm

572
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,440
losing my mind I'm so stressed out and

573
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,079
he's like tearing up and then like

574
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,840
pretty soon he's back he's like all

575
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,599
right I figured something out come hit

576
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,278
me up you know and then they're like

577
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,639
keeping it going and that's like the

578
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:21,319
nature of like reality but it's not

579
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,240
reality when people come in and they're

580
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,519
just like oh yeah we're GNA be we're

581
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,599
going to be the you know the Amazon of

582
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,519
weed or whatever it's like H good luck I

583
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,240
don't think that you can just keep

584
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,759
dumping money

585
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,679
endlessly into doing all that stuff and

586
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,798
I don't even mean like within California

587
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm like go ahead and figure out

588
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:42,798
whatever however you can make it work

589
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,359
cool fine with me I just don't think

590
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,278
that it's sustainable I don't think it

591
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,519
does work you know and it's a trip

592
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:52,359
because um you know that's like the from

593
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,519
the outside that's what everyone thinks

594
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,199
is the thing to do and it's even you

595
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,119
know like it was I probably back around

596
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,880
the time when Medical came in in the

597
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,839
early 2000s I started telling my friends

598
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,919
I was like dude going small is the new

599
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:10,398
way to go big now going big is just such

600
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,038
a huge risk and then you get screwed and

601
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:14,798
you get nothing and it's like basically

602
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,440
like okay do you wanna it's like the

603
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,038
difference between getting a job

604
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,960
painting houses and being like dude I'm

605
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,720
gonna go to the casino with everything I

606
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,558
got and put it all on one number you

607
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,759
know and it's like oh [ __ ] all right

608
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,240
damn all right I'm out you know but then

609
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,480
somebody else is just doing their job

610
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,880
and they're like I don't know everything

611
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,519
seems okay to me and that's kind of how

612
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,559
it is is these guys are going for these

613
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,440
huge pushes and these huge things and

614
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,558
then like the people who are like ah

615
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,480
it's kind of rough I'm kind of broke but

616
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:44,759
they just keep plugging along like they

617
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,120
they can do it because like it's like

618
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,398
that's what's real life you know as bad

619
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,918
as it was uh when prop 64 passed if they

620
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,439
would have kept the acre cap it would

621
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,240
have kept all this giant waste of money

622
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,120
from being poured in l before it was

623
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,038
ready for that kind of investment anyway

624
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:05,798
yeah I mean the only thing that I saw

625
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:09,319
when they first did that is I know how

626
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,519
people are and it would have been like I

627
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,519
as soon as they were like oh there'll be

628
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,639
a one acre cap and I was like yeah and

629
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:21,679
there's G to be a lot of names on

630
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,200
paper that are all vaguely if you really

631
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,519
look into it they're actually all the

632
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,080
same thing you know like somebody would

633
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,599
be holding 100 permit and they would be

634
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,558
you know it's like we you remember like

635
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,558
in the days of medical people would be

636
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,319
like yeah dude I have 1300 scripts yeah

637
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,200
went down and collected all of them and

638
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:40,519
I got all these patients and stuff yeah

639
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,880
and then you like you like talk to

640
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,839
somebody else they might have the same

641
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,799
1300 scripts you know like you know

642
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,639
really I called it the paper Shield yeah

643
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:51,278
yeah because if they landed it was like

644
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,480
you bring out your paper shield and

645
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:57,919
you're like I got I'm safe I'm on base

646
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,720
yeah and it and you know that was still

647
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,679
um

648
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,798
in those cases that's what's weird is

649
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,840
like a lot of people can grow a couple

650
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,519
tons of weed people smoke a lot of weed

651
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,038
it's it's it's you know it's perishable

652
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,839
and it's consumable so when you have

653
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,960
things like that you can be like yeah we

654
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:19,639
can produce a lot of products and it can

655
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,960
still you know be used as opposed to if

656
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,240
you were you know you really have to

657
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,640
control um Supply when you have

658
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,038
something that's like you know like like

659
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,600
diamonds right if you just have them all

660
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:35,158
out and they're all over the place then

661
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,759
it's just going to everything's going to

662
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,399
crash but people could do people could

663
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,000
have a lot of weed relative to um demand

664
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:46,918
and it would still be okay but at a

665
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,880
certain point you just it's just stupid

666
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,600
and that's you know like it it's it's

667
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,840
trippy because I think

668
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:59,398
in the legal Market there's

669
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,558
probably uh small enough po of people

670
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,158
who if they were clever enough and they

671
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:07,319
really could understand like the nature

672
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,200
of [ __ ] everything or anything for

673
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:13,158
that matter they'd be like hey you know

674
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,240
what we could completely control the

675
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,000
price because we are the biggest and

676
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,720
since they're big enough to control the

677
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,558
price what do they do they drop it out

678
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,399
the floor and overproduce and it's like

679
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,240
when you able to have such a limited

680
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:30,038
pool of production there's only so many

681
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,798
people with huge permits all those guys

682
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:37,038
could go hey let's put let's put 95% of

683
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,720
our permit to sleep let's follow it and

684
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,960
let's just make the price go through the

685
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,159
roof and maybe they will eventually when

686
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,759
they get enough control but I don't

687
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,440
think I think no matter what they're

688
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:51,079
still going to all just be like how how

689
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,440
do we make more $30 pounds of weed like

690
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,599
through the up to this up to the Moon

691
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,960
they're just going to try to do it

692
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,839
without ever thinking about it and I

693
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,840
mean you know

694
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:02,000
it seems like that would be impossible

695
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,720
that they would do that but they've

696
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,960
already done so much of it it makes me

697
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,360
wonder you know it's a tsunami of mids

698
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,480
yeah that's what it is it's it's the

699
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,398
it's the tsunami of mids all right we

700
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,759
probably have chatted that one to death

701
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,239
oh for sure yeah it's terrible uh yeah

702
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,759
but I expect more

703
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,798
lawsuits anyway I expect more lawsuits

704
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,599
between more people fighting in

705
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,440
California over the next five or 10

706
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:31,158
years yeah for sure this is just is just

707
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,919
the first wave of arguments about how

708
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,080
it's all going yeah for sure of course

709
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,880
now look the whole time we've been

710
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,798
chatting I've been thinking I'm just

711
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,000
going to draw us back to the original uh

712
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,879
question for a moment it feels a bit

713
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,240
like in the first episode I think we

714
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,799
were talking about how this issue was

715
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,278
like the emperor wearing no clothes you

716
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,278
know like we know we know this weed's

717
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:56,599
going somewhere and we see a lot of weed

718
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,558
popping up somewhere else so I guess my

719
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,879
question is now that someone's finally

720
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:05,879
called it out and seemingly nothing is

721
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,799
going to happen as a result do we think

722
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,200
Glass House product will just continue

723
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:10,440
and nothing will happen what do we think

724
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,240
it's actually going to happen if

725
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,240
anything or do we think business as

726
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,558
usual I might get a little

727
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,640
conspiratorial here I suppose but do it

728
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:25,639
aliens um I think the I think the reason

729
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,679
why a drug cop is one of the top people

730
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,880
in the company is because it bu immunity

731
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,240
from other like they they're kind of a

732
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,919
click and a club they don't go after

733
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,200
their

734
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,559
own and despite that I also think that

735
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,759
there is just a big push in California

736
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,599
to like not expose anyone big because

737
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,839
those people pay a lot in fees and

738
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,839
overhead and taxes and all this stuff

739
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,199
and they just don't want to admit that

740
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,439
the system that they developed isn't

741
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,360
working very

742
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,600
well or as designed and so there's a lot

743
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,479
of management going on and it's like you

744
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,398
know I mean some of those farms in Santa

745
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,599
Barbara probably pay this the state over

746
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:09,599
a million do just in license

747
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,600
fees you

748
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,440
know like you know small farms pay a

749
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,158
tiny amount it might be a big amount to

750
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,759
that small farm but like the bigger

751
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,120
places like really spend a lot of money

752
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,798
and so there's all this investor money

753
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,038
pouring in and there's all this taxes

754
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,240
getting made and all these local

755
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,119
municipalities are making money it's

756
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,440
almost like a I almost see it as like a

757
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,439
financial bubble that's going to

758
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,599
burst

759
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,558
like this might be getting off Target

760
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,480
for a second but imagine right when

761
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,519
Federal legalization does come there's a

762
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,639
bunch of states that have a lot of

763
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,798
infrastructure money spent on their

764
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:51,959
personal legalization that aren't going

765
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:55,200
to be able to compete with other states

766
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,038
because of their climate and

767
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,880
whatnot you know

768
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:03,278
like seriously like are you like you

769
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,440
know are you really going to are you

770
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,319
really going to have a bunch of outdoor

771
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,639
in New York compared to California or

772
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,839
Southern Oregon probably not just like

773
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,240
every other crop we grow in this country

774
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,558
we'll probably find out where the most

775
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,200
advantageous place to grow it is based

776
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,918
on the climate and whatnot and it'll get

777
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,038
shipped everywhere

778
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,000
else the only reason why people are

779
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:27,558
growing in Missouri and New York and

780
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,638
Maine and here and there and everywhere

781
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,599
else mostly is because it's a

782
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:34,678
state-by-state thing and it all has to

783
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:37,079
happen within that state so I think each

784
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,600
state has been sucking up a whole bunch

785
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:43,439
of investment and like buildout

786
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:45,918
money and blue collar and unions getting

787
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,360
built and electricians and construction

788
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,880
and all this different stuff and then

789
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:54,199
it's like you know is that stuff going

790
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,720
to persist once there's competition from

791
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,120
Arizona and California and places where

792
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
it's sunny and dry every

793
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,359
day

794
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,038
maybe I doubt it

795
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,278
though so I I think it's like a m I

796
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,119
think it's like a I think it's like a

797
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,599
state-by-state money grab in a

798
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:13,798
way because each state is building out

799
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,480
but like think think about it on a

800
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:17,240
different level right like you don't

801
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,159
grow Citrus in New

802
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,519
York you grew it in Orange County in

803
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:27,278
Florida right like you go crops where

804
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,720
they're suited yeah for sure and then

805
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:32,679
related too to the legality of it and

806
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,679
the same thing of state by state like

807
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,200
during alcohol prohibition there was a

808
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,559
time

809
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,038
um

810
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:44,599
when there were certain counties and

811
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:45,798
certain places where you could pay the

812
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,000
local

813
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:52,319
authorities and you could basically

814
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:57,240
bribe them and then you could operate

815
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:59,398
your operation there legally and then uh

816
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,159
the value wasn't as high there because

817
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,918
of that but once you took it somewhere

818
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:10,398
else your alcohol gained huge amounts of

819
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:14,800
value and so um you know it's like one

820
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:17,199
of those things where even now although

821
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,320
There's real

822
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:23,158
um regulation on these smaller levels

823
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,838
and people are like oh well it's State's

824
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,440
rights and you know County rights City

825
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,480
rights which all that is cool but at the

826
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,960
same time if you really look at it it's

827
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,000
kind of like yeah but being that it's

828
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:40,240
not really legal legal um it's really

829
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,039
kind of just a big extortion plot if you

830
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,719
look at it in relation to how things

831
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,639
were during that time because you go

832
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,838
well what's the difference really is you

833
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,919
get some paperwork doesn't really mean

834
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:57,838
anything because it's not really you

835
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:01,759
know it's not really legal but I mean it

836
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,639
is in is in a different sense but um you

837
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,640
know the whole thing of it being these

838
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:10,879
little place bypl things it's like it's

839
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:14,879
all kind of uh it's it's kind of like

840
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,800
you're just paying to do a crime

841
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,960
otherwise why is it a crime you know

842
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
what I mean like it's doesn't I that's

843
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,199
the biggest thing I've never understood

844
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,880
is you hand somebody a piece of paper

845
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,960
and now it's not immoral anymore like so

846
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,480
it's illegal because it's dangerous and

847
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:35,079
immoral that's the whole reason why weed

848
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,280
is illegal and then if you give somebody

849
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,920
a permit to grow it and sell it then all

850
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,880
of a sudden it becomes like fine totally

851
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,680
fine this is going to tie into one of

852
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,960
our segments of uh of uh you know when

853
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:53,239
it's legal it's clean yeah for sure yeah

854
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,679
of course

855
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:59,679
well saying as seeing as the cat has

856
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:03,639
been L out of the bag we will move on to

857
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:06,838
our next discussion point which is that

858
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,838
let me see am I am I

859
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,639
quick the LA times has published an

860
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:15,920
article where they have slammed a bunch

861
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,239
of extremely well-known popular hype

862
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,318
cannabis companies accusing them of

863
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:24,078
being riddled with pesticides as well as

864
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:27,679
being quite substantially off in regards

865
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,960
to the stated potency the end conclusion

866
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,919
is pretty much that a lot of the weed

867
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,599
being sold by some of these top

868
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,240
companies is basically being given to

869
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,000
them by the same Brokers the weed is

870
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,279
sort of sold between them sold to them

871
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,920
um and then they basically end up

872
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,200
selling it to the user I guess the

873
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,000
question becomes is this really that

874
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:52,279
surprising is this something we truly

875
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,280
didn't expect so to

876
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:58,559
speak I mean I think

877
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
that all the uh I don't want to say like

878
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,119
uh cannabis insiders or whatever but no

879
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,480
I don't think it's surprising it

880
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,960
certainly is 180° around their rhetoric

881
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,599
of what they thought the differences

882
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,838
were going to be um but no I wouldn't

883
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,160
say it was surprising at

884
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:20,920
all you know I I think that um I mean

885
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,879
for one thing you know it's like we

886
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,079
should say there's a lot of brands that

887
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,559
are not vertically integrated and do do

888
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,760
not grow and control their product from

889
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,519
the be they they source source material

890
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,720
whether that's flour crude or distillate

891
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:40,199
or like whatever it might be they have a

892
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:42,039
brand and there's a lot of brands that

893
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:43,719
like they might have like business

894
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,719
arrangements with Farms but they don't

895
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,159
run the

896
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,759
farm they're just buying on the open

897
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:53,440
market like stuff that meets their

898
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,200
criteria right and so as a result of

899
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,720
that the cheapest weed that you can buy

900
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,639
for your brand is probably some of these

901
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,000
huge

902
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,719
farms that we were just talking about

903
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,039
because they have the most volume so

904
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,439
they can offer it at the lowest price

905
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,838
and those large Farms have a tendency to

906
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,639
just they want to win and whether

907
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:13,480
they're spraying stuff themselves or

908
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,598
whether there's another large farm next

909
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,159
to them that's growing conventional

910
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,160
stuff that gets sprayed or you know any

911
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:24,440
number of ways um it's the problem it's

912
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,679
a good thing cannabis has much more

913
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,318
stringent testing requirements than our

914
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,318
food

915
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:32,800
but when you start growing in an Agland

916
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:35,800
surrounded by that kind of thing the the

917
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,318
chance for it being contaminated is

918
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,640
high there's even a lot of these Farms I

919
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:44,199
should mention that um their ground is

920
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:47,000
contaminated and will be for

921
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:50,519
decades as far as like stuff that that

922
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,159
tests hot for cannabis you could grow

923
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,239
cauliflower on it or whatever and

924
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,519
probably be fine but for cannabis

925
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,159
there's a lot of ban pesticides for

926
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:02,599
cannabis that is just persistent in

927
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:06,519
Agland and these huge farms are all

928
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,519
growing on Old Agland for the most

929
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,800
part you know so it doesn't surprise me

930
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,639
at all no because most of these brands

931
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,000
are probably not sourcing it from small

932
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,279
farmers that have less of a chance of

933
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
using some of that funky stuff they're

934
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,599
probably buying it on a much larger

935
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,599
market in

936
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,399
bulk and just as a quick side point I

937
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,960
wanted to add because someone actually

938
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,000
asked me why is it that like you can use

939
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,960
certain pesticides and even like pgrs on

940
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,480
certain Edibles and whatnot but like

941
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,760
it's so bad on cannabis and um you know

942
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,159
many of you will be aware of this but

943
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,960
it's just as simple as like because

944
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,480
cannabus has ended up being you know

945
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,960
volatized or vaporized in some form it's

946
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,559
it's going to get directly into your

947
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,720
body whereas a lot of these products

948
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,400
when they're on the surface of like a

949
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,039
tomato or whatever you eat it it doesn't

950
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
really get absorbed so it's it's not as

951
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,279
concerning but just a quick little tibit

952
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,879
I wanted to throw in but Mr main Jan

953
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,519
fill us in on your thoughts I could

954
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,440
actually add something before I forget

955
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,440
that's kind of cool about what you just

956
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,519
mentioned so there's this product that I

957
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,039
don't like at all called Eagle 20 that's

958
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,480
a Fungicide and the reason why they

959
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:17,318
approve it for food is they say the

960
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:23,358
chemical is broken down by your stomach

961
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:25,639
really quickly right but if you burn it

962
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:29,318
you know flow that has it on it it

963
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:29,318
creates a byproduct of cyan

964
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,960
right and so obviously you don't want to

965
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:39,760
be inhaling hot cyanide on any level um

966
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,079
so and then two I think which is good I

967
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,640
think cannabis has a stricter testing

968
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,519
regimen and that our food should move in

969
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,879
probably in that same direction too it's

970
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,800
almost like they made it more strict but

971
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,400
that's positive and we should be moving

972
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,119
away from a lot of those harsh chems in

973
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,000
our food supply as

974
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,119
well yeah yeah because when you do that

975
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it it gives people an incentive to try

976
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,599
to figure out something else the problem

977
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,679
with the way that um the legalization

978
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:14,800
and regulation went is that it's leaning

979
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:17,919
toward that big a model like he's saying

980
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,640
where you use all these crazy harmful

981
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:26,039
chemicals and they're not made for

982
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:27,759
combustible products they're made for uh

983
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:31,480
consumable edible products products and

984
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:36,200
when you eat things your digestive tract

985
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,880
is really impressive like if you drink

986
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,519
chlorinated water very little chlorine

987
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,880
goes in your system but if you bathe or

988
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,159
swim in chlorinated water you can absorb

989
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,880
a lot more you know so it's like the

990
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,440
there's there's a difference between how

991
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,160
everything works in your lungs really

992
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,039
take things in super gnarly you know you

993
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:59,799
could eat small amounts of things things

994
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,599
that are really toxic and your body

995
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,800
will'll deal with it you know your body

996
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,559
has your kidneys it has your liver it

997
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,280
has these different systems of

998
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,119
filtration and purification in your your

999
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,800
um you know everything in your gut and

1000
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,000
everything that lives in your gut but

1001
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,880
your lungs are just this clean area of

1002
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,440
something that just everything goes

1003
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,280
straight into your blood through your

1004
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,400
lungs basically because they're meant to

1005
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,800
take in the oxygen and the oxygen has to

1006
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,880
readily be sucked into your lungs which

1007
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,880
makes smoking weed great you smoke it

1008
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,800
andam the thing that should be mentioned

1009
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,079
about that is that right after that all

1010
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,119
that oxygen oxygenated blood go straight

1011
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,880
to your heart yes so whatever's going in

1012
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,920
there is going to your heart as fast as

1013
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,079
your body can get it there because and

1014
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,200
then push around the rest of your body

1015
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,480
yeah for sure and then it goes

1016
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,719
everywhere then it pumps through your

1017
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,000
whole body and then it and then it winds

1018
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,519
up after that going through the

1019
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,639
filtration after it gets into your blood

1020
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:01,159
you know where so it's

1021
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:03,000
interesting difference but yeah the um

1022
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,639
the question of was it is it a surprise

1023
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,358
is it's like no if

1024
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:12,799
you if you want to get things from the

1025
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:16,199
biggest producers of something that's a

1026
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,880
plant anybody who grows knows the bigger

1027
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:23,719
you go the more likely you are to have a

1028
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:26,680
failure of your crop and the bigger the

1029
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:29,199
failure the more costly it is so when

1030
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:33,078
people find out that okay we're about to

1031
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:35,558
lose this whole crop and this crop is

1032
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:39,039
eight tons of weed or whatever it is

1033
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,920
they're like okay so can we get away

1034
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,279
with this stuff is this gonna you think

1035
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,358
this is going to pass testing I don't

1036
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,240
know have you seen it I don't know and

1037
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,920
then they grow the whole thing they hit

1038
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,598
it with something really nasty and they

1039
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,920
get all the way to the end of it and

1040
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,200
they're left with all this tainted

1041
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,800
product but guess

1042
00:43:53,199 --> 00:44:00,199
what you can't test a whole batch you

1043
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,480
can only test a sample from a batch well

1044
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:04,118
is this sample from the batch yeah of

1045
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,920
course the sample's from the batch you

1046
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,920
know we would never uh take a sample

1047
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,800
from a different batch that we know is

1048
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,440
100% clean that we got from a much

1049
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,960
smaller producer or from a different

1050
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,318
section where we had a little bit of

1051
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,519
weed that wasn't even supposed to be

1052
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:23,800
sold but hey we know it's at least clean

1053
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:27,639
so you know maybe sometimes that is

1054
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,519
happen or even like even like uh

1055
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:31,039
there's certain band things that get

1056
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,519
pulled out when you just turn it into

1057
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:36,400
distillates so like if you're knowing

1058
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,400
that you're growing a a a big ass field

1059
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,760
just for basically for disty as they

1060
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,920
call it like you might even be able to

1061
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,800
like hit your stuff with some nasty

1062
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,000
chems because you think it's all going

1063
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,920
to get pulled

1064
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,159
out yeah you know and so it's just being

1065
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,000
it's one of those things where it's

1066
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:55,558
like it almost makes me feel like like

1067
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,159
with food or whatever it's like don't

1068
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,040
ask how the sausage was made

1069
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,480
yeah right um a lot of rules and

1070
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,679
regulations right now are sort of

1071
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,920
bumping up against the reality of what

1072
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,199
people want to

1073
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,400
do um and the pesticide thing and the

1074
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:12,838
herbicides and all that like people just

1075
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,440
don't realize that like when I met a

1076
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,279
bunch people in big a that I thought

1077
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,480
were going to crush us I didn't realize

1078
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,559
how Reliant they were on all these chems

1079
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,000
in their toolkit to be able to grow and

1080
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,119
they almost felt helpless when some of

1081
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,239
these chem and some of these you know

1082
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,838
ban pesticides or whatever are removed

1083
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,439
because they've literally leaned on them

1084
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,558
their whole career and they don't have

1085
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,920
another method to solve whatever problem

1086
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,760
it might be so it's like they almost get

1087
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,200
insulted when they find out they can't

1088
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,760
use it on

1089
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,679
weed

1090
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,839
right um and

1091
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:50,639
then um as far as the as far as the THC

1092
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:53,759
inaccurate testing goes as long as

1093
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:57,519
there's a Marketplace that stupidly is

1094
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,599
basing pricing on THC content

1095
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:03,039
there's been a THC

1096
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,720
creep um you know for going on for a

1097
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,800
long time now and it's it's just going

1098
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:12,558
to continually get worse um and then the

1099
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,240
other thing I should say too is that um

1100
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,200
some of these big

1101
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,639
farms they're the they're the lab's

1102
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:21,799
biggest

1103
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:24,920
clients and the lab the lab might be

1104
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,559
testing for THC and tpes and all their

1105
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,200
pesticide and herbicide and heavy metals

1106
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,640
testing and all that so some of these

1107
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:35,439
huge farms like literally like could be

1108
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,318
the difference between like a lab

1109
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,079
surviving or not because they're getting

1110
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,838
hundreds of thousands of dollars from

1111
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:46,079
this company so that everything's

1112
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,838
clean so there's like it's not

1113
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,400
independent I'm I guess what I'm saying

1114
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:54,759
and there's a vested interest within

1115
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,760
multiple parties to get a

1116
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,639
result that's kind of how I look it have

1117
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:03,800
you ever seen this uh documentary about

1118
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,879
the Russian doping in the Olympic called

1119
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,318
Icarus uh I haven't no no I have not

1120
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,200
it's really interesting so you watch it

1121
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:16,318
and basically it just is a great example

1122
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:19,159
of how when you have when you have

1123
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:23,519
organizations that are established and

1124
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:26,920
exist over time right and everything

1125
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:30,559
kind of keeps up the same pace and

1126
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:34,119
status quo over a long period of time

1127
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:37,000
they start to gain this relationship

1128
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:40,880
where everybody knows how everything

1129
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,119
works and after a while it's not hard to

1130
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,838
game the system in one way or another

1131
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,720
and it's not also if things are in place

1132
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,880
long enough then you actually insert

1133
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:52,239
your own people into these organizations

1134
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,800
to make sure you know that's how police

1135
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,679
corruption often works that's how you

1136
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,000
know you might be able to get you know a

1137
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:03,960
judge or a DA or a congress person or

1138
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,599
whatever it is that you need to be able

1139
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,199
to put these things in place and like in

1140
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,760
our in our in our you know the greater

1141
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,118
system of the United States it's not

1142
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,559
uncommon to see that oh the guy who used

1143
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:21,200
to work for Monsanto and cell Roundup

1144
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:25,040
now he's the guy at the at the FDA or

1145
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:27,239
the USDA or there's all these conflicts

1146
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,639
of interests that arrive naturally and

1147
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,000
like in this documentary you see that

1148
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,199
it's like they were able to figure out

1149
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,519
like the unbeatable system there's no

1150
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,279
way around this system and then they're

1151
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,039
like yeah we we know how to do it you

1152
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,760
really want to do it and and so they

1153
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,119
they basically gamed the system and

1154
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,280
figured out a way to where they could

1155
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,880
they could tamper with these samples and

1156
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,079
then they would you know they would just

1157
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,318
do this little just this little dance

1158
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,039
that was really simple you know and um

1159
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,159
they were able to figure that out and I

1160
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:59,960
mean that's naturally always going to

1161
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:02,118
happen with any kind of a testing

1162
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,358
organization at a certain point you're

1163
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,640
going to get Bad actors in there and

1164
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:12,078
that's not to say even that I have so

1165
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:15,039
much a problem with that type of um

1166
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,280
corruption because it's not so much to

1167
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:22,000
me it's not the issue it's just the fact

1168
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,720
that they The Regulators are going to

1169
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,519
pretend that everything is completely

1170
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,439
bulletproof and we know exactly what's

1171
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,519
going going on and they're going to make

1172
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,920
all the Growers jump through all these

1173
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:37,599
hoops and in reality anybody who wants

1174
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,720
to game the system can game the system

1175
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,079
and all the people who want to be honest

1176
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:42,838
are just going to be like all right we

1177
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:46,119
just have a bunch of Hoops to jump

1178
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,480
through that only keep us from doing bad

1179
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:49,798
stuff and we're not the guys who are

1180
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,400
going to use the pesticides but we still

1181
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:53,079
have to test for them to show that our

1182
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,639
stuff's clean when anyone who knows us

1183
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,599
knows it's clean but these guys who you

1184
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,239
just obviously are going to be the ones

1185
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,000
with the dirty weed because you see how

1186
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:03,959
they're how much weed they're growing at

1187
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,719
scale those are the guys who are going

1188
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,440
to wind up faking the test test testing

1189
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,279
this they don't even have to do any of

1190
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,798
this [ __ ] like in the movie that I'm

1191
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,839
talking about it doesn't have to be

1192
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:15,358
complicated they just give the lab a

1193
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,639
sample of some weed they already know is

1194
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,159
clean and they're like this is the batch

1195
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,679
and they're like okay we tested the

1196
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:22,759
batch you know and they can just test

1197
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:24,598
the same they can just put one clean

1198
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,160
pound of weed away that has super high

1199
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,960
THC and go this is the test for all of

1200
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:31,000
it and then they can go oh and here's

1201
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,920
the sample for the turps here if they

1202
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,039
want here's the sample for the T and

1203
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,720
they can do it like that if they want

1204
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,159
the whole system's a joke you know

1205
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:42,239
essentially what the LA Times found is

1206
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:44,318
that real world testing showed far

1207
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,159
different results than the piece of

1208
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,239
paper that you needed to show to make

1209
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,719
sure that you were approved and clean

1210
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:54,039
yeah and there was a vast discrepancy

1211
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:55,759
between getting the piece of paper that

1212
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:58,039
allowed you to make the sale within the

1213
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,799
legal system cuz you and now you have

1214
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:04,679
plausible deniability too right like you

1215
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:06,519
know you didn't know you tested it you

1216
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,519
didn't sell dirty stuff you tested it it

1217
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,920
came back clean yeah their test was

1218
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:14,440
clean so who knows what happened here in

1219
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,000
the middle and is it cross could it be

1220
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,960
that brand had dirty equipment yeah and

1221
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,639
they dirtied our weed yeah and when you

1222
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:27,119
have um when you have smaller

1223
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,558
producers and all the weeds coming from

1224
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,000
them it's like there's not even they

1225
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,000
don't they don't even really have the

1226
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,798
incentive to want to use all of these

1227
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,880
chemicals because there's just not

1228
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:38,798
really very much use for them because

1229
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,280
you don't have anything that gets that

1230
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:44,559
far outside of what you want to do like

1231
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:48,160
when I grow weed like any that I can

1232
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,680
that I get is either like I'm gonna take

1233
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,279
a loss on it and it's not that bad or I

1234
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:55,118
know how to fix it with something that's

1235
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,680
not harmful there's no big deal but if

1236
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,200
you're looking and you're going oh my

1237
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,759
God we have all these Acres you're going

1238
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,558
to be like all right what is what can I

1239
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,400
do for for fractions of a penny for a

1240
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:08,880
square foot like what can we get and

1241
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,079
then they do it and then they just game

1242
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,318
the testing and that's that's just

1243
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:15,599
something that is fully incentivized at

1244
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:18,440
large scale and so it would have been

1245
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,440
great for them to really keep large

1246
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,480
scale for being able to operate because

1247
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,559
then you'd have good stuff you know you

1248
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,159
go to the farmers market there's people

1249
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,599
at the farmers market who are selling

1250
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,000
organ organic produce and it's not

1251
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:34,880
organic I had a friend back in the day

1252
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,159
his family used to used to run uh big

1253
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,880
farms in California with produce and

1254
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,719
they would sell all their produce in

1255
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,440
bulk but the kids to get money would get

1256
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:48,118
a bunch of organic stickers and stamps

1257
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,880
and they would take them they would load

1258
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,680
up their car and go to the farmers

1259
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,318
market and sell all this conventional a

1260
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,078
[ __ ] that was left over from their

1261
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:59,639
family's operation and they'd sit at the

1262
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,000
they'd sit at the farmers market and

1263
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,879
sell it and they would do that but at a

1264
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,798
farmers market they were the they were

1265
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,798
the minority most people at the farmers

1266
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:10,079
market you can like go up and check

1267
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:11,838
stuff out and you go okay I mean one of

1268
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,798
the great things that's funny at like a

1269
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,318
farmers market is if you go to like buy

1270
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:17,280
some broccoli and it's got like three or

1271
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:19,079
four aphids on it you're like all right

1272
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,119
I know they didn't use anything that bad

1273
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,599
because these [ __ ] would have been

1274
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:24,280
smoked if they used the [ __ ] people are

1275
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,960
spraying on these weed crops you know

1276
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,200
like you can see that this is like

1277
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,039
regular

1278
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,759
stuff it doesn't look quite like the

1279
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,759
stuff at the store maybe the varieties

1280
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,240
are different it's these it's a

1281
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,720
different thing and usually you can

1282
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,078
trust the smaller people but there's

1283
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,639
that there's still going to be a certain

1284
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:45,599
aspect of of funkiness to that but like

1285
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:49,679
the reality was that the reason these

1286
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:52,079
people I knew had funky not organic

1287
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,239
produce selling along with the rest was

1288
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,760
because they were the guys who were

1289
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,959
growing conventional Fields full full of

1290
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,200
food and in order to do that like

1291
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,559
organic just it wasn't it wasn't

1292
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,399
unsprayed

1293
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:09,519
um organically grown you know fed with

1294
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,200
compost and green manure and manure and

1295
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,599
all these things it wasn't practical for

1296
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,519
them at all because they were at scale

1297
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,280
but for like my grandpa who wants to

1298
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,719
have like some crates of tomatoes it's

1299
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,960
super easy he doesn't you don't ever

1300
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,639
have to spray your Tomatoes a gopher

1301
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,599
eats like a quarter of your tomato

1302
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,920
plants you're like dude we still got so

1303
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:30,200
many it's no big deal but when you have

1304
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,119
a massive tomato Farm you're under the

1305
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:34,639
gun what are we going to do what are we

1306
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:36,480
going to use and so it just is you know

1307
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,400
it's a bummer but it's no shock when you

1308
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,400
see that the biggest guys are the ones

1309
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,480
using the most [ __ ] and there and

1310
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,400
they're yeah and the thing that sucks

1311
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,000
about it is that those are the most

1312
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,720
economical people for the brands to

1313
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
purchase the material they need from

1314
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,639
because they have the largest volume and

1315
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,519
they can offer the most aggressive

1316
00:54:54,639 --> 00:55:00,358
pricing and so a lot of brands are

1317
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:02,440
gravitating towards like the biggest

1318
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:04,159
farms because they have the cheapest

1319
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,679
stuff I mean you mentioned glass house

1320
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,598
again they have been undercutting hard

1321
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:11,960
because you know um these Brands need

1322
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,760
these Farms need to sell stuff on the

1323
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,639
legal Market too right and they compete

1324
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,359
with each other on how cheap so you come

1325
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:23,279
up here to Mendo or humble and people

1326
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,960
want one price you know but there's big

1327
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,680
groups down there that like you know he

1328
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,679
was just saying you know his friend will

1329
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:30,960
buy it wholesale for a hundred bucks

1330
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:34,038
there's people that'll sell it for

1331
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,119
30 yeah which yeah which one are they

1332
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,400
going to pick they're like I mean if my

1333
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:41,240
if my buddies didn't have a working

1334
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,039
model and they were not ethical the way

1335
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:45,239
that they are because they're cool dudes

1336
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:48,640
but if they weren't like that they could

1337
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:51,038
really easily just go oh so right now

1338
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,199
let's just uh let's leave all these guys

1339
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,520
hanging for the 100 because they that's

1340
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,000
as low as they'll go and let's just go

1341
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,000
ahead and go down there and we'll buy

1342
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,639
this other weed for 30 but they're not

1343
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,358
doing it luckily and they're not going

1344
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:06,400
to change their their pricing wholesale

1345
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:09,880
so they just dropped their their

1346
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,318
overhead a ton twoth thirds almost

1347
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,200
basically yeah and I mean these guys who

1348
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:16,159
I'm talking about by not doing that

1349
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:17,639
they're probably missing out on another

1350
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:19,000
couple million dollars a year or

1351
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:22,558
whatever you know these guys are killing

1352
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,960
it they're doing really good and um

1353
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,000
that's a lot of money they're leaving on

1354
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,798
the table to be ethical and and you

1355
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,760
can't expect everybody to make that same

1356
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:34,759
sacrifice when they crunch the numbers

1357
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,799
but you know you can expect more of that

1358
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,160
from people who were the people who were

1359
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,519
really growing weed and actually like

1360
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,159
have an attachment to the ethics of

1361
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,280
having a good product because a lot of

1362
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:46,960
people take pride in the fact that

1363
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,039
they're giving people the weed that's

1364
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,159
making them feel better and they want to

1365
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:55,200
give people good clean weed and so these

1366
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,879
guys are still doing that but that there

1367
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,519
there's no uh

1368
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,358
there's no reason for these huge

1369
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:05,038
companies who don't come from any kind

1370
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:07,558
of a cultural practice at all they just

1371
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,960
crunch the numbers they go it's cheaper

1372
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,559
to Eagle 20 it it's cheaper to hit it

1373
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,240
with this it's cheaper to hit it with

1374
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,880
that cheaper to dry it in this many days

1375
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,798
all this stuff just to get the prices

1376
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,880
down and then they're like yeah our

1377
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:22,079
numbers are up we made more money you

1378
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,000
know and it's like well that's cool but

1379
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,240
it's one of the reasons why a lot of

1380
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,880
times weed was expensive

1381
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,358
when it was expensive a lot of people

1382
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,160
could have grown a lot more weed but a

1383
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:35,558
lot of the best Growers friends of mine

1384
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,598
they looked at it and they we they go we

1385
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:40,200
got a lot of space you know but we don't

1386
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:46,599
have quality drying space for more than

1387
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:49,798
80 or 12 pounds and we could build it

1388
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,960
but I tried to grow a little bit extra

1389
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:54,159
and it like everything the quality on

1390
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,880
everything was just not quite there I

1391
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,159
feel like I'm topped out growing this

1392
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,400
much weed and maybe they get some help

1393
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,199
and they can grow a little bit more but

1394
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,838
when people really have pride in [ __ ]

1395
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:07,480
they're more likely to like want to

1396
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:11,798
stick to a a real number that they know

1397
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:15,039
is where things line up to be topnotch

1398
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:17,079
and a lot of people in the old days you

1399
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,440
know were like okay this is what I can

1400
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:19,839
this is what I can manage and there's

1401
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,480
still a lot of people like that and

1402
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,078
that's like what these guys are buying

1403
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,280
the weed from those guys because the

1404
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:28,480
because there's a lot of people who are

1405
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,640
like we could grow 25 500 lbs of crap

1406
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,240
but we're just going to keep growing 800

1407
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:36,038
pounds we're just G to keep growing you

1408
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:37,879
know 1100 pounds of weed that's coming

1409
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:39,359
out like really how we want it to come

1410
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,280
out you know because they're doing that

1411
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,598
over three or four runs it's not all at

1412
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,599
once so they're having these batches

1413
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,160
that are coming off and they're just you

1414
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,280
know a few hundred pounds and that's

1415
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,598
really manageable with a small team of a

1416
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,880
few people you can have the best weed

1417
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,880
like that you know it might not be quite

1418
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:59,318
like the lady who you know who has one

1419
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,119
you know 600 watt light and you're like

1420
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:03,400
oh I'll buy that to smoke or whatever

1421
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,200
but it's still really good weed but I I

1422
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,440
know that when you're at huge scale like

1423
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,639
that it's just you know even if the weed

1424
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,760
seems like it's its best it's GNA fall

1425
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:14,838
off in one one way or another you know

1426
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,160
it's gonna it's going to get treated

1427
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:19,279
industrially by something I mean there

1428
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:22,279
could even be a thing and we can move on

1429
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,480
again but um the reality is when you're

1430
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,160
growing at large egg places most of

1431
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:31,079
those places hire out their sprayers to

1432
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:33,159
come in and spray whatever so there's

1433
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,760
even possibilities that like let's say

1434
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:38,759
that five days a week these sprayers are

1435
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,720
out there hitting conventional farms and

1436
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,440
using different kinds of chemicals and

1437
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:43,879
then they come on your farm and they put

1438
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,838
in whatever they're going to spray that

1439
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,318
night but there's there's enough residue

1440
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:51,599
in the lines in the tank in the sprayer

1441
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:53,519
in the whatever that like it's it's not

1442
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:57,079
even like a full dose but it's enough to

1443
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:59,480
pop enough one worker I'll tell you that

1444
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:01,760
all those big farms most of them don't

1445
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,838
have all their own personal equipment

1446
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,520
and their own team out there all night

1447
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,159
long they hire it out as a

1448
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:11,079
service most of them and so then what

1449
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:12,759
are those Services doing in their and

1450
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:14,440
all their equipment all those other days

1451
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,760
a week that they're spraying

1452
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,079
conventional Farms that are allowed to

1453
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,839
use all these camps yeah there's even

1454
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:25,000
room for honest mistakes where it's like

1455
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:26,519
we we didn't even want to do that but

1456
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,239
there it is there it happen it is it

1457
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:30,920
Happ think that doesn't happen to

1458
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:33,639
somebody like me who was growing a you

1459
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,159
know 25 plants medical and had a bunch

1460
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:36,719
of weed on those plants and they were

1461
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:39,279
beautiful and it was just like I didn't

1462
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:42,558
have to do anything like oh one plant's

1463
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,720
got tons of bugs just [ __ ] chop it

1464
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,720
down if it's not good enough it ain't

1465
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:50,118
good enough who cares you got more you

1466
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:52,000
know and you don't need you don't have

1467
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:55,559
you know when it's you're losing your

1468
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,719
whatever 4% right now by chopping this

1469
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:01,640
it's not like you're you know losing 4%

1470
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:05,399
of you

1471
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:09,199
know 400,000 plants or whatever in that

1472
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:12,400
run so yeah totally different

1473
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:14,038
thing look I think we've thoroughly I

1474
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,559
think we've thoroughly hashed that one

1475
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:20,760
out um let's change the pace a little

1476
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:24,119
bit I want to talk a little bit about

1477
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,599
how Germany recently passed an adult use

1478
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,200
Bill I'm sure you guys have heard about

1479
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,960
this it was I think probably about 6

1480
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,598
months ago maybe getting close to that

1481
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:35,440
now but it's been reported that it has

1482
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:39,079
absolutely opened The Floodgate for CIP

1483
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,119
Pacs flooding into Germany anecdotal

1484
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:46,079
Reports say that they're going for

1485
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:48,280
10,000 Euro a pound uh it's not

1486
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,960
particularly surprising but I guess the

1487
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,278
question is do we think other countries

1488
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:56,000
in the EU are going to follow and as a

1489
01:01:53,278 --> 01:01:59,358
followup do we think this might be the

1490
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,278
first sign of a global cannabis culture

1491
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,199
which is essentially going to eventually

1492
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:05,838
wipe out you know sort of the individual

1493
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,679
cultures for a long time you know there

1494
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:12,239
was sort of the Dutch scene more

1495
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:15,038
recently the Spanish scene but I mean if

1496
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:17,519
you take it on face value if if Cal if

1497
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,640
California bud is dominating it's it's

1498
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,798
hinting that that that may well be the

1499
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:24,440
global culture going forward California

1500
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:27,639
Cannabis culture will be exported all

1501
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:31,240
over the world what do we

1502
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:33,038
think it's I mean this is kind of a

1503
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:36,199
theme I think of what we've been talking

1504
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,799
about but like every state in America so

1505
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:41,558
far that goes legal uh it's a grand

1506
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:44,519
mystery what happens to its its

1507
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:46,039
excess right and it is going to start

1508
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:47,798
going all over the place I mean I know

1509
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:50,359
that like when they opened up Thailand

1510
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:52,759
last year all of a sudden there was all

1511
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:56,239
these California Brands and people and

1512
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:59,640
opening stores and there was jars of

1513
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:03,159
purple weed over there you know and it

1514
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:05,639
wasn't all traditional Tow and Li and

1515
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:08,318
Cambodian you know sativas and that

1516
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:11,960
stuff it was it's going to go places and

1517
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:14,239
I think that's just the nature of like

1518
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,960
you know it's really sad but like I was

1519
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,558
reading about how like you know there's

1520
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:21,639
barely any Moroccan weed left in

1521
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,480
Morocco it's all Dutch and Spanish

1522
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:25,920
Imports and they give them all that's

1523
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,079
where they're getting their seed stock

1524
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,440
and that's what they're growing and then

1525
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:31,720
they're turning that into hash and then

1526
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,880
it's going back into Europe and so I

1527
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:38,118
think probably like it's a good time to

1528
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,760
say that rules are rules but then

1529
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:41,400
there's always going to be if there's

1530
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,720
profit involved and there's this and

1531
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,079
that involved there's always going to be

1532
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,759
people bending them and uh it sounds

1533
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,200
funny to think that like America would

1534
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,160
have an excess of something that it

1535
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,439
would be smuggling into other countries

1536
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:56,399
because we're usually the gobbler that

1537
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,920
just takes the world's supply of sub es

1538
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,480
and send it here for money uh but I

1539
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:05,200
guess we could reverse the stream and

1540
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:08,920
start sending um you know packs all over

1541
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:10,838
the place and uh you know I think every

1542
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,880
country and every state that wants to

1543
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:17,078
legalize is going to have to deal with

1544
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:19,798
the fact that there's this robust

1545
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:22,079
underground you know and I don't know

1546
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:24,278
how that's all going to shake out but

1547
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,559
it's going to every place it's it's

1548
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,679
every place it's going to it's going to

1549
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,480
be

1550
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:30,639
different you

1551
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,039
know I mean I would imagine since

1552
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,558
Holland is right next door wouldn't

1553
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,039
there be a bunch of weed from Holland

1554
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,240
and Switzerland that would start to pour

1555
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,720
into Germany like on a more on a on a

1556
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:45,278
you know I mean You' think that

1557
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,959
too their production just can't keep up

1558
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:49,239
I wonder but I guess I'm interested you

1559
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,798
know like historically the Dutch scene

1560
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:54,159
you know people would say oh you know

1561
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:56,920
hazes and um she some of these more

1562
01:04:54,159 --> 01:05:00,000
European oriented VAR would generally be

1563
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:02,680
considered to be kind of the the

1564
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,960
prevalent strains in the Zeitgeist

1565
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:08,000
whereas you don't see that you know it

1566
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:11,679
seems as though C like let's just be

1567
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,159
blunt like gelardo runs these household

1568
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,440
Nam strains it feels like they're going

1569
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,199
to become the dominant and synonymous

1570
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,639
names with these regions and I wonder if

1571
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:27,078
we'll lose that sort of more localized

1572
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:30,038
culture that you know like I think his

1573
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:32,160
yeah yeah I mean to go back to what we

1574
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:35,599
were talking about before about huge

1575
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:37,838
farms over producing is those things you

1576
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,760
just mentioned part of the reason why

1577
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:42,119
gelato and runts and these different

1578
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,160
things have swept so much is because the

1579
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:47,559
largest Farms are growing them and so

1580
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:50,598
there's just more production of those

1581
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:53,640
Str like the amount of that being grown

1582
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:55,880
just dwarfs anything else like once

1583
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:58,480
you've got a bunch of huge farms growing

1584
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:00,358
purple candy gas and all of a sudden

1585
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,358
purple candy gas starts showing up in

1586
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:05,440
every Market legal and illegal and gray

1587
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:07,719
and whatnot it just floods what's out

1588
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,400
there to some degree so it's like

1589
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:12,118
whether or not people want it that's

1590
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,880
what's happening you know and there's

1591
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,720
only the weird thing about the

1592
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,880
California Market that people might not

1593
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,598
know is that most Farms are flowering

1594
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,200
farms and they end up buying their

1595
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:24,880
clones from a nursery and they don't get

1596
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,318
these huge lists where they can just

1597
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,880
choose 50 or 80 strains most nurseries

1598
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:32,000
are like for the next four months these

1599
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,920
are the 12 strains we

1600
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,760
offer and we're going to be cutting

1601
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,200
clones off them regularly and selling

1602
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,278
them repeatedly to all kinds of

1603
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:43,239
different farms and there's only so many

1604
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:45,639
big nurseries so a few big nurseries and

1605
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:47,439
a few big farms if they decide to start

1606
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:51,480
to grow certain things all of a sudden

1607
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:53,960
it's all jealousy gelato runs various

1608
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,358
hybrids and that's what most people see

1609
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:00,318
because that's the vast volume being

1610
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:04,199
grown yeah you know there then there's a

1611
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:07,358
there's the feedback loop too of like um

1612
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:08,399
you know it's like whatever is uh the

1613
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:13,598
most

1614
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:15,798
popular with people in general like you

1615
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:18,519
know it

1616
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:20,400
always it always comes down to like when

1617
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:22,719
people show up like when they're going

1618
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,039
to buy all the weed what are they asking

1619
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:28,719
for and so when there starts to be a

1620
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:31,920
trend of people going okay well we want

1621
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:34,318
this then people are like okay I got to

1622
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,400
grow that and a lot of times it'll swing

1623
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,079
like people will finally catch on to the

1624
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,358
trend and they'll grow that and then

1625
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,760
it'll be like no that's the old [ __ ] now

1626
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:44,199
yeah oh no we're not going to give you

1627
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,559
that money sh so hard and the weed takes

1628
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:48,118
so long to flower and get processed and

1629
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,839
everything so a lot of times it'll be

1630
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:53,440
like oh it's you know everybody wants

1631
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:55,719
you know the original one really was

1632
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,119
everybody wants purple urle then a

1633
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:58,558
sudden people started showing up and

1634
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,599
they're like no we don't want that

1635
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,760
anymore we only want sour and then

1636
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,318
people were like no sour is not [ __ ] we

1637
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,480
don't want that we want OG then people

1638
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,318
shift over to OG and then people start

1639
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,480
being like no we don't want OG we want

1640
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:15,159
cookies then people had cookies and

1641
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:20,279
everybody started going no no we want

1642
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:21,759
sherbet we want we want Skittles we want

1643
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:23,640
whatever it was and it kept going you

1644
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:26,640
know Skittles and then it went we want

1645
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,838
runs and then we want Lemon Cherry

1646
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,359
gelato which is just runs and then like

1647
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:33,960
it kept going to the point where now

1648
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,679
it's like witch runs which Lemon Cherry

1649
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,960
gelato and it's like this bag seed cut

1650
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:41,960
that is a little bit more like this or

1651
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:45,319
whatever but the problem with it is

1652
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,960
that um when people go to sell their

1653
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:49,319
weed they have to have the weed that

1654
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,679
people want to buy and what people tend

1655
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,239
to want to buy is the weed you know that

1656
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,480
the easiest thing to understand is

1657
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:58,439
always going to be what sells the best

1658
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:00,718
so like you're not going to like make a

1659
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:03,519
jazz album right now with a bunch of

1660
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,679
[ __ ] you know math music where you

1661
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,759
have to like know the theory to know

1662
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,000
what it is and but it's like that [ __ ]

1663
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,039
to musicians is crazy they're like oh

1664
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,960
did you hear that you know and that

1665
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:17,238
would be like you know me and Francis

1666
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:19,600
looking at some weird ly Haze hybrid

1667
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:22,000
that you smoke it and you're like oh no

1668
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,400
what have I done you know but like the

1669
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,960
market is going to want you know

1670
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:30,639
bubblegum pop they're going to want like

1671
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:34,039
the music that is the most relatable

1672
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,640
that's the most accessible and very weed

1673
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:39,399
is very pretty looking and very frosty

1674
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,798
purple weed is very pretty looking and

1675
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,719
then when it smells really crazy like

1676
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:47,079
whoa that doesn't smell I expect wheed

1677
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:49,600
to smell like hay and I expect it when

1678
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:52,158
it's really good to smell like like kind

1679
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:55,039
of skunky and fuy or something and then

1680
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:58,439
people smell weed that smells like crazy

1681
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:01,158
C gas per and they're like whoa this is

1682
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,960
just so far from what I expected that it

1683
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:05,079
has this knee-jerk reaction where people

1684
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,000
are like that's what I want then once

1685
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:08,238
they like it they know what they like

1686
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,920
and then they're just like people are

1687
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,359
creatures of habit they just stick to it

1688
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:15,119
so when buyers show up they're like they

1689
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:17,759
look at everything and they're like uh I

1690
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:19,719
just want the Obama runs I just want the

1691
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,440
Lemon Cherry gelato they don't even want

1692
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:23,920
to look at any of the other stuff you

1693
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,079
show it to them they go yeah no that's

1694
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,760
not it and then they smell something

1695
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:29,479
they go that's got some of it and what

1696
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,520
they're talking about is just the thing

1697
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:34,759
that they know really sold for them fast

1698
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:38,840
and then it becomes this endless

1699
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:41,320
feedback loop where like the the buyers

1700
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,119
want this so the grower wants this so

1701
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:45,719
the nursery supplies this and pretty

1702
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,000
soon you get stuck in the loop and all

1703
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,000
of a sudden then you get the people who

1704
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,840
are like I really want to smoke some of

1705
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,319
that weed like that [ __ ] I got back in

1706
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,560
the day I don't even know what it was

1707
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,198
and you know in the in there like you

1708
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,360
know [ __ ] I I don't want to smoke no

1709
01:10:58,198 --> 01:11:02,000
[ __ ] like blue dream or no [ __ ]

1710
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:03,559
you know and then like if you actually

1711
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
showed it to them they go this is that

1712
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,640
[ __ ] from back in the day and you'd go

1713
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,679
yeah that was the real blue dream cut

1714
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:12,280
the one that's the weed that you liked

1715
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:14,279
that you never could find because all it

1716
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:15,960
you know blueberry Haze when blue dreams

1717
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:17,599
stopped selling and now you've never

1718
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,198
known what your favorite weed is and of

1719
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,840
course some people hate that weed but

1720
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:24,639
some people hate runs you know like it's

1721
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,920
it's a Trippy you know it's a weird Loop

1722
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,400
that people get stuck in though maybe

1723
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,520
one angle that we could talk about for a

1724
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:34,238
second with Germany and then pop off to

1725
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:37,199
the next thing is that Germany is a big

1726
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:40,559
very populated very wealthy country so

1727
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:43,319
for them opening up to weed if they drop

1728
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,199
the penalties for weed quite a bit there

1729
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:47,639
could be this big demand of all these

1730
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:51,359
people that want cannabis but there's

1731
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:53,920
not the supply within Germany at all to

1732
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:56,519
give them that and there's excess over

1733
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,639
here in America so straight capitalism

1734
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,080
is just basically like oh well there's

1735
01:11:58,639 --> 01:12:03,319
excess over here and there's demand over

1736
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:06,198
there the Invisible Hand is going to

1737
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,639
come pull it and there's going to find a

1738
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:09,279
way that it's going to show up and so

1739
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:12,199
it's probably temporary it's probably

1740
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:15,399
going to bridge the gap until Germany

1741
01:12:12,198 --> 01:12:17,399
gets its own sort of little engine going

1742
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:18,960
right and then those prices will drop

1743
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:23,079
but probably what happened is they

1744
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,880
loosened the penalties a huge surge in

1745
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:27,760
demand not that much Supply and The

1746
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,840
Surge got the price up to a bunch of

1747
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,800
people were like oh I I have a clever

1748
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,920
way I think I could make that happen and

1749
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,000
loow and

1750
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:40,760
behold you know the excess gets to where

1751
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,600
the the drought is yeah I think that's

1752
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:45,239
kind of it's B it's it's like that's

1753
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,800
like classic that's like Adam Smith that

1754
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:48,879
you learn in grade school or whatever

1755
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,920
about like how capitalism works yeah

1756
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,480
right like yeah it's like alcohol

1757
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,359
prohibition you know all of a sudden it

1758
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:58,879
was like oh well did you know Ireland is

1759
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:01,359
still making stuff so how do we get that

1760
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,199
here so they would bring it in to Canada

1761
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:06,479
and then over the lake I'll use I'll use

1762
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:09,039
a right now weed example dude when I was

1763
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:10,319
out in New York setting some stuff up

1764
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,279
when they went

1765
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:17,399
legal they distillate was going for

1766
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:21,119
$8,000 a liter in New York but you could

1767
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:23,399
buy distillate for6 or $700 a liter in

1768
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:25,000
California and if you don't think that

1769
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,559
there were some entrepreneurs somewhere

1770
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,840
that that made some cheap California

1771
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,639
distillate show up in expensive New York

1772
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,719
past his New York distillate and they

1773
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:37,319
made 10 times their money you're nuts

1774
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:38,880
yeah people figured out how to do that

1775
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:40,519
on some level that's what an

1776
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,119
entrepreneur is looking for they're

1777
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,080
going okay where's the where's the

1778
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,920
supply of something and the and the

1779
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:48,399
market for something else and there's a

1780
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,880
difference and when there's a difference

1781
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:52,759
then you're the one who comes in and

1782
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,440
capitalizes on the difference and it's a

1783
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:58,280
huge you know a huge thing and that yeah

1784
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:00,439
but talking about the um talking about

1785
01:13:58,279 --> 01:14:03,198
the the way that everything moved

1786
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:05,879
towards being like Oh it's all you know

1787
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:09,599
like now the market the buyers The

1788
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:12,800
Growers the nurseries the runs the Lemon

1789
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,280
Cherry gelato all that that's like a

1790
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,000
smaller version of what I think just

1791
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:21,840
kind of always is in is happening all

1792
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,319
the time with um because what I didn't

1793
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,719
say about those things too is that all

1794
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:27,238
those things are easier to grow a lot of

1795
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,840
people don't know that it's not hard to

1796
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:31,638
produce weed that looks like the weed

1797
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,000
you want from those things if you grow

1798
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:35,560
sour diesel a good Sour Diesel grower

1799
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,520
might tell you yeah it's going to be one

1800
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,480
or two out of four runs you know three

1801
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,159
or four out of five runs that are going

1802
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,319
to come off the way you really want it

1803
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:47,079
but when you grow like gelato or a lot

1804
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:49,319
of these things like they just kind of

1805
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:51,119
come out how they come out pretty close

1806
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:54,519
and so they're really easy to produce a

1807
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:57,760
lot of and I think uh worldwide that's

1808
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:00,440
where the Trends have gone a lot over

1809
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,159
the years was it was like okay you have

1810
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:04,879
like this weed if you take it over here

1811
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:06,839
you can grow it here you can take weed

1812
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,079
from India take it to Jamaica it grows

1813
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,079
really good there now you have this big

1814
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:13,198
Supply now it goes here now that

1815
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:15,840
influences what everybody thinks of as

1816
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:17,879
weed that's their first in New York the

1817
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,719
first weed you got when in Miami the

1818
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,279
first weed you got was this Jamaican you

1819
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:23,800
know so you know what that is and that

1820
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,719
like sets a paradigm and then and then

1821
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,279
the California weed started and it was

1822
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,439
like okay what everyone can grow

1823
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:32,359
everywhere it turns out are these

1824
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:35,678
afghanis or these afghanis that are

1825
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:38,920
crossed with a Colombian or a Mexican or

1826
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:41,119
a Tai or whatever it is and then that

1827
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,399
becomes the thing that's easy to over

1828
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:47,000
produce and that becomes the understood

1829
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:49,079
thing of like okay so for production we

1830
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,319
want to do something like this and so

1831
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:53,238
then everywhere you go everybody's

1832
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:56,039
constantly all around the world it's

1833
01:15:53,238 --> 01:15:58,399
like everybody's trying to always keep

1834
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:01,079
up with okay what is the best way to do

1835
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:03,158
this and where does this thing work and

1836
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:06,920
where does that thing work and I think

1837
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:10,119
like now that everything's been in the

1838
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:14,760
US for so long and the US it takes up a

1839
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:16,519
pretty big chunk of of the you know

1840
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,480
basically when you're when you're

1841
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,920
looking at like the the the area that it

1842
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:24,158
takes up when you look at it you go okay

1843
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,319
well you can grow pretty crazy weed in

1844
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:28,679
Southern California that you can't maybe

1845
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:31,279
grow in Montana but there's something

1846
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:33,960
you can grow everywhere and so the US

1847
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:37,479
has become a place where it's a really

1848
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:40,480
good place to figure out what those

1849
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:43,599
possibilities are and so it's going to

1850
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:45,638
be hard I think to ever get out of what

1851
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,760
you're talking about where it is going

1852
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:50,199
to dictate a lot of the trends and it is

1853
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,560
going to dictate a lot of the greater

1854
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:56,439
the world uh the weed world because it's

1855
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,320
always been that but the United States

1856
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:00,158
has been a little bit more successful

1857
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,119
with figuring out these things and if

1858
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:06,399
you look at the way that like um animal

1859
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:09,158
crops or grain crops food crops were

1860
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:11,439
when you when you had like Eurasia you

1861
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:14,879
know because now we go oh well you got

1862
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:16,519
Europe over here and you have Asia over

1863
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,480
here and it's like well when you look at

1864
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:20,719
the map it's all one place just like the

1865
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,839
United States is all one place it

1866
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,359
stretches from way over here to way over

1867
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:28,279
there it stretches from way up here to

1868
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:30,639
way down here here and so all of our all

1869
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:32,960
of the food Trends and everything are

1870
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:35,279
the most most not all of them but a lot

1871
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,880
of the most popular ones all came from

1872
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,359
over there because it's like this is

1873
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,920
this place where you can grow these

1874
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:46,198
things over a big uh area and have a lot

1875
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:49,039
of um you know there there's a lot of

1876
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:50,759
like Evolution going on with culture

1877
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:54,158
with these particular things and that

1878
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:56,320
happened a lot with weed in um the US so

1879
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:58,119
like I think like like naturally Germany

1880
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:00,799
is going to be more likely to mimic the

1881
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:04,599
US than where else would they mimic like

1882
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,279
the Congo or southeast Asia or it's like

1883
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,120
more likely whatever is the most

1884
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:10,559
successful is going to continue to just

1885
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:13,519
be the model and so I won't be surprised

1886
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,360
if everywhere that everywhere that sets

1887
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,120
up new legalization a lot of them are

1888
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:19,198
going to look to the US and go how do

1889
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:21,198
those guys do it over there you know

1890
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:24,198
people will even look at Colombia and

1891
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:25,519
Mexico um anywhere that play people have

1892
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:27,158
been real successful uccessful with this

1893
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,600
particular kind of crop is going to be

1894
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:33,279
like you know going to kind of set a lot

1895
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:36,440
of the pace in all those places for

1896
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:39,079
sure well look we uh we quickly

1897
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:41,399
referenced it earlier in the answer so

1898
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:44,679
why don't we quickly touch on our next

1899
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:46,359
story uh which is that you know we spoke

1900
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:49,119
in one of the prior episodes about

1901
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:52,000
Thailand reversing their stance well

1902
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:54,880
guess what they have done yet another

1903
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:59,439
reversal on their reversal signaling

1904
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:01,960
that they may indeed not re criminalize

1905
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,399
cannabis this is obviously a breath of

1906
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,719
fresh air for many of the people who

1907
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:07,359
have set up operation over there after

1908
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:09,198
the initial calls for Banning it

1909
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:11,238
happened a few months ago it's not

1910
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:13,198
entirely clear what the new plan exactly

1911
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:15,119
will be but the overall message is that

1912
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:17,479
it's largely speaking going to remain

1913
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,880
legal I guess I'm wondering do we think

1914
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:20,678
this will stick do we think there might

1915
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,199
be yet another u-turn on the u-turn on

1916
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:25,319
the U-turn and as an extension do we

1917
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,519
think other Asian countries will

1918
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:30,799
progress towards legalization or is this

1919
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,800
a sign of the general

1920
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:36,279
instability I mean I was going to say it

1921
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:39,960
about Germany but I can say it about

1922
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:42,158
Thailand too it's good for obviously

1923
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:46,600
people that believe what we do when

1924
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:48,599
large populist countries decide to like

1925
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,120
that their approach to cannabis is

1926
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,440
misguided and they need to like you know

1927
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,840
decriminalize it Legalize It change

1928
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:59,279
their approach to it treat it in a much

1929
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:02,159
better fashion so in general I think

1930
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:04,359
these big countries deciding to like

1931
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:07,000
take it from you know a criminal side

1932
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:10,399
and be like oh it's normal I think

1933
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,840
that's huge I think Thailand got

1934
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:15,759
scared because I can tell you from just

1935
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,679
a bunch of people I know that as soon as

1936
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,760
they opened up they got flooded with

1937
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:23,480
foreigners looking to take advantage of

1938
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,719
the new weed rules and that's sort of

1939
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:28,879
going to happen in places as they open

1940
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:30,840
up is essentially cannabis people from

1941
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,239
oversaturated markets are going to look

1942
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,400
at that and be like oh I could go there

1943
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:38,119
and kill it for a minute and they're

1944
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:41,399
going to flood in I mean to be honest

1945
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:44,840
mean jeene and I saw that happen in

1946
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:46,879
Mendo like once people really we passed

1947
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,560
this law called measure G which made us

1948
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,960
pretty much like the most open place to

1949
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,280
grow weed in America and I would say

1950
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:58,639
starting about 03 or ' 04 like the

1951
01:20:55,279 --> 01:21:01,800
floodgates opened of people moving here

1952
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,520
to blow it up and go big and I'm sure

1953
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,320
the same thing happened in Thailand it

1954
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,800
like overwhelmed all of a sudden it went

1955
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:10,679
from like it always existed to like holy

1956
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,239
crap it's

1957
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:16,319
everywhere and it caused our real estate

1958
01:21:13,238 --> 01:21:17,759
to boom and Spike around here it created

1959
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:21,079
an enormous

1960
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:24,159
bubble and I know literally probably

1961
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:27,079
over a dozen people just personally that

1962
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:29,119
went to Thailand to blow it up and to

1963
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:31,880
and to and to change these laws and so

1964
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:33,880
I'm sure there there was thousands of

1965
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,199
people that went there and so they

1966
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:40,359
probably got a bit freaked

1967
01:21:36,198 --> 01:21:42,719
out at how fast things exploded clamp

1968
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:44,359
down for a minute then realize they

1969
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,359
didn't really want to clamp down they

1970
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:49,559
just need to figure out a path

1971
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:51,599
forward you know um and I think that's

1972
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,239
probably going to keep happening because

1973
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,199
look at what we just talked about 10K

1974
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:57,439
weed in Germany Germany like takes its

1975
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:59,919
foot off the gas a little bit and all of

1976
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:03,119
a sudden there's crazy like it's just

1977
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:06,719
going to keep happening until more and

1978
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:09,000
more of these places like go through it

1979
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,480
I think and so it's good that it's

1980
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,920
spreading because Asia has some of the

1981
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:16,439
absolutely most Draconian drug laws like

1982
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:18,039
there's places that you land and they're

1983
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:21,198
like if we find you with this we'll just

1984
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:23,760
kill you like we just and that it's like

1985
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:26,119
it's just on the sign you know they're

1986
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:29,119
not they don't mess around so it would

1987
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:32,079
be good at least for some of the lesser

1988
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:34,238
lesser harmful ones especially cannabis

1989
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:36,439
for them to take a more normalized

1990
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,759
approach what's really funny is that

1991
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:41,678
it's likely that those places over there

1992
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:43,239
were mostly influ I mean sometimes it's

1993
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:46,279
not the case because sometimes it's

1994
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:48,238
religion or or whatever is going on but

1995
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:51,319
a lot of the reason why like the whole

1996
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:54,919
War on Drugs has

1997
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:58,719
affected uh cannabis is it's because of

1998
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:01,079
us and us being America and we basically

1999
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,359
like went around the world and said hey

2000
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:05,479
like if you guys are going to be smoking

2001
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,158
all this dope don't [ __ ] think that

2002
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:09,879
you know you can just count on us for

2003
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:11,559
[ __ ] and you know if uh you guys [ __ ]

2004
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,239
around a little worse we're we're not

2005
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,480
going to show any Mercy because you got

2006
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:17,879
the you know like they we've pushed

2007
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:20,439
those drug laws as the American

2008
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:22,440
government has pushed those drug laws on

2009
01:23:20,439 --> 01:23:27,479
the whole world and it's crazy because

2010
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:33,759
um it's a real it's a real weird form of

2011
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:39,638
insanity when you um make a war on

2012
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:42,560
something that is not actually dangerous

2013
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:44,440
unethical immoral there's really nothing

2014
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,960
wrong with wheat it's just a plant it'd

2015
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:48,479
be like if there was a war on corn right

2016
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,359
now people would be like this is so

2017
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,279
strange I mean the weird thing about

2018
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:54,920
that too is that at least in America we

2019
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:57,960
didn't really have a cannabis tradition

2020
01:23:54,920 --> 01:24:00,840
but southeast Asia does yeah they

2021
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,639
literally had a

2022
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,159
longstanding you know tradition yeah but

2023
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:08,440
you convince part their cure yeah you

2024
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:11,158
convince one generation anywhere that

2025
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:13,678
something is super immoral and dangerous

2026
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:15,839
and all of a sudden they're like oh man

2027
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,760
I don't want our kids doing that this is

2028
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:21,279
crazy like this is going to destroy our

2029
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:23,400
country or you know the people who are

2030
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,639
incentivized by that because they want

2031
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:27,519
you know foreign Aid or because they

2032
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:29,159
want to just at least be in good

2033
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,960
standing internationally in the

2034
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:34,238
community like they basically go oh well

2035
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,520
we can't we we don't want to be like

2036
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:38,919
this country that's left and you know

2037
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,520
we're still our everybody else has moved

2038
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,960
past this and we're still doing this

2039
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:45,119
like we need to step into the Step Into

2040
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,960
the Now into the modern times so we need

2041
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:48,920
to start enforcing these laws that these

2042
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,639
other countries are enforcing and you

2043
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:55,039
wind up with this weird thing but what's

2044
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:58,600
crazy about it is that um

2045
01:24:55,039 --> 01:25:00,880
when you make something up like that

2046
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,960
it's not like like you can go anywhere

2047
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,600
in the world basically and they're like

2048
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,800
hey guess what it's not legal to steal

2049
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,440
people's [ __ ] unless you're maybe like

2050
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,279
in California or something it's

2051
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:15,158
loosening up a lot but you go places

2052
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:17,359
that are like it doesn't matter where

2053
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:21,039
you go people know that certain things

2054
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:22,519
are immoral dangerous and unethical

2055
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:24,319
basically anywhere in the world you go

2056
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,000
you can't steal people's [ __ ] and

2057
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,559
anywhere you go in the world you can't

2058
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,600
kill people

2059
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:32,520
senselessly anywhere you go you know

2060
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,480
like there's these certain things that

2061
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:38,360
everybody can agree like these are bad

2062
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:41,519
things and so when you enforce against

2063
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:44,599
them it all makes sense but when you

2064
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:49,320
make a huge War that's enforced by

2065
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:51,920
violence and threats of violence and and

2066
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:55,039
you know turning people into captives

2067
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:58,319
and all this [ __ ] and then you only have

2068
01:25:55,039 --> 01:26:01,158
it in some places then you cause this

2069
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:03,960
odd type of insanity where people leap

2070
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:06,439
frog from where it's acceptable to where

2071
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:09,279
it's acceptable to where it's acceptable

2072
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:11,238
and there's all this weird change in the

2073
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:14,319
prices and values of everything because

2074
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:16,638
over here now it's like still kind of

2075
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:19,079
considered bad but you can get away with

2076
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:21,520
it so that's where the big prices right

2077
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:23,719
and then where it's where it's but but

2078
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,400
it's not dangerous enough to keep people

2079
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:29,118
from wanting to do it and so the thing

2080
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,879
that happened to us right was people we

2081
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:34,519
should mention that's been going on

2082
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:37,000
forever yeah like Holland got started

2083
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,920
because permissive California and

2084
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,479
America started cracking down on the

2085
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:43,399
drug war and sending helicopters and all

2086
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:47,799
these breeders fled to this like

2087
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:50,319
essentially cold gray kind of dark place

2088
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:52,600
but it was more permissive and then as

2089
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:54,279
soon as Switzerland opened up they

2090
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,840
flooded into there and then as soon as

2091
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:59,198
Spain opened up they flooded into there

2092
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,360
one point I want to say before I forget

2093
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:04,000
is that one of the positives about

2094
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:06,719
Thailand is that their climate is so

2095
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,679
different that it is very very unlikely

2096
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,639
that purple candy gas is going to take

2097
01:27:08,679 --> 01:27:14,639
over in Thailand for a length of time

2098
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:16,560
because that [ __ ] will rot there they

2099
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:20,560
are going to need to develop different

2100
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:24,400
cultivars that grow well in a hot humid

2101
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:26,440
thick climate and a lot of the runs and

2102
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,679
a lot of that kind of stuff I don't

2103
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:31,599
think is going to and that kind of uber

2104
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:33,840
dense cxes and buds I don't think it's

2105
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,480
going to go over well there unless you

2106
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:40,719
have some very expensive climate

2107
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:42,118
controlled situations so they should

2108
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,639
they might end up there might be some

2109
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:47,960
places as they loosen up where they

2110
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:51,319
become like areas where sativas are

2111
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:55,560
cultivated simply because that's what

2112
01:27:51,319 --> 01:27:57,000
works in the climate that they're in

2113
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,880
you know it really could be because I

2114
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,639
don't see like I don't see in Thailand I

2115
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:05,279
mean I don't know if Thailand is a lot

2116
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,679
of like it's 90 to 95 degrees and of

2117
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:09,158
over 80%

2118
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:11,239
humidity you can pull off more than you

2119
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:13,279
would imagine there like I gave a a

2120
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:15,559
friend of mine back in the day a bunch

2121
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:17,479
of different seeds and the only things

2122
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,760
he couldn't grow in Thailand was the

2123
01:28:17,479 --> 01:28:22,599
stuff that was uh monkey balls hybrids

2124
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,800
yeah those he couldn't grow there that

2125
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,199
extreme Afghan and I was like you could

2126
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,719
grow the other stuff he's like yeah I

2127
01:28:26,198 --> 01:28:31,719
grew candleabra I grew the lime I grew

2128
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:33,480
you know he was able to pretty much pull

2129
01:28:31,719 --> 01:28:35,639
off everything but not you know he

2130
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:37,479
wasn't a commercial grower either you

2131
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:39,118
know the the Monkey Ball stuff that we

2132
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:40,718
could get away with growing here that's

2133
01:28:39,118 --> 01:28:42,759
still challenging for mold and

2134
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:45,279
everything he was like the whole plant

2135
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:48,320
mold the whole thing just melted you

2136
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:49,719
know um but uh but the other stuff was

2137
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:52,198
like yeah you know he got a little bit

2138
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:55,399
of mold but he was able to he was able

2139
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:57,879
to grow it so you can get away with

2140
01:28:55,399 --> 01:29:01,000
stuff that you might think wouldn't

2141
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:03,520
wouldn't work but I don't think on a big

2142
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,719
enough level that it would that you'd

2143
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:08,239
want to have that be what you supplied

2144
01:29:05,719 --> 01:29:13,198
over you know something that was like a

2145
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:14,839
more um narrow Leaf equatorial at least

2146
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:16,559
influenced you know they can make

2147
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:18,440
hybrids though the same way we did here

2148
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,000
yeah take that stuff they will make

2149
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:21,719
hybrids I just mean that they'll they'll

2150
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,439
probably try to like but I was even

2151
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:24,840
thinking about like New York and stuff

2152
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,759
like that like should probably be

2153
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,079
looking into like Canadian genetics for

2154
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:32,280
their outdoor stuff that did well in

2155
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:34,840
southern Canada and survived well not

2156
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:37,079
necessarily bone dry California and just

2157
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:40,279
trying to like take that over and switch

2158
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:43,118
switch it yeah but that kept happening

2159
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:45,679
too there was this famous thing uh Sam

2160
01:29:43,118 --> 01:29:47,839
talked about it a long time ago where

2161
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:51,079
most of the Afghans that got brought

2162
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,520
over from Afghanistan and Pakistan early

2163
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:54,559
in like the late 70s and 80s and stuff

2164
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,880
over here

2165
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,679
a lot of them

2166
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:01,239
molded and because they came from a much

2167
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:04,399
more mountainous dry climate and a lot

2168
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:06,919
of the Afghans that like got famous or

2169
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:10,519
got well known were simply the ones that

2170
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:14,279
didn't rot and didn't breed rot into the

2171
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:16,320
sativas they were mixing them with yep

2172
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:18,559
you know so that kind of stuff

2173
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:21,960
matters figuring out what suits where

2174
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:24,400
you're at I so I think it's awesome that

2175
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:28,118
Thailand I think it's awesome that land

2176
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:30,359
is is uh is loosening up and I hope it's

2177
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:30,359
it

2178
01:30:31,238 --> 01:30:36,198
spreads you know and I think it could

2179
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:38,198
last if it's you know the the big the

2180
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:40,000
big thing was that I think you know like

2181
01:30:38,198 --> 01:30:42,000
you said we talked about it on a

2182
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,238
different episode that we did but it I

2183
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,760
was just saying like [ __ ] Americans

2184
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:49,039
you know like just run well we have

2185
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:51,520
power too because if we made it legal I

2186
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:52,840
bet it would go legal in a lot of places

2187
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,400
and then there would be a lot of

2188
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:57,800
countries that already get a lot of

2189
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:59,920
money in American tourism and they'd be

2190
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:02,560
perfectly content to just sell us weed

2191
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,960
too when we're there on

2192
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,400
vacation I think places like Colombia

2193
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:10,000
and all those guys down there are

2194
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:11,319
eagerly anticipating America loosening

2195
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,399
up even

2196
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:16,840
further and that's why they're there

2197
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,359
that American money-making Market drives

2198
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:21,719
a lot you know how many Americans go to

2199
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:23,439
Thailand you know how many Europeans go

2200
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:24,679
to Thailand to party and have a good

2201
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:28,000
time

2202
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:29,920
a lot yeah and they probably would be

2203
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,479
totally down to buy weed while they're

2204
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,199
there especially if they could do it

2205
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:36,039
legally and not get in trouble or go to

2206
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:38,439
tie jail it'd probably explode and then

2207
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:41,000
there'd be all this excess imported

2208
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:43,238
pouring in money coming in it' just be

2209
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
another tourism thing yeah it should be

2210
01:31:43,238 --> 01:31:46,879
great you know it should be great like

2211
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,279
in and when you look at it and it's just

2212
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:51,239
like well you know just it's got to be

2213
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:54,039
handled right I guess but yeah hopefully

2214
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:55,319
it hope hopefully it can stay in cuz

2215
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:57,800
it's you know there's nothing wrong with

2216
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:57,799
it that's for

2217
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:05,199
sure there you go nothing wrong with all

2218
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:08,800
right um look in other news let's jump

2219
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:11,759
to the next story uh let me get the

2220
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:14,199
banner up all right here we go

2221
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,360
so where's our

2222
01:32:14,198 --> 01:32:20,198
picture the Californian government has

2223
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:23,238
announced that a special California task

2224
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:26,678
force has seized over 2.2 million

2225
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:29,118
illegal cannabis packages all of which

2226
01:32:26,679 --> 01:32:32,239
they deemed to be too similar to being

2227
01:32:29,118 --> 01:32:34,158
marketed as candy for children now they

2228
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:36,479
say specifically these packages were

2229
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:38,559
designed to mimic popular food and candy

2230
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:39,759
brands and the concern was raised that

2231
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,400
you know it's obviously going to appeal

2232
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,119
to kids this is obviously nothing new

2233
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:46,198
we've been aware of this for a very long

2234
01:32:44,118 --> 01:32:47,960
time I guess the question becomes when

2235
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:49,719
you can actually see the numbers this is

2236
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,319
just over a short period of time They

2237
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:52,760
seized this I don't believe it was over

2238
01:32:51,319 --> 01:32:55,279
a oneyear period I think it was just

2239
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,440
over like a short t targeted intensive

2240
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,800
period where they scan the ma and the

2241
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:02,519
companies uh they pulled up this many

2242
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,840
you know a surprisingly large number so

2243
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,400
I guess the question is do we think the

2244
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,520
trend's going to slow down and more

2245
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:10,679
importantly you know we heard of people

2246
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,199
getting ceas and assist for copying

2247
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:15,118
certain brands but it seems like it

2248
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:16,919
might be getting to the point where even

2249
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:18,759
the companies would be too overwhelmed

2250
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,279
to really try to tackle all of it

2251
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:23,480
especially when you consider that um you

2252
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,840
know and no no shade being thrown here

2253
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:28,718
out buddy sticker farmer he probably has

2254
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,199
many customers who have products similar

2255
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,279
to what we're talking about you know

2256
01:33:30,198 --> 01:33:34,079
somewhat similar in marketing do we

2257
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:35,719
think it's just going to just overwhelm

2258
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:38,118
the companies and will just people will

2259
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:40,960
just stop even trying to Market it where

2260
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:40,960
do we go from

2261
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,600
here yeah I mean I think there's

2262
01:33:45,238 --> 01:33:48,718
a I don't know there's an interesting

2263
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,320
thing

2264
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:54,800
like

2265
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:57,880
in in music like if you imagine

2266
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:00,360
imagine like people sample

2267
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,480
People's music right somebody takes like

2268
01:34:00,359 --> 01:34:03,920
oh I'm going to take this little piece

2269
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:05,479
and it's like oh you can't clear it

2270
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,719
you'll see there there there will still

2271
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:09,439
be like places where it's like Kanye

2272
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:10,920
took this song and he didn't clear it

2273
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:13,000
and you're like he knows better he has

2274
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,760
all the lawyers as but it's like if

2275
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,560
somebody knows that they have a hit

2276
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:22,600
they're going to get a lot of momentum

2277
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:25,719
off of the hit until they get shut down

2278
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:29,960
so it's like like imagine the difference

2279
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:33,000
between having a package that is just

2280
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:36,319
very simple and nobody really notices it

2281
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,198
and people don't really want it but it's

2282
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:42,158
totally honest and legit and it's done

2283
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:44,479
the right way and it's all by the book

2284
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:47,519
and then you don't really sell anything

2285
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:52,118
versus you have a package that sells

2286
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:54,920
like hot cakes right now for a little

2287
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:57,158
while and then it gets shut down

2288
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:00,600
like a lot of people are going to go

2289
01:34:57,158 --> 01:35:03,359
ahead and go with that package that they

2290
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,679
probably shouldn't really use but they

2291
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,359
know that it's gonna hit and so they're

2292
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:12,399
like all right well we'd rather get a

2293
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:14,599
lot of momentum for six months than have

2294
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:16,719
a brand that's going to just trickle in

2295
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:18,000
for the next 20 years like what's the

2296
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,439
point because it's not even going to

2297
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,399
sustain sustain itself so a lot of

2298
01:35:20,439 --> 01:35:25,559
people will just keep going from one

2299
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:27,960
thing to the next going oh this is a hot

2300
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,880
idea this is a hot idea and they'll just

2301
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:36,118
basically either kind of steal things or

2302
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:37,760
twak them a little bit or you know do

2303
01:35:36,118 --> 01:35:40,079
something and have it be like oh it's

2304
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,119
cartoony you can't do that because

2305
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,800
that's not how you can but they're like

2306
01:35:42,118 --> 01:35:47,198
yeah but like this this is what's

2307
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,880
testing the best like with people people

2308
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:50,919
see this they buy it so they're just

2309
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,880
like all right just run this up and just

2310
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,679
do it and do it and do it and then be

2311
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,400
like all right that's it that's as much

2312
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:59,118
as we could do with it now we're screwed

2313
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:04,279
and then you also have a lot of people

2314
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:06,519
who um there's no way to know what it is

2315
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:08,880
anyway like there's you can imagine like

2316
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:10,719
hash when people used to sell stamped

2317
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,920
hash bricks for a long time and they

2318
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:14,639
never they never knew who did it they

2319
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:16,560
just knew that it was there and they

2320
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,400
would find it and they'd be like oh it's

2321
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:22,400
a big mystery we don't know who's making

2322
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:24,359
the whatever hash you know and uh so

2323
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,599
that's the case too so like the people

2324
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:27,880
who are known and their faces on it and

2325
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,639
they're like all right when we get a

2326
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,279
cease and assist we'll stop and then

2327
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:32,920
there's the people who are like they'll

2328
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,599
never know who we are anyway let's just

2329
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,800
keep selling this product you know so I

2330
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,840
mean that's how that's how I see that

2331
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:42,960
kind of thing going as far as the basics

2332
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:46,279
of it you know I I don't want to sound

2333
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:49,239
like old man yells at cloud or anything

2334
01:36:46,279 --> 01:36:53,118
but I will say that uh with

2335
01:36:49,238 --> 01:36:55,599
legalization the type of artwork and and

2336
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:57,359
the colors and all that I'm not we're

2337
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,119
not trying to Market to children or

2338
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:02,279
anything like that but it is very bright

2339
01:37:00,118 --> 01:37:05,839
and it is kind of cartoony and it is

2340
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:07,679
exaggerated a lot um and I also say just

2341
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,920
totally different that like for a long

2342
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:13,800
time weed was essentially underground in

2343
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:17,399
counterculture and so we a lot of weed

2344
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,719
names and a lot of things were sort of

2345
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:23,920
takes

2346
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:26,239
on culture Cinderella 99 you know that's

2347
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,440
all fine and good until all of a sudden

2348
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:31,039
it's legal and Disney is like wait we we

2349
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:33,479
own Cinderella what what is this this is

2350
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:35,079
some no no no no no no you know and that

2351
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:38,319
just I don't want to you know I could go

2352
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:41,238
over example example example but we in

2353
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:43,920
cannabis for a long time a lot of

2354
01:37:41,238 --> 01:37:47,000
cannabis things got were sort of plays

2355
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,560
on more popular culture and we got away

2356
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,198
with it because we were

2357
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,920
underground but as you get trademarked

2358
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:54,678
and as you get legal and as you get all

2359
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:57,279
these different things things you start

2360
01:37:54,679 --> 01:37:58,679
bumping into and like mean jeene is

2361
01:37:57,279 --> 01:38:01,000
right in the sense that people are just

2362
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:03,158
going to do it and be underground but

2363
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,479
then you can probably as a company and

2364
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:07,638
we've seen this a few times rise to a

2365
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:10,118
level that you're big enough that they

2366
01:38:07,639 --> 01:38:13,599
care and they shut you

2367
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:17,118
down you know thin mint cookies went to

2368
01:38:13,599 --> 01:38:20,199
cookies there was a reason for that you

2369
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:22,598
know a certain candy went to

2370
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:24,079
Z there was a reason for that but you

2371
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:26,239
almost have to get big enough and

2372
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:27,359
wellknown enough that your merch and

2373
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,759
everything like that is sort of

2374
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:33,118
percolating up enough so that big

2375
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:35,119
company with the copyright you know or

2376
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:38,598
the trademark or whatever like actually

2377
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:41,839
notices you you can probably do a bunch

2378
01:38:38,599 --> 01:38:44,159
trapping before it bubbles up Yeah by

2379
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,880
that point yeah even if you get rid of

2380
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:48,960
that like you've already that's like

2381
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:51,760
what I told the Z that's what I told the

2382
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:54,239
Z guys what I told Tony I was like it

2383
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:56,079
was it was well worth it like now you

2384
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:57,718
just change it a little bit it's

2385
01:38:56,079 --> 01:38:59,359
established and it got everybody know

2386
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:01,439
everybody you need to know what they

2387
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:02,839
know what it is yeah and then you drop

2388
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:04,799
it and then you know what it is and

2389
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,279
great Best of Both Worlds you know like

2390
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,279
if that's what it takes to have

2391
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:09,880
something get momentum it's like cool

2392
01:39:08,279 --> 01:39:11,679
give it that momentum and then all you

2393
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:13,719
have to do is be like oh yeah it used to

2394
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:16,920
be called that you've heard of that this

2395
01:39:13,719 --> 01:39:19,000
is that cool it got momentum you know

2396
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,239
with Edibles it was huge like when

2397
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,719
everything was still medical I think

2398
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:26,479
Colorado was the first state to go Rec

2399
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:28,840
recreational and as soon as they went

2400
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:30,839
recreational um people came into their

2401
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:32,920
stores and almost all the Edibles got

2402
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:35,719
pulled off because all the artwork was

2403
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:39,079
bites off Reese's or Rice Krispie treats

2404
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:42,480
or it was really really really obvious

2405
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:44,479
takes on other kinds of food that those

2406
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:46,319
trademarks are like all well established

2407
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:48,919
and decades old and so they just came in

2408
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,519
and swept it and then people had to

2409
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,599
figure out like well what kind of art

2410
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:56,440
can I use what kind of name can I use

2411
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:58,199
that like might skate close where

2412
01:39:56,439 --> 01:39:59,678
everybody that's my customer knows it's

2413
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:02,198
kind of tongue and cheek but it doesn't

2414
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:04,800
like cross the line where we're going to

2415
01:40:02,198 --> 01:40:08,439
be battling these $500 an hour lawyers

2416
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,800
from the Mars Corporation yeah you know

2417
01:40:08,439 --> 01:40:12,678
and I think he's right that's just going

2418
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:15,199
to keep happening and they're going to

2419
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:17,079
keep there's no there's no reason to

2420
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:19,198
Market weed to kids there's nobody in

2421
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:21,599
weed that cares about selling to kids

2422
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:23,439
that's like a terrible Trope but they

2423
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:26,679
might want

2424
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:29,238
bright cartoony things that grab the eye

2425
01:40:26,679 --> 01:40:32,440
so that adults will purchase it that's

2426
01:40:29,238 --> 01:40:35,118
really what it is it's just bright ey

2427
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:37,359
grabbing artwork because most of the

2428
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:39,000
stuff is being sold in myar anyway it's

2429
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:44,118
not like you're touching it and smelling

2430
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:46,760
it and and um and seeing it or whatever

2431
01:40:44,118 --> 01:40:48,880
so it's all just it's all the myar is

2432
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:51,880
sort of like your

2433
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:54,960
ad right yeah and there there's there's

2434
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:58,800
also in this whole argument there's a

2435
01:40:54,960 --> 01:41:02,399
generation gap learning curve right so

2436
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:06,239
imagine this that there was a certain

2437
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:10,879
period of time when

2438
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:13,919
cartoons were for kids Boomers look at

2439
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:17,359
cartoons and they go those came out when

2440
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,960
we were kids or they came out when my

2441
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:20,238
parents were kids in the case of like

2442
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,000
the older

2443
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:26,479
cartoons but people who are from later

2444
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,520
Generations their parents grew up with

2445
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:32,399
cartoons and they never stopped watching

2446
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:35,119
them cartoons are not inherently related

2447
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:36,960
adult anymore that's a boomer

2448
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:39,719
perspective that's a pre- boomer

2449
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,079
perspective so when you see something

2450
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:44,520
that has colorful characters and it's

2451
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:47,399
cartoony and it's all this it's like no

2452
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:51,360
guys that's the people who are now in

2453
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:54,439
their 50s and their 40s and their 30s

2454
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:57,039
they grew up with cartoons but their

2455
01:41:54,439 --> 01:42:00,439
parents still watched cartoons possibly

2456
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:02,679
and cartoons are made now for adults and

2457
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:06,000
there's been ever since the 60s there's

2458
01:42:02,679 --> 01:42:08,840
been tons of cartoons that were made for

2459
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,118
adults specifically and that is a later

2460
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:13,800
phenomenon and so the people who are

2461
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:16,039
looking at it and going oh cartoons

2462
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:19,279
that's for kids it's like there's not

2463
01:42:16,039 --> 01:42:22,599
anything anymore at all that says

2464
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:26,238
cartoons are for kids kids aren't even

2465
01:42:22,599 --> 01:42:29,279
that into cartoons relative to what kids

2466
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:31,319
like Mr Beast kids like streamers like

2467
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:34,039
it'd be different if it was like oh this

2468
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:36,599
is the kais sonat packaging this is you

2469
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:38,319
know video game packaging that maybe

2470
01:42:36,599 --> 01:42:41,279
would be a little more related to kids

2471
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:42,880
but cartoony stuff like cereal boxes

2472
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:45,399
that's not the thing anymore those

2473
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:48,239
things are old those are the things that

2474
01:42:45,399 --> 01:42:49,960
The Regulators think kids are into and

2475
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:51,519
they don't even know what kids are into

2476
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,840
because they they're people regulating

2477
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,360
all this [ __ ] don't even have kids

2478
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,400
anymore their kids are all my age now

2479
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,319
you know what I mean like my my my

2480
01:42:57,399 --> 01:43:01,399
generation and mean we probably got up

2481
01:42:59,319 --> 01:43:04,799
at 600 or 7 in the morning on Saturday

2482
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:06,839
to watch cartoons yes right but my kids

2483
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:09,239
don't do that they don't have to like

2484
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:11,000
wake up they can stream you know they

2485
01:43:09,238 --> 01:43:12,439
don't have to wake up at a certain time

2486
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,319
they think it like that that that is

2487
01:43:12,439 --> 01:43:19,598
like wild to them so you know but it is

2488
01:43:15,319 --> 01:43:21,719
it is there is a whole thing of like all

2489
01:43:19,599 --> 01:43:24,400
these companies realized well what do

2490
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:27,639
you mean half the weed names are plays

2491
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:29,759
on our trademarks yeah because that just

2492
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:32,279
kept happening all kinds of different

2493
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,000
things you know I mean there's even like

2494
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:36,479
there's even weed strains named after

2495
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,479
famous

2496
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:41,679
actors you know and stuff like that

2497
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:44,238
there's we we we borrow from all kinds

2498
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:46,079
of culture we grab whatever we want we

2499
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:47,959
put our own twist on it we always did no

2500
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:50,000
one could tell everyone told us we were

2501
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:52,359
wrong anyway so we just did whatever we

2502
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,118
wanted and now that it's going legal

2503
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,799
it's like oh it's you're we're going to

2504
01:43:54,118 --> 01:43:58,359
bump into this stuff and then the other

2505
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,679
part of it is that I don't really see

2506
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:03,639
cannabis like other drugs but there's

2507
01:44:00,679 --> 01:44:06,279
always been this Trope in America that

2508
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:08,520
drug people want to push their their

2509
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:12,519
wees onto

2510
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:14,599
children right and I like there's no

2511
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:17,080
cannabis people that could get like that

2512
01:44:14,599 --> 01:44:19,319
doesn't there's no there was never any

2513
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:21,238
like oh let's hit the high school with

2514
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:23,198
you know this or like let's give homie

2515
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:25,879
the dime bags in Middle School like that

2516
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,719
was never even never on anyone's radar

2517
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:31,319
ever it never occurred that was some

2518
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:33,599
like fever dream cooked up in some Far

2519
01:44:31,319 --> 01:44:36,920
Away place that they had no idea but it

2520
01:44:33,599 --> 01:44:38,599
exists yeah dare were dare was the was

2521
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:41,079
the people who brought all the drugs to

2522
01:44:38,599 --> 01:44:42,480
your school it wasn't anybody else they

2523
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:44,118
were the only ones who showed up and

2524
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:46,759
went hey have you ever seen and they

2525
01:44:44,118 --> 01:44:49,559
showed up in a sports car and you were

2526
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:50,920
like dang they have a nice ride where

2527
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,719
they they got that that dude got a

2528
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:56,560
Corvette whoa you know

2529
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:58,639
all glued to one board man this dude's

2530
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,280
balling you know like that's crazy never

2531
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:01,920
seen so many I never didn't even I

2532
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:03,198
didn't even know what these drugs were

2533
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:06,800
you know

2534
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:08,678
like a Thor introduction I guess yeah uh

2535
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,239
and you know it it probably will change

2536
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:14,039
because right now we're in the purple

2537
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:17,799
candy gas era of California Cannabis so

2538
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:19,359
I would imagine candy themes every name

2539
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,800
not every name there's some people out

2540
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,319
there that are changing but right now

2541
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,199
we're certainly in the can I call my

2542
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:28,439
weed a candy or

2543
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:31,919
dessert it's very heavily in that vein

2544
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:34,399
and so you know also like mean jeene was

2545
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,158
saying with video games a lot of older

2546
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:39,279
or ancient adults that are making our

2547
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:42,198
laws associate candy with

2548
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:45,359
kids why would an adult eat

2549
01:45:42,198 --> 01:45:47,359
candy you know uh they if you told them

2550
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:48,839
that the most famous weed in California

2551
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:52,359
right now was stuff that was purple

2552
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:54,920
candy gas they would be baffled at what

2553
01:45:52,359 --> 01:45:54,920
that even meant

2554
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:58,638
you

2555
01:45:56,479 --> 01:46:00,000
know they probably might think it's like

2556
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:02,679
in response to

2557
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Children yeah and generationally you

2558
01:46:02,679 --> 01:46:06,840
know there was you know there was there

2559
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,760
was a certain time when there was so

2560
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,639
much of that stuff basically when I

2561
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:15,440
think it was Reagan made it legal to

2562
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:18,679
advertise to children and so anybody who

2563
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:22,039
was an adult in that era the people who

2564
01:46:18,679 --> 01:46:23,800
were adults in the 80s in the early 80s

2565
01:46:22,039 --> 01:46:25,880
are the people who who think that all

2566
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,880
this advertising to children is

2567
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:29,840
advertising to children but what they

2568
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:34,400
don't realize is that all those children

2569
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:38,480
who were advertised to then are now 40

2570
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:40,719
something 50 years old and they are

2571
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:43,479
still like that stuff all looks normal

2572
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:45,960
to them so like if you show me something

2573
01:46:43,479 --> 01:46:47,678
that has like a cool cartoon character

2574
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:49,920
on it I'm like oh that's pretty cool

2575
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:52,000
like you can put like Skeletor on some

2576
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,679
[ __ ] and I'm oh that sounds dope it's

2577
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,359
your shit's called skelet

2578
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,359
like damn that's probably hardcore you

2579
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:59,238
know what I mean and it sounds cool to

2580
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:01,319
me but like they would go oh well that's

2581
01:46:59,238 --> 01:47:04,000
for kids and it's like no kids it's not

2582
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:05,519
kids don't know Skeletor it's not just

2583
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,840
because it was a cartoon from then it's

2584
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:10,320
not like that is what's hip with the

2585
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,480
young kids now you know but they people

2586
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:13,759
don't know

2587
01:47:11,479 --> 01:47:15,238
it's yeah they don't realize that like

2588
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,079
kids today probably don't care about

2589
01:47:15,238 --> 01:47:19,479
Skeletor but there's all these cartoons

2590
01:47:17,079 --> 01:47:23,118
that classify that qualify as

2591
01:47:19,479 --> 01:47:25,839
Nostalgia yeah for people like our AG

2592
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,598
it's for adults yeah yeah a 10-year-old

2593
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,159
doesn't

2594
01:47:26,599 --> 01:47:31,520
care like what is what you like you know

2595
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:33,479
like you can see behind me I you can see

2596
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,199
what my art is for my brand there's no

2597
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:38,519
weed in it it has nothing to do with

2598
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:41,759
weed it's a seed it's a seed brand it's

2599
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:44,800
a apparel brand it can be whatever it is

2600
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:46,719
it is what it is and I made it that way

2601
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,639
because I like to have it be something

2602
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,920
like oh yeah my kid can wear the shirt

2603
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:54,079
to school it could be whatever it is if

2604
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,319
you know what it is you know what it is

2605
01:47:54,079 --> 01:48:00,439
you know it's very very much a weed

2606
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:02,479
thing but it isn't it isn't like

2607
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:07,000
cartoony there's nothing like that that

2608
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:09,759
was how I wanted my thing to look but if

2609
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:14,238
I see something that's super super

2610
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:17,159
cartoony like it's it's it's like it's a

2611
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:20,359
weird definition so you go so what is a

2612
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:23,598
cartoon is that a cartoon it's handdrawn

2613
01:48:20,359 --> 01:48:27,279
it's not photo realistic it's

2614
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:30,039
stylized it has bright colors is it a

2615
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:32,559
cartoon I don't know for a while they

2616
01:48:30,039 --> 01:48:35,039
said that you couldn't have any animals

2617
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,840
and I was like so my hummingbird is this

2618
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:39,399
this is is this what kids want to this

2619
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,239
is what kids are into is a humming bird

2620
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:46,158
up here I don't think so but if it was

2621
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:49,439
more cartoony does that is that

2622
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:51,598
inherently appeal the CH to to to the

2623
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:53,439
child mind I don't I just don't get it

2624
01:48:51,599 --> 01:48:54,920
you know like the whole the whole thing

2625
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:58,799
is trippy you know like is this a

2626
01:48:54,920 --> 01:49:01,118
cartoon it's an animal it's handrawn

2627
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,440
like look at old cartoons look at like

2628
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:05,920
Snow White it's almost photorealistic in

2629
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:08,158
some cases there's only a little bit of

2630
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,880
caricature added to certain things the

2631
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,399
backgrounds are totally realistic like

2632
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:15,199
the whole the whole thing is really

2633
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,839
strange the definitions and the more the

2634
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:18,759
more they try to Define it the more

2635
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,599
they're going to wind up going oh [ __ ]

2636
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,360
we just need to put serial numbers on

2637
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:25,079
everything and then at that point you're

2638
01:49:22,359 --> 01:49:27,399
like just Tak everything out of the

2639
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:30,039
product and the marketing so I think the

2640
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:32,679
whole thing's goofy as [ __ ] myself but

2641
01:49:30,039 --> 01:49:35,599
that's just my take on it you

2642
01:49:32,679 --> 01:49:37,960
know no certainly and look it seems like

2643
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:40,079
there's sort of endless degrees of which

2644
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,520
you can try to nitpick at it which I

2645
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:43,880
completely understand one of the things

2646
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,679
notso dog said that I think is a great

2647
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:47,760
segue is that you know the fact we're in

2648
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,800
the purple candy gas error of course

2649
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:53,239
lends itself to the fact that you're

2650
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:54,800
going to see this sort of marketing but

2651
01:49:53,238 --> 01:49:58,519
as it so

2652
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:01,440
happens excuse more one of the major

2653
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:03,360
movers and shakers Mr DOA himself Has

2654
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:06,759
Come Out Swinging

2655
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:10,519
saying the age of candy is over he says

2656
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:12,719
biscotti soap gelonade permanent

2657
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:14,920
marker is uh is what people are

2658
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:17,480
requesting at the moment he says that

2659
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:19,399
candy is not on the menu what do you

2660
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:22,759
guys

2661
01:50:19,399 --> 01:50:26,799
think it's kind of a vague definition

2662
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:29,960
like I consider all those things to be

2663
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:33,679
um to be

2664
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,439
candy you know to me I mean I don't say

2665
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:38,319
I don't think that they're like

2666
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:40,319
exclusively gassy I mean they are nice

2667
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:43,198
and gasy don't get me wrong they smell

2668
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:45,359
good they smell acrid they're nice

2669
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:47,359
everything to me smells like the very

2670
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:50,479
best of

2671
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:53,839
um of like the really really cool

2672
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:56,439
afghanis from back in the day like

2673
01:50:53,840 --> 01:51:00,159
uh not so NOS like the thing that they

2674
01:50:56,439 --> 01:51:04,559
called FX up here is very close to what

2675
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:08,799
now everybody calls the candy gas or the

2676
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:12,280
purple gas of now and meaning like past

2677
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:14,599
the candy where it's the gasier side um

2678
01:51:12,279 --> 01:51:17,840
that kind of like acrid with that

2679
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:20,800
interesting edge of soapiness and the

2680
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:22,719
kind of like this deep kind of musky

2681
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,560
there's this certain profile that you

2682
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:28,078
know if you know it from way back in the

2683
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:30,199
day and uh it was like things that pop

2684
01:51:28,078 --> 01:51:32,559
out of certain purple afghanis you know

2685
01:51:30,198 --> 01:51:34,559
the most special of the deep chunk the

2686
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:37,360
monkey balls that's really the rare ones

2687
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:39,039
in there um this thing I had called Big

2688
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,118
Blue some of the stuff that would pop

2689
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,158
out like even now when I did all the

2690
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:46,359
Hindu s1s there's these things that pop

2691
01:51:43,158 --> 01:51:47,960
out and I'm like oh they smell like

2692
01:51:46,359 --> 01:51:49,598
really like they're kind of in that

2693
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:52,920
ballpark

2694
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:55,199
but it's still so similar all that weed

2695
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:58,319
is so similar to just like cookies

2696
01:51:55,198 --> 01:52:00,638
gelato weed like it's not that different

2697
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:02,759
to say that all of a sudden now

2698
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:07,760
everything is totally flipped it's a new

2699
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:10,320
paradigm I'm like it is just more of the

2700
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,599
same [ __ ] weed like it's literally

2701
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:17,238
all the same weed that I grew up with

2702
01:52:12,599 --> 01:52:19,119
90s I anything new it's really good

2703
01:52:17,238 --> 01:52:21,759
they're good versions but like I'm

2704
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:23,639
literally pulling out of these ones that

2705
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,000
I just cut down down I'm smelling them

2706
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:29,039
and I'm like there's that thing there's

2707
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,198
that thing I mean this is jarro Sensei

2708
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:33,639
this is sensey Star Cross Sensi Star

2709
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:37,118
Cross jaro and then I crossed it with

2710
01:52:33,639 --> 01:52:40,159
Hindu this smells really similar to

2711
01:52:37,118 --> 01:52:43,198
those things like permanent marker or

2712
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:46,679
the other things with the musk the soap

2713
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:50,238
the little bit of that Afghani cookies

2714
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:51,679
underlying thing that like if you know

2715
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:53,279
that kind of weed you know that kind of

2716
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:55,239
weed and to me

2717
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:57,479
I'm just like it's just we've been stuck

2718
01:52:55,238 --> 01:52:59,959
there we've been stuck there since

2719
01:52:57,479 --> 01:53:02,399
[ __ ] animal cookies in my opinion

2720
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:04,800
it's all the same thing and now if you

2721
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:07,238
haven't seen that original type by

2722
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,760
itself then you can't see that

2723
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:12,439
everything is a quarter that but if you

2724
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:15,360
know that type you see that it's just

2725
01:53:12,439 --> 01:53:18,078
all modulating this one type and it's

2726
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:20,399
just like this swirling thing of them

2727
01:53:18,078 --> 01:53:22,679
dancing around this [ __ ] thing that's

2728
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:25,279
all the same weed and I honestly for

2729
01:53:22,679 --> 01:53:27,599
myself have no problem with it because

2730
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:30,118
that weed from back in the day that t

2731
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:32,199
that type was always kind of my favorite

2732
01:53:30,118 --> 01:53:34,359
that was really hard to lock down and I

2733
01:53:32,198 --> 01:53:36,759
really [ __ ] liked it and all all my

2734
01:53:34,359 --> 01:53:39,399
buddy had something that was

2735
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:41,320
uh oh I can't remember what it was but

2736
01:53:39,399 --> 01:53:45,039
it was like it was something he made and

2737
01:53:41,319 --> 01:53:47,719
it was like Jokers crossed

2738
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:49,639
with I want to say like cookies and

2739
01:53:47,719 --> 01:53:51,679
cream or something like that and he

2740
01:53:49,639 --> 01:53:53,599
handed me a butt and I went that's that

2741
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:55,880
[ __ ] that came out out of that weed I

2742
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:57,840
had that first Garden in the 90s that

2743
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:00,199
with that coffee smell that almost

2744
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,719
smells a little bit like Sharpie markers

2745
01:54:00,198 --> 01:54:04,879
like kind of opium and I'm smelling and

2746
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,118
I'm going I [ __ ] love this type and

2747
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,118
it's just so funny because it's just

2748
01:54:06,118 --> 01:54:11,399
more [ __ ] cookies weed it's all the

2749
01:54:08,118 --> 01:54:13,719
same it's all that thing and I love it

2750
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:15,759
but to say that like it's all flipped on

2751
01:54:13,719 --> 01:54:18,239
its head now and it's like yeah maybe

2752
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:19,840
now Skittles isn't the biggest thing and

2753
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:23,118
people want things that are like a

2754
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:24,960
variation of biscotti or they want like

2755
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:26,679
this variation like all those things to

2756
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,279
me when I smell them all I'm kind of

2757
01:54:26,679 --> 01:54:30,719
like that's it's not like it's that it's

2758
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:33,319
not like it's that different it's not

2759
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:35,239
like you smelled um it's not like you

2760
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:37,719
smelled Jack and then you smelled

2761
01:54:35,238 --> 01:54:40,759
Skittles or you smelled OG and then you

2762
01:54:37,719 --> 01:54:43,198
smelled purple Urkle it's like no it's

2763
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:45,400
it's all really close together to me

2764
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:48,198
it's in a tight Target of what like

2765
01:54:45,399 --> 01:54:51,118
you're breeding in my opinion but

2766
01:54:48,198 --> 01:54:52,879
everybody I don't know it's not and it's

2767
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:54,759
not to say that it's really same I'm

2768
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,719
just saying that it's all a quarter the

2769
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:58,520
same and then everything is different

2770
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:01,039
around it on this Frame of this old

2771
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:03,840
Afghan smell I have a quick thought and

2772
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:05,519
a long thought my quick thought because

2773
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,840
you made me stare at that picture for a

2774
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,159
long time is I don't have a diamond

2775
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:12,400
watch that makes me look cool when I

2776
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:15,039
want to smoke joints and have people

2777
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:17,078
take pictures of me but it seems very

2778
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:19,960
important to have diamond watches down

2779
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:22,359
in SoCal and be part of the weed scene

2780
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:25,679
uh there's a lot of uh nice watch going

2781
01:55:22,359 --> 01:55:30,078
going on status symbols and you know

2782
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:31,039
yeah and two I mean dude I think that

2783
01:55:30,078 --> 01:55:34,439
you

2784
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:36,840
know the reality of it is is that

2785
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:40,078
cookies became some of the most popular

2786
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:42,719
weed and it became popular at a time

2787
01:55:40,078 --> 01:55:45,840
when people started reversing Cuts

2788
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:48,000
specific Cuts onto other cuts and so we

2789
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,360
just went through like what he was

2790
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,599
saying at length about everything kind

2791
01:55:50,359 --> 01:55:54,399
of being the same same is we this

2792
01:55:52,599 --> 01:55:56,039
running joke that like a lot of times

2793
01:55:54,399 --> 01:55:59,759
when people are like oh look at this new

2794
01:55:56,039 --> 01:56:02,960
new and it's same same it's like there's

2795
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:08,280
only so many variations of like cookie

2796
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:10,800
gelato OG hybrids all using the same 8

2797
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:13,000
to 10 cuts in different combinations

2798
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,520
blending themselves together there might

2799
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,639
be really nice weed that comes out of

2800
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:21,320
that sometime but because weed boomed

2801
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:22,800
and changed around then it's going to

2802
01:56:21,319 --> 01:56:24,840
take real effort

2803
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:27,199
like I would imagine do is going to be

2804
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:29,719
like oh the age of candy is over and

2805
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:32,559
here's like eight new kind of candish

2806
01:56:29,719 --> 01:56:34,439
strains that are different but the same

2807
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,360
and it's almost like feeding people more

2808
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:38,638
of the same genre of music but trying to

2809
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:41,319
say it's

2810
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:43,199
groundbreaking right there's so many

2811
01:56:41,319 --> 01:56:46,279
breeders and there's so many people

2812
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:49,439
whose start was using things that were

2813
01:56:46,279 --> 01:56:51,679
heavily made out of the same few Cuts

2814
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:55,198
it's going to take some time to Branch

2815
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:56,920
out because a lot of people those are

2816
01:56:55,198 --> 01:57:00,678
the ones they had access to when they

2817
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:04,239
started working right and so it's just

2818
01:57:00,679 --> 01:57:07,520
flooded with all this same stuff you

2819
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:10,519
know and it's like you know uh there's

2820
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:14,159
thin mint but then you know sherbet is

2821
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:17,960
thin mint you know and then gelato is

2822
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:19,638
sherbet by Thin Mint and then you know

2823
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:21,439
and you start adding various four or

2824
01:57:19,639 --> 01:57:23,039
five different OG cuts and you start

2825
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:25,598
adding these different purples and stuff

2826
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:27,639
and they get a million names but if you

2827
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:30,639
scale it all back the genetics really

2828
01:57:27,639 --> 01:57:32,920
aren't that wide and that is become like

2829
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:35,840
sort of the bulk Market there's plenty

2830
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:37,840
of cool people that have access to like

2831
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:42,599
heirlooms or stuff that are completely

2832
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:44,239
outside that thing but we're like Creeks

2833
01:57:42,599 --> 01:57:46,520
you know we're not the main river we're

2834
01:57:44,238 --> 01:57:50,238
not the main tributary we're like an

2835
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:53,639
offshoot the main tributary is this so

2836
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:55,519
even if dudes like that over it would be

2837
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:58,560
a scramble like I don't know what the

2838
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:02,000
next big thing is because the market has

2839
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:05,199
changed so much there's not the way that

2840
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:08,319
everything became a big thing is

2841
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:11,678
different you know like almost

2842
01:58:08,319 --> 01:58:14,118
every almost every famous Elite started

2843
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:17,199
in some small group people liked the

2844
01:58:14,118 --> 01:58:19,118
smoke it grew it it got it sold for a

2845
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:21,319
bunch of money more people wanted it

2846
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:23,679
because of the money it started growing

2847
01:58:21,319 --> 01:58:25,439
Brokers started asking for it and that's

2848
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:26,960
how the first wave of purple or that's

2849
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:28,839
how the Hindu or that's how the northern

2850
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:31,560
lights or that's how the white family or

2851
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:34,800
that's how the you know the sour or the

2852
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:38,360
cookie or Skittles worked but now we

2853
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:40,880
have modern marketing so it's like where

2854
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:45,759
is the next wave of weed going to Bubble

2855
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:48,679
Up from there's there's a lot of same

2856
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:50,119
same right now and so for things to

2857
01:58:48,679 --> 01:58:52,399
really be different it's going to have

2858
01:58:50,118 --> 01:58:54,759
to come it's going to literally honestly

2859
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:56,359
have to be somebody like you know we I

2860
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:58,400
mean we can mention a bunch of names but

2861
01:58:56,359 --> 01:59:00,519
it's going to have to be somebody

2862
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:01,960
like different that comes out with

2863
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:04,280
something different that just breaks

2864
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:06,399
through and becomes popular and then

2865
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:08,279
honestly what's going to happen is that

2866
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:11,118
thing is going to get a million

2867
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:13,118
variations with names attached like if

2868
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:15,118
mean jeene came out and his Yaro by

2869
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:17,399
Whatever by whatever became the next big

2870
01:59:15,118 --> 01:59:19,679
thing people would take it and reverse

2871
01:59:17,399 --> 01:59:21,158
it and copy it and buy seeds of it and

2872
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:23,199
cross it to different things and make

2873
01:59:21,158 --> 01:59:25,679
their own versions of it and then that

2874
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,839
would dominate for a bit so I don't know

2875
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:30,239
where it's going to go because the whole

2876
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:32,920
method of things getting popular has

2877
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:35,598
changed now it's like you have

2878
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:37,679
influencers like DOA or like burner like

2879
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:38,920
whoever that are telling us what the

2880
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,158
next Heat

2881
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:43,719
is and it's probably something they have

2882
01:59:41,158 --> 01:59:45,238
a line on making money off of and if it

2883
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:47,279
doesn't work in six months they'll have

2884
01:59:45,238 --> 01:59:51,039
the next

2885
01:59:47,279 --> 01:59:56,279
heater weed has been this weird thing

2886
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:57,760
where consumers told farmers and Brokers

2887
01:59:56,279 --> 02:00:00,158
what they

2888
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:04,360
wanted and they sort of demanded it

2889
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:06,519
nobody nobody would have chosen to grow

2890
02:00:04,359 --> 02:00:08,118
Kush right like you got to figure out

2891
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:09,800
how to like make these rinky dinky

2892
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:11,279
little like dink dink dink dink dink

2893
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,880
dink chunks you know you'd want to grow

2894
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:16,279
like some kind of big stretchy Afghan

2895
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:17,679
sativa thing a blue dream a something

2896
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:20,319
that you know something that gets huge

2897
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:22,760
like in mean jeene era of 500 gallon

2898
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:24,880
pots and 12-footers

2899
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:27,320
you know like nobody would choose cookie

2900
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,920
from a production standpoint it doesn't

2901
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:31,679
like food doesn't like light doesn't

2902
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:34,078
like to get very tall but consumers used

2903
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:36,359
to demand certain things and then

2904
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:39,238
farmers and Brokers rushed in to fill

2905
02:00:36,359 --> 02:00:41,078
that demand and I'm not sure that same

2906
02:00:39,238 --> 02:00:43,598
Dynamic exists

2907
02:00:41,078 --> 02:00:45,679
anymore because of the changes and I

2908
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:47,639
don't know what dynamic is necessarily

2909
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:51,279
going to replace

2910
02:00:47,639 --> 02:00:54,639
it you know um but it might just be that

2911
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:57,559
doa's is like his customer base they're

2912
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:59,000
just bored of it like music you know

2913
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:00,280
they're just bored of this genre and

2914
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,599
they want something new they want

2915
02:01:00,279 --> 02:01:05,840
something different you know they've

2916
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:08,319
been smoking the same variations of the

2917
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:10,520
same thing 45 times over for the last

2918
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:12,359
eight years and they're over it it

2919
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:14,400
happened already we already saw it when

2920
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:16,399
it was originally the purple craze of

2921
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:18,479
the sweet weed and that was all anyone

2922
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:20,559
would touch and it was urel and

2923
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:22,718
everybody wanted that and Granddaddy and

2924
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:24,520
anything that was really close to that

2925
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:27,000
then it flipped we talk about it all the

2926
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:29,520
time then it flipped to Kush and then

2927
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:33,118
all the stuff that's now out is kind of

2928
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:36,280
like all URL Kush and it's the second

2929
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:39,960
purple wave Deja Vu and then it's like

2930
02:01:36,279 --> 02:01:42,559
if you take to me if you take URL OG and

2931
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:44,359
like Bubba or Hindu and you mix that

2932
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,239
together you're going to keep spitting

2933
02:01:44,359 --> 02:01:48,679
out all these things that everybody

2934
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:50,678
keeps going oh this is the new new like

2935
02:01:48,679 --> 02:01:53,000
you could get like a Urkel and a OG

2936
02:01:50,679 --> 02:01:55,000
combo and if it's twe just the right way

2937
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,880
you could have something like Skittles

2938
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,639
it just has to have a lot of the most

2939
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:01,078
special part of the urel with a little

2940
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:03,279
bit of the OG part that isn't the accurd

2941
02:02:01,078 --> 02:02:05,799
part and you'll wind up with this crazy

2942
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:08,399
soapy fruity thing you just need this

2943
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:10,000
10% of this and 10% of that get rid of

2944
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:11,839
all the rest of all that [ __ ] and you

2945
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,639
can wind up with this thing that's like

2946
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:17,000
this but it's just a trip to me what's

2947
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:18,319
funny with like as far as like what's

2948
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,560
the next big

2949
02:02:18,319 --> 02:02:24,359
thing um for my nose

2950
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,840
like even though that's because I'm

2951
02:02:24,359 --> 02:02:27,399
really interested in plants and I'm

2952
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,400
really interested in variety and

2953
02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:32,479
preservation and all that stuff but as

2954
02:02:29,399 --> 02:02:34,759
far as for products I don't even think

2955
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:37,839
that it's a weird thing that we've

2956
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:41,280
arrived where we've arrived because if

2957
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:43,000
you took me when I was 16 and you asked

2958
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:45,479
me what everything what everything

2959
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,198
should be that's the very biggest thing

2960
02:02:45,479 --> 02:02:49,319
on the market I would have said what it

2961
02:02:47,198 --> 02:02:51,559
is right now because that was the weed

2962
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:53,238
that I liked then and that was when

2963
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:54,599
people used to ask me what's the best

2964
02:02:53,238 --> 02:02:56,559
thing you've ever seen I was like oh

2965
02:02:54,599 --> 02:02:59,360
it's this crazy Frosty purple [ __ ] and

2966
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:01,920
it smelled like super like crazy and

2967
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:04,439
deep and dark and chemically and Balm

2968
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,760
but fruity and like there's these crazy

2969
02:03:04,439 --> 02:03:09,158
old kinds of weed that are really balm

2970
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:11,159
like you know like yeah they're not like

2971
02:03:09,158 --> 02:03:14,118
they're not like you know like your

2972
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:16,158
Mendo but at the same time they share a

2973
02:03:14,118 --> 02:03:18,880
lot of the appeal that those kind of

2974
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:21,359
plants have where you're like oh if you

2975
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:23,880
liked Urkel you you might think if you

2976
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:25,880
liked ccle and you really like tindu

2977
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:28,560
then you probably wouldn't hate

2978
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:31,520
permanent marker because these things

2979
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:34,880
are all kind of like this kind of like a

2980
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:37,159
modern take on old Afghan weed with a

2981
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,880
little bit of something exotic thrown in

2982
02:03:37,158 --> 02:03:41,559
from a rare plant that you wouldn't

2983
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,679
normally find in a field of ACD weed and

2984
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,280
that's where it's like kind of like this

2985
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:48,399
magic combination and I think that's one

2986
02:03:46,279 --> 02:03:51,000
of the reason why it gets stuck like

2987
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:53,078
that is because for a lot of people if

2988
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,599
they're really into something like these

2989
02:03:53,078 --> 02:03:59,439
newest of the crazy things that are out

2990
02:03:55,599 --> 02:04:02,159
right now um whatever they are if you do

2991
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:04,479
give them a bag of Blue Dream and you

2992
02:04:02,158 --> 02:04:06,078
give them a bag of permanent marker

2993
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:08,238
they're going to go back to the bag of

2994
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:09,679
the permanent marker more and the blue

2995
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:11,359
dream's not going to be the thing they

2996
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:12,840
want to smoke you're you're not going to

2997
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:15,399
convert them even if they're not

2998
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:17,319
influenced they're just going to be like

2999
02:04:15,399 --> 02:04:19,319
I don't know this one just has this

3000
02:04:17,319 --> 02:04:21,719
thing to it it's thick it's Rich it

3001
02:04:19,319 --> 02:04:23,279
smokes good and you know most people

3002
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,920
people smoke so much weed they're not

3003
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:26,559
going to notice that the high is kind of

3004
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:27,960
lackluster because every [ __ ] high

3005
02:04:26,559 --> 02:04:31,000
they've had in the last 10 years is

3006
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:34,078
lackluster anyway because well that

3007
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,078
actually makes me hopeful because dude I

3008
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:41,238
coming from the Midwest I grew up on

3009
02:04:37,078 --> 02:04:44,359
Mexican yeah right and I remember when I

3010
02:04:41,238 --> 02:04:47,439
first got my a sack of much better than

3011
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:51,359
Mexican weed and I was like oh my God

3012
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:53,359
weed can be like this and so there are

3013
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:55,238
people out there that grew up on purple

3014
02:04:53,359 --> 02:04:57,198
candy gas and I'm not trying to diss it

3015
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:59,598
all hard but like I think most heads

3016
02:04:57,198 --> 02:05:01,960
would agree there are some exceptions

3017
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:04,360
but for the most part it's kind of got

3018
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:06,520
like a medium mid-grade kind of flat

3019
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:09,558
high that you get a tolerance to like it

3020
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:12,639
might look beautiful taste great smoke

3021
02:05:09,559 --> 02:05:14,880
well or whatever but it doesn't actually

3022
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:17,840
have some of the more unique highs that

3023
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:19,559
other strains do right and so those

3024
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:21,279
young people one day they might smoke a

3025
02:05:19,559 --> 02:05:23,880
haze or they might smoke something weird

3026
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:25,439
and not even realize weed can do that

3027
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,400
because they've been tough puffing on

3028
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:31,558
this like this like one offshoot right

3029
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:33,558
and I will say two that one of the

3030
02:05:31,559 --> 02:05:36,520
things that that I don't know if it's

3031
02:05:33,559 --> 02:05:38,360
true or not but the re one of the

3032
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:40,400
reasons why people loved Crossing things

3033
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:42,238
to cookie Was Not only was it so famous

3034
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:45,479
but like cookie was sort of the was sort

3035
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:47,319
of like where things shifted from a lot

3036
02:05:45,479 --> 02:05:48,519
of kind of ugly weed that was still

3037
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:51,679
really nice

3038
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:55,800
sold cookie made everything has to look

3039
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:59,679
visually amazing and it really did up

3040
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:01,960
how most things looked right and you're

3041
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:03,840
on IG you're on this you can't smell it

3042
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:06,920
you can't smoke it you can't squeeze it

3043
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:10,559
but you can look at it and we're very

3044
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:13,239
visual creatures and so I do kind of

3045
02:06:10,559 --> 02:06:15,279
Wonder it not because the funny part

3046
02:06:13,238 --> 02:06:17,479
about weed is that looks really doesn't

3047
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:19,679
matter like it doesn't like looks

3048
02:06:17,479 --> 02:06:21,439
doesn't make it taste good or work well

3049
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:24,399
you can't tell how what it looks like in

3050
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:27,279
a joint really but it really matters as

3051
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:29,279
far as sales right now and I don't know

3052
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:32,519
how easy it would be for a phenomenal

3053
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:37,000
strain that's a little uglier to catch

3054
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:39,119
on in today's market it might take a

3055
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,039
sort of a maturing of the scene for a

3056
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:45,839
while because everyone's used to weed

3057
02:06:42,039 --> 02:06:49,880
looking fire I'll tell you straight up

3058
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:52,159
dude um when the sour craze really first

3059
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:55,639
hit in meno

3060
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:58,000
most Brokers and me and Gan will back me

3061
02:06:55,639 --> 02:06:59,880
up on this a lot of times they would

3062
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,840
come over and they would open the bag

3063
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:05,078
and if the nose hit them the right way

3064
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,800
they would just be like yes they knew

3065
02:07:05,078 --> 02:07:08,319
that if it smelled like that it was

3066
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,880
going to work for them they'd still look

3067
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:13,279
through it and stuff but there was this

3068
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:14,719
nose and it's like if they opened it up

3069
02:07:13,279 --> 02:07:17,479
and they got hit with it and they knew

3070
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:19,279
it was fresh and it was good that nose

3071
02:07:17,479 --> 02:07:21,638
was going to be like okay we're this is

3072
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:23,198
going to work they were only looking

3073
02:07:21,639 --> 02:07:24,920
mold right so they didn't even care and

3074
02:07:23,198 --> 02:07:28,158
there was a lot of times where like sour

3075
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:31,039
could look kind of stemy kind of you

3076
02:07:28,158 --> 02:07:33,519
know like it wasn't it it you know it

3077
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:35,118
wasn't always the prettiest

3078
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:38,159
looking

3079
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:40,279
sack but it didn't matter they knew it

3080
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:41,598
was potent and it smelled amazing and

3081
02:07:40,279 --> 02:07:43,000
that was going to work for their market

3082
02:07:41,599 --> 02:07:45,639
and that's what they cared about but

3083
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,880
right now people are so indoctrinated

3084
02:07:45,639 --> 02:07:50,639
and weed

3085
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:53,559
looking extremely visually attractive I

3086
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:55,078
wonder if that's like a permanent shift

3087
02:07:53,559 --> 02:07:57,239
where you're just going to have to breed

3088
02:07:55,078 --> 02:07:59,759
weed that looks attractive or I wonder

3089
02:07:57,238 --> 02:08:02,479
if there's going to be openness to

3090
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:04,920
like this weed looks kind of ugly but

3091
02:08:02,479 --> 02:08:08,919
man it's lip smackingly

3092
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:11,359
good yeah you know and when I'm say like

3093
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:14,199
the the weed like my favorite weed like

3094
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:16,279
back in the day some of it that I'm

3095
02:08:14,198 --> 02:08:19,719
talking about was because of how it

3096
02:08:16,279 --> 02:08:21,639
smoked it tasted so good we smoked so

3097
02:08:19,719 --> 02:08:24,198
much weed that if it tasted really good

3098
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:26,400
and it burnt right it was like that was

3099
02:08:24,198 --> 02:08:28,359
enough because it was like you know the

3100
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:29,558
high we weren't that worried about it

3101
02:08:28,359 --> 02:08:32,598
because we knew we were going to get

3102
02:08:29,559 --> 02:08:33,960
high because we so much [ __ ] weed but

3103
02:08:32,599 --> 02:08:37,000
but yeah a lot of the highs are more

3104
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:39,039
lackluster but more I mean like it was

3105
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:42,039
the weed that I looked at and was like

3106
02:08:39,039 --> 02:08:44,760
this is what

3107
02:08:42,039 --> 02:08:46,599
I if you had a time machine you're like

3108
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:49,320
oh man people would buy this [ __ ] so

3109
02:08:46,599 --> 02:08:51,440
fast and for a lot of people buying weed

3110
02:08:49,319 --> 02:08:55,078
it it it's never going to come down to

3111
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:57,319
to the character of the high or any of

3112
02:08:55,078 --> 02:08:59,880
that it a for a lot of people it's

3113
02:08:57,319 --> 02:09:02,319
always just going to be they look at it

3114
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:03,920
real quick and they go oh [ __ ] that's

3115
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:06,679
awesome a lot of people are going to

3116
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:09,158
continue to choose friends like that how

3117
02:09:06,679 --> 02:09:10,679
many people do you know who the the

3118
02:09:09,158 --> 02:09:14,158
friends who they will choose are the

3119
02:09:10,679 --> 02:09:17,800
people who they know have the most money

3120
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:19,439
or the most access to a certain crowd or

3121
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:22,079
whatever it is a lot of people don't

3122
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:23,839
care about people's character at all

3123
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:26,519
they continue to just hang out with

3124
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:28,159
people who have the most [ __ ] and

3125
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,960
they're like oh those people are cool

3126

3128
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:36,439
lot of [ __ ] for me and so a lot of

3129
02:09:34,279 --> 02:09:39,399
people that's like unfortunately that's

3130
02:09:36,439 --> 02:09:40,678
a crowd mentality and with weed there's

3131
02:09:39,399 --> 02:09:43,719
always going to be this thing where

3132
02:09:40,679 --> 02:09:46,880
people look at it real quick they go oh

3133

3135
02:09:49,559 --> 02:09:53,960

3138
02:09:56,800 --> 02:10:01,000
it is got tiny little flowers and I

3139
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:03,039
can't really see the resin but then you

3140
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,760
like roll it up and you're like that's

3141
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:08,118
crazy that made like my nose is stuck

3142
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:10,840
with a smell for [ __ ] hour and it's

3143
02:10:08,118 --> 02:10:12,598
am tasting and that's for us you know

3144
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:15,679
you're right in that sense dude is that

3145
02:10:12,599 --> 02:10:17,078
like if you could take a sack of I don't

3146
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:18,399
know you know animal cookies or

3147
02:10:17,078 --> 02:10:20,439
permanent marker or something that's

3148
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:22,759
really attractive and you could like

3149
02:10:20,439 --> 02:10:25,078
throw that into a jar and time travel

3150
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:27,800
back to 19-year-old you and show that to

3151
02:10:25,078 --> 02:10:29,519
you in the '90s that was so much

3152
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:32,320
prettier looking than most of the weed

3153
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:34,440
you had access to you would imagine it

3154
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:36,719
had to be as good as it looked it you

3155
02:10:34,439 --> 02:10:38,519
would just be blown away well in some of

3156
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:40,158
the weed back then what's crazy is some

3157
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:42,000
of the weed back then it just kind of

3158
02:10:40,158 --> 02:10:44,638
looked the same like I had this [ __ ]

3159
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,960
called big blue and it's still to this

3160
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:50,400
day like if I'll I'll show you too like

3161
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:52,198
when I after I reveg and and regrow

3162
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,000
these Hindu s

3163
02:10:52,198 --> 02:10:56,638
you'll be like there's cookies there's

3164
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,960
gelato there's all the stuff that

3165
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:01,719
everybody thinks are these modern looks

3166
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,760
you're like no it was all in the old

3167
02:11:01,719 --> 02:11:06,480
Jean Pool from back in the day I think a

3168
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,920
lot of it popped out from these

3169
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:11,319
ancestral things that you and me had

3170
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:14,480
from back in the day like the effects it

3171
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:17,840
had more bag appe peel than

3172
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:19,759
cookies unbelievable holy [ __ ] it looked

3173
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:22,199
like you rolled it in Sugar yeah it's

3174
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:23,880
insane like the northern my mom had

3175
02:11:22,198 --> 02:11:25,558
you're like that was cookies doesn't

3176
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:29,000
even look like it has any resin compared

3177
02:11:25,559 --> 02:11:32,239
to that [ __ ] it was wild stuff but um

3178
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:34,359
yeah it's it's it's just uh I don't know

3179
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:37,839
it's a crazy it's a crazy thing but I

3180
02:11:34,359 --> 02:11:39,279
think that in a lot of cases when

3181
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:41,760
marketing

3182
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:43,078
happens you know you're marketing I

3183
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,520
don't want to say it but you're kind of

3184
02:11:43,078 --> 02:11:49,319
marketing to shallow people bro like

3185
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:51,760
it's kind of like you're marketing to

3186
02:11:49,319 --> 02:11:54,558
shallow people I [ __ ] hate to say it

3187
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:57,360
but like you know who wears the [ __ ]

3188
02:11:54,559 --> 02:11:59,840
who wears the [ __ ] you know I don't

3189
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:01,920
want to like make anybody feel like

3190
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:03,599
stupid but like some of these name brand

3191
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:05,158
things that cost a lot of [ __ ] money

3192
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:07,480
and they have the brand written all over

3193
02:12:05,158 --> 02:12:09,279
them I don't want to like blow anybody's

3194
02:12:07,479 --> 02:12:11,000
trip but the rich people don't wear that

3195
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:13,840
[ __ ] they buy the one where you can't

3196
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:16,039
see the brand there's subtlety there's

3197
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,119
Nuance you're buying it because of the

3198
02:12:16,039 --> 02:12:19,960
way the shit's sewn you're buying it

3199
02:12:18,118 --> 02:12:21,479
because of the material it's made out of

3200
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:23,840
you're buying it because it's got some

3201
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:25,799
reference to this or it's in this color

3202
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:28,000
that means something to a certain people

3203
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:32,559
a group of people that you don't [ __ ]

3204
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:34,760
know about because not really one thing

3205
02:12:32,559 --> 02:12:38,079
one thing I should say too is because

3206
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:40,760
things are so controlled

3207
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:43,039
now and this is basically about like

3208
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:46,559
what what would come after purple candy

3209
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:49,359
gas or the age of candy is over is that

3210
02:12:46,559 --> 02:12:51,760
like what's in stores is what people are

3211
02:12:49,359 --> 02:12:54,279
growing is what the nurse

3212
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:55,840
make available as clones or whatever not

3213
02:12:54,279 --> 02:12:58,319
that there aren't some Farms that have

3214
02:12:55,840 --> 02:13:00,679
their own stuff but it's like it's not

3215
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:04,238
that easy for like an organic shift to

3216
02:13:00,679 --> 02:13:08,039
just happen right there's like like

3217
02:13:04,238 --> 02:13:10,039
layers now like most Farms buy their

3218
02:13:08,039 --> 02:13:12,719
plants from a nursery which means that

3219
02:13:10,039 --> 02:13:16,399
Nursery has to choose to Mom up those

3220
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:17,880
plants to sell clones off of and they're

3221
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:19,519
going to try to pick what they think is

3222
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:22,199
the most popular thing that they're

3223
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,360
going to sell a lot of clones of for

3224
02:13:22,198 --> 02:13:25,919
that era that they're going to be

3225
02:13:23,359 --> 02:13:29,399
offering it maybe they switch up they

3226
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:31,920
like six to 12 things they offer like

3227
02:13:29,399 --> 02:13:33,198
three four times a year you know they've

3228
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,880
probably got a bunch of moms that're

3229
02:13:33,198 --> 02:13:36,638
ramping up and a bunch of moms that're

3230
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,920
ramping down and then moms that are in

3231
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:43,279
their Prime and they switch it a little

3232
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:45,399
bit you know but it's not going to be

3233
02:13:43,279 --> 02:13:48,158
like I'm I think that the way that we

3234
02:13:45,399 --> 02:13:49,759
used to get popular has broken down and

3235
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:52,319
there's going to be some kind of new

3236
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:54,639
paradigm and people are going to need to

3237
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:56,118
sell what the work is and the work I

3238
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:59,078
think part of the reason why purple

3239
02:13:56,118 --> 02:14:00,639
candy gas has lasted so long is that's

3240
02:13:59,078 --> 02:14:02,399
what the Brokers and that's what the

3241
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:05,520
hustlers and that's what everyone has to

3242
02:14:02,399 --> 02:14:09,039
make hash with and that's what's out

3243
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:11,119
there like that's the flow that's what's

3244
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:13,479
there in large amounts so it's like in

3245
02:14:11,118 --> 02:14:15,920
order for the market to change you're

3246
02:14:13,479 --> 02:14:18,039
going to have to get some amount of of

3247
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:20,399
new herb that people want that's getting

3248
02:14:18,039 --> 02:14:22,639
made into flour and hash and joints and

3249
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:24,879
Edibles and this and that and that's a

3250
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:28,279
slower

3251
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:29,639
process yeah like I'll give like like

3252
02:14:28,279 --> 02:14:31,198
maybe I'll say this and I'm sorry for

3253
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:33,760
ranting on it but like going to your

3254
02:14:31,198 --> 02:14:36,039
local grocery store they usually only

3255
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:38,840
have two or three kinds of whatever

3256
02:14:36,039 --> 02:14:40,920
veggie it is they got a few kinds of

3257
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:42,800
tomatoes they got you know they got the

3258
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:45,078
dark red beets and maybe they got some

3259
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:47,800
golden ones they got a cuc they got two

3260
02:14:45,078 --> 02:14:50,519
kinds of cucumbers they got like you

3261
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:52,360
know like as weed becomes more legal

3262
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:55,920
producer and stuff are going to want to

3263
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:58,319
just settle on production Classics that

3264
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:01,039
work and so it could kind of get trapped

3265
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:03,279
in time for a bit of like you have to

3266
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:05,279
convince producers to grow something

3267
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:07,439
different and they're like well I've

3268
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:09,198
already got all my nutrition dialed in I

3269
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:11,078
already know how much EC to give I know

3270
02:15:09,198 --> 02:15:14,198
when to flush I know when to this I've

3271
02:15:11,078 --> 02:15:16,439
got it dialed I'm getting 3.4 pounds of

3272
02:15:14,198 --> 02:15:19,678
light with my LED bro I don't want to

3273
02:15:16,439 --> 02:15:21,399
mess with some new new why switch and so

3274
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:26,399
you could have a situation where weed

3275
02:15:21,399 --> 02:15:28,759
sort of calcifies a bit in the center

3276
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:31,598
because the people growing it and

3277
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:32,400
selling it and hyping it like don't want

3278
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:34,360
to

3279
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:35,879
change and they don't even know what to

3280
02:15:34,359 --> 02:15:38,719
change

3281
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:41,520
to yeah and I think that's been kind of

3282
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:44,078
the standard like forever like I mean at

3283
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:48,400
a certain point it was like if you were

3284
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:50,359
growing if you were growing you know

3285
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:53,759
weed in Jamaica you were growing this

3286
02:15:50,359 --> 02:15:57,078
Indian variety if you were growing weed

3287
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:59,239
in Colombia I assume it was whatever

3288
02:15:57,078 --> 02:16:02,078
that first import was and it came over

3289
02:15:59,238 --> 02:16:04,158
and they all had one thing at one point

3290
02:16:02,078 --> 02:16:06,799
if somebody was growing weed it was

3291
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:08,479
probably skunk number one and then at

3292
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:11,239
one point it was probably Northern

3293
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:14,279
Lights and then at one point in some

3294
02:16:11,238 --> 02:16:18,000
places it was probably like sweet tooth

3295
02:16:14,279 --> 02:16:21,198
or yeah you know like like Cindy or

3296
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,198
whatever like I think it basically we're

3297
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:25,439
they're we're constantly in these little

3298
02:16:23,198 --> 02:16:26,879
waves where everything is all the same

3299
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:28,960
and the only reason why there was a

3300
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:31,719
little more variety was because everyone

3301
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:34,519
was isolated and that isolation was

3302
02:16:31,719 --> 02:16:36,558
protecting cultures you know isolation

3303
02:16:34,519 --> 02:16:38,599
protects cultures to an extent and it

3304
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:41,119
evolves cultures to an extent and as

3305
02:16:38,599 --> 02:16:43,079
soon as you got the internet it's like

3306
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:46,000
it it's going to get rid of some of that

3307
02:16:43,079 --> 02:16:48,478
naturally but at the same time there's

3308
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,959
always this the the the the small amount

3309
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:53,199
of people who are more into all the

3310
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:55,518
really weird [ __ ] and I feel like right

3311
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:57,840
now more than at any point in history

3312
02:16:55,519 --> 02:17:00,840
there's probably more people who are

3313
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:03,040
into weird [ __ ] than there ever was

3314
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:04,920
because they're able to look at all of

3315
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,280
history and go oh what was the weird

3316
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:09,040
[ __ ] that you had back then over there

3317
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,760
and someone's like I got the weird [ __ ]

3318
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:12,719
from back then over there and then you

3319
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:14,478
can get it and try it whereas back in

3320
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:16,718
the day if I wanted to try the weird

3321
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:19,358
[ __ ] from back then over there that was

3322
02:17:16,718 --> 02:17:22,358
completely inaccessible all I could get

3323
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:25,760
was the normal [ __ ] from here right now

3324
02:17:22,359 --> 02:17:28,040
or [ __ ] from there right now or the

3325
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:30,960
normal [ __ ] from over there back then

3326
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:32,679
but none of the like the weird little

3327
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:34,358
that it it's trippy you know like I feel

3328
02:17:32,679 --> 02:17:37,398
like right now is actually really good

3329
02:17:34,359 --> 02:17:42,079
and I don't think that you're ever gonna

3330
02:17:37,398 --> 02:17:45,398
see a time when it completely comes

3331
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:47,478
undone like I don't think like classical

3332
02:17:45,398 --> 02:17:49,279
music is going to make a huge [ __ ]

3333
02:17:47,478 --> 02:17:51,119
comeback but I think there's probably

3334
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:53,840
more people listening to it right right

3335
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,599
now than there has been a lot in the

3336
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:58,960
past because of the internet I don't

3337
02:17:55,599 --> 02:18:01,079
think access is going to make all the

3338
02:17:58,959 --> 02:18:03,799
sudden hey guess what [ __ ] the number

3339
02:18:01,079 --> 02:18:06,959
one album once again is like when it was

3340
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:08,759
[ __ ] Miles Davis or whatever but

3341
02:18:06,959 --> 02:18:10,638
there's a lot of people who know what

3342
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:12,200
that is and they're into it but I don't

3343
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,358
think it's ever coming back and if you

3344
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:15,719
want to bring back classical Hip Hop's

3345
02:18:14,359 --> 02:18:17,920
going to have to sample it if you want

3346
02:18:15,718 --> 02:18:20,199
to bring back Jazz Hip Hop's got to

3347
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:22,840
sample it and if you want to like make

3348
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:24,719
like Haze popular you might have to toss

3349
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:26,478
some color on it or you might have to

3350
02:18:24,718 --> 02:18:29,598
make it pretty to make something that's

3351
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:30,879
a huge thing that starts a huge wave but

3352
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:32,280
in the meantime you're still going to

3353
02:18:30,879 --> 02:18:34,279
have the people who are listening to

3354
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:36,159
Jazz and listening to classical and

3355
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:39,000
there's still more of them it's just

3356
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:41,519
that you're so overwhelmed by all the

3357
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,040
basic [ __ ] that it's like you're like

3358
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:45,719
safe to flip and I don't I don't know

3359
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:47,359
that it ever will I this might be in

3360
02:18:45,718 --> 02:18:50,119
aide or whatever but I should tell a

3361
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:52,639
funny story like 20 20 plus years ago

3362
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:54,599
maybe 22 years ago I used to go to these

3363
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:56,638
Harvest festivals these little private

3364
02:18:54,599 --> 02:19:00,558
parties right and it's actually the

3365
02:18:56,638 --> 02:19:04,119
first place that I met CSI or sha like

3366
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:06,000
707 you know or like chip from Royal

3367
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:07,920
gold you know or whatever like that does

3368
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,359
the real dirt like bunch of people bunch

3369
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:11,439
of people from like overgrow and

3370
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:13,840
cannabis world and all that and I

3371
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:15,719
remember getting invited to this thing

3372
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:17,558
and it was like a who's who of

3373
02:19:15,718 --> 02:19:19,598
underground people and I was like oh my

3374
02:19:17,558 --> 02:19:21,599
God I'm like in my early 20s or whatever

3375
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:23,639
mid 20s I'm like I'm going to meet all

3376
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:26,558
the old schoolers that have all the real

3377
02:19:23,638 --> 02:19:29,679
[ __ ] that I'm hunting for and I went

3378
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:31,759
there and it was like everything popular

3379
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:33,439
at the time that you could imagine

3380
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,880
everything was cross the White Widow

3381
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:36,679
everything was cross the blueberry

3382
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:38,718
everything was cross the Sweet Tooth and

3383
02:19:36,679 --> 02:19:41,359
Blockhead and Louie like you know

3384
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:44,279
breeder Steve was big and like DJ Short

3385
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:46,000
and like the first Brothers grim and so

3386
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:48,200
I think in a way that's always sort of

3387
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,439
happened is like people take popular

3388
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:52,439
stuff that other people are into and

3389
02:19:50,439 --> 02:19:55,000
start Crossing it into

3390
02:19:52,439 --> 02:19:57,960
everything and it seems overwhelming at

3391
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,359
the time you know H you know for a

3392
02:19:57,959 --> 02:20:02,159
minute and I think I think the the

3393
02:20:00,359 --> 02:20:04,079
purple gas stuff has sort of been locked

3394
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:06,439
in a time capsule for a second because

3395
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:09,920
it's just been there as all the changes

3396
02:20:06,439 --> 02:20:12,079
have been happening um but you know

3397
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:14,200
there's a lot of weed that's not that

3398
02:20:12,079 --> 02:20:16,200
that I would imagine will become popular

3399
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:19,479
simply because it's like you get to

3400
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:22,200
reintroduce old hits to new

3401
02:20:19,478 --> 02:20:23,799
people and that weed is nice and so I

3402
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:25,720
don't know how long it'll take for like

3403
02:20:23,799 --> 02:20:29,478
diversity to develop in these various

3404
02:20:25,719 --> 02:20:32,000
markets but as as markets develop like

3405
02:20:29,478 --> 02:20:33,799
and get more mature there's people that

3406
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,920
are going to want to try the famous

3407
02:20:33,799 --> 02:20:38,559
strains of old or different takes on

3408
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:40,520
this or that weed nerds you know that

3409
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:42,359
want something just off the beaten path

3410
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:44,520
a little bit and then those things will

3411
02:20:42,359 --> 02:20:46,079
get their fandom but I don't know how

3412
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:49,800
quick it's going to occur because the

3413
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:51,159
market is pretty um you know I don't

3414
02:20:49,799 --> 02:20:52,840
want to say it's collapsing under its

3415
02:20:51,159 --> 02:20:55,318
own weight but it's it's pretty

3416
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:56,799
unbalanced at the moment you know

3417
02:20:55,318 --> 02:20:58,879
there's not a lot of freedom there's not

3418
02:20:56,799 --> 02:21:01,759
a lot of freedom of expression there's

3419
02:20:58,879 --> 02:21:05,239
way more people just trying to hold on

3420
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:07,159
than feeling like frisky and wanting to

3421
02:21:05,239 --> 02:21:10,398
experiment with what the market may or

3422
02:21:07,159 --> 02:21:13,840
may not be interested in yeah I'm

3423
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:18,000
curious heavy in where you're at is that

3424
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:21,478
a thing that has happened where it's

3425
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:26,239
completely leaned towards one kind of

3426
02:21:21,478 --> 02:21:28,959
grouping or has uh interesting variation

3427
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:31,959
and kind of more old school things have

3428
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:34,358
they kind of kept kept the ground and

3429
02:21:31,959 --> 02:21:36,759
maintained like a big space in in the

3430
02:21:34,359 --> 02:21:39,920
market

3431
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:42,040
there yeah I think the old school unique

3432
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:43,879
sort of plants are certainly dying like

3433
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:46,000
they only really exist in the outdoor

3434
02:21:43,879 --> 02:21:49,039
landscape not not in the indoor like the

3435
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:51,920
indoor space is all dominated by younger

3436
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:54,880
Generations plugged into Instagram

3437
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:58,359
running all the latest rs11

3438
02:21:54,879 --> 02:22:00,799
hybrids um and generally speaking the

3439
02:21:58,359 --> 02:22:03,680
culture mimics the USA culture with like

3440
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:05,159
a certain time delay uh so things that

3441
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,800
are popular there maybe popular here

3442
02:22:05,159 --> 02:22:08,439
like a year later or so like once it

3443
02:22:06,799 --> 02:22:10,239
becomes available as like an S1 or

3444
02:22:08,439 --> 02:22:13,280
something but in terms of the old school

3445
02:22:10,239 --> 02:22:15,840
stuff there are these outdoor guys who

3446
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:18,880
do big numbers with the you know like

3447
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:23,478
old mother sativa or um heirloom

3448
02:22:18,879 --> 02:22:26,079
climatized tie type type stuff and they

3449
02:22:23,478 --> 02:22:28,719
still do that because you know you can't

3450
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:31,840
deny the yield it's just it performs

3451
02:22:28,719 --> 02:22:34,920
dude but it's

3452
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:36,719
dwindling I if old mother sativa exists

3453
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:39,359
over there still that would be lovely I

3454
02:22:36,719 --> 02:22:42,679
had an old friend who's passed on now

3455
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:45,640
from meno that had some of that and he

3456
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:48,520
had the biggest plants I have ever seen

3457
02:22:45,639 --> 02:22:51,680
and it was just like top to bottom giant

3458
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:53,640
colas all over itself it had a it was

3459
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:56,200
obviously heavily sativa but it had

3460
02:22:53,639 --> 02:22:58,799
enough indicia in it that it threw it it

3461
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:01,880
like literally was like a 12 foot round

3462
02:22:58,799 --> 02:23:04,478
ball that threw bats all over itself it

3463
02:23:01,879 --> 02:23:06,159
was so I might even have a picture of it

3464
02:23:04,478 --> 02:23:07,719
I could send you if I look deep enough

3465
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:10,079
it it was

3466
02:23:07,719 --> 02:23:11,760
incredible um and he just said it was

3467
02:23:10,079 --> 02:23:13,719
old mother sativa and he said it was

3468
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:15,159
from Australia so if that stuff exists

3469
02:23:13,719 --> 02:23:17,438
that would be pretty

3470
02:23:15,159 --> 02:23:20,478
cool I can't even remember how good it

3471
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:23,800
was I just remember how giant how

3472
02:23:20,478 --> 02:23:28,079
unbelievably giant it

3473
02:23:23,799 --> 02:23:30,719
was yeah it's it's nice sort of uh

3474
02:23:28,079 --> 02:23:33,920
moderately uplifting sativa sort of

3475
02:23:30,719 --> 02:23:36,119
stuff I've yet to have stuff that's like

3476
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:38,359
profoundly psychedelic in the way like

3477
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:40,720
maybe some of the ties that you see with

3478
02:23:38,359 --> 02:23:43,359
Coastal or bod like they can really tap

3479
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:45,639
into that but and and also old mother

3480
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:48,559
sativa is a term it's such a broad term

3481
02:23:45,639 --> 02:23:50,478
you know like it's just like it's it's

3482
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:52,680
more or less just a term for saying like

3483
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:55,079
this is like some sort of a climatized

3484
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:57,760
heirloom tie that's clearly been grown

3485
02:23:55,079 --> 02:24:02,359
Outdoors for who knows how many

3486
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:04,239
generations but uh yeah it's it is still

3487
02:24:02,359 --> 02:24:05,640
around it's probably you know in reality

3488
02:24:04,239 --> 02:24:08,279
it's probably getting harder to find

3489
02:24:05,639 --> 02:24:10,239
because the people who used to buy that

3490
02:24:08,279 --> 02:24:11,840
sort of stuff usually bought it because

3491
02:24:10,239 --> 02:24:13,920
they didn't know where to get better

3492
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:16,318
stuff from all they could get was this

3493
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,040
sort of outdoory stuff that was

3494
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:22,119
generally considered second rate

3495
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:24,840
compared to Indica stuff and then when

3496
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:26,640
medicalization rolled in those were all

3497
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:28,359
the first people who got their cards

3498
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:30,159
because they had the most to gain they

3499
02:24:28,359 --> 02:24:32,359
like in terms of the quality jump they

3500
02:24:30,159 --> 02:24:33,879
had the most to gain by getting on even

3501
02:24:32,359 --> 02:24:36,200
though it's you know the stuff we laugh

3502
02:24:33,879 --> 02:24:39,000
at the the Canadian

3503
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:41,079
radiated imported herb that's not

3504
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,680
considered that great it was still

3505
02:24:41,079 --> 02:24:47,279
significantly better in their eyes so

3506
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:48,520
I've actually heard from uh a few of

3507
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:49,960
well I've seen it myself there's a lot

3508
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:52,279
of grow stores in Australia that are

3509
02:24:49,959 --> 02:24:54,599
shutting down because a lot of the guys

3510
02:24:52,279 --> 02:24:57,040
who used to grow stuff Outdoors that was

3511
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:59,159
bit more bulk bit less quality maybe

3512
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:02,040
using some of these old climatized trins

3513
02:24:59,159 --> 02:25:03,840
that really did produce volume uh that

3514
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:06,120
there's just the market has evaporated

3515
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:08,680
for that and the medical Market has just

3516
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:08,680
swalled

3517
02:25:09,398 --> 02:25:14,680
it that's the way of the world like I

3518
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:18,399
was saying before Morocco is mostly like

3519
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:21,920
Super Lemon Haze and you know and

3520
02:25:18,398 --> 02:25:23,959
critical mass and you know big you know

3521
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:25,719
them bringing over kilos of that kind of

3522
02:25:23,959 --> 02:25:27,358
seed and having them grow whole fields

3523
02:25:25,719 --> 02:25:29,478
of it and the farmers are happy because

3524
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:31,479
they're going to buy it all and hash it

3525
02:25:29,478 --> 02:25:34,318
it's Spain's right there yeah they grow

3526
02:25:31,478 --> 02:25:36,278
what's in Spain and the right there give

3527
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:38,278
us the stuff that we you know like

3528
02:25:36,279 --> 02:25:39,760
here's the seeds we'll make take a whole

3529
02:25:38,279 --> 02:25:41,960
room they make tons of seeds and they

3530
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:43,880
give it to them and then they hash back

3531
02:25:41,959 --> 02:25:45,478
you know I actually have thought and

3532
02:25:43,879 --> 02:25:47,959
this might be kind of controversial or

3533
02:25:45,478 --> 02:25:50,278
weird but like the fact that like

3534
02:25:47,959 --> 02:25:53,239
America went to war with Afghan and and

3535
02:25:50,279 --> 02:25:55,760
Afghanistan for 20 years might have done

3536
02:25:53,239 --> 02:25:58,760
more to protect like Afghan

3537
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:01,318
Afghanistan's like traditional indicas

3538
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:03,639
from being flooded with anything because

3539
02:26:01,318 --> 02:26:05,559
it just wasn't safe for people to like

3540
02:26:03,639 --> 02:26:07,519
go there and travel around very much

3541
02:26:05,559 --> 02:26:08,680
unless you were in the military and then

3542
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:10,040
there was a bunch of resentment and you

3543
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:12,439
didn't want to get your head cut off or

3544
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:13,880
be in some kind of Taliban video but

3545
02:26:12,439 --> 02:26:17,040
like you know arjent and stuff they

3546
02:26:13,879 --> 02:26:19,318
weren't doing any like any like you know

3547
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,479
uh safaris or whatever into like the

3548
02:26:19,318 --> 02:26:24,600
Hindu Kush mountains to like meet people

3549
02:26:21,478 --> 02:26:27,119
for Strain Hunters because it was too

3550
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:29,120
dangerous so it kind of kept those

3551
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:32,200
Farmers

3552
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:34,760
isolated like they were exporting things

3553
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:36,640
but not really importing if that makes

3554
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:39,680
sense they weren't being influenced by

3555
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:42,879
the larger Globes change in Canada over

3556
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:45,520
the last 20 years because it was a war

3557
02:26:42,879 --> 02:26:47,719
zone and it was dangerous and it was it

3558
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:50,800
was you know I that could change in the

3559
02:26:47,719 --> 02:26:52,719
future but I almost think that like the

3560
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:54,438
Talib the combination of like the war

3561
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:55,599
and the Taliban has probably like

3562
02:26:54,439 --> 02:26:58,479
isolated

3563
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:59,640
them well the taliban's a huge problem

3564
02:26:58,478 --> 02:27:02,039
because they're really good at

3565
02:26:59,639 --> 02:27:05,039
eradicating everything over there right

3566
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:08,000
now and so it's pushed things into the

3567
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:10,680
real extremes um yeah the mountains and

3568
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,439
the higher up Pakistani border

3569
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:15,318
Wilderness regions but it's cool because

3570
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:16,840
like I was told for years and years like

3571
02:27:15,318 --> 02:27:18,879
yeah there's nowhere in the world where

3572
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:21,680
they still have the old things they had

3573
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:23,079
it's all been watered down and all this

3574
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:24,880
different stuff and then like when I

3575
02:27:23,079 --> 02:27:27,359
finally T started talking to people on

3576
02:27:24,879 --> 02:27:28,920
the internet who were like up there in

3577
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,640
those mountains I was like yeah what's

3578
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:33,000
the weed smell like what's it look like

3579
02:27:30,639 --> 02:27:34,840
and they're like oh it's you know it's

3580
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:38,840
like there's ones they smell like like

3581
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:42,040
earthy kind of accurd coffee dead neat

3582
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:43,559
weird kind of stuff you know and like

3583
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:45,600
describing them all and I'm like that

3584
02:27:43,559 --> 02:27:47,079
sounds like all the really old Afghani

3585
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:49,880
that I would consider to be like what's

3586
02:27:47,079 --> 02:27:52,520
the definition of The Afghani stuff that

3587
02:27:49,879 --> 02:27:54,559
I that I knew had been kept pure here

3588
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:57,000
and then you start to see the pictures

3589
02:27:54,559 --> 02:27:58,959
and everything and you're like oh this

3590
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:01,840
is and then you see the areas and you

3591
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,719
see the people and you see like a

3592
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:05,279
marketplace with all the people and you

3593
02:28:03,719 --> 02:28:07,199
go this is not a place where there's

3594
02:28:05,279 --> 02:28:09,239
just a whole bunch of Outsiders

3595
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,680
polluting everything nobody's they're

3596
02:28:09,239 --> 02:28:12,318
not going to try to and then you see the

3597
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:14,600
way they grow that was a big thing that

3598
02:28:12,318 --> 02:28:16,278
I picked up in Jamaica was that when

3599
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:17,840
they took all the things to grow in my

3600
02:28:16,279 --> 02:28:19,960
buddy's neighborhood in Jamaica they

3601
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:22,318
planted them and they all died because

3602
02:28:19,959 --> 02:28:23,959
they rely on the rainfall and the cycles

3603
02:28:22,318 --> 02:28:26,119
of the seasons and if the weed ain't

3604
02:28:23,959 --> 02:28:28,239
from there and it hasn't been there or

3605
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:31,279
it's not from a similar climate it just

3606
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:34,559
all [ __ ] dies so you can't really

3607
02:28:31,279 --> 02:28:36,840
take this Amsterdam hybrid [ __ ] and

3608
02:28:34,559 --> 02:28:38,760
throw it out by the Handful in

3609
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:41,559
Afghanistan and leave it in the desert

3610
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:43,920
with two rains a year and expect it to

3611
02:28:41,559 --> 02:28:46,199
survive it needs to have big fat fan

3612
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:48,639
leaves and thick stems to draw water

3613
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:50,720
from when it dries out and all this

3614
02:28:48,639 --> 02:28:52,119
different [ __ ] you know and you realize

3615
02:28:50,719 --> 02:28:54,000
when you look at the fields you're like

3616
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:55,399
they look pretty they look pretty

3617
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,079
similar to when you look at the old

3618
02:28:55,398 --> 02:29:00,358
picture of like Schultz or whoever over

3619
02:28:58,079 --> 02:29:02,559
there in like plants of the Gods and you

3620
02:29:00,359 --> 02:29:05,720
see those little afghanis are like looks

3621
02:29:02,559 --> 02:29:07,478
like monkey balls looks like big blue

3622
02:29:05,719 --> 02:29:10,840
looks like the same [ __ ] that they have

3623
02:29:07,478 --> 02:29:12,358
now when you see like uh deot going over

3624
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:15,559
there and bringing back you know like

3625
02:29:12,359 --> 02:29:18,279
this this book back here it's Afghan

3626
02:29:15,559 --> 02:29:20,159
project it's like it it kind of looks

3627
02:29:18,279 --> 02:29:22,680
the same as it's ever looked and I was

3628
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:24,520
super excited because it might be one of

3629
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:28,120
the only places left that's like that

3630
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:30,880
because one of the few Jamaica Morocco

3631
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:33,560
Mexico Colombia Thailand all these

3632
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:35,079
different places like they don't have

3633
02:29:33,559 --> 02:29:38,079
they didn't go through the same things

3634
02:29:35,079 --> 02:29:39,639
that isolated them like that region did

3635
02:29:38,079 --> 02:29:41,600
and they don't have what they used to

3636
02:29:39,639 --> 02:29:43,760
have anymore things different different

3637
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:46,279
reasons for different countries but like

3638
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:50,040
a lot of that legendary herb is either

3639
02:29:46,279 --> 02:29:52,439
lost or reduced to such a point like

3640
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:55,359
we'd have to like refind it again yeah

3641
02:29:52,439 --> 02:29:56,960
you know um but Afghanistan and Pakistan

3642
02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:59,200
and those Regions they're just so

3643
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:00,079
dangerous I think they stayed isolated

3644
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:02,920
to

3645
02:30:00,079 --> 02:30:05,079
locals and not as influenced when you

3646
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:06,960
see it's pretty easy to see you're like

3647
02:30:05,079 --> 02:30:08,959
I'm not just GNA go walking in there and

3648
02:30:06,959 --> 02:30:11,398
go act like a big shot people are like

3649
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:13,438
no there's not there's not critical mass

3650
02:30:11,398 --> 02:30:15,920
or super silver haze in the Hindu Kush

3651
02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:18,239
right now doesn't look like it doesn't

3652
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:19,799
look like doesn't look like it no they

3653
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:22,279
might have we might not have access to

3654
02:30:19,799 --> 02:30:23,358
it but like they they I mean I guess

3655
02:30:22,279 --> 02:30:25,399
there's some people on the internet

3656
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:26,920
making access happen but like I mean

3657
02:30:25,398 --> 02:30:29,039
there's people out there there's people

3658
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:30,520
in Pakistan who are growing runs you

3659
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,319
know it is a thing but they're growing

3660
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:35,200
it like indoor they're not field farming

3661
02:30:33,318 --> 02:30:36,760
they in the fields they have to continue

3662
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:39,159
to grow what works in the field you

3663
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:42,200
don't really want to risk you know your

3664
02:30:39,159 --> 02:30:43,639
field on some whatever it is you know

3665
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:45,240
there's no reason to do it because you

3666
02:30:43,639 --> 02:30:48,959
already have the thing that you know is

3667
02:30:45,239 --> 02:30:50,920
going to make a whole lot ofed yeah yeah

3668
02:30:48,959 --> 02:30:53,478
and the variety there just comes from

3669
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:56,639
like you know acclimated might be like

3670
02:30:53,478 --> 02:30:59,119
acclimated to this Valley this mountain

3671
02:30:56,639 --> 02:31:01,039
pass this area and it's not like those

3672
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:03,640
people travel a ton so they're probably

3673
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:06,439
just working essentially like you know

3674
02:31:03,639 --> 02:31:08,639
meene and I joke that like and but this

3675
02:31:06,439 --> 02:31:10,318
is true it's like there'd be Hills and

3676
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:12,840
and Mendo and neighborhoods that would

3677
02:31:10,318 --> 02:31:14,478
all have very similar weed but if you

3678
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:16,279
drove 30 minutes to a different

3679
02:31:14,478 --> 02:31:18,559
neighborhood maybe there was a different

3680
02:31:16,279 --> 02:31:20,680
collector on that road and the the

3681
02:31:18,559 --> 02:31:21,920
neighbors would get seeds from from him

3682
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:22,960
and it would have a little different

3683
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:25,520
kick to it it would be a little

3684
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:28,719
different mix of things and so even when

3685
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:31,439
I first moved here like weed was very

3686
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:33,719
Regional based on road and where you

3687
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:36,040
were in the county and all that it was

3688
02:31:33,719 --> 02:31:38,239
still and I think it's like that in

3689
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:39,960
Afghanistan and Pakistan I think it's

3690
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:42,279
very Regional I think it's very like you

3691
02:31:39,959 --> 02:31:45,759
could go drive for 20 minutes in a

3692
02:31:42,279 --> 02:31:45,760
different Valley and you're like oh

3693
02:31:46,239 --> 02:31:52,239
wow I love it and look I think we could

3694
02:31:49,159 --> 02:31:54,000
probably mute on it forever but given

3695
02:31:52,239 --> 02:31:56,159
how long we've been gone for why don't

3696
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:58,799
we jump into the uh our little final

3697
02:31:56,159 --> 02:32:01,119
segment before we wrap up the heavy

3698
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:02,679
thought for this week I've got an

3699
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:06,160
interesting one I want to give a shout

3700
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:08,559
out I've taken some musings from uh 710

3701
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:11,039
labs they put a post up recently where

3702
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:13,799
they sort of posed a rhetorical question

3703
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:16,120
saying are hash holes

3704
02:32:13,799 --> 02:32:17,478
Overkill it got me thinking you know

3705
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:19,000
like I mean first of all the obvious

3706
02:32:17,478 --> 02:32:20,679
interpretation is you know like is a

3707
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,959
better just to enjoy your flower and

3708
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:24,800
your hash sort of separate on their own

3709
02:32:22,959 --> 02:32:27,959
but I guess you know we exist in this

3710
02:32:24,799 --> 02:32:30,438
culture where hash holes are starting to

3711
02:32:27,959 --> 02:32:32,438
become a more standard phenomena among

3712
02:32:30,439 --> 02:32:36,359
those who consume doinks and we see

3713
02:32:32,439 --> 02:32:38,000
those even ever increasing in size I

3714
02:32:36,359 --> 02:32:39,479
guess it starts to beg the question you

3715
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,680
know are we are we just starting to get

3716
02:32:39,478 --> 02:32:44,398
a bit too hedonistic about all of it is

3717
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:46,760
it a bit indulgent for the sake of

3718
02:32:44,398 --> 02:32:48,920
indulgence is it better to consume them

3719
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:51,040
separately I guess as a little side note

3720
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:54,359
you can also make the argument that it's

3721
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:56,640
sort of easier for sub quality material

3722
02:32:54,359 --> 02:32:59,200
to fly under the radar when you blend

3723
02:32:56,639 --> 02:33:02,079
flour with concentrate so there's almost

3724
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:04,279
a secondary sort of conundrum there but

3725
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:06,600
I'd love to hear your thoughts a hash

3726
02:33:04,279 --> 02:33:06,600
holes

3727
02:33:08,398 --> 02:33:13,398
Overkill

3728
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:15,799
well I I'll say I'm pretty confident

3729
02:33:13,398 --> 02:33:19,398
that you're talking to two primarily

3730
02:33:15,799 --> 02:33:21,358
flower smoking humans uh who dabble a

3731
02:33:19,398 --> 02:33:25,079
bit in hash but it's not your primary

3732
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:27,239
gig I will say that I think that hash

3733
02:33:25,079 --> 02:33:30,039
has become as things have loosened up

3734
02:33:27,239 --> 02:33:33,159
hash has become massive compared to like

3735
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:35,600
sort of a a small corner of weed for at

3736
02:33:33,159 --> 02:33:38,000
least Americans in the past and that's

3737
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:40,439
raised a bunch of people's tolerances

3738
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:43,200
and so there's a lot of weed smokers who

3739
02:33:40,439 --> 02:33:46,120
basically they don't consume flour all

3740
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:47,520
that often they need Hash Hash is like

3741
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,840
what they're used to smoking whether

3742
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:51,479
they're dabbing it whether they're

3743
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:52,880
mixing it or what not um and I think

3744
02:33:51,478 --> 02:33:54,840
fads are going to happen because you

3745
02:33:52,879 --> 02:33:58,839
have all this excess

3746
02:33:54,840 --> 02:34:01,439
hash um and I would say that over the

3747
02:33:58,840 --> 02:34:03,559
last 10 or 15 years as hash has become

3748
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:05,639
really popular I think there's been an

3749
02:34:03,559 --> 02:34:08,959
immense amount of fads that have lasted

3750
02:34:05,639 --> 02:34:11,318
a year or two and change whether for

3751
02:34:08,959 --> 02:34:14,679
their I mean do do you remember back in

3752
02:34:11,318 --> 02:34:16,920
like 09 or 2010 when everybody took dabs

3753
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:17,840
off a cherry glowing like thousand

3754
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:20,318
degree

3755
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:22,040
Banger right like that was just common

3756
02:34:20,318 --> 02:34:24,680
before we realized it was

3757
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:26,920
cartic you know and like the styles of

3758
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:29,239
hash have changed and like how what kind

3759
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:31,559
of color and what kind of this and so I

3760
02:34:29,239 --> 02:34:34,199
do feel you're probably right in that

3761
02:34:31,559 --> 02:34:36,719
low qual lower quality weed and lower

3762
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:39,520
quality hash will blend together to make

3763
02:34:36,719 --> 02:34:44,679
like a product that works so that's a

3764
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:46,920
risk but um in in Europe I would say

3765
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:48,520
when I first started going over there

3766
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:50,239
they always looked at me as nuts as

3767
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:52,880
smoking pure weed

3768
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:54,879
all their weed always had hash in it or

3769
02:34:52,879 --> 02:34:58,799
they would smoke the hash with tobacco

3770
02:34:54,879 --> 02:35:00,559
even more commonly so I think mixing in

3771
02:34:58,799 --> 02:35:02,840
joints you know or various things you

3772
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:05,920
can call it different names but I think

3773
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:08,920
mixing hash and weed or mixing hash and

3774
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:12,920
tobacco um is like a practice that's

3775
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:15,279
been around for a really long time you

3776
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:17,478
know and and certain cultures it's like

3777
02:35:15,279 --> 02:35:17,479
the

3778
02:35:18,120 --> 02:35:26,319
norm yeah I mean definitely as long ago

3779
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:30,680
as 25 years ago we were putting snakes

3780
02:35:26,318 --> 02:35:34,439
of hash in the middle of joints

3781
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:38,079
um it it's cool I mean I don't really

3782
02:35:34,439 --> 02:35:40,680
see anything wrong with it I I

3783
02:35:38,079 --> 02:35:44,398
personally don't want to do it because a

3784
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:48,439
big part of smoking joints is like for

3785
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:51,278
me I really am like trying to like I'm

3786
02:35:48,439 --> 02:35:54,600
trying to learn about the weed because

3787
02:35:51,279 --> 02:35:56,640
that's like my more my job is to know

3788
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:58,479
about the weed so putting hash in it

3789
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:01,278
like not going to really give me any

3790
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:05,398
very clear idea of what the hell's going

3791
02:36:01,279 --> 02:36:07,319
on with the weed um I over the years

3792
02:36:05,398 --> 02:36:11,159
have

3793
02:36:07,318 --> 02:36:15,398
like become less and less excited about

3794
02:36:11,159 --> 02:36:17,879
any type of mixing of anything with weed

3795
02:36:15,398 --> 02:36:20,000
um I did smoke weed with tobacco which

3796
02:36:17,879 --> 02:36:23,039
is hilarious because that's like most

3797
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:25,879
extreme mixing you could possibly get

3798
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:29,520
but tobacco is so harsh and gnarly that

3799
02:36:25,879 --> 02:36:31,959
if weed can cut through it and be still

3800
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:35,840
really killer killer weed it says a lot

3801
02:36:31,959 --> 02:36:38,159
about the weed and any weed that is like

3802
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:40,040
kind of half ass that might trick you in

3803
02:36:38,159 --> 02:36:42,239
a regular joint you go oh that's really

3804
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:45,160
good you mix it with tobacco and it'll

3805
02:36:42,239 --> 02:36:47,318
just be like nope but if you take like

3806
02:36:45,159 --> 02:36:50,359
the very best like if you take anything

3807
02:36:47,318 --> 02:36:55,039
that's really tasty like lemon tree or

3808
02:36:50,359 --> 02:36:56,479
jarro or uh OG cush or diesel or

3809
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:58,120
whatever and you mix it with tobacco

3810
02:36:56,478 --> 02:37:00,119
you'll still be like damn you can really

3811
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:02,120
taste the weed sometimes you can taste

3812
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:04,319
the weed more clearly the character of

3813
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:06,359
it because it's set against this jux

3814
02:37:04,318 --> 02:37:08,840
toos as something really gross along

3815
02:37:06,359 --> 02:37:11,600
with it and it really makes it pop out

3816
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:15,600
you know but um as far as like putting

3817
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:17,439
hash in weed I've just never like I'll

3818
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:20,920
put I'll take like hash bong hits and

3819
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:24,040
put hash on top of weed and we're old I

3820
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:25,719
do the same thing it's really the hash I

3821
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:28,200
don't care the weed's only there to keep

3822
02:37:25,719 --> 02:37:29,959
that make the hash like but it's it's a

3823
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:32,359
it's a carrier it's something to it's

3824
02:37:29,959 --> 02:37:36,799
something for it to light on and melt

3825
02:37:32,359 --> 02:37:39,920
and burn into as you take a b yeah but

3826
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:42,239
basically for me anytime you mix one

3827
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:45,559
thing with the other thing one of the

3828
02:37:42,239 --> 02:37:48,600
things is I'm going to look at it as an

3829
02:37:45,559 --> 02:37:51,039
adulterate like people are like oh moon

3830
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:53,279
rocks you take the weed and you dip it

3831
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:55,319
in the oil and then you roll it in the

3832
02:37:53,279 --> 02:37:57,880
KE and people are like dude if you do

3833
02:37:55,318 --> 02:38:00,159
that with like the very best craziest

3834
02:37:57,879 --> 02:38:04,239
oil ever and then you do it with the

3835
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:06,680
very best craziest full all head sift

3836
02:38:04,239 --> 02:38:08,680
and it's like all super crazy products

3837
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:11,079
when you put them together then they're

3838
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:15,479
like then that then that's good I'm like

3839
02:38:11,079 --> 02:38:18,920
no then that is every every every other

3840
02:38:15,478 --> 02:38:21,278
thing is just in the way it's everything

3841
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:24,040
is an ad ulter it to the other thing I

3842
02:38:21,279 --> 02:38:26,239
don't I don't look at it like oh that's

3843
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:28,200
a great [ __ ] idea I always look at it

3844
02:38:26,239 --> 02:38:30,799
like no I want to I want to see what the

3845
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:34,520
hash is like I want to see what the weed

3846
02:38:30,799 --> 02:38:37,478
is like like I don't I don't you know

3847
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:39,800
get much about each product now if I

3848
02:38:37,478 --> 02:38:41,959
know him really well after a while I

3849
02:38:39,799 --> 02:38:44,438
might go okay [ __ ] it you know let's mix

3850
02:38:41,959 --> 02:38:46,119
this together and see what that does but

3851
02:38:44,439 --> 02:38:48,559
Mo for the most part I want to see what

3852
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:50,200
things are by themselves and that to me

3853
02:38:48,559 --> 02:38:53,559
is like

3854
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:55,640
um that's the best way to do that like

3855
02:38:53,559 --> 02:38:57,478
and I'm funny like that if I drink

3856
02:38:55,639 --> 02:38:59,719
alcohol I don't want you to put the

3857
02:38:57,478 --> 02:39:01,920
alcohol in the [ __ ] juice give me a

3858
02:38:59,719 --> 02:39:04,959
cup of juice and give me a [ __ ] cup

3859
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:08,840
of alcohol and I'll drink the [ __ ]

3860
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:11,239
Whatever It Is by itself and then I'll

3861
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:13,079
sit and I'll drink a cup of juice like I

3862
02:39:11,239 --> 02:39:14,799
don't want the alcohol in the juice and

3863
02:39:13,079 --> 02:39:16,478
I don't want the juice and the alcohol

3864
02:39:14,799 --> 02:39:18,398
like let me drink the alcohol and see

3865
02:39:16,478 --> 02:39:19,760
what that is and then let me drink the

3866
02:39:18,398 --> 02:39:21,439
juice and see what that is it's like you

3867
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,000
put them together you ruin both that's

3868
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:25,239
how I feel about those kind of things

3869
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,398
even sometimes when I'm sitting in the

3870
02:39:25,239 --> 02:39:31,119
kitchen making tacos I'll just sit there

3871
02:39:27,398 --> 02:39:32,840
and I'll like eat the meat and then be

3872
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:34,399
wind up just being like I had the meat I

3873
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:36,398
don't really need the taco because like

3874
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:38,719
the meat was so good I'm like the meat's

3875
02:39:36,398 --> 02:39:40,318
already so good like a a corn tortilla

3876
02:39:38,719 --> 02:39:41,679
is going to make it that much better and

3877
02:39:40,318 --> 02:39:44,039
that's how I feel sometimes about really

3878
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:46,279
good weed like some other hash from some

3879
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:47,760
other thing like if it's both the same

3880
02:39:46,279 --> 02:39:49,840
that could be kind of cool to just have

3881
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:52,200
like a stronger version of

3882
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:53,840
Skittles or a stronger version of diesel

3883
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:56,079
or whatever like that's cool but

3884
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:57,000
generally people like mix them and all I

3885
02:39:56,079 --> 02:39:58,959
don't know it's all just a bunch of

3886
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:00,559
jumbled [ __ ] to me I'm weird like that

3887
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:03,478
you

3888
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:06,559
know I love it look the art of mixing no

3889
02:40:03,478 --> 02:40:09,599
doubt has existed for a very very long

3890
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:11,359
time I uh I think we might leave it at

3891
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:13,800
that one we've we've thoroughly explored

3892
02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:16,200
a number of issues before we sign off

3893
02:40:13,799 --> 02:40:19,920
any final

3894
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:21,800
words uh I don't know I mean you know

3895
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:24,000
back on that one like whatever people

3896
02:40:21,799 --> 02:40:25,920
like to do if you enjoy it that's great

3897
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:28,040
if you like your joint better with hash

3898
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:30,120
upe Mill you better throw some hash in

3899
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:32,640
the middle of it and enjoy that joint if

3900
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:35,479
you like that that's what you like you

3901
02:40:32,639 --> 02:40:37,199
know same with any of it if you like all

3902
02:40:35,478 --> 02:40:38,599
this kind of weed we were talking about

3903
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:40,880
and that's your favorite it's your

3904
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:44,159
favorite you don't have to worry just

3905
02:40:40,879 --> 02:40:45,719
try take you know think about all these

3906
02:40:44,159 --> 02:40:48,039
things thing think if they maybe they

3907
02:40:45,719 --> 02:40:51,199
might make sense and if they don't then

3908
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:53,680
don't bother for sure and I definitely

3909
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,640
want to say as someone who is ardently

3910
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:58,359
against smoking tobacco there is

3911
02:40:55,639 --> 02:41:02,478
undeniably something magical about a

3912
02:40:58,359 --> 02:41:05,159
little snake of hash among some tobacco

3913
02:41:02,478 --> 02:41:09,398
you can't deny it oh God very neat man

3914
02:41:05,159 --> 02:41:11,439
it's very neat y I'll say this uh and

3915
02:41:09,398 --> 02:41:13,920
then we can go when I was a kid and I

3916
02:41:11,439 --> 02:41:15,559
was going to Amsterdam uh to buy seeds

3917
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:17,200
in the mid 90s because that's where I

3918
02:41:15,559 --> 02:41:20,719
knew how to get kind

3919
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:22,880
bud I they they don't smoke weed over

3920
02:41:20,719 --> 02:41:24,840
there they mix it and so if you're in a

3921
02:41:22,879 --> 02:41:26,719
coffee shop in Winter and it's all

3922
02:41:24,840 --> 02:41:28,920
closed up and there's four or five

3923
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:31,840
different groups each smoking a big

3924
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:34,040
spliff with a big hash snake down the

3925
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:36,000
center and a bunch of tobacco and

3926
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:38,439
there's just so much tobacco smoke in

3927
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,639
the air there was times I had to leave

3928
02:41:38,439 --> 02:41:42,880
certain clubs because I was like this is

3929
02:41:40,639 --> 02:41:45,239
the most Smoke Filled tobacco room I

3930
02:41:42,879 --> 02:41:47,039
think I've ever been in and my lungs are

3931
02:41:45,239 --> 02:41:50,318
shutting down and maybe I'm a [ __ ] but

3932
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:52,319
I don't care I can't handle it it's like

3933
02:41:50,318 --> 02:41:55,000
like if you've ever seen a huge spliff

3934
02:41:52,318 --> 02:41:57,199
just being chiefed you know and like all

3935
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:58,439
that hash smoke and all that tobacco

3936
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:00,159
smoke and then you look around there's

3937
02:41:58,439 --> 02:42:02,920
like four or five more of them getting

3938
02:42:00,159 --> 02:42:06,478
PED in different groups it's a bit

3939
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:09,239
overwhelming yeah speaking who sat in

3940
02:42:06,478 --> 02:42:11,959
like my buddy's old Chevy or whatever

3941
02:42:09,239 --> 02:42:14,439
back in the day when we were when we

3942
02:42:11,959 --> 02:42:16,478
were teenagers and rolled up like the

3943
02:42:14,439 --> 02:42:19,880
shake that's the only thing you can get

3944
02:42:16,478 --> 02:42:22,278
and a little resin and rolling joints

3945
02:42:19,879 --> 02:42:24,159
this big around and you know three

3946
02:42:22,279 --> 02:42:26,720
sheeters or whatever and just trying to

3947
02:42:24,159 --> 02:42:29,318
smoke all that in the hot box to try to

3948
02:42:26,719 --> 02:42:31,478
like all right we're somehow off of this

3949
02:42:29,318 --> 02:42:33,840
stuff how are we gonna do it you know

3950
02:42:31,478 --> 02:42:35,398
taking bong hits and try keing it and

3951
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:37,000
trying to put that back in there and

3952
02:42:35,398 --> 02:42:40,478
make it a little stronger and all this

3953
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:42,959
[ __ ] like I don't like to sit in a place

3954
02:42:40,478 --> 02:42:45,438
where people are smoking I don't smoke

3955
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:48,199
inside I'll smoke a joint inside if

3956
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:50,200
we're like like me and you not so can

3957
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:52,560
sit in my living room and smoke a joint

3958
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:56,159
and it's fine that's fine but if there's

3959
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:58,478
like 20 of us somewhere and be outside

3960
02:42:56,159 --> 02:43:00,398
that much something like that yeah I

3961
02:42:58,478 --> 02:43:03,599
need to go outside and it's not even

3962
02:43:00,398 --> 02:43:05,719
it's like literally every like a little

3963
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:08,040
bit of that smoke comes off the joint

3964
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:09,879
most of it came out of somebody's mouth

3965
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:11,600
and when you're sitting in a smoky room

3966
02:43:09,879 --> 02:43:15,358
what you're really looking at is

3967
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:17,318
everybody's breath with smoke it's bad

3968
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:21,159
enough that you're in there with the

3969
02:43:17,318 --> 02:43:23,680
breath man with a bunch of stale ass

3970
02:43:21,159 --> 02:43:26,000
burnt whatever the [ __ ] we're burning

3971
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:28,079
all in there it's just like yeah hash

3972
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:31,120
weed whatever it is especially if it's

3973
02:43:28,079 --> 02:43:34,359
tobacco I'm just like no dude this is

3974
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:36,200
stale this is funky like you know what I

3975
02:43:34,359 --> 02:43:38,840
mean I want to take I want to have my

3976
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:41,760
own joint or whatever it is I want to

3977
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:43,920
probably be outside and I want to sit

3978
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:46,159
there and a lot of times I like to smoke

3979
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:48,600
by myself and kind of meditate about

3980
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:50,879
[ __ ] and think and get some ideas and

3981
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:53,120
some spiration and everything and I

3982
02:43:50,879 --> 02:43:55,000
