not a lot my friend I've been looking

79
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:26,219
forward to this chat but the first

80
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,840
question we ask yes when they come on

81
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,098
the show what have you been smoking on

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
recently

83
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:35,818
uh you know somebody uh sent me some

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,340
some banana runs uh

85
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,018
uh hash and I've been smoking that so

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,000
lately I've been just smoking a lot of

87
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,920
you know solventless hash I just love

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,780
the taste of it so that's really my

89
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,059
go-to

90
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,580
um and yeah yeah the banana runs at

91
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,680
these this uh couple made is really good

92
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,019
so yeah it's kind of almost got like a

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,480
Sprite taste to it with like a banana

94
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,580
hint to it it's pretty awesome so that's

95
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,699
what I've been spoken on nice that

96
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,760
sounds undeniably delicious did you find

97
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,859
that the banana runs tended to produce a

98
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,359
range of flavor profiles or they were

99
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,140
more just sort of one parent or the

100
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
other

101
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,399
yeah you know the crazy thing is and

102
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,699
it's kind of like an inside joke man is

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,798
that when you when you cross runs to

104
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,860
things they almost always come out like

105
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,679
runs dominant especially in the in the

106
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,300
smell category of it like you get some

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,639
red structure and then you'll get the

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,620
runt smell and I I see that like almost

109
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,079
with all wrench crosses so it's like

110
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,060
when I see all these runs crosses I'm

111
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,478
just like dude you could have just got

112
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,399
one pack of anybody's runts cross and it

113
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,659
would have been you know similar to the

114
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,659
runts but

115
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,900
um about 20 of those at least in the

116
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,560
banana runs uh lean towards that

117
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:54,000
banana flavor so you'll get like I don't

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,759
know we've seen some that are just like

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,978
all purple and Frosty and then just

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,180
smell like bananas and that's the ones

121
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,099
that I like I mean there's some green

122
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,478
ones that do that as well

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,439
um and then there's some that just come

124
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:09,599
out super like rincey I would say on the

125
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,339
Run side of the things but yeah you're

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,900
gonna find that range from like that

127
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:17,099
runs dominant

128
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:19,500
kind of Fino all the way to this like

129
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,479
I don't know just like this crop this

130
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,839
just blending of both of them where you

131
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:27,719
get this purple Frosty banana flavored

132
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,418
Fino that's the ones I love

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,820
at about yeah look I mean that sounds

134
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,560
like the winner to me as well right it's

135
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,899
beautiful I guess I was sort of

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,639
interested in asking you we sort of

137
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,038
don't see that many breeders working

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,538
with the banana OG and I've always

139
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,579
wondered why because it's such a good

140
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,459
cut do you have any theories on maybe

141
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:50,819
why it's not as commonly used

142
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,739
uh you know I I really don't know so

143
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,139
I've always been like even if you go

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,879
back to my first line we were when you

145
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,120
know with the black banana I've always

146
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,639
loved that banana Turf like that

147
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,740
um banana candy flavor so that that's

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
one of my favorite flavored candies is

149
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,879
like the banana Laffy Taffy so some

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,400
people either like love this chirp or

151
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,300
they absolutely hate it so

152
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:18,239
and that's in like the food world and in

153
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,160
the pot world so but for me I love it in

154
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
both so

155
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,259
you know that candy fake banana flavor

156
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,198
it's just something I like I don't know

157
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,340
why more people don't work with it but

158
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,680
you know we kind of go through these

159
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,239
phases right like sometimes it's orange

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,819
and it's Tangy and everybody's just

161
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,819
gravitating towards that or sometimes

162
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,439
it's banana and you know people like

163
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,960
like that at a time like I know when

164
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,939
they had that uh it was like a

165
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,138
California Bennett Chiquita banana or

166
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,060
something like that people were loving

167
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,699
it at that point and then it you know

168
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,860
strawberry so we go through phases

169
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,660
yeah ain't that the truth it's all sort

170
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,220
of circular isn't it and you just

171
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,139
reminded me I totally forgot about that

172
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,180
Chiquita banana thing that you were

173
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,519
right it was huge for a minute so that's

174
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,959
some good Insight I guess the other

175
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,579
thing you mentioned was that it was

176
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,620
you're on like the solventless hash

177
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,659
where do you fall on the concentrate

178
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,399
flower sort of divider you more a hash

179
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,539
or more a flower sort of Guy where do

180
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,019
you sit

181
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:19,019
uh for me I like I like Dash like ever

182
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,299
since I I was really got uh turned on

183
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,560
onto it I just I don't know I love it I

184
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,240
smoked a lot of hash when I was a kid

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,519
that wasn't like the hash that we have

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,079
nowadays it was just like much different

187
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,038
but um

188
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,500
yeah I really got into it and then the

189
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,620
whole Don Mega line that we did

190
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,899
um just before this Bahama line my whole

191
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,300
focus of that line was hash like I went

192
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,638
out and bought a goddamn uh freeze dryer

193
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,699
and I turned a whole room into a hash

194
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,038
room and I was like you know what I

195
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,598
don't care what anybody wants me to do I

196
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,699
don't care about runs I don't give a

197
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,800
[ __ ] about anything I want to make a

198
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,598
line

199
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,478
that all washes I don't care if they're

200
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,779
pretty I don't I don't care I want to

201
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,219
show that you can breed functionally you

202
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,739
know you can

203
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,039
breed something to to do something

204
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,620
specific and that's what we did I I

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,719
hunted down plants that I knew washed I

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,199
put it with the dawn which we knew

207
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,780
washed and then I just washed all the

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,680
all the whole tests and smoked a bunch

209
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:28,258
of it and everybody that gets those

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
those seeds from that down line we're

211
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,940
constantly hearing from them about how

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,278
well they wash so it was kind of a fun

213
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,719
thing so yeah I love hash I love the

214
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,080
process of it

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,300
um I'm by no means an expert uh I'm I'm

216
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,520
a newbie at best at making hash

217
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,439
don't worry I'm right there with you but

218
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,299
it's it's cool to hear that like that's

219
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,459
sort of how you intentionally did it and

220
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,719
I was sort of wondering that so you sort

221
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,579
of answered the question so thank you

222
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,620
but I guess the next question it makes

223
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,139
me wonder is do you think eventually

224
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,139
we'll get to a point where for a strain

225
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,240
to be commercially viable it has to wash

226
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,679
well even if it's for flower or do you

227
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,539
think there'll just always be a sort of

228
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,759
divide

229
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,399
I don't know you know honestly at least

230
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,759
here in Seattle I don't see a lot of

231
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,740
guys that their whole company is based

232
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,939
around

233
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,580
washing strains I mean there's a couple

234
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,560
of them I know like no mids up here in

235
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,440
like American hash makers and stuff like

236
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,419
that but I think it's and I don't know

237
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm not an expert on it but I think that

238
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,139
it's just really hard for them to make

239
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,519
the money on it you know in the store

240
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,799
right because

241
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,200
they got a the store has to put on tack

242
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,639
on their money and then the state tax on

243
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,399
their tax

244
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:45,539
and by the time they get done that gram

245
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,759
is so expensive the like casual smoker

246
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,319
doesn't want to pay like 80 bucks for a

247
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,019
gram of hash they just don't want to do

248
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,660
it so I just don't know how commercially

249
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,820
viable it is which honestly to me kind

250
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,559
of keeps it cool because it's like it's

251
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,480
more for the heady the heady guys you

252
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,000
know like the real

253
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,440
the real the guys that are really into

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,259
those terms

255
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,240
um and the and smoking the very best you

256
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,600
might have to get it from your homeboy

257
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,100
and not go to the store

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,480
yeah I get you and that sort of makes

259
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,639
sense it's interesting I've been

260
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,980
wondering about that sort of high and

261
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,179
low end divide but I just want to jump

262
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,620
back to a minute you know you were

263
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,139
talking about the runs and something

264
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,940
that I noticed about that was it seemed

265
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,860
like you hit the market just at that

266
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,420
perfect timing where you know like runs

267
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,759
was really hitting its stride with

268
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,439
consumers and then when you paired it

269
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,299
with say you know all of the other

270
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,000
feminized crosses you made it just made

271
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,559
some phenomenal results my question is

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,299
sort of do you feel like you have to

273
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,919
keep your finger on the pulse a bit with

274
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,139
the Canon community and trying to time

275
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,759
these things perfectly so they go off or

276
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,879
is it just a sort of a case of trying to

277
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,100
be in the right place at the right time

278
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:57,120
um you definitely do you definitely need

279
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,680
to read the crowd right like I don't

280
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,139
know people aren't really into hazes

281
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,479
right now so if you just go try to breed

282
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,240
like a whole line of hazes Because You

283
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,980
Love Haze it might not go over as like

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,740
you want it to

285
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,440
um but at the same time you can't just

286
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,759
breed because the names sound cool like

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,220
there's a lot of breeders out there that

288
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,620
are just like oh I got this cut and it's

289
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,139
this name and I'm gonna throw it

290
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,240
together with this you know these cool

291
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,578
names and here's some seeds for you to

292
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,560
buy that's definitely not how we do

293
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:31,379
things over here

294
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,319
um you know you have like our

295
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,419
I the way we do things is I could bring

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,519
that clone that cut in if somebody's

297
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,199
like if a homie's like oh this is

298
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,740
you know Soul you got to check this out

299
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,860
this is awesome okay I hear you give it

300
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,360
to me let me grow it let me see if I

301
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,339
really feel like it's gonna work in this

302
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,778
lineup it might be awesome and not work

303
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,339
for this lineup and I don't give a [ __ ]

304
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,439
what the name of it is

305
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,940
I could care less if everybody's talking

306
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,140
about it and it's awesome if it's not

307
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
going to work for this light like if it

308
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,559
wouldn't have worked for that that wash

309
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,140
line up even though it has an awesome

310
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,439
name it's out of here you know so you

311
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,419
have to use some of your own judgment on

312
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,660
what you're trying to accomplish in your

313
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:15,958
project and that should Trump the names

314
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:18,059
of of the uh of the strings that you're

315
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,278
trying to put together but

316
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,500
um I think we did you know we we were

317
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,179
one of the first people I think to to do

318
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,820
a wrench cross and I think that banana

319
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,559
wrench really you know caught people's

320
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,360
attention

321
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,699
um and then I know

322
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,159
my homeboy exotic right after I right

323
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,920
after he saw the runts uh the banana

324
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,539
runs he is like he reversed it and did a

325
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,539
whole lineup you know he reversed it and

326
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,159
put it to all of his strains

327
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,199
um for a whole runs lineup and that

328
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,360
thing went crazy people loved it and

329
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,160
then after after those two things after

330
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,860
you saw the banana runs and then Mike's

331
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,379
big runs drop just everybody who was

332
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,919
doing the ranch crosses and now they're

333
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:01,679
just I think people are almost over it

334
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,958
yeah it certainly had a good run the old

335
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,120
runs hasn't it but I guess the follow-up

336
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,399
question for me is given that you're one

337
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,778
for one with your predictions on runs

338
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,120
what do you think is going to be the

339
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,879
next big flavor to hit the scene

340
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,500
I mean you tell me man I have absolutely

341
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,639
hopefully it's the Bahama Mama I don't

342
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,620
know I I have absolutely no idea

343
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,180
um and I'm waiting on it like in our

344
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,240
circles we talk about that kind of stuff

345
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:30,778
right like what's gonna be the next like

346
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,519
big hit like a GMO or like like a runs

347
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:35,399
or you know because we want to catch

348
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,560
that that new one that's tight and get

349
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,778
it in the stable and grow it and see if

350
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,479
the hype is real but you know I don't

351
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:45,059
know Gary Payton seems to be floating

352
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,200
around and and uh We've grown it I think

353
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,039
it's awesome

354
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,079
um

355
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,719
yeah it's just really hard to say which

356
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,759
which way the is gonna go

357
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,820
yeah for sure it's a bit unpredictable

358
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,519
like that isn't it to to loop back a bit

359
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,820
uh we actually did some breeder awards

360
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,519
for the year just gone by and as it

361
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,399
turns out both James bean and myself who

362
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,259
sort of do the awards each year we uh we

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,778
both voted you as the sort of

364
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,819
breakthrough breeder of the year which I

365
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,559
guess not so much about like your first

366
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,060
year obviously but the year where we

367
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,278
feel like from a commercial perspective

368
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,199
things are really sort of taking off so

369
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,240
I guess first of all congrats on that

370
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,278
but the question is sort of did you

371
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,139
expect things to really gain so much

372
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,299
momentum over the past few years and in

373
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,220
the last year have you felt like you've

374
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,958
really sort of had an upswing in terms

375
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,060
of popularity and people growing your

376
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:39,059
work

377
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,338
um well first I mean awesome thanks for

378
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,958
you know recognizing recognizing me I

379
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,760
really appreciate that that's huge you

380
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,899
know like uh the opinions appears as

381
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,819
huge for me uh in the game but um no I

382
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,860
you know

383
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,199
I I don't know I don't really

384
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,940
concentrate on on that on the on the

385
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,719
popular it's really not about me very

386
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,480
much it's or or or anything like it's

387
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,600
just the company you know and and what

388
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,240
what we can do like um I talked to I try

389
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,199
to answer every DM which I probably

390
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,459
shouldn't say that because people are

391
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,879
going to be dming me all their questions

392
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:18,838
like but uh we try to answer every

393
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,578
DM every question and I try to comment

394
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,500
on anybody like if I see somebody that's

395
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:24,838
growing soulfire

396
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,480
um and I'm tagged in that in that

397
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,040
picture I will I will stop by make a

398
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,959
comment on there and I just try to

399
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:35,639
interact with absolutely everybody and

400
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:38,399
we've done that since you know 2015 so

401
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,139
um I think after you it once having that

402
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,179
rapport with people that you actually

403
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,839
give a [ __ ]

404
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,778
um

405
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,880
it's it starts to you know resonate with

406
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,078
them like oh you know so far actually

407
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,240
cares

408
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,159
uh what we're growing in

409
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,680
for me I'm all about the guys that are

410
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,799
in the trenches you know what I mean I'm

411
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,539
making these strains for the guys that

412
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,419
are in the trenches not really the guys

413
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:06,599
that are like in big commercial grows

414
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,159
and warehouses and and you know for the

415
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,259
recreational Market it's cool when they

416
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,939
grow my stuff don't get me wrong I I

417
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,698
like that too but

418
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm really here for the guy that's like

419
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:17,939
growing pot in his garage or growing it

420
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,040
in a tent and blowing out the block and

421
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,540
stinking up the neighborhood that's you

422
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,919
know that's who I'm here for I like to

423
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,240
comment on their pictures I like to see

424
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,819
what they're doing

425
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,039
so yeah I think that it's starting to

426
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,019
build I think they see that like you

427
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,299
know we test our work

428
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,179
um we put a lot of thought into

429
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,399
what we put together

430
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:40,198
and and that that can show in the in the

431
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,899
end result and nobody can guarantee you

432
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,659
like you're never gonna have a Herm or

433
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,578
or nobody can guarantee like you're

434
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,078
gonna have the best results ever no but

435
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,059
if I can

436
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,979
if I can somehow

437
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,319
make you make it make you a little bit

438
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,560
more confident in what you see or and

439
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,000
what you're gonna get or or lower that

440
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,679
chance that you're going to have a Herm

441
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,759
or a problem

442
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,039
um that's what that's what it's all

443
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,199
about or if I can you know help you talk

444
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,659
to you and help you that's what it's all

445
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,400
about and I think that's you know that's

446
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,640
a driving force I think that's helping

447
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,500
build our popularity given a [ __ ] yeah

448
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,199
for sure I think that sort of customer

449
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,119
service really goes a long way and a

450
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,980
testament to the brand image you want to

451
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,139
maintain so while we're on the topic of

452
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,838
customer service let's say you got one

453
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,840
of those sneaky DMS and it's someone who

454
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,178
says you know pretty new to Growing I

455
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,619
like your stuff which one strain would

456
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,059
you recommend and I guess the question

457
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,918
sort of comes down to like without

458
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,720
knowing too much about a person's

459
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,400
interest what strain do you feel you

460
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,600
could really get behind and recommend to

461
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,460
most people

462
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,259
well you know when someone I get that

463
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,298
question all the time so when they when

464
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:49,980
somebody asks me that question I

465
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:51,359
I have to hit him with a barrage of

466
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,099
questions what kind of flavors do you

467
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,719
like how much room are we working with I

468
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:56,699
mean if we're in a you know we're in a

469
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,380
small space Maybe regs aren't what you

470
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,759
want maybe Femmes are what you want what

471
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,320
kind of flavor profiles do we look up

472
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,919
here are we looking for gas are we

473
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,899
looking for fruit you know uh

474
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,460
I I I'll have to ask him a bunch of

475
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,160
different questions before I can kind of

476
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,960
tailor something for them

477
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,580
um to grow and have success with because

478
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,700
ultimately what I want to see is them

479
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,439
have a successful grow and um you know

480
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,759
put their pictures up on Instagram so I

481
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,759
could be like damn you crushed it bro

482
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,160
look at that it looks like some heat so

483
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,599
yeah it's it's a it's a hard question to

484
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,058
answer like a lot of people ask me in

485
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,500
this uh this Bahama line well which is

486
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,259
the best one which all these pictures

487
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,058
look so so dope uh so far which is the

488
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,619
best one well it's hard to say what's

489
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:39,839
the best one because

490
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,519
if you like gas maybe this is the one

491
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,139
for you but if you like fruit maybe this

492
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,940
one or if you're looking for weight that

493
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,160
one might be the one for you so it's

494
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,419
really it's really different you know I

495
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,120
love them all that's why I chose them

496
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,640
for this this lineup

497
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,279
yeah and look totally understandable

498
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,559
right all of the new Bahama Mama lines

499
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,839
are just looking so incredibly Frosty I

500
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,418
I easily put them in the hype train

501
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:06,000
worthy category and that I'm I'm excited

502
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,860
to see them and to see how they do it

503
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,619
makes me wonder what was it about the

504
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,298
Bahama Mama itself that stood out to you

505
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,399
or made you think let's do a line with

506
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,798
this let's blow it up

507
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,298
well when I saw it when I saw the guys

508
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,740
at Rugged Roots growing it and those

509
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,019
guys were amazing Growers over there in

510
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,058
Maine right so when I saw them growing

511
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:28,859
and I was like dude what that thing is

512
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:31,740
black and it has crazy Leaf to flower

513
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,779
ratio right and as we were talking about

514
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,359
earlier I'm not a huge fan of trimming

515
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:39,720
like I got better [ __ ] to do it's one of

516
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:42,178
the least favorite things to do so if we

517
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,000
can get a leaf to Fan Ratio or a leaf to

518
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,940
flower ratio that's favorable

519
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,759
I'm all for that so first I saw the

520
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,740
structure the color the frost

521
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,419
they were nice enough to give it to me

522
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,038
and when I got it I was like okay we're

523
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,480
gonna grow this thing out

524
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,220
you know because

525
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,538
you gotta stick to the plan anything

526
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,058
that comes in it doesn't matter how

527
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:05,038
tight it looked when you were growing it

528
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:10,918
I'm gonna have to grow it assess it

529
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:12,900
smoke it and then decide if it's worthy

530
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,000
um did that and I was just like oh my

531
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,460
God this is [ __ ] amazing look at this

532
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,839
thing it's so Frosty it's you know it

533
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,579
looks like you could literally I'm not

534
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,859
I'm in line dude it looks like you could

535
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,619
go up with a like a little dab tool and

536
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:29,279
just scrape that [ __ ] off and smoke it

537
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:31,439
so yeah so I was just like okay uh this

538
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,660
is awesome I just killed it you know I

539
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,519
just crushed this but let me give it to

540
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,100
like a couple homeboys and let's see

541
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,000
them grow it they grow it hit me up so

542
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,058
far

543
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,798
this [ __ ] is crazy right here boom so

544
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:45,720
now we're kind of have a consensus like

545
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:47,460
all right this thing's awesome

546
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,298
so I think that's

547
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,179
um

548
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:54,359
how it got chose you know I mean we

549
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,940
looked through probably

550
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:59,038
over a thousand different Bahama Mamas

551
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,900
over from the time it was released

552
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,759
because we knew the first time we made

553
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,860
Bahama Mama we're like this thing is

554
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,140
awesome you know this strain is cool

555
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,240
like it

556
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,038
it dumps you know it's great for hash

557
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,980
it's

558
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,359
um beautiful colors but in so many of

559
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,099
them and it's not that it's a bad thing

560
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,139
but because that chopped cookies in

561
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,019
there we're getting that Tangy smell in

562
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,660
a lot of them right so

563
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,759
that's that's great but in what I wanted

564
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,100
to use for this lineup I didn't want

565
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:32,779
that Tangy smell and the rugged cut did

566
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:36,658
not have the Tangy smell it had like a

567
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:40,379
vanilla icing Hawaiian Punch hard candy

568
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:42,900
kind of smell completely devoid of

569
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,120
orange Citrus so and that was another

570
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,798
factor I was just like okay you know now

571
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,158
we got something unique we got the color

572
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,099
we got the structure we got the the leaf

573
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,440
to flower uh ratio that's insane the

574
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,719
weight was great I washed it because you

575
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,940
know when I I was going through my my I

576
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,860
want to wash everything hash phase and

577
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,380
you know even for a noob like me to wash

578
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:06,240
it and they came back like 5.5 or

579
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,340
whatever and that was me just taking the

580
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,620
best of the best too so not like full

581
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:11,699
spec or whatever so yeah it was awesome

582
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:13,678
and

583
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,740
yeah that's I think that's how the

584
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,600
decision came down on that yeah it makes

585
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,339
sense why you picked it I mean if people

586
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,139
haven't seen the photos please get over

587
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,819
to sulfi's Instagram check it out it's a

588
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,100
no-brainer but

589
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:29,099
I sort of hear this sentiment at times

590
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:31,139
that a lot of the Cannabis community in

591
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,178
terms of like The Connoisseur cannabis

592
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,640
Community they complain about you know

593
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,679
being burnt out on that Tangy turp in

594
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,480
general but then I also realized that

595
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,280
there's this huge part of the market

596
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,500
especially the more sort of casual

597
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,538
smokers who definitely don't share this

598
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,919
opinion and it makes me wonder do you

599
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,900
think it's better to cater to the

600
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,700
greatest number of customers or do you

601
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,080
feel like you have some obligation to

602
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,080
sort of the hardcore heads

603
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,658
um

604
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,538
well for me I mean again this is kind of

605
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,780
like a personal thing I love the Tangy

606
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:06,000
don't do not get it misconstrued you'll

607
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,700
see a lot of our crosses have that that

608
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,640
drop in it because I love that I love

609
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,798
smoking it I love the extracts that it

610
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,538
makes I love it

611
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,339
um I just didn't want it for this

612
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,038
because I feel like there's already that

613
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,619
in the market you know what I mean like

614
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:26,099
you can go get that from Trump if you

615
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:28,319
want it right like it's out there so I

616
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,418
wanted to do something different and

617
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,058
yeah that's and the only way I could do

618
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,740
it is if it wasn't present and it took a

619
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:38,700
long time to find something that is

620
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,919
present but do I feel like loyalty to

621
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,100
um any one group when I'm doing my

622
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:47,820
breeding now I'm

623
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:50,459
casual or hardcore heady guys no I'm

624
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,558
just trying to make the very best that I

625
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,360
possibly can make and

626
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,220
and you know

627
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,158
bring it to the market at a price point

628
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,460
that anybody can

629
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,980
afford to grow us you know back to that

630
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,779
like I love the guys in the tents I love

631
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,179
the home the home grower that's breaking

632
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:11,819
it off in their backyard in in their

633
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,620
garage or or just out in the sun

634
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:16,500
um and

635
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:19,199
yeah so I just try to keep it

636
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,538
keep it accessible for everybody I guess

637
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,279
yeah I think there's huge value in that

638
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:25,619
and I you know obviously being in

639
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,658
Australia I'm one of those people who's

640
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,279
like not burnt out on Tropicana cookies

641
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,679
at all so I'm totally in the same boat

642
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,500
as you love it I think it's amazing I

643
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,720
guess it makes me wonder then how would

644
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,298
you describe the uh the rugged mountain

645
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,860
cut itself is it very drop heavy leaning

646
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:43,619
or does it bring some other sorts of

647
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:46,139
flavors and turps to the table

648
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:50,279
so it the

649
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,380
how to explain it is it grows similar

650
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,759
kind of to Trop but I feel like it's

651
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,700
heavier

652
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,798
um and it's just jet black and it comes

653
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,220
on kind of late so like when I was

654
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,960
growing I was like I don't know man you

655
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,900
know like I don't think this is going to

656
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,120
be very heavy and I don't I don't know

657
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,919
if it's going to be very colorful and

658
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,158
then we're like pulling into like week

659
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,820
five and boom the color show starts it

660
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,880
starts going like like sunset orange

661
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:23,399
Frosty Madness and then from there it

662
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,600
just goes to jet black so it's it's just

663
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,519
really cool

664
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:30,480
um and then like yeah flavor wise it's

665
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:32,720
just it's like this vanilla it's like a

666
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,179
vanilla icing

667
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,579
Hawaiian fruit terp kind of like a

668
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,100
fruity pebbly terp it's weird

669
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,019
and that's another thing I didn't want

670
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:45,298
the

671
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:48,900
flavor of that to overpower everything

672
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:51,720
in the in the lineup right so like

673
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:55,278
when I choose the the one that's the

674
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,140
other side of it right the the other

675
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,640
part of the cross I want that to kind of

676
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,740
shine because I choose some of those for

677
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,940
their their flavors and I want some of

678
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,259
that to shine through and sometimes if

679
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,840
you choose something that's just too

680
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,819
dominant then now it's like the runs

681
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,178
thing right runts beautiful beautiful

682
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:12,960
plant does excellent crosses breeds very

683
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,298
well

684
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,140
but makes everything taste like rice I

685
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:21,480
didn't want that yeah sure it does bring

686
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,580
this topic to mind for me which is that

687
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,599
a lot of the Casual consumers out there

688
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,519
as I'm sure you're aware they're

689
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,959
obsessed with like the idea of exotic

690
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,720
you know everything's got to be exotic

691
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,419
for them to want to have it and to me it

692
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,000
raises this fundamental question what is

693
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,200
exotic like what makes a strain exotic

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,038
and I'd be interested in your

695
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,038
perspective on that

696
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:48,659
I don't know I really don't

697
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:52,199
hey it's irritating that oh exotic but I

698
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:54,720
what I think it is is one it has to be

699
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,840
it has to be an amazing strain right it

700
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,480
has to almost be kind of known worldwide

701
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:05,158
but not able to be

702
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,500
obtained so it has to have some sort of

703
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,080
like really hard to get because once

704
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,339
everybody gets it is it exotic no it's

705
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:17,759
not now it's mundane so it has to be

706
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:20,639
hard to obtain well known and it has to

707
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,798
be absolutely amazing that's the three

708
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,500
things it has to be to be exotic

709
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,579
yeah that's a that's a good criteria you

710
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,619
know I've heard a lot of different

711
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,480
answers and it's interesting that

712
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:32,399
there's no consensus on it you know I

713
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,558
think it was compound who we had on not

714
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,059
too long ago and he sort of said some

715
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,980
many similar things to you except he

716
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:40,019
also said oh I also think it's got to be

717
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,400
purple to some extent which I think was

718
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,900
an interesting sort of Tibet and I guess

719
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,080
your work sort of fills that criteria

720
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,080
anyway

721
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,759
um yeah but I mean are we saying that we

722
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,460
can't have an exotic strain that's like

723
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,019
green I mean I guess we're just not in

724
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,519
favor right now and I understand what

725
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:57,859
he's saying that it needs to have some

726
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,418
color to be

727
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,819
exotic but

728
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:06,659
um I've seen some of the banana runs

729
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,579
fenos that are green and are absolutely

730
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:10,260
exotic you know what I mean like when

731
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,740
you pop that jar up and you smell it and

732
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:16,079
you look at how Frosty it is whoa so I

733
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,599
don't know if that if I agree completely

734
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,058
that the colored part of it

735
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,379
yeah no I definitely get yeah and then I

736
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,819
can't remember who it was but someone

737
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,440
else thread an interesting answer I

738
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,538
think it might have even been Masonic

739
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,000
but someone was like what about like

740
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:31,859
Acapulco Gold you know like that is that

741
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,839
like that's sort of exotic just by

742
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,339
virtue of how hard it is to get but I

743
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,259
digress so we could go down a whole

744
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,058
rabbit hole with that one

745
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,278
um yeah but but I mean speaking of

746
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:43,200
exotic you notably have a have a pretty

747
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,778
good friendship with exotic mic as far

748
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,419
as I know how did that all come about

749
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:50,640
yeah I mean we go all the way back to

750
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,980
like Community College so

751
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,020
um we've been buddies since way before I

752
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,940
mean I would say it's like brothers so

753
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,400
we we go all the way back

754
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,038
um before exotic genetics the company

755
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,200
and and

756
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:07,859
soulfire or any of that I mean we go

757
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,080
we go back to uh Community College uh we

758
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:13,678
met in uh

759
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:16,319
pre-cal math class and uh and we used to

760
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,840
take trips down to Humboldt to uh see my

761
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,980
uncle who's a farmer down there uh for

762
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,720
obvious reasons uh back in back in the

763
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,700
day we used to make that run back and

764
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,440
forth and we've just been friends for a

765
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,778
long time man he's a good dude

766
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,000
yeah what an organic sort of connection

767
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:34,740
you guys had and it you got me

768
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,480
interested now what were sort of some of

769
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,798
the old school strains you were smoking

770
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,480
on back in the day when you were doing

771
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:42,000
those trips

772
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,960
well back then we were doing it we were

773
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,759
like

774
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,079
oh at least that like we would go to

775
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,960
school and then we would come back and

776
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,839
we would watch like uh uh sub cool in

777
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,120
his old uh in his YouTube uh channel

778
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,298
right yeah yeah yeah so we were really

779
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:00,359
into like TGA sub cool back then so we

780
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,259
were like smoking the flave and

781
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,778
um

782
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:06,599
and like a bunch of different different

783
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:08,339
stuff I know I was growing up uh some

784
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,798
cool Crazy Train

785
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,480
uh a lot of train wreck was floating

786
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,359
around back then

787
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,298
um yeah yeah I think the first award

788
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:20,819
that that Mike won like I had was it it

789
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:23,480
was a great God I had the

790
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:27,058
it was Grape God crossed with the flave

791
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,819
and I want to say so it was my Grape God

792
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:34,019
selection and he took a flave male

793
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:36,538
crossed that and won his first High

794
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,099
Times here in Seattle I think he got

795
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:39,480
like second place or whatever it was

796
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,879
exciting you know what I mean it was

797
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,919
like one of my selections one of his

798
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,200
selections and it was the first time

799
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,059
like he won some [ __ ] and that [ __ ] was

800
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,778
so exciting I think that really kicked

801
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:52,259
off

802
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:54,778
everything yeah wow I mean before we

803
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:56,640
move on I want to quickly ask you out of

804
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:58,740
personal curiosity because I I too used

805
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,320
to watch a ton of the weed nerd and you

806
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,880
know big up subcool we miss you

807
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,158
um the question is what's your favorite

808
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,080
TGA strain you know I I just when you

809
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,278
mentioned the Flav it it brought all

810
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,839
these memories to mind because there's

811
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:11,759
some TGO strains where you hear a lot

812
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,859
about them like Chernobyl and space

813
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,480
queen but other ones like the Flav have

814
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:16,859
got like a bit of a cult following so

815
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,839
I'm curious to hear what was your

816
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,479
favorite TGO strain

817
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,759
uh I think it was that like Mike had a

818
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,500
really good cut of the flave like we

819
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,658
loved growing it it grew like these eggs

820
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,640
all over it and then it just like these

821
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,679
egg-shaped nugs all over it and it just

822
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,778
had a crazy smell like I was talking to

823
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,399
him like a month or two ago and I was

824
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:37,200
like bro we need that where who has that

825
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,479
[ __ ] cut like where's that where's

826
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,220
our flave cut at we just don't got it

827
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,140
anymore but

828
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,179
um

829
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,038
that I loved the Crazy Train just

830
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,480
because the colors that it put out you

831
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,940
know like the smell wasn't it was like

832
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,399
kind of more of an earthy smell but the

833
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,259
color show that that thing would put on

834
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,859
um and the frost for like even back then

835
00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:01,019
was like ahead of its time so yeah I

836
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,778
think those were my two favorites yeah

837
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,398
solid picks solid picks and just to

838
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:07,980
follow up on another thing relating to

839
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,558
Exotic Mike I think it was James Bean

840
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,538
who told me that uh you had been sort of

841
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,759
one of the influential people who had

842
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:17,519
sort of helped get Mike on board with

843
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:21,658
Femmes is that true

844
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,099
yeah so I mean he had uh tried a few

845
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,899
times I mean he had used different

846
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:27,178
sprays that are on the market and he'd

847
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,379
done um different things and they just

848
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,019
weren't working they were like burning

849
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,460
up his plants and they yeah they just

850
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,099
weren't working so I just

851
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,759
you know I got a background in science I

852
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:39,959
I put my my head in it and I you know I

853
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,619
kind of came up with my own little

854
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,700
recipe and yeah I

855
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:50,939
I made it and then I I reversed uh I

856
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,980
made that banana runt and then

857
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,100
he kind of helped me get the timing down

858
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,798
because my timing wasn't very good like

859
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:00,658
I was a little bit off and you know my

860
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,398
community was like man you know you got

861
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,679
it like this your reversals are amazing

862
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,599
and I was like tight you know so I

863
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,580
showed you know I helped him to do that

864
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,778
and then he's like yeah but we got to

865
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:11,460
get this timing right and that's

866
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:14,759
something about Mike that

867
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,038
you know he's a really focused in on

868
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,859
what he's doing so he was able to like

869
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:22,740
focus in and really tune our timing down

870
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:25,798
so that we could we can nail it so

871
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,659
um yeah I I definitely helped him uh

872
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:29,278
learn how to make Femmes and I pushed

873
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,600
him in that direction

874
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,119
um to make friends because I felt like

875
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,819
the you know exotic genetics company was

876
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,439
missing that portion of it and I I want

877
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,240
to see all my homeboys

878
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,820
um succeed there's nothing more I want

879
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,038
to see than than uh everybody at the

880
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:47,339
table if anybody knows me I want to see

881
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:48,480
all my my people uh do well so I was

882
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,500
pushing him on that I was like look man

883
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
you're just gonna have to make some

884
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,359
fence and finally he was like all right

885
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,519
I'll do it and um and he really helped

886
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,038
me get that timing correct so I

887
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,720
appreciate him for that yeah brilliant

888
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,058
and that's that's a question we get

889
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,798
regularly from listeners is like what's

890
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,079
the optimal time to pollinate your

891
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,358
Harvest I remember back in the day the

892
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,039
subcool actually was he would always say

893
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,480
like I think that you want the females

894
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,398
to sort of get hit by the pole and

895
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,260
around sort of end of week three week

896
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,398
four sort of thing where do you fall on

897
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,500
that one

898
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:22,259
yeah I think that's a that's that's

899
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,599
about right like we're weak

900
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,760
yeah end of week three like so what are

901
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,099
we talking about like day 28-ish

902
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,419
yeah like right around there I think is

903
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,580
the best I mean it needs to be like nice

904
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,898
cotton balls everywhere if you do that

905
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:35,159
if you do it too early you're just gonna

906
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:37,679
cheat yourself you're just not going to

907
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,320
get um as many seeds as you you could so

908
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,800
you gotta watch it um and I've learned a

909
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,639
lesson on that

910
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,200
jumping the gun a little bit too early

911
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,539
on that but yeah so you want to have

912
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,939
really nice nice cotton balls for it so

913
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:53,099
timing is key especially timing with

914
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,960
your with your family creation you have

915
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,580
your timing right yeah definitely I

916
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,858
think I've one of those people have been

917
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,358
burnt before and you end up with like

918
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:02,039
100 seats or something and you're like

919
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,960
what happened there yeah that could

920
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,820
happen so I mean on the topic of

921
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,440
feminized work or you know obviously you

922
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,539
do a mixture of both regular and

923
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,280
feminized work and I'm sort of wondering

924
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:12,900
do you have any preference and as a

925
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,760
follow-up do you think it's easier to

926
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,470
make a good feminized cross than it is

927
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,820
to make a good regular cross

928
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:19,078
[Music]

929
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,260
um

930
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,339
I don't know if that's quite true I

931
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,280
think

932
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,420
from the selection standpoint it is a

933
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,760
little bit easier to make a good

934
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,720
feminized cross because you're looking

935
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,160
at that female plant you already know

936
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,659
what it's gonna do you know what I mean

937
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,739
like well not what it's going to do but

938
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,019
you know what you're looking at so

939
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,118
you're looking at it you're like oh man

940
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:44,579
it's got beautiful color it's got frost

941
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,780
it's got all these different things

942
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,599
um that's a little bit harder to see in

943
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:51,420
a male plant right like you select

944
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,099
differently with the male criteria I

945
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,320
mean some guys select for like Frosty

946
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,900
meal plans some guys have a bunch of

947
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,480
different ways they select male plants

948
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,639
like stem rub all those different things

949
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,858
do you really need that when you're when

950
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:07,500
you're reversing a already known like

951
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:09,900
Banger probably not

952
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,239
so yeah it might be easier

953
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,680
um but then again I mean you're going to

954
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,118
need to grow out all those Femmes

955
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,358
because

956
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,119
uh people's people seem to say that that

957
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,819
Femmes have this reputation for her

958
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,220
being easier I don't really see that I

959
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,920
think that's kind of Bro Science really

960
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,659
I I've popped a bunch of guys regular

961
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,559
rag seeds that hurt them all over the

962
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:34,739
place

963
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,838
so you know I don't know

964
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,578
yeah I mean you you just answered the

965
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,338
next question for me so thanks for that

966
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,519
and as a follow-up sometimes you hear

967
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:47,400
breeders say that they feel using a

968
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:49,019
mother that comes from Femme stock is

969
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,119
like a bad practice if you're gonna make

970
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:52,440
seeds do you do you also have a similar

971
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,059
point of view where you think that's

972
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,280
maybe not true

973
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,000
yeah I don't know I I don't know that

974
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,400
it's

975
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,679
uh true or not true I mean I guess

976
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,599
that's part of the problem with

977
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,858
um where we're at in like cannabis

978
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,160
breeding because a lot of it is just

979
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:10,078
anecdotal right it's like oh well this

980
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,299
happened to me this one time so this

981
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,579
must be the science and me kind of

982
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,539
coming from like a science background

983
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,480
um

984
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:21,420
I just don't go unless it's proven I

985
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,940
just don't go for it you know so hard to

986
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,280
say I mean there's guys that reverse

987
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,059
Femmes all the time and use them in

988
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,800
their

989
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:34,380
in their stuff so uh hard to say

990
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,440
yeah so and I guess just as a bit of a

991
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,079
far out question would you ever consider

992
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,659
making like S2s or something like that

993
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,660
if you found a killer say Bahama Mama S1

994
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,260
um I mean I would I would be open to try

995
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:51,660
it it would just have to have to make it

996
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,460
through the rigorous testing you know

997
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:54,838
like we have to see what that with the

998
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,300
progeny would do would they come out all

999
00:37:54,838 --> 00:38:00,779
weird I don't know

1000
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,220
yeah I I guess so right I mean you're

1001
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,440
stacking a lot of jeans on top of each

1002
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:06,118
other right yeah it'd be interesting if

1003
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,760
you could somehow get some sort of like

1004
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,960
ABC or freak Show sort of expression out

1005
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,300
of doing that

1006
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,519
dude that freak Show thing looks crazy

1007
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,760
yeah it's interesting isn't it I mean

1008
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,960
you you've got me you know on this freak

1009
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,820
Show train now so I'm gonna ask the

1010
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,099
question I look at plants like that and

1011
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,740
I'm sort of like this is cool and I see

1012
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:28,079
the value in it but I also don't see the

1013
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:31,259
commercial value in it what's your

1014
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,240
thoughts on those weird sorts of strains

1015
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,359
um for me it's not I mean that

1016
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:40,019
particular one isn't something that I

1017
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,940
would breed with or I would grow so I

1018
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,900
agree with you there it's not it's

1019
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,880
interesting

1020
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll give you that it's it's interesting

1021
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,500
I'll just that's that's about that but

1022
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,599
um like uh we bred with with uh the

1023
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,920
creature from from bee Leaf over there

1024
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,260
he sent the cover we grew that out

1025
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,000
that's a weird plant

1026
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,599
um it just like makes these fingers a

1027
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,739
super Frosty uh so it was a little bit

1028
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,780
odd an odd plant but it wasn't like that

1029
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:11,279
where like I don't even know what the

1030
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,140
freak Show really is is that a mutant

1031
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,400
I've never grown it I haven't seen it

1032
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,420
grown personally so I've only seen

1033
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,900
pictures

1034
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:22,079
yeah I think it's like a a weird hybrid

1035
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,940
of Big Sur Hollywood and banana OG of

1036
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,560
all things so yeah it's pretty weird in

1037
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,720
genetics in it

1038
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,719
weird I didn't even know that yeah there

1039
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,699
you go okay well take me back to the

1040
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,519
start what was your first experience

1041
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:38,159
with cannabis

1042
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:40,920
I mean the the very start goes back to

1043
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,838
my my uncle from Humble like just being

1044
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,960
a little kid and just walking into his

1045
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:48,119
uh his girl room and being blinded so I

1046
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,480
mean I guess I've had a a relationship

1047
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,740
with it since I could walk but

1048
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,780
um

1049
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:58,199
I think in high school like in the

1050
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:02,099
middle of high school you know just

1051
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:05,639
oh [ __ ] even before that I guess I was

1052
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,760
I would steal my my uh my cousin's car

1053
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:12,118
when we were 13 and go to Yakima and buy

1054
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,920
um Mexican brickweed ounces and smoke

1055
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,720
with all the all the homies back in the

1056
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,880
early early 90s

1057
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:23,279
so I guess there and then

1058
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,440
um Midway through high school I was I

1059
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,480
mean I live in a I live in West Seattle

1060
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,358
White Center area it's kind of like the

1061
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,039
shitty neighborhood of of Seattle and

1062
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,719
back then when we were kids I didn't

1063
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,679
have any money we didn't have [ __ ] so I

1064
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,939
was

1065
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:41,699
I was like a water a water boy for uh uh

1066
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,380
you know grow house here so I mean I got

1067
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,419
I got a real intimate

1068
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,180
relationship with at least taking care

1069
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,019
of plants I guess that was like

1070
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:54,598
94 94 95 Maybe

1071
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,159
so yeah I mean [ __ ] man we didn't have

1072
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,079
filters we didn't have any of that dude

1073
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,338
it was just like the whole block would

1074
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,940
just reek

1075
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:05,578
it was it was crazy but yeah so

1076
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,960
um that and then with breeding like

1077
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,039
those guys that I was watering those

1078
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,539
plants were they were like older guys

1079
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,920
you know like I was wearing those

1080
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,539
password they were doing some breeding

1081
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,200
back then

1082
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,940
um

1083
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,219
and then like near the end of high

1084
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,280
school I would we live really close to

1085
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:22,439
Canada so back then

1086
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,900
um we would drive up to Canada

1087
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,599
and you could go to these coffee shops

1088
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,539
where you could go in the coffee shop

1089
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,420
you could roll up joints and they sold

1090
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:36,599
seeds there right so we would go there

1091
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,358
and I would just buy all kinds of seeds

1092
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,859
enjoy smoking weed inside in a coffee

1093
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,960
shop like I thought that was the coolest

1094
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:44,880
[ __ ] right and uh

1095
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,079
then I would smuggle all the seeds back

1096
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,940
and we would pop all these different

1097
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,859
seeds and go through the Finos and stuff

1098
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,000
stuff I guess that's kind of where it

1099
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:53,578
started

1100
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,980
yeah wow is that sort of like the mark

1101
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:58,019
Emery days of it all yeah yeah that was

1102
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,519
definitely the mark every days yeah yeah

1103
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,320
wow that's cool that you got to

1104
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,000
experience that and you referenced that

1105
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,800
you know some of the the more senior

1106
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,420
guys when you were younger were toying

1107
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,980
around with breeding do you happen to

1108
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,358
remember what they were working with by

1109
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,500
any chance

1110
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,480
uh I mean everything back then was like

1111
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,380
um

1112
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,380
like skunks and like Northern Lights and

1113
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,660
just I mean I thought that the part that

1114
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,760
we were growing back then was amazing if

1115
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:28,259
we saw it today I'd probably be like oh

1116
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,020
but

1117
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,820
um yeah I don't know I mean they were

1118
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,039
they were making all kinds of things it

1119
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,700
was it was a wild time

1120
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,579
um

1121
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,739
and just super illegal right like back

1122
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,119
then it wasn't

1123
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:43,259
romanticized as much as it is now like

1124
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,940
where

1125
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,119
nowadays in Seattle your neighbors don't

1126
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,579
give a [ __ ] they don't everybody is pro

1127
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,079
pot well back then it wasn't that like

1128
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:54,960
it was a

1129
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,700
it was a operation so uh it was a good

1130
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,800
learning experience I mean I learned a

1131
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:00,419
lot

1132
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,700
watering those plants and listening to

1133
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,579
those guys and a lot of those guys now

1134
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:07,679
are are in the industry today in the

1135
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,519
legal industry here and uh

1136
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,618
in Washington so it's cool to see them

1137
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:15,300
move forward yeah definitely it's always

1138
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,338
good to see the people who sort of lay

1139
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,740
the groundwork initially getting some

1140
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:22,318
recognition for that if we fast forward

1141
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:24,659
a little bit when did you decide to get

1142
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,159
your first sort of grow going in terms

1143
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:28,019
of like it's yours you're running it

1144
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,519
selecting the genetics and whatnot how

1145
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,338
did that occur

1146
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,579
oh I mean we've been growing

1147
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:37,159
we've been growing since

1148
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:39,839
96 at

1149
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:43,799
for different reasons and

1150
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,880
from then on so always I mean I I feel

1151
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,220
like

1152
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,680
growing

1153
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:51,118
is almost therapeutic for me you know

1154
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,399
what I mean it's like church it's it's

1155
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,019
where I go sometimes to think it's where

1156
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,700
I go sometimes to just get away from

1157
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:59,940
people

1158
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:02,519
um and sometimes where I go to you know

1159
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,818
to have to talk with the homies or or

1160
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:08,460
whatever so I don't think that

1161
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:11,279
I'll ever no I have a grow and and

1162
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,099
growing goes back all the way before you

1163
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,819
know before 2000 for me so

1164
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,920
um

1165
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,900
yeah yeah

1166
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,059
it holds a it holds a place in my heart

1167
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,920
I guess I think I'm gonna steal that

1168
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:25,199
line from now and growing is like church

1169
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,480
for me I like that a lot

1170
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:31,439
yeah it is I'm not very religious myself

1171
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:34,019
uh I'm pretty agnostic but uh but

1172
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,599
there's there's some sort of

1173
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:38,519
religious connection from a spiritual

1174
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,559
connection I guess for me with with

1175
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,838
growing if if I didn't if I didn't make

1176
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,039
a dollar from it I'd still be doing it

1177
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:46,739
every day

1178
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,420
yeah for sure and I mean you sort of

1179
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:49,500
raise an interesting point when you say

1180
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,539
that you know even if I didn't make a

1181
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,420
dollar from it I'd still do it it sort

1182
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:56,099
of makes me think about the trajectory

1183
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,960
of someone who's looking to craft

1184
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,700
themselves out a position in the

1185
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,980
industry maybe as a breeder maybe as a

1186
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:03,719
just a grower and having a brand but

1187
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,338
obviously at some point everyone starts

1188
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:06,539
off where they are getting paid a dollar

1189
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:08,759
for it and they're just sort of doing it

1190
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:10,679
for themselves what might be some advice

1191
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,079
you'd give to someone who wants to you

1192
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,419
know sort of do things in the right way

1193
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,920
and not just you know sort of cut

1194
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,800
corners or whatever what's your advice

1195
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:24,000
for a newbie breeder or brand

1196
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,099
well I don't worry about the money you

1197
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,659
know what I mean like don't don't do it

1198
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,980
for the dollars man because there's

1199
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,838
other [ __ ] you could do you can make

1200
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,420
better money you know

1201
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,239
um yeah at least if you're doing it

1202
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,240
right I mean you see me I we don't drop

1203
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,799
a strain every day or every week you

1204
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:42,539
don't hear a new strain from me every

1205
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
week yeah that's because the [ __ ] takes

1206
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:46,259
time and if you're doing it right and

1207
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,440
you're testing you're growing everything

1208
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,839
out the proper way and you're really

1209
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,700
um doing it the proper way in my opinion

1210
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,078
there's no real proper way right you do

1211
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:58,500
whatever you want but this is the way I

1212
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,599
do it we just are able to drop a strain

1213
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,579
every every five minutes like that [ __ ]

1214
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,818
takes time so

1215
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:07,980
um and time is money right so

1216
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:10,019
you know don't do it for the money you

1217
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,880
do it because you love doing it and then

1218
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:13,318
that should it'll show in your work you

1219
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,940
know if you do it if you're doing it

1220
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:16,318
because you love doing it because you

1221
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,300
absolutely

1222
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,519
enjoy doing it

1223
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,460
we're gonna see that you know we're

1224
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:26,338
gonna see that in your crosses and you

1225
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,980
might be surprised we might love it too

1226
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:31,078
yeah that's some great information and

1227
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,300
you gave me a brilliant segue right

1228
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,039
there and I remember you know Chad I was

1229
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,599
having with James Bean last year he was

1230
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,940
telling me that you had a release sort

1231
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,380
of scheduled to go live but sort of as

1232
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,179
it was getting close to the date you

1233
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,680
decided to pull the plug because you

1234
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:46,078
sort of weren't happy with some of the

1235
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,519
results you were seeing and it raises

1236
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,318
the question you know what's it like to

1237
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,500
have to make that call you know and how

1238
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:54,179
does it feel to have done that and what

1239
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,219
many would say is probably the honorable

1240
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:58,559
thing if that's how you feel While

1241
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:01,078
others in the industry you know have

1242
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,940
sort of knowingly dropped strains that

1243
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,079
are just horrible you know and I mean

1244
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,760
the one that everyone's probably

1245
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,800
thinking of is it Candy Rain from the

1246
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,599
cookie fam you know like they don't give

1247
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,859
a [ __ ] about that like so what was it

1248
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,539
like to have to make that call and how

1249
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:14,219
does it feel when you see that other

1250
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,559
breeders don't do that sort of thing

1251
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:18,659
when maybe they should for me it was

1252
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,799
absolutely easy easy

1253
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:24,179
call to make like you know we looked at

1254
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,579
it and we're just like

1255
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:27,960
and that was that was a Don Mega across

1256
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,880
there's a bunch of crosses in that and

1257
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,619
we're just like you know what maybe with

1258
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,240
this mail the mail that we used which

1259
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:35,640
was awesome what we thought was awesome

1260
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:38,519
now we're just seeing too much too many

1261
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,858
problems so in some of the in some of

1262
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,780
the crosses so we're like we're gonna

1263
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,338
back up we're gonna just hold back then

1264
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,960
I mean the money's not that important

1265
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:48,838
the money's definitely not worth my

1266
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,539
reputation and the money's not worth

1267
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,639
um people having all kinds of issues all

1268
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:55,619
over the place like nah that's not what

1269
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,039
we're about so we just pulled back off

1270
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:01,019
that and then and we went and then we

1271
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,818
went at that

1272
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,318
um with a different Focus you know and

1273
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:08,039
then that's when that when we made the

1274
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,719
the line with uh the washing in mind we

1275
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:12,420
came at it with a different mail and

1276
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:14,578
then tested all that stuff again and we

1277
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,858
didn't see those problems so we're like

1278
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:20,039
boom we found it you know

1279
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:21,900
yeah again just emphasizing you know I

1280
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:23,639
feel like that's a very honorable thing

1281
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,740
to do which you don't really hear a lot

1282
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,059
about and it makes me wonder what is

1283
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,679
unacceptable and there's this

1284
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,000
hypothetical I've been giving to guests

1285
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,919
on the show because I think it's an

1286
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,199
interesting sort of moral dilemma let's

1287
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,960
just say you've got a seed line and like

1288
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:40,199
half of the seeds Herm right so a very

1289
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,380
high percentage like 50 but the 50 that

1290
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:45,899
don't hurt is the most fire thing you've

1291
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,920
ever seen or created what do you do with

1292
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,079
that line

1293
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,119
well obviously you probably should work

1294
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,440
it some more even if it's even if it's

1295
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,900
super fire but you know what you could

1296
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,539
the one thing you could do is be honest

1297
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:02,099
about that and and tell people like hey

1298
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:05,639
this is what it is you know uh uh get it

1299
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,960
at at your own risk or or you could go

1300
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,578
back to the drawing board and rework

1301
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,619
that or you can take some of those ones

1302
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,300
that you found in there and work work

1303
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,318
from there out

1304
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,880
um there's a bunch of different things

1305
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:17,519
you can do rather than just drop the

1306
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,559
[ __ ] like 50 that are actually harms

1307
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,838
like intersects from the bottom to the

1308
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:22,858
top yeah that's a that's a problem I

1309
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:27,299
mean

1310
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:30,000
I I get some guys that will say you know

1311
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,318
hey this like things harm for a bunch of

1312
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,179
different reasons right like sometimes

1313
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:35,219
if it's just on like the lower like you

1314
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,318
see some stuff on the lowers that could

1315
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,939
be a bunch of different things like one

1316
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:40,619
guy could get a plant and it'll pop out

1317
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,420
some nuts on the bottom and another guy

1318
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,920
get the same plant and grow it just fine

1319
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,358
so

1320
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,519
you know there's a difference between

1321
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:50,519
problems in your grow room and problems

1322
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,679
with your Tech versus problems with the

1323
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:57,239
genetics if you got a if you if you're

1324
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:59,519
testing some seed 50 of those seeds have

1325
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,618
full-blown herbs I don't give a [ __ ]

1326
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,318
what the other 50 look like you need to

1327
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:06,720
probably start over

1328
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,179
yeah and you raise a brilliant point

1329
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,739
there sort of about honesty like is it

1330
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:11,818
you just be up front just be honest

1331
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:14,399
about it like this is what you're gonna

1332
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:16,380
get and it further segues into this

1333
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,420
discussion about do we need to test

1334
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,818
seeds even because we've sort of entered

1335
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,440
this new domain of breeding where you've

1336
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,480
got some breeders like Masonic for

1337
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,159
example where he's just open like I

1338
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,318
don't test my seats straight up don't

1339
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,899
test them and then it makes you wonder

1340
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,639
is it better to be honest or is it

1341
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:36,599
better to test

1342
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:39,000
dude that is exactly why I [ __ ] with

1343
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,740
Masonic so strong I love that guy you

1344
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,179
know what I mean I I get people I did a

1345
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:45,539
cross um

1346
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:47,879
uh I did a collab with Masonic

1347
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:50,639
um I used his papaya God and with my Don

1348
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,559
Mega and my Don Mega cross right and I

1349
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,440
got guys in my DM talking [ __ ] to me

1350
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,079
because I use masonic's um work and I

1351
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,720
you know I don't even get into it with

1352
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,880
them but here's the thing about Masonic

1353
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,879
the guy has never lied to you

1354
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,760
he's never he's told you the truth from

1355
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,460
day [ __ ] one he told you straight up

1356
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,760
I'm gonna take everything I'm gonna

1357
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:17,220
cross Wilson with it

1358
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,420
and that's what it is and you know I was

1359
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:20,818
listening to him one time he was like

1360
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,740
you know you can go buy seeds from some

1361
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:24,300
breeders that they do all this testing

1362
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:25,919
and they do all this stuff or you can

1363
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,099
you can get these right here you know

1364
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,559
that that we made and you can get these

1365
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:33,300
deals on them and I just I don't know

1366
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,980
man I just support the honesty and the

1367
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,339
openness that that he brings to the

1368
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:41,099
table and furthermore when I popped that

1369
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:44,039
uh that papaya God and I grew it out

1370
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,599
that [ __ ] was tight straight up that's

1371
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,058
why it made it into the line for no

1372
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,940
other reason it was a banger and we see

1373
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:54,180
pictures of people that grow out the uh

1374
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:57,059
the Don Magic Wand all the time that

1375
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:59,578
that found it to be heat so Props to

1376
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:01,380
Masonic I agree he's he's an interesting

1377
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,119
character very polarizing but the thing

1378
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,099
which I find most interesting is exactly

1379
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,420
what you said there's like people like

1380
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,700
to hide on it but it's really hard to

1381
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,200
point to anything ethically so to speak

1382
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:12,838
bad that he's done because as you said

1383
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,480
it's been it's been so upfront you know

1384
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:18,900
yeah I mean he he's never lied to you

1385
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:21,300
like that's all I gotta say like hate on

1386
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,579
him if you don't like his personality or

1387
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,980
you don't like it his trolling that's

1388
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:26,940
you man but the guy in the at least in

1389
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,280
the breeding from the breeding

1390
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,179
standpoint he's been up front and he's

1391
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,619
been

1392
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:33,239
um honest with what he's doing the

1393
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,818
entire time so

1394
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:37,618
yeah yeah it's funny likewise I had a

1395
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:39,659
lot of people in my DMs and even

1396
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:41,338
publicly you know really upset we had

1397
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:43,078
him on the show and you know this whole

1398
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:45,058
get real breeders on the show and I'm

1399
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,280
just I always just thought he's opening

1400
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,599
a store in like Fairfax like he's

1401
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,619
obviously doing something right like

1402
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,500
don't you feel like you've got something

1403
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:55,140
you could possibly learn from him yeah I

1404
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,480
I don't get it like I said I I have

1405
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:59,578
popped a bunch of breeders uh I'm not

1406
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,099
gonna out anybody or whatever but I pop

1407
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:04,619
anybody in the game that's somebody I've

1408
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:08,338
popped their gear and I've grown it

1409
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:11,039
and I just like that I mean I we met at

1410
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:12,900
uh at the Denver show he was like yo so

1411
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,940
far here's all these seeds and I was

1412
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,920
like bro this is so many seeds I can't

1413
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,599
pop all these seeds tell me which one of

1414
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,220
these is a banger and I will pop that

1415
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,318
pack he's like these ones right here

1416
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:23,699
these ones are a banger I said tight I'm

1417
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,380
popping these when I get home just like

1418
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,058
I said when I got when I got off the

1419
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,260
plane I got home I put out all my

1420
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:30,359
different seeds because I always collect

1421
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,920
seeds don't think that just I'm buying

1422
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:36,119
seeds all the time I get seeds from

1423
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,099
everybody so I his winning in the in the

1424
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,420
group to get popped and when we were

1425
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:41,460
going through it I was just like this

1426
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,920
[ __ ] is tight like the smell was tight

1427
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:46,019
the frost was tight everything was like

1428
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,818
it just came together man and I was like

1429
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:49,920
and there's a few of them right like

1430
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:52,500
there's a couple Keepers so I was like

1431
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,200
yeah this is some heat period That's why

1432
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,699
I made it in the lineup no other reason

1433
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:58,259
and it shows in the like the progeny

1434
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:03,239
with that dawn like it crossed really

1435
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:05,400
well it washed awesome like yeah so yeah

1436
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:07,078
he also referenced that that one when

1437
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,760
we're interviewing human he said it's a

1438
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,440
banger so that's good to hear but if we

1439
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,000
take a step back and look at the mail

1440
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,059
we've spoken about it a few times the

1441
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,039
Don Mega it in itself was you know what

1442
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:19,800
I consider to be a pretty successful

1443
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,318
commercial release what was it about the

1444
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,359
Don Mega that stood out to you and how

1445
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,900
would you describe the Terps and sort of

1446
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:29,098
flavors it brings to crosses

1447
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,200
well

1448
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,119
you know that that came around like it

1449
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,259
so it's a GMO cross so you know right

1450
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,000
off the bat you're going to get those

1451
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,800
funky terms but it was a little bit

1452
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,940
different it was kind of like a funky

1453
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:44,160
gem sock corpse plant

1454
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:46,500
nasty funky terp like you got to kind of

1455
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:49,558
be into it and then um

1456
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:52,679
the commercial guys like the

1457
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,300
the wreck Growers really liked it

1458
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:58,078
because you're getting this funky terp

1459
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,818
you're getting a high THC uh test score

1460
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,480
you know most of the the keepers are

1461
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:06,000
testing around 30 30 plus and

1462
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:10,019
they're just weighing super heavy and

1463
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,639
they're finishing before 65. so that's

1464
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:13,139
kind of like a trifecta for those guys

1465
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:14,639
you know what I mean the guys that want

1466
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:16,199
to make money

1467
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,358
um and they have like these this like

1468
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:21,299
little box criteria that they need to

1469
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:24,299
stay in to be able to hit these numbers

1470
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:27,359
for their investors or just to stay open

1471
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,339
in a market that's overly taxed and

1472
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,318
overly regulated

1473
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:35,099
um

1474
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:36,779
they they love it yeah so and it washes

1475
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,460
so and I think you know that comes from

1476
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,780
the GMO and probably

1477
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,639
um the Black Banana I have in that

1478
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,400
blackberry kush in the background which

1479
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,659
is also a good washer so yeah it just

1480
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,460
checked a lot of boxes for people

1481
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:48,659
commercially I think that's why it was

1482
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,358
really popular

1483
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:53,279
it's I hey if you're like a home grower

1484
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,739
it might not be the one for you because

1485
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,980
that thing gets so tall and gnarly

1486
00:55:55,739 --> 00:56:00,838
uh you know if ceiling height is like a

1487
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,940
a thing for you then and the

1488
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,940
vigorousness of it too it'll it'll

1489
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,980
overshadow other [ __ ] in your garden so

1490
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,800
uh it'll just crowd them out

1491
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,780
yeah okay I mean would you have a

1492
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,300
specific cross you might recommend that

1493
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,519
has the Don Mega in it that is maybe a

1494
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,839
little more sort of indoor tameable or

1495
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,400
would you just say stay away from the

1496
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:23,099
f2s because that's sort of the more

1497
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,139
vigorous lanky one you referenced yeah

1498
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:27,480
the F2 super vigorous

1499
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:30,779
um but like the the happy hour is a

1500
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:34,980
great one I mean um uh the Scorpion crew

1501
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:36,780
those guys out of Spain they've won uh

1502
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,240
they've won some competitions with that

1503
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:42,119
and extract uh it's got a nice

1504
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:44,338
strawberry with that raunchy turp it

1505
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:46,858
stays a little bit shorter you know

1506
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:49,199
that's a really good one so if I was

1507
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,940
gonna do uh if I wanted to Don megacross

1508
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,199
and something indoors that's probably

1509
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,318
what I would go with

1510
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,879
nice and I mean as we wrap up on the Dom

1511
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:58,619
Mega quickly I'm just wondering will we

1512
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,059
will we see it show its head again or

1513
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:02,338
are you just sort of always moving

1514
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:03,960
forwards

1515
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:05,578
um I like to I like to move forward

1516
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,139
sometimes if something's like really

1517
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:10,380
popular and people are just like hey we

1518
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:13,199
need come on do something bring it back

1519
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,880
then you know we'll consider it but I

1520
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,919
think part of like going back to that

1521
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,220
when we're talking about Exotics I think

1522
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:22,800
it's cool for things to go extinct right

1523
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:24,299
like the banana runs uh we're probably

1524
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,160
gonna let that run its course and be

1525
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,480
done at some you know

1526
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,000
um because

1527
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,740
then when you have that pack in your

1528
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,199
Vault and we're not making it anymore

1529
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:36,058
it's 16 it's done

1530
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,799
um that value goes up kind of like a

1531
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,079
baseball card and I think that's part of

1532
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,760
the culture with seeds and I think that

1533
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,980
is what makes it cool seeds are not

1534
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,619
going to be as cool if there's huge

1535
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,579
companies making so many of them it's

1536
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:49,380
like

1537
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:51,240
you know

1538
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,619
celery and watermelon seeds or whatever

1539
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,818
that you can buy at Home Depot they're

1540
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,960
never going to run out so it's going to

1541
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:57,239
be the exact same

1542
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,440
that is boring to me

1543
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:03,539
so I think it's much cooler if things

1544
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,880
become rare or or gems that you just

1545
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:07,679
can't find anymore

1546
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,380
yeah definitely I definitely feel that's

1547
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,879
got some value to it and before we move

1548
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,500
on too much I did want to actually

1549
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,019
quickly ask you you referenced the happy

1550
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,579
hour the strawberry jelly that that

1551
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:19,619
grabbed my attention because you can

1552
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:21,780
find so little information on it I think

1553
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:23,338
it might be one of Mike's strains can

1554
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,599
you give us any backstory on that one at

1555
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:27,179
all

1556
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:30,539
yeah so the strawberry jelly actually is

1557
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:32,519
a is a cut it's a cut a mimosa it's a

1558
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,079
very unique cut at the most so where if

1559
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:36,838
you've grown Mimosa it kind of has like

1560
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,980
a citrusy orange

1561
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:43,078
smell generally but this one did not and

1562
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,719
um it was given to Mike at a show uh by

1563
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,160
a guy named pure Mel and

1564
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:49,500
uh

1565
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,420
Mike recognized it right off the bat he

1566
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,559
was like oh this is this might be

1567
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,780
something because he just had the flower

1568
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,839
you know and then Paramount brought uh

1569
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,460
Mike the cut and Mike gave it to me and

1570
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,219
he was like Hey man

1571
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,720
grow this out I was like all right just

1572
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:05,818
like anything else that comes into our

1573
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:08,159
crew [ __ ] gots to be grown out right

1574
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:10,259
it's the number one rule

1575
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,759
comes in I grow it out I'm growing it

1576
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,040
with a bunch of different stuff you know

1577
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,500
I got I got some cap stuff in there I

1578
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:18,179
got I got the creme de mint from Mike in

1579
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,798
there which was kicking ass like just

1580
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,838
doing amazing

1581
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:26,400
um and then I had this strawberry plant

1582
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:29,119
and it was wild I I remember I was like

1583
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,180
it was day 52 finished

1584
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,500
Frosty as hell uh green this is a green

1585
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:35,578
plant it's more on the green side of

1586
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,019
everything right kind of like a little

1587
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:39,298
bit of pink on the under leaves but

1588
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:39,900
overall green

1589
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:43,079
um

1590
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:45,720
and just super like dense

1591
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:49,318
and frosty but what the real kicker like

1592
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:51,899
the what grabs you is the super fake

1593
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:53,699
artificial strawberry smell it's never

1594
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,740
smelled anything like it and I've I've

1595
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:57,298
grown Strawberry Cough I've grown a

1596
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,000
bunch of different strawberry crosses

1597
00:59:57,298 --> 01:00:01,980
all over the place and I called him up

1598
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,358
and I was like yo ax what's up he's like

1599
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,298
what's up I said the strawberry plant

1600
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:10,980
this is the real deal this is it it's

1601
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:12,960
awesome and uh yeah he and he grew it in

1602
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,119
his facility and boom he made

1603
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,679
strawberries and cream a bunch of

1604
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,660
different uh strawberry crosses all

1605
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:21,899
bangers like look at his red pop line

1606
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:24,058
with that heaters so

1607
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,619
yeah that's a that's a cool little

1608
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:26,640
backstory on that I guess yeah I

1609
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,260
wouldn't have expected that out of

1610
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,058
mimosa everything I've seen was like

1611
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,460
what you mentioned so orange dominant

1612
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,680
but sort of you touched on the idea of

1613
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,780
you know testing stuff and it we've seen

1614
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:40,139
a bit of a move in the past few years

1615
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:43,019
from breeders having uh like public

1616
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:44,279
testers and admittedly you know

1617
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:46,259
sometimes getting a bit frustrated

1618
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,540
because you you know you don't get back

1619
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,339
all the reviews and the grow reports

1620
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:52,980
that you're hoping to get to sort of

1621
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:54,420
more of an in-house testing format how

1622
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,699
do you test things and do you like to

1623
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,440
have external testers or do you just

1624
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:00,838
keep it in-house

1625
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:04,440
uh we just do it in-house right now but

1626
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:07,078
uh I'm thinking about well here's what

1627
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,880
I'll say about it nothing's better than

1628
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:13,260
you doing it yourself

1629
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:15,960
because when I test something myself one

1630
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,240
uh I can talk about it to people so if

1631
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,039
somebody if somebody hits you up and

1632
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,078
you've used all these different testers

1633
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,480
and they hit you up on Instagram they're

1634
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,160
like hey uh how does the hoodie dough

1635
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,500
grow well you don't know how the hodi

1636
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,739
dough grows because your testers know

1637
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,659
how it grows so that for me is

1638
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:36,118
problematic right off the bat the fact

1639
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:38,338
that you can't talk about your own

1640
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:41,280
strains

1641
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:43,380
um I know guys do it for whatever

1642
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,400
reasons and it just bugs me personally

1643
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:50,280
so I have to be able to be able to have

1644
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,380
a long drawn out conversation about

1645
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,660
exactly how it grows what the phenols

1646
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,880
look like that I found how they smell

1647
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:59,219
everything I can tell you everything

1648
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,358
about my strains because I grew them

1649
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:06,058
before you did not a tester

1650
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:08,279
nobody else I grew them before I ever

1651
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:10,440
thought about selling them to you so we

1652
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,540
can have whatever discussion you want to

1653
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,000
have about the plant and I can hopefully

1654
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:17,880
give you an informed answer I I should

1655
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,579
be able to because I've seen it

1656
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,240
um I mean that said though I we kind of

1657
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:26,880
want to open up a

1658
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,399
a testing program at soulfire we put an

1659
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,640
application on our website

1660
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:35,280
um for to take in some testers maybe

1661
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,259
like 30 but they have to be amazing like

1662
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:41,400
when I look at your picks they have to

1663
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:44,280
be that dope that you can be accepted so

1664
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,200
it'd be a high bar and then those things

1665
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,040
that they test

1666
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:49,019
um

1667
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,000
would probably I'm thinking about just

1668
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:53,940
doing it with one line right and then

1669
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,179
taking these applications

1670
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:59,338
picking say 30 testers and then dropping

1671
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:01,919
a line and calling it you know and

1672
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:03,000
labeling it Community tested and maybe

1673
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,139
they'll have a different price point

1674
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,940
like a little bit lower because

1675
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:07,739
obviously I'm not doing that work which

1676
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,440
is vital

1677
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:12,419
um and just trying that one time not an

1678
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,700
all the time thing but maybe one time

1679
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:16,740
have this community tested

1680
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:20,159
line drop I think that would be cool as

1681
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:22,739
like an interaction thing but outside of

1682
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,139
that nah I'm testing everything myself

1683
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:28,078
yeah it makes sense for a variety of

1684
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:29,759
reasons and especially for getting you

1685
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,619
know high quality photos of the end

1686
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,839
result and that's something which I

1687
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:36,298
think you along with a few other people

1688
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,798
really excel at and if there's anything

1689
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:39,659
we've learned from our chats with James

1690
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:42,000
Bean in the past it's the good photos

1691
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:44,399
sell packs so I guess I'm sort of

1692
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,858
wondering how much Focus do you place on

1693
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,599
getting good photos and what sort of a

1694
01:03:46,858 --> 01:03:50,578
setup do you use to get these photos are

1695
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,740
you using like a DSL like a high-end

1696
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:54,119
sort of camera or just like good quality

1697
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:56,098
phone

1698
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,500
I just use my iPhone

1699
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,359
I use my iPhone to take the uh the

1700
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,699
pictures when I do you know I'll just go

1701
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:04,019
into like 4K mode or whatever and just

1702
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:06,480
snap a picture

1703
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:10,019
and and that's really it and you know

1704
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,480
yeah I have a DSL camera and I bought

1705
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:14,818
like this badass DSL camera and macro

1706
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,380
lenses and all this [ __ ] but honestly

1707
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:18,298
there's so many different settings on

1708
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,780
there and like different

1709
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:23,219
apertures and f-stops and it's like I

1710
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:25,200
need to go back to college to take

1711
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:27,239
another course on how to use this damn

1712
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,739
camera and then when I take the pictures

1713
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,139
with the camera they don't come out any

1714
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,279
better than my iPhone so yeah I just

1715
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:34,798
stick to the iPhone

1716
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,119
yeah I mean it's sort of like good and

1717
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:37,619
bad we're at that point like it's good

1718
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,480
that you can just use your iPhone but it

1719
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:41,640
sucks that anyone who's got really good

1720
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,039
cameras it might not be given them that

1721
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:46,379
much better results and I I do want to

1722
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:47,579
touch on your days at University but I

1723
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,380
just want to squeeze in one question

1724
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,059
first which is sort of related to the

1725
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,640
photos we've seen a lot of people

1726
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,140
getting a lot of photos taken down by

1727
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,298
Instagram and some people even having

1728
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:59,639
their Pages banned and I guess what's

1729
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:01,559
sort of more notable is that this is

1730
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:03,480
occurring even in the case where like

1731
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,640
like yourself your legal business

1732
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,679
operating in a legal State just doesn't

1733
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:09,358
really make a lot of sense do you think

1734
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:12,000
this is a problem with as a community

1735
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:14,219
have to sort of address somehow and what

1736
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,119
do you think might be a solution

1737
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:19,980
first of all it sucks and a lot of it is

1738
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,240
Guy competition and guys telling on each

1739
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,019
other

1740
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,539
um

1741
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:26,338
for whatever reason and and that part of

1742
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:28,798
it is I'm not going to get me started

1743
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:32,279
out that part of it's despicable but I

1744
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,960
think until there's like some federal

1745
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,180
legislation

1746
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,318
this is going to keep happening and why

1747
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:40,798
is it going to keep happening because

1748
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:42,900
Instagram wants to get paid right I mean

1749
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,900
let's just be real that's what it's all

1750
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:49,500
about like they're not getting paid on

1751
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:51,720
cannabis guys marketing their stuff

1752
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,179
um on Instagram they can't sell you

1753
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:57,419
little ads they can't legally help you

1754
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:59,338
sell seeds so you know they're trying to

1755
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:01,139
bully us I mean that's basically what it

1756
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:03,838
is until they

1757
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:07,318
are able to make their money because

1758
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,759
Instagram's not free right I mean we it

1759
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:10,519
social media has been around long enough

1760
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,980
just because they let you use that app

1761
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:16,500
nothing's free like your time your data

1762
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:18,900
uh what you look at them using the

1763
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:22,679
algorithm to track you all that stuff is

1764
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:24,298
is how they get paid for that app and

1765
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:26,038
it's kind of like a free ride for

1766
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:29,759
cannabis guys right they don't get any

1767
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,920
money from us so until they do I think

1768
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,140
we're going to be in for this you know

1769
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,900
the persecution

1770
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:39,358
yeah great point and do you think that

1771
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,579
you know we see the rise of alternative

1772
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,739
social media platforms Focus for

1773
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:45,180
cannabis users do you think they'll take

1774
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:46,979
off or do you think ultimately Instagram

1775
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,078
will just change its rules and try to

1776
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,358
become profitable office

1777
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:53,160
I think ultimately Instagram will change

1778
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:55,500
his rules and try to become profitable

1779
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:57,239
of us I've popped into some of those I

1780
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:00,000
popped into burners like Social Club

1781
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:01,618
thing when it was up and instantly

1782
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,838
popped right out because there was some

1783
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:04,440
crazy [ __ ] on there

1784
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,380
um

1785
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,599
so you know I commend him for trying you

1786
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,519
know for trying to uh to make a

1787
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,859
different way because he was obviously

1788
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:16,019
sick of having his account taken down

1789
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:18,420
but I think he probably wasn't really

1790
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:21,239
ready for how much like you have to do

1791
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:23,760
to have one of those apps up and and

1792
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:25,558
police it properly but

1793
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,420
um yeah I think we're just stuck with

1794
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,940
Instagram for now I don't see a way out

1795
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,220
but I will say I did pop over to

1796
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,960
calculator's um Bean basement so he's

1797
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,779
kind of brought back that like forums

1798
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,059
thing and uh you know I just kind of

1799
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,280
lurked through there and was reading

1800
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:43,019
some of the the grow journals and

1801
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,380
whatnot and I thought that was it was

1802
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:48,480
pretty cool you know like I read um uh

1803
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,980
one of the guys that grew a banana runs

1804
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,440
I saw banana restaurant I was like okay

1805
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:54,539
let me check this guy's Journal out and

1806
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:57,298
his journal was so detailed from like

1807
01:07:54,539 --> 01:08:00,119
they they do it from the the start of

1808
01:07:57,298 --> 01:08:02,818
the seed pop all the way to the end of

1809
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:04,140
the plant so I don't know I thought that

1810
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:05,460
was kind of cool you know not that's

1811
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:07,139
obviously not Instagram where

1812
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,659
everybody's there and like liking and

1813
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:13,259
but much more like

1814
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:15,358
intimate with the the whole grow process

1815
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,920
and you know if

1816
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,818
yeah if you're into that kind of thing

1817
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,679
you should pop over and check that

1818
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:21,239
because I thought it was pretty cool

1819
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:23,460
yeah hugely I mean I guess we don't

1820
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:25,738
really see a lot of like dedicated grow

1821
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,319
journals and with the very nature of

1822
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:29,759
like the the feed that just flies by

1823
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,060
it's sort of hard to do it on Instagram

1824
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,798
in a sense but yeah it's cool and I mean

1825
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,179
I guess it makes me wonder you know do

1826
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:37,859
you think those forums will ever take

1827
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:39,960
off or it's more of a side thing for

1828
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,000
like the the hard cause

1829
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,798
nah it's the side thing for the hard

1830
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,659
course I think

1831
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:48,899
here's where I think things are going to

1832
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:50,039
go and I think everything's gonna go to

1833
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:52,379
Discord

1834
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,640
we have a we have a big Discord

1835
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,199
following

1836
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,500
um right now I mean not big I guess we

1837
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,338
got like a thousand guys or something

1838
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,159
um

1839
01:08:59,338 --> 01:09:04,140
I know Masonic has his own Discord but

1840
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:06,179
yeah uh

1841
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,560
Discord is where it's at because we can

1842
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:09,420
do all those things we're auctioning

1843
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,100
packs of seeds in there we're actually

1844
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:14,579
you know things that are hard to get

1845
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,239
from myself and from other breeders

1846
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:16,859
um

1847
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:18,479
and we're able to give you that

1848
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,060
one-on-one like you can ask questions

1849
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,919
directly to me or to other team members

1850
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,779
there's moderators in there making sure

1851
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,460
it's you know there's nobody in there

1852
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,620
saying things they shouldn't or posting

1853
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,698
things they shouldn't and I just think

1854
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:31,798
like

1855
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:36,298
if you're in this game right now you

1856
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:38,338
should be looking to to move your people

1857
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:40,579
also to Discord because if your

1858
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:42,960
Instagram goes down at least you have

1859
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:46,198
your community there

1860
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,759
yeah hugely everyone go go jump on the

1861
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:49,439

know to assist I mean it's it's pretty

1880
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,800
awesome so it's kind of like a mix of

1881
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,640
like almost like Instagram forums and

1882
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,159
like

1883
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:34,199
chat all together it's it's pretty cool

1884
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,698
yeah that you know what that's an

1885
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:38,460
interesting prediction and that's that's

1886
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:40,919
cool to hear so I mean let's just jump

1887
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,600
back a bit you you mentioned how you had

1888
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,158
your first grow going and you're growing

1889
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,260
things like TGA and whatnot I'm

1890
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,000
wondering at that time before you had

1891
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:49,860
really got the ball rolling on your own

1892
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,479
breedings were there any specific

1893
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:53,039
breeders who you sort of really looked

1894
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:54,419
up to or who you felt you learned the

1895
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,519
ropes from

1896
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:00,060
well

1897
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:02,940
I mean obviously I I learned a lot from

1898
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:05,880
from watching those TGA videos and then

1899
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:07,919
the homeboys from here in White Center

1900
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,480
um growing up I mean they didn't know

1901
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,920
what they were doing at all they were

1902
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:12,658
just doing things just for seed like

1903
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,880
there's no money in it there wasn't no

1904
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:17,099
reason to do it except for ourselves and

1905
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,840
then uh and then just Mike you know like

1906
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,659
being around Mike

1907
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:25,260
um while he was taken off like he

1908
01:11:21,658 --> 01:11:28,079
started exotic and I went to University

1909
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:30,000
um and just being around that uh the

1910
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:33,479
entire time like a lot of times we joke

1911
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,359
that our style of growing I watched a

1912
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:39,178
lot of kung fu movies as like a kid

1913
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:40,799
um and it's almost like a Kung Fu style

1914
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:42,960
you know there's a bunch of different

1915
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,520
ways to grow a pot there's a bunch of

1916
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,880
different ways to do things and that

1917
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:51,600
doesn't none of them are are wrong per

1918
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:56,159
se but in our crew we have a specific

1919
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:58,320
style that we grow and yeah and it's

1920
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:00,960
cool to be part of that it's cool though

1921
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:02,340
to be in a group of individuals that you

1922
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,520
know I mean Mike's got a big facility

1923
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:07,500
now I know he he uses uh trellis and

1924
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,820
[ __ ] to but I know he misses staking up

1925
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,399
all those [ __ ] plants because that's

1926
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:13,259
part of our that's part of our our style

1927
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:16,859
like staking up everything you see it in

1928
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:19,860
our pictures a lot we use bamboo steaks

1929
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:21,719
um yeah so yeah I think being around him

1930
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:24,299
being around I mean he's a giant in the

1931
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,679
game like you can't deny him so

1932
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,900
um just all the things I've learned from

1933
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,060
him and and the people around us I think

1934
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:32,698
really shaped it

1935
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:34,440
yeah great answer great answer and you

1936
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:36,719
sort of referenced it in some prior

1937
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:37,979
answers but I'd love to know a little

1938
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,960
more you know like you went to

1939
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:41,939
University and you did a bachelor of

1940
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,679
genetics how do you feel like that's

1941
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:44,879
impacted on your growing and your

1942
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,440
breeding do you think it's sort of

1943
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,000
beneficial and something you might

1944
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:49,799
recommend others sort of look into if

1945
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,899
they're interested

1946
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,640
uh yeah so I went to the University of

1947
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:55,500
Washington here in Seattle I mean it's a

1948
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,079
it's an amazing

1949
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,179
um public uh University it's one of the

1950
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:04,979
best in science like it's number one in

1951
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:07,560
for Family Medicine so uh it's Top Notch

1952
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:09,539
as far as as far as universities go in

1953
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,820
my opinion go dogs

1954
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:13,738
um

1955
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:14,579
I graduated with my bachelor's of

1956
01:13:13,738 --> 01:13:18,119
science

1957
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:21,539
I don't I wouldn't say that it like

1958
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:24,059
really helped my breathing like a whole

1959
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:25,920
bunch so what it did is it gave me like

1960
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:29,159
a way to think

1961
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:31,020
um it rounded me out for sure like as a

1962
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:33,599
as a person

1963
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:36,540
uh I feel like being in those groups and

1964
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,179
and working through problems and failing

1965
01:13:36,539 --> 01:13:40,859
failing [ __ ] ochem

1966
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:42,779
um and going back and like doing it

1967
01:13:40,859 --> 01:13:45,779
again you know

1968
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:47,279
um it just it it really brings that that

1969
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:48,899
resolve to the table like you're not

1970
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:52,380
gonna quit you're gonna you're gonna do

1971
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:55,279
this [ __ ] regardless I mean dude I'm I'm

1972
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:58,260
just a a kid from the hood man from a

1973
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,840
broke ass part of a town you know just

1974
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:03,060
raised by my by my mom Brothers in the

1975
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,940
[ __ ] in the joint

1976
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:07,199
and I got I have kids too so I wanted to

1977
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:08,939
show them like

1978
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:10,979
hey man you know

1979
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:12,839
I if I can do this you can do this if I

1980
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:15,178
can pass oh Cam you can you can

1981
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:18,659
definitely pass ocam if I can pass a

1982
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:20,460
genome you can do it and um

1983
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:22,319
I don't know I just loved it I loved

1984
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,679
learning that stuff I don't think that

1985
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:29,039
it help helps me be a better breeder

1986
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:31,859
except it helps me to solve problems not

1987
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,359
quit and just like really stick to like

1988
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:34,619
a protocol

1989
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:37,500
um I guess that's what I learned in the

1990
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:39,479
lab I worked under I think some of the

1991
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:43,198
most Brilliant Minds

1992
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:45,658
um in plant biology like uh I worked in

1993
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:50,460
a in a plant lab with this professor

1994
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:52,439
Taco uh this Japanese guy from uh the

1995
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,539
University of Washington he was just so

1996
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:57,299
smart like we were doing tissue culture

1997
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:58,619
and like what hopefully I can talk about

1998
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,960
this I'm sure they already released

1999
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:03,300
their paper but they were

2000
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,980
um working on the Circadian clocks of

2001
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:10,619
arabidopsis and able to to make them uh

2002
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:12,658
better pollinators or get pollinated

2003
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:14,340
better by moths and it was just super

2004
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:16,079
interesting you know like like what they

2005
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,699
were doing in there so I got to learn a

2006
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:19,800
lot there I know the lady above us was

2007
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:20,658
like even doing cooler stuff like she

2008
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,460
was

2009
01:15:20,658 --> 01:15:25,439
genetically engineering plans to be able

2010
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:27,658
to have stomas on the bottoms of the

2011
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,779
leaves like add them or remove them

2012
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:33,119
which I mean that's I mean think about

2013
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:36,119
that like you can make a plant not lose

2014
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,738
water as quickly and could like you

2015
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:39,840
could grow maybe corn and like a much

2016
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:43,079
more arid area or desert or something

2017
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,239
and they wouldn't die so I don't know

2018
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:48,300
it's just I love the university I loved

2019
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:51,718
my time there uh I'm proud of myself for

2020
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:54,179
for graduating and sticking it out and

2021
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:57,060
when people ask me like

2022
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:58,980
you know should I go there I'm I want to

2023
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,239
get into cannabis should I go there I

2024
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:03,839
always say you should just go there

2025
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:06,419
because of the experience and and

2026
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,400
what you learn about yourself and about

2027
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,880
how working with other people and

2028
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:14,579
and you know how science works you know

2029
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,859
I love physics too and yeah I just love

2030
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:18,840
the whole thing really yeah that's so

2031
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:21,359
awesome to hear I'm glad you felt like

2032
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,100
it was it was beneficial and likewise

2033
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:24,719
encourage everyone you know get amongst

2034
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,460
to get yourself a Bachelor of Science if

2035
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,500
you're into it it sort of makes me

2036
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:30,239
wonder how does it feel to have this

2037
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:33,238
sort of very formal scientific

2038
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,738
background and yet to be on Instagram at

2039
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:36,599
times and you know you look at other

2040
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:39,000
Growers and you sometimes see some

2041
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:41,340
Highly Questionable slash maybe even

2042
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,779
pseudoscience about maybe growing or

2043
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,760
just in general you know do you just

2044
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:46,019
have to sort of ignore it at times or

2045
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,000
what's your take

2046
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:50,640
yeah I gotta bite my tongue sometimes

2047
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,920
like I just I don't like the Bro Science

2048
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,020
you know what I mean where because you

2049
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,719
saw something maybe happen one time in

2050
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:01,140
your garden that does not make it a

2051
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:04,739
scientific fact that's actually like you

2052
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:06,420
know I just it it irritates me but I

2053
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:07,500
just leave it to what it is I mean we're

2054
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:09,480
all

2055
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:13,260
doing the best we can it's this is

2056
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:15,899
mostly a game of of selection it's it's

2057
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,739
a lot of art to it

2058
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:19,019
um

2059
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:21,539
you know and the scientists really

2060
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:24,120
haven't got in the game yet and I'm a

2061
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:27,840
little nervous for when they do

2062
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:32,340
um so right now this is more akin to

2063
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:34,260
breeding dogs than it is to

2064
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:36,659
you know genetically engineering a plant

2065
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:40,380
to be the very best plant on the planet

2066
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:43,500
which they can do so

2067
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:45,480
you know I don't know it's it's an art

2068
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,219
to me more than it's like this hardcore

2069
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:50,639
science

2070
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:52,679
um where people are

2071
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,420
people are paying for the art people are

2072
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:57,840
paying for your eye for your selection

2073
01:17:54,420 --> 01:18:00,300
and then for your your work making sure

2074
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,619
that that your your selection and your

2075
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,239
eye comes through

2076
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:06,359
so I look at these guys more or less

2077
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:08,579
artists than I do as scientists so yeah

2078
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:11,158
look you you raised a brilliant

2079
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:13,439
discussion there in that you know like

2080
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:15,658
fundamentally do you think the braiding

2081
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,000
is more of an art than a science in the

2082
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:20,099
sense that do you think one day we'll be

2083
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,719
able to like program a computer to be

2084
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,640
like a better breeder than a human or do

2085
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:26,100
you think it'll always have a sort of an

2086
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,140
element of like that feeling you get

2087
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,640
when an experienced breeder like looks

2088
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,420
at a certain planet is like that's the

2089
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,140
one

2090
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:36,060
yeah I think it's I think it's art and

2091
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,679
you know maybe a computer maybe the

2092
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:39,179
crisper will come into play at some

2093
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,340
point but

2094
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:43,500
um not right now I think it's I think

2095
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:47,039
it's completely art like uh even in this

2096
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:51,060
last in this Bahama Mama lineup I did a

2097
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:53,819
a collab with a a local graffiti artist

2098
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:55,140
um the name creature panic and he I

2099
01:18:53,819 --> 01:18:58,920
didn't even know the guy you know I just

2100

overpass it's up on science it's

2107
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:15,539
everywhere right and to the point where

2108
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:17,459
like when I'm driving around or when the

2109
01:19:15,539 --> 01:19:18,658
homies or with my kids or something like

2110
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,640

another bear there's another bear over

2112
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,179
there so I tracked the guy down on

2113
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:25,259
Instagram I found some other graffiti

2114
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:26,699

2117
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:33,719
and I was like hey man you wanna you

2118
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,880

2119
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:37,439
was like I really enjoy your the bear

2120
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,300
that I see everywhere you know it kind

2121
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,460
of [ __ ] makes me happy when I see it

2122
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,980
for whatever weird reason and he was

2123
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:46,980
like hell yeah let's do this so

2124
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:49,738
um he did the box art and then we we uh

2125
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:52,259
have a sticker for that's in there of

2126
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:53,339
that bear and you know if you get that

2127
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:56,039
strain

2128
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:57,840
um uh this month I don't even know how

2129
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:00,238
many of them we saw quite a bit I'm

2130
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,940
gonna buy a a can of spray paint for him

2131
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:04,259
for every box that we sell so and I'm

2132
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:05,939
gonna pull up in my truck and give them

2133
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:10,860
this pallet of spray paint so he could

2134
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:13,079
[ __ ] Seattle up so uh you know and and

2135
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:14,939
the reason I did that is because in that

2136
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:17,399
box of seeds you get

2137
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:20,039
two pieces of art from Seattle you get

2138
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:22,079
the soulfire art which is in my seeds

2139
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:24,179
and you get that little that that

2140
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:26,399
graffiti art from Creature panic and

2141
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:29,460
that's just because I feel like you know

2142
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,960
it's breeding and graffiti are just two

2143
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:34,500
subcultures

2144
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,460
of of Seattle or of of American art you

2145
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,619
know

2146
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,480
uh breeding in

2147
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:41,158
and graffiti it's just it's just two

2148
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:43,139
forms of Art

2149
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:44,759
yeah look thanks for bringing that up

2150
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,260
because I was going to ask about that so

2151
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,060
you you saved me the effort and that's

2152
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:50,159
really cool to hear that you're you know

2153
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,140
collaborating with other artists even in

2154
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:55,079
a sort of less than conventional sense

2155
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:56,760
and I was hoping to ask you do you have

2156
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:58,619
any other of these sort of more

2157
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,159
interesting slightly left of filled

2158
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:04,319
co-labs like you know shoe collabs like

2159
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,119
stuff like that or even just the more

2160
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,399
standard ones breed a breed of collabs

2161
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:10,800
what can we expect in the future

2162
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,299
yeah well I love doing I love working

2163
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,679
with other breeders

2164
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:19,140
um you know if if it's tight you know I

2165
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:21,300
I love um doing that and definitely

2166
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:23,760
gonna have some more

2167
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,560
uh collabs that are outside of the realm

2168
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,119
of cannabis um

2169
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,340
I just don't know exactly what they are

2170
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:30,359
yet I mean they they got a fit with what

2171
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,800
we're doing and they got to have a

2172
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:34,500
purpose in it it just really worked well

2173
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,820
with creature panic because um you know

2174
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,719
These Guys these graffiti guys man

2175
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:38,519
they're going out there and they hang

2176
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,658
their ass on the on the line

2177
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,219
um and they don't get anything for it

2178
01:21:39,658 --> 01:21:43,198
they do it for the culture man you know

2179
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:45,239
they do it for they do it for the love

2180
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,399

do too I I do it because I love it and

2182
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:52,619

2183
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:55,198
so I had I had to track him down and get

2184
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:59,519

2185
01:21:55,198 --> 01:22:02,519

2189
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:13,079

2192
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:20,759
so we were just doing the whole show

2193
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,739
circuit just shaking hands uh you know

2194

2198
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,940
um and that was it and that's really

2199
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,960
what launched it and it was like just

2200
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:39,599
people loved the the line that's where

2201
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,480
the Don Mega came from the the work was

2202
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,280
all very very stable and uh it just kind

2203
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,839
of took off from there you know like I

2204
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:47,399
said just talking to absolutely

2205
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,340
everybody who

2206
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:52,738
who grew our grow strains

2207
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,840
yeah and I noticed the brand has like

2208
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:56,579
the slogan arise with the Phoenix and

2209
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,920
it's called slogan you don't see a lot

2210
01:22:56,579 --> 01:23:00,658
of brands with slogan what does that

2211
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,658
sort of mean to you and where did the

2212
01:23:00,658 --> 01:23:05,759
name soulfire itself come from

2213
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:10,379
um so soulfire kind of came from uh Mike

2214
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:12,600
and I had a glass shop in in Seattle so

2215
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:15,000
we were selling like uh bongs and [ __ ]

2216
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,280
for a while there and that was the name

2217
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,960
of our our glass shop and it just kind

2218
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,000
of stuck with me I came up with it for

2219
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,260
the glass shop and then and then the

2220
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,039
slogan which wasn't part of the glass

2221
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,300
shop

2222
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:27,238
um

2223
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:30,480
it uh it just kind of

2224
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:33,959
the Phoenix you know represents rebirth

2225
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,339
anyway and what better of an icon

2226
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,840
um than that for like a seed company

2227
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:38,520
right because every one of those seeds

2228
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,980
is potential every one of those seeds is

2229
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:42,360
rebirth so that's where the Phoenix part

2230
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:44,759
of it came from and the rise of the

2231
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,319
Phoenix is just kind of like you know

2232
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:49,020
our ethos I mean that's just kind of how

2233
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,939
we think like you're you're right we

2234
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,760
want you to rise we want you to do well

2235
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:55,619
our whole

2236
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,960
goal is to see you crush it nothing

2237
01:23:55,619 --> 01:24:00,179
makes me happier than to have somebody

2238
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,640
hop in the DM show me their plant and be

2239
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:04,679
like Soul fire look at this crazy [ __ ] I

2240
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,039
just grew and then I you know I love

2241
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:09,300
that [ __ ] I basically live for it so

2242
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:12,359
um and that's Rising with the Phoenix

2243
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:15,840
man every time I see that uh or see

2244
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:18,059
people happy because of the genetics

2245
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,619
you're growing that's that's where that

2246
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,780
came from I Love It

2247
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:23,399
yeah that's that's so cool to know that

2248
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:24,899
you had like this glass shop and that

2249
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:27,299
it's all sort of even further

2250
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:30,059
intertwined back with Mike than what at

2251
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:32,039
least I previously knew oh dude it was a

2252
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:34,260
nightmare man the glass shop was like in

2253
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:35,519
the uh so like I said our neighborhood

2254
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:37,560
right here White Center is a rough

2255
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,880
neighborhood as far as Seattle goes

2256
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:41,400
right

2257
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:43,440
um it's just a nightmare man like people

2258
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:45,059
were [ __ ] breaking in we're having

2259
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,500
all these problems eventually we had to

2260
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:50,760
shut it down man they just can't let you

2261
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:53,279
have nice [ __ ] but uh it was a it was a

2262
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:56,219
fun time definitely back in the day

2263
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:58,198
yeah that's cool and I mean I'm sure you

2264
01:24:56,219 --> 01:25:00,539
are smoking lots of cool stuff back in

2265
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:02,399
the day are there any old school cuts

2266
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:04,439
that you have particularly fond memories

2267
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,839
of maybe ones you can't get access to

2268
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:09,419
anymore and and if so what's some of the

2269
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,940
ones you would love to get back

2270
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,819
yeah I mean well obviously the Flav like

2271
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:16,919
we missed that we had a a grape God that

2272
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:18,420
smelled like it was very similar to how

2273
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,800
that Str you know that strawberry jelly

2274
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,539
is where it had like this fake grape

2275
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,300
smell I feel like I'm constantly

2276
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:27,179
searching for like a fake grape

2277
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:28,860
um I'm you know I I think I have some uh

2278
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:30,840
bloomco's um

2279
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:32,819
grape cream or something like that I'm

2280
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,140
gonna pop some of those or whatever's

2281
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:36,119
grape something I'm gonna pop some of

2282
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,679
those and go through uh some of his work

2283
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:39,479
because I see a lot of his stuff it

2284
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,560
looks interesting

2285
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:42,899
um

2286
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,400
that and blueberry like we used to have

2287
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:46,559
this blueberry cut that would it was a

2288
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:49,439
super it was like a [ __ ] to root can't

2289
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,880
seem to ever get a that blueberry smell

2290
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:53,698
or it's just not that popular anymore

2291
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:56,520
right but I used to like it so I guess

2292
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:58,619
that if I had to answer yeah nice look

2293
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:01,260
is that does that happen to be the one

2294
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:02,579
that Mike used a few times or he had

2295
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,139
some crosses where it was like old

2296
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:06,359
blueberry and that you don't really see

2297
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:09,900
it anymore is that maybe related

2298
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:11,639
yeah that is the cut like he he had a

2299
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:13,679
really we had a really good blueberry

2300
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:15,179
back in the day and I know he used it in

2301
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,619
some of his crosses like in the early

2302
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:17,760
Works

2303
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,679
um

2304
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,780
and yeah and it's just gone I mean

2305
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,100
that's kind of like the story right like

2306
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:25,139
we have these

2307
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:27,239
sometimes amazing cuts that we wish we

2308
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:28,859
still had like that that flave and the

2309
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:31,919
Grape God and

2310
01:26:28,859 --> 01:26:33,359
yeah there's a lot of them really yeah

2311
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,179
wow that's really cool that's really

2312
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:38,219
cool to hear so I'm Keen to chat about

2313
01:26:36,179 --> 01:26:39,899
some of your releases that have come out

2314
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:42,300
but before we do that I want to quickly

2315
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:44,519
glance to the Future For a Moment what's

2316
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:46,199
on the horizon for soulfire what's the

2317
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,739
next big project you're looking to sink

2318
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:48,738
your teeth into

2319
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:55,020
um well I've I've already kind of

2320
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:56,399
started to formulate uh the next project

2321
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,500
but I don't want to talk about it too

2322
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,779
much yet until we're

2323
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:03,840
until we're there so

2324
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:06,179
um I think maybe that Community uh

2325
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,039
testing that Community project I think

2326
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:11,279
that might be something coming up where

2327
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:12,359
if I can iron it out uh I'd like to do

2328
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,579
something like that because I have so

2329
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:16,319
much fun testing our stuff it would be

2330
01:27:14,579 --> 01:27:18,238
fun to do like some sort of interactive

2331
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:19,920
like where we send them out to our our

2332
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:22,198
few testers and they

2333
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,819
they run them down but again it it

2334
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:27,599
wouldn't be like something that we do

2335
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:28,319
all the time or I I just don't know so

2336
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,679
um

2337
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,880
yeah a community test project that that

2338
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,460
would be fun

2339
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,980
um yeah I don't know we got a lot of

2340
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:40,198
stuff coming really just takes time it

2341
01:27:37,979 --> 01:27:42,419
takes we just people say the whole time

2342
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:43,678
when's your next drop or when when is

2343
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:45,060
that new stuff going to come or banks

2344
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,579
are like where's the drops at bro I'm

2345
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:49,260
just like hey don't don't rush it man

2346
01:27:47,579 --> 01:27:52,979
because we don't do it like that you

2347
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:56,100
know yeah sure okay well look if we go

2348
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:58,079
back I was looking at the banana fire

2349
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,000
cookies from Relentless genetics that

2350
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:01,500
you used initially to do the black

2351
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,380
banana cookies

2352
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:06,840
and I was sort of curious as to what was

2353
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,400
it about those genetics that Drew you to

2354
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,679
it initially and thought you know let's

2355
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:13,319
make a line using this

2356
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,719
yeah it was awesome I mean it just it

2357
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:17,340
had that banana smell to it but it had

2358
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:18,600
the cookie structure and I'm just drawn

2359
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,719
to that like we were talking about that

2360
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:24,060
banana smell early and

2361
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:27,658
um I was like I like this you know and I

2362
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:29,940
I you know I loved it and I I hit him up

2363
01:28:27,658 --> 01:28:32,339
and I asked permission

2364
01:28:29,939 --> 01:28:35,339
um to use it you know and he said go

2365
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:38,400
ahead so uh

2366
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:39,659
yeah yeah I I just it just checked all

2367
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:41,579
the boxes

2368
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:45,000
and then

2369
01:28:41,579 --> 01:28:48,179
uh I went through all the progeny I grew

2370
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,658
out all the Prodigy before I landed on

2371
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:54,420
that the the Black Banana so there was

2372
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:55,138
quite a bit of

2373
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:58,039
um

2374
01:28:55,139 --> 01:29:03,060
I would say testing and second guessing

2375
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:05,698
and OCD perfectionism that tends to

2376
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:08,159
mire me down sometimes

2377
01:29:05,698 --> 01:29:09,779
some things that may be awesome to some

2378
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:11,939
people will just get thrown out by me

2379
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:13,198
like oh no I don't like it but but it

2380
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:15,238
was actually awesome

2381
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:17,158
you know so that's just a personal

2382
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:19,439
problem

2383
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:21,899
yeah look the problem I think many of us

2384
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:24,719
have faced before when you when you bred

2385
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:26,759
the f2s of the Black Banana was there

2386
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,279
any specific traits you were looking to

2387
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,800
sort of hone in on

2388
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:33,719
yeah I was trying to narrow it to try to

2389
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,760
bring that the jeans down a little bit

2390
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:38,340
and narrow it and also

2391
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,440
um because I was using you know a stream

2392
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:44,039
from Relentless I didn't want to release

2393
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:44,939
the F ones I still have all the f1s from

2394
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:47,639
that

2395
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:50,158
um so I wanted to

2396
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:52,500
have it be my own you know a step

2397
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,000
further in my own selection

2398
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,340
so that's why

2399
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,619
you can only get black banana F2 you

2400
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,139
you'll never get the F1

2401
01:29:58,619 --> 01:30:02,819
and is that sort of like a concept do

2402
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:04,380
you think you'll use going forward or

2403
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:05,880
more just in this case it was the

2404
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,100
appropriate thing

2405
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,420
uh just in this case because you know I

2406
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:11,100
used his work even though he gave

2407
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:13,679
permission I didn't want to just take

2408
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:15,659
his mail and cross it with you know and

2409
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:20,158
then release it now I wanted to take it

2410
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:22,679
the next step of of my own selection

2411
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:24,899
sure so I mean when you're looking to

2412
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,060
select a male for the next generation of

2413
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:29,279
breeding are there any particular traits

2414
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:30,960
that you look for or think are you know

2415
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:32,039
sort of synonymous with a good quality

2416
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,260
mail

2417
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:37,019
uh yeah there's a bunch of different I

2418
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:41,340
mean I have a checklist of things I go

2419
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:45,120
through on a male and before it's like

2420
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:46,500
the one so it's really

2421
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:48,238
uh there's just a lot of different

2422
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:50,158
things you know the leaf structure the

2423
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:52,500
way the plants lining up you know I've

2424
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,179
heard some guys talk about reversing a

2425
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,579
male to see what it looks like I've

2426
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:59,039
never done that personally but I want to

2427
01:30:56,579 --> 01:31:01,559
I think it'd be interesting to do

2428
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:03,238
yeah that I think that would be hugely

2429
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,340
cool wouldn't it

2430
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:07,678
um so I mean it sort of gets us to this

2431
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,779
place where we normally ask the Growers

2432
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,579
about what style of growing they do but

2433
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:13,859
you're so very transparent on your

2434
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:15,600
Instagram about it it's probably easily

2435
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:17,039
known by most people listening but for

2436
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,960
the sake of it if anyone hasn't checked

2437
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:20,880
out your Instagram what style of growing

2438
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,980
do you utilize and uh do you have any

2439
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,420
tips on you know how people can get the

2440
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:26,459
best results out of growing your

2441
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:29,520
Australians

2442
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:32,279
uh okay so for me and this is you know

2443
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,719
kind of going back to our our style we

2444
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:37,380
use

2445
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:39,000
um we use pro-mix HP for the medium it's

2446
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,560
kind of like an inert dirt right it's

2447
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,880
like a soil that doesn't really have

2448
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,159
nutrients or anything like that it's

2449
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,020
like kind of a peat based

2450
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:47,399
uh with a little bit of perlite and

2451
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,600
stuff in there so

2452
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:49,500
um I don't add it it just comes like

2453
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,440
that

2454
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:54,658
um so I love that medium one because

2455
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:56,879
it's not too water locky it doesn't it

2456
01:31:54,658 --> 01:32:00,359
lets me get that water in get the

2457
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:04,139
nutrients in and it just doesn't hold

2458
01:32:00,359 --> 01:32:05,579
the water for too long so it allows me

2459
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:07,980
to pound them

2460
01:32:05,579 --> 01:32:10,380
um if I need to so

2461
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:11,698
um I use that and then size a pot it

2462
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:12,900
just varies depending on what I'm trying

2463
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:14,519
to do

2464
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:16,679
um I like to give my plant structure

2465
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,260
mistakes so like in my pictures you may

2466
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:20,699
notice that I I use bamboo Stakes which

2467
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,820
is can be a [ __ ] when we're talking

2468
01:32:20,698 --> 01:32:26,819
about hundreds of plants but uh that's

2469
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:27,840
how that's how I like to do it

2470
01:32:26,819 --> 01:32:32,039
um

2471
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:34,440
than as far as nutrients I use House and

2472
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:38,760
Garden I've used House and Garden for

2473
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:43,198
ever so I'm over a decade there

2474
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:44,760
amazing newts I I think it makes uh I'll

2475
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:46,019
see a guy grow with something else and

2476
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,340
I'll be like dude why don't you just go

2477
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,320
ahead and use House and Garden here's

2478
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:52,079
how I use it and how I use it is exactly

2479
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:54,000
how they have on the um on their little

2480
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:57,479
feed scale so I don't go aggressive but

2481
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,420
uh I just use the housing Garden I use

2482
01:32:57,479 --> 01:33:02,399
uh the aquaflakes with my for the a b

2483
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:03,500
part of it

2484
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:08,579
um

2485
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:10,619
and this last run the guys from Power SI

2486
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:12,059
or whatever they sent me some and I saw

2487
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:14,939
the hype around and I was like you know

2488
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:16,500
I'll give it a shot the [ __ ] was amazing

2489
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:19,379
like I didn't have to bring in those

2490
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:21,600
bamboo Stakes till way later in the game

2491
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:23,279
um and I I really saw a benefit from

2492
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,699
using it a lot of times guys will send

2493
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:28,259
me products I'll give them a shot and I

2494
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:31,019
just don't see any change you know what

2495
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:33,420
I mean so no I'm not gonna use that I

2496
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,860
like to use things that I see a direct

2497
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,639
change

2498
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,979
um

2499
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:39,420
and in house with House and Garden you

2500
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,799
can you can see that like when you hit

2501
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:43,800
week six and you use their shooting

2502
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,020
powder I tell guys this all the time you

2503
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,980
use your shooting powder you go in your

2504
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:53,460
room the next day you see a change like

2505
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:55,259
a marked change so um yeah I can't say

2506
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:58,079
say enough good things about House and

2507
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:00,719
Garden and uh I really like the power or

2508
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,760
Si I think is how you say it

2509
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,880
um other than that this was my first run

2510
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:09,119
with LEDs really impressed uh with the

2511
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:10,800
LEDs I might never go back

2512
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,479
um that's about it man that's

2513
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,520
comprehensive and I tell you what you've

2514
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,019
now got me wondering is it power SI or

2515
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,580
what would the alternative be like power

2516
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:19,520
C

2517
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:22,139
oh I don't know I mean

2518
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,900
it's it's I mean they're using the

2519
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:27,239
periodic table for silica right so is it

2520
01:34:24,899 --> 01:34:31,379
do you just call it power silica I don't

2521
01:34:27,238 --> 01:34:32,819
know but great guys I mean they they uh

2522
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:34,079
sent me so they're hitting me up and

2523
01:34:32,819 --> 01:34:36,299
they're like hey you want to give this a

2524
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:39,300
shot I was like yeah they sent it it

2525
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,739
took me a long time to um to use it

2526
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,300
because I was like making seeds so I

2527
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:44,099
didn't want to use it well as we could

2528
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:46,920
see it's because there's really nothing

2529
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:48,780
to to show or see or whatever so

2530
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,219
they didn't like hit me up like hey are

2531
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:52,920
you using that stuff or if they didn't

2532
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:53,819
bug me or anything and then uh that I

2533
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,500
told him I was like you know what I'm

2534
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:57,299
gonna I'm gonna use it for this test so

2535
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,158
just stay tuned and we'll see you know

2536
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,100
we'll see how it is

2537
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:05,399
um I know uh my buddy Miss Jackson Co I

2538
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:07,440
I saw him using it I saw uh cush Forest

2539
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:09,359
over in Boston using it and I was just

2540
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:13,379
like yeah man let's go let's go for it

2541
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:15,539
and I like it I like it yeah nice nice

2542
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:18,600
and I mean an ongoing discussion we have

2543
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:21,420
on the show is organic and non-organic

2544
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,340
do you feel like the style of growing

2545
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:25,679
you use ultimately affects the end

2546
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:28,500
product in the way that it's sometimes

2547
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:31,260
made out I know that like I'm a die-hard

2548
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:33,479
sort of Organics guy but I also

2549
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:36,539
recognize that at like the very Pinnacle

2550
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:38,579
I it can get hard to to see the

2551
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:40,439
difference though I I like organic I

2552
01:35:38,579 --> 01:35:43,738
guess at the end of the day do you feel

2553
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:45,119
like if you grow a well-grown product it

2554
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:49,319
makes a difference or do you think

2555
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:51,179
there's like a bit of bias from people

2556
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:53,759
um I think there's I think as long as

2557
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:55,679
you as long as you have a well-grown

2558
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,300
product I think you're good

2559
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,399
um I think people bring in their own

2560
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:01,260
biases if you've ever went to like a

2561
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:03,599
grow store or whatever and like waited

2562
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:05,400
in line and like four or five different

2563
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,500
people will give you different advice on

2564
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:11,339
what is the best thing in the world to

2565
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:13,020
use right so I you know it's to each

2566
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,420
their own there's a bunch of different

2567
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:17,280
ways to get to the finish line there's a

2568
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:19,560
that doesn't make any one of them the

2569
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:21,840
right way or the wrong way it's like

2570
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,179
we're all from different uh we're all

2571
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,800
from different dojos we're all from

2572
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:27,840
different styles right we all have our

2573
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:30,239
style you may have the crouching tiger

2574
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:33,119
style I might have the Crane style

2575
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:35,579
um it doesn't it doesn't change it one

2576
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:37,439
bit I I've smoked organic and I I

2577
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:39,238
thought it was tight and I definitely

2578
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,158
like mine so

2579
01:36:39,238 --> 01:36:43,500
um it could be

2580
01:36:41,158 --> 01:36:44,279
yeah everybody has their own biases I

2581
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,560
guess

2582
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:47,759
yeah sure and I mean it makes sense

2583
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,460
makes sense

2584
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,679
so if we move now on to some of your

2585
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:54,960
work I mean many of your Australians are

2586
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:56,579
very interesting for a variety of

2587
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:00,239
reasons so the first one that grabbed my

2588
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:03,059
eye was the green which you use the Lil

2589
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:04,799
value OG and I guess I was particularly

2590
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,600
interested in the Little Valley oh gee

2591
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,219
I'd never heard of it before is there

2592
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,199
any backstory on it and what's it sort

2593
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:13,319
of like on its own

2594
01:37:10,198 --> 01:37:14,219
yeah so the Little Valley OG came to me

2595
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:16,439
from

2596
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:19,920
um my homeboy Duke over in Yakima so

2597
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:21,839
Yakima is a small town over on the uh

2598
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,579
the east side of Washington so

2599
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,520
Washington is kind of divided by this

2600
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:29,179
mountain range where over in Seattle on

2601
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:32,000
the western side it's kind of rainy and

2602
01:37:29,179 --> 01:37:34,079
more I don't know North Westy and then

2603
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,179
on oh on the other side of that mountain

2604
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:39,179
range is more like desert and hot over

2605
01:37:36,179 --> 01:37:40,440
there right so anyway my my homeboy

2606
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:42,779
lives over there and he's always telling

2607
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:45,479
me about this this uh OG plant they got

2608
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:47,819
over there and I was like okay and then

2609
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:49,439
he he had came over to our side for for

2610
01:37:47,819 --> 01:37:52,198
a night we were playing dominoes and

2611
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:54,539
[ __ ] and uh I smoke some and I smelled

2612
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:58,259
some and I was like oh that is like old

2613
01:37:54,539 --> 01:38:00,779
school like OG like that [ __ ] is tight

2614
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,820
go ahead and bring me three of those

2615
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:04,319
things I need to grow them out dude my

2616
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:06,420
homeboy's name is Duke he's like okay I

2617
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:09,238
got you I got you so he brings him over

2618
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:12,600
I grow them out and it's like it's got

2619
01:38:09,238 --> 01:38:15,059
that structure that stick and ball OG

2620
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,400
structure and then that just that smell

2621
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:19,620
and I was like this is gas like this is

2622
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:21,359
real gas and they didn't really know

2623
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:22,859
what it was you know they don't they

2624
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:24,658
just know it was like the OG that they

2625
01:38:22,859 --> 01:38:26,279
love so we just called it Little Valley

2626
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:28,079
OG because it didn't really have a name

2627
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:30,479
and they're from a little Valley over

2628
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:31,079
there in in Yakima

2629
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:34,379
um

2630
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:36,840
so shout out to the 509 and Yakima Duke

2631
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,819
and and to the Little Valley OG which is

2632
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,020
one of the gaseous strains I've probably

2633
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:42,179
ever come across

2634
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,860
nice I like that I mean there's I think

2635
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:45,000
everyone has a few ogs that they've

2636
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:46,738
tried throughout history and they're

2637
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,960
like if only I knew which one that was

2638
01:38:46,738 --> 01:38:51,539
right like they're so like they're

2639
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:54,719
mysterious but like these guys over

2640
01:38:51,539 --> 01:38:56,219
there in that area they like that flavor

2641
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:58,679
profile

2642
01:38:56,219 --> 01:39:00,899
um much more than like fruit and [ __ ]

2643
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:03,600
like I saw I got them some packs of like

2644
01:39:00,899 --> 01:39:05,039
uh Trump cookies maybe back in the day

2645
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,600
and they're like yeah we don't like this

2646
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:09,840
[ __ ] it smells like perfume like where's

2647
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:11,219
the OG at you know just old school

2648
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,699
gangsters I said they don't want those

2649
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:17,399
they want that they want that virgin gas

2650
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:19,799
yeah okay well musty mojito that's

2651
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:22,559
another interesting strain where you use

2652
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,179
the Grim bastard OG as the male in it

2653
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,580
and I I guess you know seeing as we're

2654
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:28,380
sort of discussing it where does OG fit

2655
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:30,059
in the Arsenal for you you know like are

2656
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:32,039
you a big fan of the gas and do you like

2657
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:36,360
to breed with OG

2658
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:38,460
um I do I mean I am a fan of the gas I I

2659
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:40,619
think we're kind of it's kind of getting

2660
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:42,719
harder to find as we get all these poly

2661
01:39:40,619 --> 01:39:45,899
hybrids especially with like this like

2662
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:47,399
everything crossed with gelato which I

2663
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:49,920
don't know if anybody's tired of it I'm

2664
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:51,839
kind of I try to limit it you know like

2665
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,600
if you look at this line there's not a

2666
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:58,020
whole lot of that whenever we whenever

2667
01:39:54,600 --> 01:40:00,179
we sit down to create a lineup we try to

2668
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:01,500
make it diverse you know like if you

2669
01:40:00,179 --> 01:40:04,199
look at any of them there'll be a little

2670
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:06,000
bit of gas we'll maybe try to slip a

2671
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:08,460
lemon in there we'll try to slip some

2672
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,979
different fruits in there we try

2673
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,619
to make the menu diverse because who

2674
01:40:10,979 --> 01:40:16,439
wants to sit down at a restaurant and

2675
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:18,899
there's just nothing but meatloaf like

2676
01:40:16,439 --> 01:40:21,359
okay like Meatloaf's good one day but

2677
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:23,399
not all the days so or maybe no days

2678
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:24,000
depending if you don't like me though

2679
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:26,158
um

2680
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,840
so I like to keep that menu diverse

2681
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:29,759
maybe there'll be a gas maybe there'll

2682
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:33,000
be uh you know

2683
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:35,219
age gelato but not the whole damn thing

2684
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,380
um yeah I think that's kind of the

2685
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:39,960
direction something for everybody you

2686
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:41,760
know yeah sure and I now this train I

2687
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,219
wanted to flag was you've worked with

2688
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,199

2689
01:40:44,219 --> 01:40:48,480

2693
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:56,579
you've made with it like the I'm going

2694
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,719
to pronounce it wrong but is it the NF

2695
01:40:56,579 --> 01:40:59,698

2697
01:40:59,698 --> 01:41:04,500
if she

2698
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:07,379
yeah uh the end of sheesh came out

2699
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:09,179
awesome like that thing is so Frosty and

2700
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:11,279
that's why I love using um the north

2701
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:13,679
Fire's cut uh shout out to North fire

2702
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,599
man he's a he's a great grower and you

2703
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,340
know we appreciate him let's use that

2704
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,639
strain so

2705
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:22,980
um yeah it's just a banger man like it

2706
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:24,480
has beautiful structure it washes very

2707
01:41:22,979 --> 01:41:27,718
well

2708
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:31,500
um it's it's got a good smell on it and

2709
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:33,480
it breeds well like you know caps I

2710
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,800
think Captain was that the El Norte with

2711
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:38,039
it

2712
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:40,320
um we've done a couple with it it's and

2713
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:43,679
it really I think with the Bahama

2714
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,639
together yeah I mean it is so Frosty

2715
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:46,020
like if you look at some of those

2716
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,800
pictures it is crazy

2717
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:51,360
so yeah it came out well yeah nice I

2718
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,039
might just try to bang off some of the

2719
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:54,420
ones that I was personally curious so

2720
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,579
just get them all done in one segment

2721
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:58,020
but the the Mando was another

2722
01:41:56,579 --> 01:41:59,460
interesting cross because it used a

2723
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:01,679
mother called Yoder and you had me

2724
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:04,020
wondering is that related to the the

2725
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:06,480
baby Yoda we see from compound genetics

2726
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:08,760
and if not what is it

2727
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:10,559
yeah so that's another one like that we

2728
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,960
just don't know

2729
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,780
um so it's an unknown like that got

2730
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:18,239
slipped out of a out of a warehouse or

2731
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:20,880
out of a wreck in in La I can't really

2732
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:24,000
say a bunch about you know where it came

2733
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:27,359
from uh per se but no he just was like

2734
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,859
Hey grow this out it's it's gassy you

2735
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:31,439
know super gas you got to grow this out

2736
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:35,519
so I got it back to Seattle

2737
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:37,979
I uh I grew it out because he doesn't

2738
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,199
know [ __ ] and I'm definitely not it it's

2739
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:42,299
just in the pool of things until it

2740
01:42:40,198 --> 01:42:44,219
makes the cut to even go to the next

2741
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:46,800
phase

2742
01:42:44,219 --> 01:42:48,960
um it's nothing so and when I grew it

2743
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,880
out I was like oh yeah this is tight you

2744
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,520
know like this is gas it I love the

2745
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:55,440
frost on I love the structure of it

2746
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,420
um it kind of had like this

2747
01:42:55,439 --> 01:43:00,618
almost like

2748
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:03,899
oh the Mando crosses had like this

2749
01:43:00,618 --> 01:43:05,579
gray blue tint to them which I found

2750
01:43:03,899 --> 01:43:07,259
like really cool I didn't see a bunch of

2751
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:10,319
those in the females but I did see a

2752
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:13,500
couple that were like this blue gray

2753
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:16,920
color with like heavy Frost and like a

2754
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,420
gassy nose so I mean that's what got it

2755
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:20,340
in to the

2756
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:23,039
to the lineup and like the other females

2757
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:24,480
were tight too so yeah it was tight

2758
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:26,579
um but as far as like the background

2759
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:29,579
lineage there's so many different Yoda

2760
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:31,319
Cuts there's like a Yodo G there's over

2761
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:32,100
the years there's so many of them so who

2762
01:43:31,319 --> 01:43:34,259
knows

2763
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:37,320
yeah it can get like a bit of a myriad

2764
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,520
like that at times I guess yeah like I

2765
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:40,439
think it might even be one of the most

2766
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:42,960
recent posts on your Instagram but the

2767
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:45,359
Bitties it looks phenomenal like these

2768
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:48,060
super swollen hand grenade type buds

2769
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:50,339
just gorgeous Rich purple hues

2770
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:52,920
do you find that the purple lines like

2771
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:54,960
this sell well or do you feel like that

2772
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,480
somewhat prevalent myth around purple

2773
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,000
strains not being super potent sort of

2774
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:02,099
cancels out any increase in terms of

2775
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,260
like sales or interests

2776
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:06,360
no I think they they go well people

2777
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:08,699
people like that colourpop you know what

2778
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:10,439
I mean and that Bitties that is comes in

2779
01:44:08,698 --> 01:44:11,399
a bunch of different colors so like I

2780
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:14,879
had

2781
01:44:11,399 --> 01:44:16,979
that's a great strain because you get so

2782
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:19,739
much selection in that you got Mike's

2783
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:22,138
selected cut of the jigglers which is

2784
01:44:19,738 --> 01:44:25,919
already [ __ ] awesome and then you get

2785
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:29,819
this selection of Bahama reversed onto

2786
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:32,039
it and now we're getting you know crazy

2787
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:35,519
phinos so yeah the one with like that

2788
01:44:32,039 --> 01:44:38,039
hand green hand grenade size nug you're

2789
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,960
exactly right like it's that big it

2790
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:43,439
fills the palm of your hand so it was

2791
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:46,319
super heavy had a a great you know more

2792
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:47,658
gelato East Side nose on that one

2793
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,399
um

2794
01:44:47,658 --> 01:44:52,019
and like the leaf ratio there's like no

2795
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:55,439
leaves on that like that's there's like

2796
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:57,719
no trimming to that and yeah I mean

2797
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:59,939
that's I can't I definitely kept that

2798
01:44:57,719 --> 01:45:01,739
keeper cut to work with down the down

2799
01:44:59,939 --> 01:45:04,138
the line but um

2800
01:45:01,738 --> 01:45:06,959
some of the other femos that were in

2801
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:10,199
there had different uh almost like gassy

2802
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:12,239
kind of weird smells to them and

2803
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:15,479
um there was even like a grape one like

2804
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:17,819
a it was ugly like it it was one of the

2805
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:19,919
tester ones that it just didn't have the

2806
01:45:17,819 --> 01:45:22,439
right leaves to it to be a keeper so I

2807
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,679
didn't keep it but the smell was crazy

2808
01:45:22,439 --> 01:45:28,198
um it smelled like grapes uh but yeah

2809
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,940
like there was quite a few cool jigglers

2810
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:31,799
some of them look

2811
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:33,738
awesome

2812
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:37,500
I love that I think it's one of my

2813
01:45:33,738 --> 01:45:39,479
favorites Miami uh mommy too is one of

2814
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:41,158
my heavy favorites I I really loved

2815
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:43,379
everything in the lineup

2816
01:45:41,158 --> 01:45:45,539
yeah look strong sales pitch and I got

2817
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,400
to admit the the Bitties was one that I

2818
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:49,920
was looking at myself thinking this

2819
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:52,019
might be the one I'd pick it makes me

2820
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:54,359
wonder I like the name Bitties I think

2821
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:56,219
it's cool and and I always think how

2822
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:58,859
important is a strain name do you think

2823
01:45:56,219 --> 01:46:00,600
it's sort of only really matters if the

2824
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:01,559
strain isn't good like if the strain's

2825
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,000
good enough it doesn't really matter

2826
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:05,219
what the strain name is or do you think

2827
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,920
it really actually makes a difference

2828
01:46:05,219 --> 01:46:09,480
I think it does to an extent I mean I

2829
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,279
named that Bitties because if you know

2830
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:14,339
my boy Mike he'd be coming up with some

2831
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:18,000
of the most outlandish sometimes

2832
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:20,579
borderline offensive names ever so I I

2833
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,920
figured like okay if I'm gonna you know

2834
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:25,679
it's a it's an exotic soulfire collab

2835
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:30,239
it's got to have a name that

2836
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:33,060
that would be proper so I went with

2837
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:35,399
Bitties but um yeah I think the names do

2838
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:38,940
matter a little bit people want some

2839
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:40,559
creativity in the names people want you

2840
01:46:38,939 --> 01:46:42,479
to take some time and figure it out and

2841
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,920
it's not easy with like absolutely

2842
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,539
everything you got to make sure that

2843
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,800
nobody has the [ __ ]

2844
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:51,658
or it causes a desktop so yeah names are

2845
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:54,900
important and I guess there's a little

2846
01:46:51,658 --> 01:46:57,000
follow-up to that do you tend to name

2847
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:58,679
strains before you've grown them out or

2848
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,899
do you like to grow them out and sort of

2849
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:02,760
use that experience as some inspiration

2850
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:05,519
for the name

2851
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:07,619
yeah I got to grow them out first

2852
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,900
yeah I just the reason why I ask is

2853
01:47:07,618 --> 01:47:11,579
because I find it interesting you sort

2854
01:47:09,899 --> 01:47:13,859
of see it more commonly these days where

2855
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:16,198
people put a post up being like hey the

2856
01:47:13,859 --> 01:47:18,179
name Bitties is now taken and it's like

2857
01:47:16,198 --> 01:47:19,979
they've just dusted the female with

2858
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,480
pollen and it's sort of like don't you

2859
01:47:19,979 --> 01:47:22,738
want to grow it out first or like I

2860
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:24,599
guess Bitties is a bad example for

2861
01:47:22,738 --> 01:47:26,459
people like you know orange lemonade

2862
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,719
cookie and it's like don't you want to

2863
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:29,639
make sure that's actually like the

2864
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:31,679
flavor in there like what if what if you

2865
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:34,079
don't find it right

2866
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,000
yeah I mean how do you how do you name

2867
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:38,279
something before you've seen what it is

2868
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,219
because it can be completely different

2869
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:42,960
from what you may think

2870
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:44,760
so yeah you got to grow it out because

2871
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:48,060
and honestly it's going to help you name

2872
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,440
your plant much better like you're gonna

2873
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:52,619
see something in there that maybe

2874
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:54,599
triggers like a name that

2875
01:47:52,618 --> 01:47:56,880
like has a distinguishing characteristic

2876
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:58,679
for that plant so yeah grow your plants

2877
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:02,039
out before you name them in my opinion

2878
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:03,719
yeah I get yeah I feel you I feel ya but

2879
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:06,600
I mean a lot a lot of people just don't

2880
01:48:03,719 --> 01:48:09,840
grow their [ __ ] out so maybe you know it

2881
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:11,880
is what it is that's it isn't it so one

2882
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:15,060
of the final strains I wanted to grill

2883
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,560
you about was the baby cakes it looks

2884
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,520
great and I love that you the

2885
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,199
description you know you're sort of

2886
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:22,199
talking about how it's a very consistent

2887
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:24,178
cookie type Finos but something which I

2888
01:48:22,198 --> 01:48:26,399
was also curious about was how did you

2889
01:48:24,179 --> 01:48:27,960
get that cake mix clone like I swear

2890
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:30,000
that's got to be one of the most locked

2891
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,179
down cookie fam clones there is how did

2892
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,279
that happen yeah I mean they're not that

2893
01:48:33,179 --> 01:48:36,658
locked down because they just be sliding

2894
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:39,719
around and we have a really good circle

2895
01:48:36,658 --> 01:48:40,859
of friends that that get these get these

2896
01:48:39,719 --> 01:48:43,198
things so

2897
01:48:40,859 --> 01:48:46,859
um yeah they might not be as locked down

2898
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:48,960
as you think there you go I mean like I

2899
01:48:46,859 --> 01:48:50,519
think people always uh talk about Envy

2900
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,840
genetics in that regard you know it's

2901
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,400
like how did he get but I guess you know

2902
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,480
it just sort of speaks to the crew

2903
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:56,638
you've got

2904
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,618
yeah definitely I mean Envy's right

2905
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:01,380
there in the mix he's down in La he's

2906
01:48:58,618 --> 01:49:04,559
got you know he's got a good network of

2907
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:06,659
people so he's able to uh he's able to

2908
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,280
find find things that other people uh

2909
01:49:06,658 --> 01:49:12,059
might not be able to

2910
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:14,939
that's awesome that's awesome so as just

2911
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,860
someone who has a very you know soft

2912
01:49:14,939 --> 01:49:19,138
spot for sativas I'm wondering do you

2913
01:49:16,859 --> 01:49:22,679
have a plan to do any work with some

2914
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:24,840
like you know strongly sativa type work

2915
01:49:22,679 --> 01:49:27,060
or is you just more into the indicary

2916
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:29,279
sort of hybrids

2917
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:31,920
um I definitely am open to it man I I

2918
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:34,920
want to uh I was just talking about this

2919
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,300
the other day I want to grow a sativa

2920
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,859
plant it's almost

2921
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:39,480
like people always ask like is this

2922
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:42,179
sativa dominant or is this in the

2923
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:43,379
dominant and it's almost to the point

2924
01:49:42,179 --> 01:49:47,520
where like

2925
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:50,340
that nomenclature is kind of dead you

2926
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:53,820
know where we call things sativa or

2927
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:56,039
indica everything is so hybridized now

2928
01:49:53,819 --> 01:49:57,599
it's almost hard to like find a true

2929
01:49:56,039 --> 01:49:59,219
sativa

2930
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:02,820
um I guess unless you're ordering seeds

2931
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:05,340
from like the UK so in general which of

2932
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:07,319
your strains do you think is sort of one

2933
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:08,760
that's most sort of slept on by the

2934
01:50:07,319 --> 01:50:10,319
public like sort of like that secret

2935
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:12,060
dark horse that you think's a real

2936
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:14,939
winner but maybe just needs a bit more

2937
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:18,000
time before it catches on

2938
01:50:14,939 --> 01:50:21,599
um I think our mind flare is you know it

2939
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,479
it came out in the white jelly uh lineup

2940
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,820
and it was just I thought it was amazing

2941
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:28,919
um it just all these different flavor

2942
01:50:26,819 --> 01:50:30,779
profiles were in there and then we just

2943
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,079
used it again

2944
01:50:30,779 --> 01:50:35,819
um we used our keeper uh in with the

2945
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:38,340
Bahama Mama and that's what made the

2946
01:50:35,819 --> 01:50:40,738
Miami Mommy and it's

2947
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:43,079
just crushed in there like so many

2948
01:50:40,738 --> 01:50:45,059
Keepers I was throwing them away like I

2949
01:50:43,079 --> 01:50:47,819
just can't keep them all you know so

2950
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:50,520
I think when people dig into the Miami

2951
01:50:47,819 --> 01:50:52,399
Mommy and see what that's all about and

2952
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:56,280
when you get these kind of like

2953
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:58,979
chocolatey really rich Fino like

2954
01:50:56,279 --> 01:51:00,658
smelling phinos and like this Frost that

2955
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:02,459
is putting off

2956
01:51:00,658 --> 01:51:04,019
um and the the colorways that they have

2957
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:05,698
I think that you know it's going to

2958
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:08,219
really open their eyes to the Mind flare

2959
01:51:05,698 --> 01:51:09,839
and the selections that we've done over

2960
01:51:08,219 --> 01:51:13,020
time with it

2961
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:15,119
yeah heck maybe we can change that and I

2962
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:17,520
mean sort of in a similar light what do

2963
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:19,799
you think is the most consistent line in

2964
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,420
terms of plants produced like what the

2965
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:23,039
plants produce and the reason why I ask

2966
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:25,260
this is because we've got a lot of

2967
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:27,118
listeners who grow outdoors and for them

2968
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:28,860
they ideally want to be able to you know

2969
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:30,658
like Harvest a bunch of plants and it

2970
01:51:28,859 --> 01:51:32,399
just all goes in the same bag so like

2971
01:51:30,658 --> 01:51:34,198
consistency for some people is quite

2972
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:36,539
important which line do you think gives

2973
01:51:34,198 --> 01:51:38,519
pretty consistent results

2974
01:51:36,539 --> 01:51:42,238
right so you're talking about like

2975
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:44,520
phenotypic consistency across across all

2976
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:45,839
the crosses sure

2977
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:48,000
um I mean you're going to see a lot of

2978
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:51,239
that in this Bahama line because the

2979
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,100
Bahama was so dominant in like and like

2980
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:54,599
passing on that color Frost and

2981
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,360
structure

2982
01:51:54,600 --> 01:52:00,900
um you're gonna see a lot of uh

2983
01:51:56,359 --> 01:52:05,099
phenotypic similarities in this lineup

2984
01:52:00,899 --> 01:52:06,658
um if I would say not in the um

2985
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:09,360
in the Black Banana lineup because

2986
01:52:06,658 --> 01:52:10,559
everything was vastly different in that

2987
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:11,698
one

2988
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:16,080
um

2989
01:52:11,698 --> 01:52:18,479
yeah and probably could see some of that

2990
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:19,920
in the in the white jelly because the

2991
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:22,379
white jelly kind of did that as well

2992
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:24,480
like where it

2993
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:25,920
it brought those similarities but yeah

2994
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:28,738
definitely the Bahama line you're gonna

2995
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:31,319
it was it was a strong

2996
01:52:28,738 --> 01:52:33,299
strong presence of Obama in there yeah

2997
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:36,899
nice nice

2998
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:38,460
so what genetics in general excite you

2999
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:40,738
you know like what are you sort of

3000
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:42,960
excited to hunt next and and if you were

3001
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:44,879
to sort of pop some other seeds from

3002
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,500
someone else how many seeds do you like

3003
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:49,020
to pop to get an idea of what's going on

3004
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:52,020
with that line for me I'll just grab

3005
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:53,940
like interesting packs so if I can't

3006
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:55,920
find something tight in just one pack of

3007
01:52:53,939 --> 01:52:58,678
your seeds I'm probably not [ __ ] with

3008
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,600
you so like I said I'm gonna pop this

3009
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:04,739
bloomco

3010
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:07,020
um pop some of his stuff so uh that of

3011
01:53:04,738 --> 01:53:09,718
course Mike's Creations I'm always

3012
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:11,520
popping [ __ ] out of his stuff uh mostly

3013
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:14,039
because I can just hit him up and get

3014
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,619
him like what's up bro those are looking

3015
01:53:14,039 --> 01:53:20,698
Ty with some strawberry gears bro I need

3016
01:53:16,618 --> 01:53:23,099
I need my fix so um yeah uh so any of

3017
01:53:20,698 --> 01:53:24,899
any of the Exotic stuff is Ty uh like I

3018
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,679
said bloomco

3019
01:53:24,899 --> 01:53:26,939
um

3020
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:29,340
uh

3021
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:31,019
uh Relentless always has great work you

3022
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:33,779
know you can really see that he puts a

3023
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:36,840
lot of time in his stuff uh I might have

3024
01:53:33,779 --> 01:53:39,599
my papa a pack of masonics um stuff

3025
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:42,420
because I had such great results with uh

3026
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,079
what I got from him last time

3027
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:48,840
um

3028
01:53:43,079 --> 01:53:50,760
who else I want to pop some dead pan I

3029
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:52,079
think his name is I want to pop some of

3030
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,739
his stuff I think I have some of his

3031
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:58,260
Peach stuff uh I might be popping

3032
01:53:55,738 --> 01:54:00,299
some of the wave genetics I think I got

3033
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:02,579
their what their peach rings I think

3034
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:04,260
it's called Uh I really want to find

3035
01:54:02,579 --> 01:54:07,738
this Peach chirp that people are talking

3036
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:09,239
about so I'm gonna hunt a bunch of peach

3037
01:54:07,738 --> 01:54:10,919
flavored stuff see what I can find I'm

3038
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:12,599
looking for peaches and grapes

3039
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:14,760
kind of

3040
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,619
um so we'll see what I can find I enjoy

3041
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:19,500
popping other people's work

3042
01:54:16,618 --> 01:54:22,439
and seeing what what cool [ __ ] it's fun

3043
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:24,479
for me yeah for sure I definitely can

3044
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:27,899
get down with that sentiment

3045
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:29,879
so the Lumpy Space Princess that's uh

3046
01:54:27,899 --> 01:54:31,679
that's a cool strain both because it's a

3047
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:33,179
great reference to Adventure Time as

3048
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:35,039
well as

3049
01:54:33,179 --> 01:54:37,020
um you know it looks phenomenal when you

3050
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:39,179
look at the plants it's both been bred

3051
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:42,119
with and it on itself

3052
01:54:39,179 --> 01:54:43,739
do you find that like you name strains

3053
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:45,420
with references like also there's the

3054
01:54:43,738 --> 01:54:47,519
Grim bastard OG which is phenomenal

3055
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:49,500
reference to Trailer Park Boys

3056
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,719
um do you name these because these

3057
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:54,000
strains remind you of that reference in

3058
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:55,859
some way or it's just special to you and

3059
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,880
like what sort of makes you think oh you

3060
01:54:55,859 --> 01:54:59,039
know I'm gonna give this like a cool

3061
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:02,039
name that's a reference to a show or to

3062
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:06,238
a game or something like that

3063
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:09,899
um both so uh that thing looked like

3064
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:10,979
Lumpy Space Princess so uh like what we

3065
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:13,138
were talking about you got to grow them

3066
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:14,399
out once I grew them out I was like I'm

3067
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:16,440
slumping on these lumps right here

3068
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:18,179
because that thing looks like Lumpy

3069
01:55:16,439 --> 01:55:19,138
Space Princess

3070
01:55:18,179 --> 01:55:22,079
um

3071
01:55:19,139 --> 01:55:25,500
so yeah I I

3072
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:27,238
I like the LSP I think I you know and

3073
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,618
that might be something that we revisit

3074
01:55:27,238 --> 01:55:30,299
at some point because people just

3075
01:55:28,618 --> 01:55:33,179
absolutely love that

3076
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:36,000
that cross like the pink Hues that it it

3077
01:55:33,179 --> 01:55:38,340
comes with and the and that that musky

3078
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,439
lemon flavor that you can actually taste

3079
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:41,520
they they like that strain like those

3080
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:44,399
things have been sold out for a while

3081
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,739
but um yeah I like to I like to

3082
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:50,099
reference pop culture

3083
01:55:46,738 --> 01:55:51,779
um I play a ton of uh I'm a I'm a gamer

3084
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:53,159
myself I play a ton of video games with

3085
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:57,359
my kids

3086
01:55:53,158 --> 01:56:00,179
um we even run a uh Grand Theft Auto uh

3087
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:02,579
server like uh where people come in and

3088
01:56:00,179 --> 01:56:04,319
play like Grand Theft Auto online it's

3089
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:07,920
kind of wild

3090
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:11,399
um yeah so I mean we just we're we're

3091
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:13,920
pop culture Fanatics I guess that's cool

3092
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:17,099
you got your own GTA server oh yeah we

3093
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,719
love it man I I yeah it's like an RP

3094
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,980
server so you get in there and you you

3095
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,600
know you role play whatever you're

3096
01:56:19,979 --> 01:56:24,899
playing and people like really get into

3097
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:27,119
it so uh yeah it's it's pretty awesome

3098
01:56:24,899 --> 01:56:29,939
there you go a whole new world for both

3099
01:56:27,118 --> 01:56:31,259
me and the listeners to go and explore a

3100
01:56:29,939 --> 01:56:33,238
bit more

3101
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:35,639
yeah I think we're gonna I was thinking

3102
01:56:33,238 --> 01:56:39,658
about doing like a seed drop in the in

3103
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:42,118
the in the GTA uh server so you know you

3104
01:56:39,658 --> 01:56:44,399
would just get in yeah and do something

3105
01:56:42,118 --> 01:56:46,859
maybe to get a specific pack of seeds

3106
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:50,519
that you can only get by hopping in and

3107
01:56:46,859 --> 01:56:52,979
and hopping into 5m and and uh coming

3108
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:54,840
into the uh the city so might be

3109
01:56:52,979 --> 01:56:57,599
something in the future to look out for

3110
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,619
now that's the next level drop that's

3111
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:02,159
right

3112
01:56:58,618 --> 01:57:03,839
so I noticed amongst the various strains

3113
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:06,000
you've made you've worked with a few

3114
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:08,219
different cookie Cuts or sort of cookie

3115
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,500
related strains like you know from just

3116
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:12,359
straight cookies to the northern fire

3117
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:15,118
cookies to even things like biscotti

3118
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:17,098
stuff like that which of the cookie cuts

3119
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:19,738
are your preferred ones if you had to

3120
01:57:17,099 --> 01:57:22,260
pick say one or two and do you like to

3121
01:57:19,738 --> 01:57:25,500
breed with cookies generally speaking

3122
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:27,719
uh I do because I like the structure of

3123
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:29,460
cookies I like the smell of cookies I

3124
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:32,219
think that

3125
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:33,658
um the creation of cookies really was a

3126
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:36,658
uh

3127
01:57:33,658 --> 01:57:40,319
turning point in in breeding and in

3128
01:57:36,658 --> 01:57:43,079
cannabis culture or you know and however

3129
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:45,719
you feel about the cookies machine and

3130
01:57:43,079 --> 01:57:48,539
brand and burner and all that put that

3131
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:50,520
[ __ ] to the side and you really just

3132
01:57:48,539 --> 01:57:52,979
can't take away from these guys what

3133
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,540
they you know what that what that plant

3134
01:57:52,979 --> 01:57:57,299
has done

3135
01:57:54,539 --> 01:57:59,899
um at least breeding wise for sure so

3136
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:03,420
yeah I like it I

3137
01:57:59,899 --> 01:58:06,059
uh right now I like the the north fire

3138
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:08,099
cookies I used to have the cut of

3139
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:09,420
cookies and cream that I thought was the

3140
01:58:08,099 --> 01:58:13,020
best one

3141
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:13,739
um to me far better than the 13.

3142
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:15,320
um

3143
01:58:13,738 --> 01:58:17,698
in my opinion

3144
01:58:15,319 --> 01:58:20,579
uh but

3145
01:58:17,698 --> 01:58:23,279
yeah I I do I do enjoy breeding with

3146
01:58:20,579 --> 01:58:26,880
cookies I think it's I think it adds

3147
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:28,920
some characteristics to the progeny that

3148
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,819
can only be found in the in those plants

3149
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,880
so

3150
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:34,618
uh I I don't try to over add too much of

3151
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,380
it to the lineup like I said I like to

3152
01:58:34,618 --> 01:58:39,839
have a little something for everyone

3153
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:41,699
um I guess I'm missing missing that Mark

3154
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,440
by not having enough sativa and maybe

3155
01:58:41,698 --> 01:58:46,799
we'll fix that in the future

3156
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:48,839
uh but yeah it's a good one to add no

3157
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:51,239
fire cookies right now is the one

3158
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:53,880
yeah I love it good answer

3159
01:58:51,238 --> 01:58:56,819
so on the final question before we do

3160
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:58,679
our quick fire questions at the end I

3161
01:58:56,819 --> 01:59:01,559
noticed that you'd had some nice

3162
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:04,679
write-ups in high times and I feel like

3163
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,020
in the past High Times played a huge

3164
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:09,539
role in our scene and in promotion and

3165
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:12,179
awareness but as Instagram and other

3166
01:59:09,539 --> 01:59:14,460
social media platforms have taken off it

3167
01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:16,618
feels like it's faded a little bit did

3168
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:18,658
you feel like you got a bump out of

3169
01:59:16,618 --> 01:59:20,579
those write-ups and those features or do

3170
01:59:18,658 --> 01:59:23,399
you feel like they are sort of fading a

3171
01:59:20,579 --> 01:59:25,679
bit Into Obscurity

3172
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:27,598
um I think I I mean maybe we did I

3173
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,440
didn't pay too much attention to him I

3174
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:30,840
feel like

3175
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:32,879
High Times is kind of

3176
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:36,060
it used to be like this

3177
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:38,159
like Flagship for our industry it used

3178
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:40,440
to be like oh High Times you know and

3179
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:43,098
maybe it's because the covet and the

3180
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:46,859
shows are gone or the shows have been so

3181
01:59:43,099 --> 01:59:48,420
[ __ ] up with like the regulation like

3182
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:51,000
you can't even answer any of these damn

3183
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:52,800
shows anymore without being licensed in

3184
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,079
that state and it's just turned a bunch

3185
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,360
of [ __ ] so

3186
01:59:55,079 --> 01:59:59,579
I'm just disappointed in in High Times

3187
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:02,339
in that aspect like

3188
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:03,840
it used to be the one thing that we all

3189
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:05,880
used to come together to do to go to

3190
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,199
these competitions and they've really

3191
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:09,239
just turned it into like an

3192
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,579
advertisement for whatever local

3193
02:00:09,238 --> 02:00:13,319
recreational breeders are gonna line

3194
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:15,238
their pockets and that's unfortunate

3195
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:17,158
like they've really I don't know if it's

3196
02:00:15,238 --> 02:00:19,859
the new owners or what's going on over

3197
02:00:17,158 --> 02:00:22,079
there but I think the general sentiment

3198
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:24,559
from like most of the

3199
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:26,939
heads in the industry is just like

3200
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:30,360
they're pretty irrelevant at this point

3201
02:00:26,939 --> 02:00:31,799
and they need to come back to like what

3202
02:00:30,359 --> 02:00:33,658
started them

3203
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,219
and

3204
02:00:33,658 --> 02:00:36,658
I don't know

3205
02:00:35,219 --> 02:00:39,179
so

3206
02:00:36,658 --> 02:00:40,799
if we got a bump from it I I don't know

3207
02:00:39,179 --> 02:00:44,060
but

3208
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:46,139
I missed the old High Times to be honest

3209
02:00:44,060 --> 02:00:50,039
when you say that do you sort of mean

3210
02:00:46,139 --> 02:00:51,840
like before it was like pay to play

3211
02:00:50,039 --> 02:00:53,460
um yeah like well I'm sorry I should

3212
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,500
clarify obviously it's not all pay to

3213
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:57,060
play because I I can bet my left like

3214
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:58,800
you didn't pay for that article but like

3215
02:00:57,060 --> 02:01:01,139
that's one of the criticisms which gets

3216
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:05,279
leveled against them at times I guess

3217
02:01:01,139 --> 02:01:07,800
yeah well it's I I don't know man people

3218
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:11,279
used to like I I know when Mike and and

3219
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:13,260
Q and Cuban were winning all of their

3220
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:15,539
um just on that run like winning all

3221
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:17,219
their their trophies and whatever those

3222
02:01:15,539 --> 02:01:19,319
guys weren't paying to win that stuff

3223
02:01:17,219 --> 02:01:20,939
like I you know I'm right there in the

3224
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:22,500
circle they still didn't pay that [ __ ]

3225
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:24,839
they just had fire and they were winning

3226
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:27,060
you know so like I hear so many times

3227
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:28,560
like oh like if you want a cup that's

3228
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:30,480
because you paid or that's because you

3229
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:33,000
did that that's [ __ ] like that

3230
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:34,859
that's not absolutely not true those

3231
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,960
guys won that [ __ ]

3232
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:40,979
fair and square

3233
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:43,079
um but now yeah I think it's like

3234
02:01:40,979 --> 02:01:44,698
I don't know they're just I think maybe

3235
02:01:43,079 --> 02:01:46,260
I don't know their financials but maybe

3236
02:01:44,698 --> 02:01:47,519
High Times is upside down they need to

3237
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:49,320
make some money

3238
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,480
but they can make all that money by

3239
02:01:49,319 --> 02:01:54,899
showing by making having some awesome

3240
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:56,579
shows uh once maybe covered gets up off

3241
02:01:54,899 --> 02:01:59,158
of our ass

3242
02:01:56,579 --> 02:02:01,319
yeah that's some really valid points you

3243
02:01:59,158 --> 02:02:04,019
know I definitely have heard that

3244
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:05,579
criticism raised uh before about the

3245
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:06,960
purchasing of the cups and I think like

3246
02:02:05,579 --> 02:02:09,238
what you said is really valid you know

3247
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,279
people like exotic Mike and various

3248
02:02:09,238 --> 02:02:13,019
others clearly not paying to win clearly

3249
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:15,479
got the fire I think some of the

3250
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:17,820
frustration is more like when you see

3251
02:02:15,479 --> 02:02:19,559
strain right UPS in the magazine and

3252
02:02:17,819 --> 02:02:22,079
it's like we're doing a write-up this

3253
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:23,760
week on crop Kings blueberry and you're

3254
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:26,340
like oh come on

3255
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:28,679
yeah I think yeah but anyway so I mean

3256
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:30,239
bringing us to sort of our quick fire

3257
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:32,699
questions that we'd love to ask all

3258
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:35,819
guests at the end uh the first one I

3259
02:02:32,698 --> 02:02:38,879
wanted to ask you is what is the best or

3260
02:02:35,819 --> 02:02:40,859
most memorable single weed experience

3261
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:43,139
you've had so it might be like smoking a

3262
02:02:40,859 --> 02:02:45,179
certain flower smoking a certain hash or

3263
02:02:43,139 --> 02:02:46,980
just whatever what stands out the most

3264
02:02:45,179 --> 02:02:50,158
to you

3265
02:02:46,979 --> 02:02:54,598
uh lemon tree yeah I don't know why but

3266
02:02:50,158 --> 02:02:57,719
uh uh one of the just the when Mike and

3267
02:02:54,599 --> 02:03:00,659
I smoked a lemon tree at the I think it

3268
02:02:57,719 --> 02:03:03,239
was the emerald cup or something we just

3269
02:03:00,658 --> 02:03:05,339
we're like just love the flavor so damn

3270
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:07,799
much we had to get a get a cut for

3271
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:10,380
ourselves so I I remember that

3272
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:12,480
yeah nice it's a really it's a really

3273
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:15,420
interesting flavor isn't it

3274
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:19,138
yeah it's one of a kind actually like

3275
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:21,060
the it's the aftertaste man like that it

3276
02:03:19,139 --> 02:03:22,560
stays on your palate and that's like

3277
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:25,500
what we're looking for when it comes to

3278
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:28,800
Flavors like the weed can be pretty the

3279
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:30,479
weed could be this or that but if it

3280
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:34,079
leaves that aftertaste in your mouth

3281
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:35,519
like that lemon tree does uh yeah that's

3282
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:37,319
memorable so that's that's definitely

3283
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:38,880
one of the most memorable yeah a

3284
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:40,679
brilliant answer and I can I can

3285
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,420
understand why you'd say that so on the

3286
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:44,460
other end of the spectrum though was

3287
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:46,560
there ever a situation where people

3288
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:48,420
around you or people who you sort of

3289
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,219
generally trust the opinion over like

3290
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:53,219
hyping a strain up and then you finally

3291
02:03:50,219 --> 02:03:55,939
taste it and you're like oh is that it

3292
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:55,939
hmm

3293
02:03:56,158 --> 02:04:01,799
yeah

3294
02:03:58,738 --> 02:04:03,959
I know there is I just don't know it off

3295
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,900
the top of my head

3296
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:08,460
um one that we're just like oh that's

3297
02:04:06,899 --> 02:04:10,759
not that tight

3298
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:12,960
yeah I'm not sure not for me personally

3299
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:15,239
I can't think of one off the top of it

3300
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:17,698
it's almost a good thing right

3301
02:04:15,238 --> 02:04:19,439
yeah yeah definitely there you go the

3302
02:04:17,698 --> 02:04:21,118
people around you are only suggesting

3303
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:23,339
and hyping up the good stuff that's good

3304
02:04:21,118 --> 02:04:24,960
to hear so let's do a bit of a

3305
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:27,300
hypothetical you know I'm gonna drop you

3306
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:29,219
off on a remote desert island with just

3307
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:31,020
three strains and you can theoretically

3308
02:04:29,219 --> 02:04:32,399
grow them for the rest of time what

3309
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:34,080
three are you taking with you they can

3310
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:35,519
either be clones or seeds whatever you

3311
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:38,238
want but just three

3312
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:42,540
just three uh GMO

3313
02:04:38,238 --> 02:04:44,238
uh probably take uh my kind of banana

3314
02:04:42,539 --> 02:04:47,579
runs

3315
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:50,459
and I only get one more

3316
02:04:47,579 --> 02:04:52,698
Let's see we got some funk we got some

3317
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:52,698
uh

3318
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:58,079
uh

3319
02:04:54,960 --> 02:05:00,000
uh do you say I'm on the island yeah

3320
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:01,039
I gotta bring the Bahama Mama it's an

3321
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,939
island

3322
02:05:01,039 --> 02:05:07,738
good cross good cross Okay cool so now

3323
02:05:05,939 --> 02:05:09,960
there's a chance to be a little bit

3324
02:05:07,738 --> 02:05:12,059
devilish here let's let's say the the

3325
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:13,319
roles are reversed and instead of you

3326
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:15,300
being dropped off we're gonna drop

3327
02:05:13,319 --> 02:05:18,179
someone else off and let's just say that

3328
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:19,800
you're not a big fan of this person you

3329
02:05:18,179 --> 02:05:21,179
get to pick what three strains you're

3330
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:23,420
gonna drop them off with what are you

3331
02:05:21,179 --> 02:05:28,920
going to leave them with

3332
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:31,380
I'm gonna leave them with a CBD strain

3333
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:34,679
um I'm gonna leave so I'll leave them

3334
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:36,779
with some some CBD I will I'm not a big

3335
02:05:34,679 --> 02:05:38,520
fan of this person right okay

3336
02:05:36,779 --> 02:05:40,800
um

3337
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:42,119
other strangers that are not that great

3338
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,260
right now

3339
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:46,019
um

3340
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:48,659
what junk would I leave somebody with

3341
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:49,739
I'd probably still give them GMO even

3342
02:05:48,658 --> 02:05:51,000
though I don't like them because we know

3343
02:05:49,738 --> 02:05:52,919
it's going to take them 12 weeks to

3344
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,099
finish it so that's just going to be

3345
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:58,440
frustrating either way

3346
02:05:55,099 --> 02:06:02,119
and then uh I'll probably leave him with

3347
02:05:58,439 --> 02:06:05,339
so he's got some CBD he's got some GMO

3348
02:06:02,118 --> 02:06:06,779
and maybe I'll leave him with some some

3349
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:09,960
apple fritter

3350
02:06:06,779 --> 02:06:14,219
oh you're not a fan of it

3351
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:18,060
uh no not that I'm not a fan of it but

3352
02:06:14,219 --> 02:06:20,158
um yeah I'm just leaving yeah

3353
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:21,480
leaving with some freighter it seems

3354
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:23,879
like what everybody wants to grow up so

3355
02:06:21,479 --> 02:06:26,399
he can grow that yeah no look we've

3356
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,560
heard a lot of blue dreams in the past

3357
02:06:26,399 --> 02:06:30,779
so I guess it's sort of like that

3358
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,699
oh I mean hey dude there's a time that

3359
02:06:30,779 --> 02:06:35,460
blue dream was awesome I don't know why

3360
02:06:32,698 --> 02:06:38,638
people hate on that [ __ ] that's it yeah

3361
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:40,920
that's it okay so final question if you

3362
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:43,980
could go back in time to any place

3363
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:45,840
anywhere in history and just collect

3364
02:06:43,979 --> 02:06:48,479
some seeds or a clone if you wanted

3365
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:50,940
where would you go what time and what

3366
02:06:48,479 --> 02:06:51,899
are you collecting

3367
02:06:50,939 --> 02:06:53,759
um

3368
02:06:51,899 --> 02:06:56,219
I don't know because if you go too far

3369
02:06:53,760 --> 02:07:01,079
back in time it's going to be some boof

3370
02:06:56,219 --> 02:07:04,079
so I would probably go back

3371
02:07:01,079 --> 02:07:06,658
I would probably go back to uh

3372
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:09,198
when I was a little kid and my my uncle

3373
02:07:06,658 --> 02:07:13,319
was was growing and it probably snatched

3374
02:07:09,198 --> 02:07:16,019
snatched some of uh his clones from

3375
02:07:13,319 --> 02:07:17,579
from the uh garage that I that I would

3376
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:20,219
