thanks for coming back

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,560
ah thanks for having me buddy so

44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,879
first question this time what are you

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,240
currently smoking on at the moment

46
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,319
um it was a uh genius skunk fina

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,118
and popped out and it was like captain

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:51,599
crunch crunch berries and

49
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:54,239
it's real good kind of surprised me

50
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,679
is this a cross we can maybe expect in

51
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,959
the future

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
i don't know i have to uh i'll have to

53
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,199
show it to

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,640
uh mr soul there see if he likes it

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,399
but uh and i think he would like i kind

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
of discounted it because like

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,598
i kind of made it already knowing like

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
well

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,878
it's going to just turn out like genius

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,479
because like everything

61
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,878
kind of you know leans that way so um

62
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,560
i was like you know see what happens and

63
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,120
the whole time it was growing

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
i was like yeah it looks like genius and

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,920
it kind of smells like it

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
and same pretty much everything had a

67
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,079
little more resin a little more

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
structure

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,480
so i kind of discounted it and so uh i

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,200
was like popping the jars

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,560
and uh crunch berry smell came out and i

72
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,598
was like whoa

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
so i tried some and then kind of hooked

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,359
on it so it might be something

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,319
i have to make yeah that's interesting

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,239
because

77
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,639
i remember i think i mentioned before

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,200
that i had found a really genius

79
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,639
dominant

80
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,000
genius haze which is perfect because

81
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,199
that was exactly what i was looking for

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,719
i love genius

83
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,039
but it brings to mind the question for

84
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,080
me what's the ideal partner for genius

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,560
if she is so

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,040
dominant would you need to match that

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,199
with something equally dominant or no is

88
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,359
the ideal partner like something kind of

89
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,958
more quote submissive and just kind of

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
allowing her to shine what's your

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,680
theories on that

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,759
no no i guess it'd be like uh

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
whatever your whatever your end goal

94
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,639
would be if you're trying to make like

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,640
you know more like a replica of the mom

96
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,039
or if you're trying to make something

97
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,359
you know totally different maybe like

98
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,479
leaving certain attributes and

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,599
changing others you know um

100
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,798
so um yeah it kind of depends what you

101
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,039
would

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
your end goal would be like if i was

103
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,400
going

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
if i was gonna like back cross it and

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,060
try to get that phenotype kind of

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,200
isolated that probably

107
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,080
[Music]

108
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,438
like like when we did the green avenger

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
i would probably like use

110
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,919
like a male from that or something and

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
that crosses at least

112
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,000
probably two maybe three times till i

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
felt like it was pretty good

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,158
and then i would like probably filial

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,438
breed it

116
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,438
f3 f4 or something like that and i feel

117
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,238
like you would get a pretty good

118
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,959
representation of that you know that one

119
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,599
fino and

120
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,360
try to improve it along the way as well

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
because like any time i've ever tried to

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,439
like

123
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:30,079
really inbreed something i was trying to

124
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,639
you know fix certain things you know

125
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,519
while

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,639
maintaining the the good attributes too

127
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,039
it's kind of tricky sometimes

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,800
yeah okay and i mean that kind of makes

129
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
sense to me in a way because

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
the green avenger i think you even

131
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
mentioned this it's probably

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,280
the most replica of genius in seed form

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
of all the brothers grim offerings

134
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,799
but at the same time at least from what

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,439
i could see

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
seems to have that really i'm not gonna

137
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,560
say a lot more but

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
a little bit more aesthetic bud look

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
that kind of the space queen and the

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,639
the you know the derivatives of that had

141
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
would you try to retain that per se

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,800
or do you think that the genius has good

143
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,799
aesthetics as it is

144
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,079
i mean it it looks good as is but

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,079
you know it

146
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
like it's kind of a weird weird plant

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
too because like it it does like the

148
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,478
biomass thing

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,319
so like later you know like mid-40s and

150
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,918
then it starts getting interested in

151
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,839
like resin production

152
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,240
and like on a good run with it i mean it

153
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,478
looks pretty pretty darn good but

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,600
um the branches on it are kind of floppy

155
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,360
you know it's not like the most uh you

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,439
know structurally strong plant

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
especially for something to grow such

158
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,800
big bugs on it you know the yield on

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
it's like really nice

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
but um you got to keep up with all the

161
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,918
branches so

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,918
uh green avenger really you know

163
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,318
strengthened everything up and it also

164
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,279
reinforced a lot of the desirable traits

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,439
that like ran through the apollo lines

166
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,799
also like you know going back with it

167
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,719
it's not like

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,680
like a back cross per se but like a

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,080
generational back cross of taking those

170
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
desirable apollo jeans and then going

171
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,159
back

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,319
you know to the uh you know to the

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,520
grandma so um it seemed like you know it

174
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
fixed all the

175
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,240
the weak branching and giving it that

176
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,560
extra layer of resin

177
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:34,079
was really nice and the only thing

178
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,879
that i would say like that i would like

179
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,159
to see like

180
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
stronger in it or not really stronger

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
but

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,879
i guess more consistent um in the

183
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
progeny would be

184
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:49,519
the the the effect because

185
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,280
genius has a really really really nice

186
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,959
speedy effect to it and like some of

187
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,318
those green avengers

188
00:06:52,959 --> 00:07:00,079
would just put you put you like

189
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,400
ridiculously stoned you know um

190
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,318
my favorite one was like real speedy for

191
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,279
about like 40 minutes and then you would

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
just crash

193
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,159
like i mean crash hard um

194
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,879
which you know like the genius wouldn't

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,520
do so like i think like you can get

196
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,560
a certain way and then like if you

197
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,959
wanted to like replicate that chemo type

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,199
you you'd really have to hunker down on

199
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,799
that you know to get it get it just so

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,240
but i think like a couple of back

201
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
crosses from

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
say like a green avenger back to that

203
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
would would

204
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
you know isolate that a little bit

205
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,439
better

206
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,598
but it's just you know each step you'd

207
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,519
have to make sure to not

208
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,918
not let any of the weak branching back

209
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,560
into it you know

210
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,240
what would you consider in with all that

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
being said would you consider

212
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,160
just say doing s-ones of it to be a bit

213
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
of a waste of time

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
in regards to trying to put it in seed

215
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,598
perform because like maybe you could put

216
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,478
it in seed form in the most basic of

217
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,839
senses but

218
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,439
you would still have all the issues

219
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,399
which you just you know listed you would

220
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,839
try to improve on

221
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,519
or would you still consider doing just a

222
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,478
straight s one

223
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,758
well like if he did like s1 and then you

224
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,918
know found that

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
particular female that matched up to it

226
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,240
very well and if it could also

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,079
go through like stress testing and

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
everything and not like freak out

229
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,359
um maybe reversing that one back to the

230
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,478
mom

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,720
um you know

232
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,399
you you might be able to find something

233
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
in the progeny it would have like a

234
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,918
stronger structure

235
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
and if it's on that x chromosome going

236
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,399
back like that should

237
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,560
you know should improve it but um

238
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,958
you never really know to you until you

239
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,879
do it so

240
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,958
he might actually he might be working on

241
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:47,120
doing that here in the future

242
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,039
but um and then like the other

243
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
i guess like the op not the opposite way

244
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,599
thinking about another way of thinking

245
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
of it

246
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,278
is like you might have a certain female

247
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
that you can get just about everything

248
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,519
out of it

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
look smell taste um structure flowering

250
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,360
time

251
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,320
with calyx ratio colors etc

252
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
but like it never never has that that

253
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,560
good potency

254
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,559
that the uh that the original mom had

255
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,679
and i've noticed that like certain ones

256
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,159
like you can only get it to pass like

257
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,519
i think by reversing it out to something

258
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,639
else and then

259
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,839
um you know trying to recover it recover

260
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,679
it from there

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,600
um it just seems like certain things it

262
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,079
won't breed out you know

263
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,159
so you might actually have to like do

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
the back cross and the filial route on

265
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,879
one end

266
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
and then also like self it you know

267
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,240
we're not selfish but um

268
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,399
out reverse it now cross it to

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,560
maybe something else closely related in

270
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,120
the line to like go back to it

271
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,679
you know to really you know get every

272
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,879
single

273
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,759
point made you know from your structure

274
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,720
vigors and

275
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,240
redesigned stuff and resistances and

276
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
yada yada you know

277
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,799
so it might take like using kind of like

278
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,240
three different tools to

279
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:09,919
to get to your end goal definitely some

280
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,000
meaningful breeding in those ideas so

281
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,919
i guess if we're going to drag things

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,759
back to one of the main projects

283
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,519
everyone's interested from you the skunk

284
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,720
project how's it all going you know like

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,759
you want to give us a bit of an update

286
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
on it all

287
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:27,039
oh yeah yeah it's going real good um

288
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,200
it's like at this point

289
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,439
like we can hit we can hit a lot of

290
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,480
those uh phenos but it's not like

291
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,160
every single one and like some of them

292
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,159
tend to be a little more fuely and

293
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,278
you get the burnt rubber smell and then

294
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,480
like you know you can

295
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,480
lean to a more just kind of a

296
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
burnt rubber rotten meat and then

297
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
sometimes you get you know like a good

298
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
blend of everything

299
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,799
where it's coming out pretty pretty damn

300
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,838
skunky

301
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,319
so it's more or less like

302
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,120
getting it to the point to where you

303
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,200
know i could say all right guys here's

304
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
you know much seeds and when you pop

305
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,560
them all it's just

306
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
it's all skunk you know it's just you

307
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,799
gotta

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,639
you know pick which one you like the

309
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,479
best i guess you know

310
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:17,679
for like maybe flower time or you know

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,240
normal normal you know so

312
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,319
yeah sounds almost similar to like just

313
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680
a cindy 99 pheno hunt you know like

314
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
all the same you just pick the one you

315
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,000
like yeah pretty much

316
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,879
pretty much but i want to refine that

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,958
like a little bit

318
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,078
a little bit further than that you know

319
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,319
i just

320
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,278
i don't know i just can't i couldn't

321
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
have it out there

322
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,000
if like everything isn't you know firing

323
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,880
on all cylinders and

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,639
you know real good so i figure anything

325
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,240
it takes that much time you know

326
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,199
might as well make it super super

327
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,759
rad and put the extra time into it and

328
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
you know

329
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,838
make sure that everybody be happy with

330
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
it because if i gotta put my name on it

331
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,480
i don't want any bunk

332
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,560
you know going out there so i mean i

333
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
guess just to clarify for the die hard

334
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,359
fans

335
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
are we talking about a skunk project

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,120
here or a road kill skunk

337
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,879
project yeah yeah like because

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
if and like to me personally like i feel

339
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
like

340
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,560
if that's the same thing you know like

341
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,759
there really shouldn't be any

342
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,679
differentiation you know like if you got

343
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,399
a skunk it should smell like a skunk

344
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,838
you know like as simple as that because

345
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
you know the things that are dead on the

346
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,639
road that got ran over i mean you're

347
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,440
smelling their

348
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,320
their gland you know that that glam

349
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,560
burst and that

350
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,639
that skunk sprays out there so um

351
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,319
yeah so like i always kind of felt you

352
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
know that that

353
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,240
you know it was kind of messed up with

354
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
somebody you know it had that

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,759
the real sweet skunk you know and

356
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,919
started calling it that

357
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,639
so um yeah um so like yeah what i'm

358
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,838
working on

359
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,720
like if you if you did have a

360
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,079
differentiation of the two

361
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,680
i guess red kill skunk whatever the one

362
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:08,239
people would consider stinky air i guess

363
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,719
i think that's what the people are after

364
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
yeah

365
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,959
and so kind of with that being said

366
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,879
i have seen a few photos going around of

367
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,000
a few of our friends with a

368
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,078
plant called roadkill skunk number four

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
what's this is this just maybe a a

370
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,439
particular pheno that's

371
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,360
you know hitting all the right spots for

372
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,560
you no

373
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,120
no it's um so when i

374
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,319
when i really got to cranking down on

375
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,320
everything like a

376
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
you know i had like a bunch of older

377
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,040
stock that i had to get pollinated and

378
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,879
every herb

379
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:45,439
that pollinated germinated and um

380
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,919
there were a few things that you know

381
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
you

382
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,799
used to give us that funk back in the

383
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,599
day you know we're growing outdoors

384
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,198
but um you know i figured like i'd pop

385
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,040
them and check them out

386
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:01,039
and um i kind of just you know

387
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,240
was doing a pollination i had a client

388
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,278
and one of them in there

389
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,440
and it was like more of the sativa route

390
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:12,559
and um toss those in there get them made

391
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
um grew them out and like you know you

392
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,239
got you got some

393
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,838
some little skunky notes to it you know

394
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,680
like it's pretty good

395
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:25,360
um you get like the cheesy cheesy skunky

396
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,078
citrusy diesel a little bit with it um

397
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,959
and some of them would be more like i

398
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,679
don't know how to explain it other than

399
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,159
a sour apple green tea or something you

400
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,319
know

401
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,319
but nonetheless like you know it was

402
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
kind of just like for shits and grins so

403
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,440
what i did

404
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,799
um they were like 12 things they got hit

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,440
um early on to kind of get the project

406
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,958
rolling and uh that was one of them it

407
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
was like

408
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,479
wasn't gonna go that route but just kind

409
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,600
of did it

410
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,360
just cuz you know and um hooked up a few

411
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,079
friends with it and they grew them out

412
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,839
and you know everybody liked it a lot

413
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,638
they were like yeah it's funky as hell

414
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
but

415
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,120
it's like i know that like i mean yeah

416
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,919
it's skunky but like it gets a lot

417
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,919
better than that

418
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,519
you know it was just kind of like some

419
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,360
shits and giggles

420
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,560
stuff okay so if we just quickly

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,600
jump back to you mentioned earlier as

422
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,000
well as i've seen

423
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
photos of this one as well the uh the

424
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
skelly

425
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,479
cross to the skunk and i think he also

426
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,759
said there's the

427
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,920
chem dog in there as well um

428
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,519
what's what can we expect from that

429
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,559
would that be like an individual release

430
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,759
the chem cis

431
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:42,719
skunk skelly or just more of an r d

432
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,360
thing well that's kind of kind of more

433
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,278
of an r

434
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,480
d thing um you know you know how i only

435
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,958
and i always hook up

436
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,079
i've got friends and you know cool

437
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,679
people just to

438
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:58,719
just to be cool like that but um

439
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,719
um like uh

440
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,800
what's more to be seen out of that is

441
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,079
more like an isolation of the

442
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,078
of the mom um not

443
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,758
much is really going to change off of

444
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,758
that and

445
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:18,079
the hmm

446
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,000
put it um you kind of

447
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,439
you're kind of bringing a lot of family

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,198
jeans together

449
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,120
if you will and um

450
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,958
like the recombination that stuff it

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,159
worked out really well it was like you

452
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,198
know it was like spitting out

453
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,360
reflectives of

454
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,838
the mother plants you know they were

455
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,600
like a little bit of

456
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,600
little bit of variance you know which

457
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
you know i expect you know to see like

458
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,480
you know what

459
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,560
what what are the weirdos gonna come out

460
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,399
like and um

461
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,799
like one of the ones with the sister it

462
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,399
smells like uh

463
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:55,919
like yellow starburst candy

464
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,278
um like if you could have that smell

465
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,838
with like a patchouli

466
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,439
type incense you know so like alan was

467
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,199
like real off the wall

468
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,558
but like all the rest of them you know

469
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,359
kind of

470
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,720
garlicky and skunky and funky like that

471
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,399
sister was

472
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,480
um the one thing

473
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,759
i noticed like when doing the light leak

474
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,640
stress testing

475
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,439
um they resisted all that you know very

476
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,079
well there was

477
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,919
one that kind of you know tapped out a

478
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,078
little bit toward the end but

479
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,000
it wasn't the last you know that last

480
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,839
week and like i mean it's a pretty

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,119
pretty decent light leak i was giving

482
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,359
them too

483
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,279
so they did a lot a lot better than what

484
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,479
i'd even thought they would do

485
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,279
but i did notice like just like the mom

486
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,279
um when they were at that that that

487
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,038
prime time harvest window that they were

488
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,000
going to try to poke at least one or two

489
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,359
nanners out

490
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,839
you know somewhere in the top of the

491
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,798
canopy and um

492
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,639
they resisted the light leak and you

493
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,639
might could say that maybe that was like

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,640
their point of tapping out but

495
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
the mom kind of does that too you know

496
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,360
it wants to push that little one out

497
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,400
like at that that peak peak harvest time

498
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,879
it seems

499
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,519
so i kind of didn't pay that as much

500
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
mine

501
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,279
you know i was just kind of looking at

502
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,079
more of what was

503
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,960
what was retained and it was nice to see

504
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,119
that

505
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,558
you know they didn't they didn't really

506
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,839
you know freak out

507
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,599
but um out of the test group um

508
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,678
there were a few of them that had didn't

509
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,079
even have the the late manner you know

510
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
it was

511
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,839
100 are mad for date free which

512
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,959
you know really surprised me and then

513
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,038
out of those uh

514
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
one of them actually also happened to be

515
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,200
the best one

516
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,720
you know so that told me hey

517
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,960
you know you're on the right track you

518
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,360
don't have to sacrifice in

519
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,640
any of the other stuff you know like

520
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,479
like that late niner

521
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,160
trait you know that's wanting to push

522
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
out during the peak time

523
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,080
like hey the the best pheno didn't do

524
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,798
that it also resisted

525
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,720
you know a lot of stress too and turned

526
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,839
out to be the most potent and the most

527
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,880
uh representative of the mom as well so

528
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,839
i was like huh

529
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
cool so maybe you know in a couple of

530
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,558
generations we can fix that

531
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,400
and kind of have more like a pure pure

532
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,960
kim seed

533
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,200
that's the goal of this and how many

534
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,880
generations do you think it would take

535
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,000
to get such a thing only one way to find

536
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,679
out buddy

537
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,798
um but i mean just just based off of

538
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,798
what i saw on the f1 i mean

539
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,879
you know if i want if i wanted to be

540
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,519
like a real shortcut [ __ ] i'd just be

541
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,280
exit one time and i bet you i'd be there

542
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,558
but um

543
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,440
um i don't know i think

544
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,720
if if we're gonna have it more like a

545
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,400
seed form of the

546
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,640
of the mother um i think at least

547
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,480
you know three or four back crosses and

548
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,520
maybe a filial

549
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,599
breeding after that maybe or

550
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,519
i don't know it's it's really hard to

551
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,959
tell until you really get into it

552
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,798
and you know start working them and

553
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
growing them and then you kind of

554
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,158
kind of see what direction you're going

555
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,960
to have to go but

556
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,440
um [ __ ] just in the f1 i was i was real

557
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,360
happy with it though

558
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
so i mean to draw you back to a point

559
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,038
you made before you said you know

560
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,798
it's all kind of drawing on a lot of

561
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,158
similar genetics in this cross just to

562
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,720
remind everyone we're talking about

563
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,080
skelly original skunk as well as the

564
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,319
chem sis

565
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,678
something i notice is people frequently

566
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,879
reference skelly

567
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,480
as like a skunky strain and i always

568
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,320
inquire about that and there's almost

569
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
like this pause for a moment they're

570
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,399
like oh

571
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,400
no i just meant it tasted skunky

572
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,159
and it's almost like i don't know you

573
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,360
know not to sound weird it sounds like

574
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,080
you know like some people out there

575
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,359
maybe think there's skunk in it i guess

576
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,158
well that's like kind of the impression

577
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:56,158
i get do you think anything about that

578
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:59,600
well it's really stinky um

579
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,720
i wouldn't call it skunky but it's nasty

580
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:06,959
you know um

581
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,960
and the the the main components of it

582
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,480
um being is what it is it's like an old

583
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,200
seed bank um hash plate you know like a

584
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,360
neville

585
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,640
made hash plant and i want to say it was

586
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,479
like nl1

587
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,960
across to like a male of nl5 and then l2

588
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,720
or something like that so like i know

589
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,600
that it's like it's primarily

590
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,759
it's like a northern lights combination

591
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,158
focusing more on the shorter phenos and

592
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:38,319
more indica dominant phenos

593
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,400
so um you know it it definitely it's

594
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,439
stinky as a [ __ ] but it's

595
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,200
like to me it was like more more fuelly

596
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,960
spicy hashy you know but um

597
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
like i mean if you had like a bud in

598
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,558
your pocket and that here's the other

599
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,559
thing too is like to me

600
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:58,319
a lot of weed can smell skunky um

601
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,158
but like something i've noticed is like

602
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,599
a you know weed in a jar

603
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,440
as you're smelling it like all

604
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,519
concentrated like that

605
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,880
when you when you take like a bud out

606
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,400
and you let it breathe

607
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
you know and it's able to permeate and

608
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,440
especially like if it gets hot

609
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,079
you know if you're just walking around

610
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,840
with a bud in your pocket like in a bag

611
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,759
you know a lot of weed can smell really

612
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,720
skunky you know

613
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,720
but um sure i forgot where i was going

614
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,360
with that man

615
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
i mean ultimately right i think maybe

616
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,479
one of the other

617
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,558
implications we get is something a lot

618
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,038
of guests have referenced in that

619
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,720
the roadkill skunk itself or even more

620
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,919
so just those extremely

621
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,679
accurate skunky smells may actually be

622
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,559
something which is more of like an

623
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,919
afghani artifact as opposed to like a

624
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:50,158
sam the skunk man type thing oh yeah

625
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,600
absolutely um yeah i'm always on that

626
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,600
same line of thought

627
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,359
that a lot of the skunkier stuff from

628
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,639
back in the day were like afghani

629
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,158
hybrids

630
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,038
and um like skunk afghan hybrids

631
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,840
as well as like northern light skunk

632
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,079
hybrids

633
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,959
and those tended to be you know

634
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,678
everything that

635
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,079
ranged like from garlic to fecal you

636
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,480
know

637
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,639
and everything in between coffee beans

638
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,640
slash skunk burnt rubber

639
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,759
that whole side of the spectrum you know

640
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,280
interesting so another post i've seen

641
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,480
which i think might be in relation to

642
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,720
all of this is

643
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,519
you've referenced in a few posts

644
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,360
something about

645
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,200
the masterpiece you know what is the

646
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,279
masterpiece

647
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,120
ah that's like all my little all my

648
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,359
little projects i've been working on for

649
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,879
so long and finally have them all

650
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:44,079
done all completed and just be done

651
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,960
like uh then i feel good about it you

652
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,879
know

653
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,319
so because like a lot of projects you

654
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,520
know there's a lot of years on some

655
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,119
stuff too

656
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,798
and some stuff i don't really get to

657
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,558
talk about because you know i just kind

658
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,839
of want to keep it dl

659
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,960
but um it'd just be really nice to have

660
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,678
it all done and

661
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,079
you know people can enjoy it and like

662
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,240
the thing is like i made everything kind

663
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,359
of for me

664
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,359
my snobby uh weed standard so

665
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,119
i kind of figure if i really like it you

666
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,918
know other people would probably like it

667
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,798
too

668
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,880
so um yeah it'll just kind of be the end

669
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,839
of the road i'm making a few things that

670
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,360
i was

671
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,798
pretty proud of and it'll be all

672
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:29,199
all finito and so

673
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,119
can people expect to be able to maybe

674
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,558
grab a few of these finito

675
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:38,000
projects at the emerald cup um

676
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,720
well some of them like it's um

677
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
it's just some stuff that's um been like

678
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,480
steps into making

679
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,079
making those things but yeah like i'll

680
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,079
always have some

681
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,480
some neat you know neat things with me

682
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,558
and there were things that i made like

683
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,038
intermediary steps or

684
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,038
things that i made just to like kind of

685
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,158
study like what a male is doing across

686
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,240
the broad spectrum

687
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,000
and after running them and growing them

688
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
and testing them smoking them stressing

689
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
them and everything like

690
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,840
they were really super awesome you know

691
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,080
but it's like

692
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,079
it was never intended to be the project

693
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,960
it was just more of a study of like how

694
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,639
the males

695
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,079
you know kind of going along with

696
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,840
another female

697
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,038
and um you know stuff was really awesome

698
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,439
so like i'll have

699
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,640
some of those things and like i'll hold

700
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,080
on to them like

701
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,480
a little while because you know i'm

702
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,359
still you know researching them and

703
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
looking at them

704
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,038
and you know making sure that you know i

705
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
know

706
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:39,278
what i need to know and um

707
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,319
i don't particularly want to just say oh

708
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,400
okay here you go

709
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,038
everybody you know when it's like part

710
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,320
of a program that i'm working as well

711
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,400
so um a lot of it's stuff like that like

712
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,720
so many steps have been made

713
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
you know i consider them what's left of

714
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,400
the

715
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,119
what i made to do all the testing with

716
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,519
um

717
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,038
you know i can let some of those out but

718
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,319
they're real limited

719
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,158
limited quantities so

720
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,158
yeah i mean it's interesting that you're

721
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,278
gonna do it that way because i think

722
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,960
it's almost

723
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,519
one of the best ways because something i

724
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,240
noticed was a while ago someone posted a

725
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,200
photo of

726
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,839
growing out cindy 88 and it was like

727
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,840
everyone

728
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,240
in the comments was like wow you got to

729
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,240
grow out like one of the steps in like

730
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,519
you know the overall process and like

731
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,519
obviously you know there's a lot of kind

732
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,359
of excitement as to you know there'd be

733
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,599
more variation that'd be cool to see

734
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,558
you know all that type of stuff so i

735
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,558
think in a way

736
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,639
it's almost like the most rarest of the

737
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,119
limited edition

738
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,159
yeah absolutely like that headband with

739
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,239
the super sativa c club skunk one on it

740
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,440
i mean it's really it's really

741
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,480
phenomenal you know

742
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,038
it's really really awesome but um

743
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,640
like i said with that one i was just

744
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,919
more or less like looking at what the

745
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,480
male does

746
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,600
in a in a related cross you know like

747
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
being able to see like

748
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:03,759
chem 91 with the same male sister d with

749
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,600
the same male

750
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,038
and things that were outside of that

751
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,959
family too you know

752
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,798
like all types of things across the

753
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,720
board and really figure out

754
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,558
you know what was happening but like

755
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,600
with that one with headband i mean he

756
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:21,200
throws like huge big old fat colas

757
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,839
and real stinky lime candy kush

758
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,880
like uh a little skunkiness to it as

759
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,158
well you know

760
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,799
but um real killer but you know like i

761
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,159
got a handful of those and a bunch of

762
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,679
bunch of little jewels so i have them

763
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,360
with me at emerald and

764
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,600
like when they're gone they're gone like

765
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,599
i'm not you know gonna be making more of

766
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,199
them or anything

767
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,719
so that's interesting you mentioned that

768
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,798
as well because i was gonna ask a

769
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,839
question about the dead bands

770
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,398
um mostly i was gonna say

771
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,079
do you see it as a potential source for

772
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,278
you know like future work maybe like a

773
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,158
new mail but

774
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,960
i actually realized a better question is

775
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
have you ever

776
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,399
been doing a similar thing you know

777
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,480
where you're testing out the mail

778
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,639
and then you do maybe not necessarily a

779
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,599
dead band but you trial out one of the

780
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
crosses and

781
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,240
and it just catches you off guard and

782
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
you're like [ __ ] i've got to work this

783
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,319
out

784
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
yeah oh yeah that that happens uh quite

785
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,519
frequently

786
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,679
because like um in certain cases

787
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,038
you you'll do something and be like wow

788
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,919
that didn't work out at all

789
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,599
it's complete [ __ ] there's opposite into

790
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,759
that spectrum of like

791
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:35,038
holy mother like that is like

792
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,359
far far exceeded what i'd expected

793
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,240
and then you realize like well hey you

794
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,079
know

795
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,440
if i could work that a little bit better

796
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,079
that could actually like change the

797
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,558
whole

798
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,439
the whole duration of the process up and

799
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,359
you might yeah

800
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,200
you might end up wanting to work one

801
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,398
line a little bit longer

802
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,159
and more you know to go back out to

803
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,519
something else and it would improve it

804
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,880
make it that much better

805
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,720
so you will you will run into that

806
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,880
you know like both of them you know

807
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,360
stuff where you're like ah that sucks

808
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,399
and then stuff that's like wow that that

809
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,558
could actually

810
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,519
work and improving something else

811
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,879
because like if you're

812
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,720
you know really studying those males and

813
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,120
how the gene pairs are like transferring

814
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,880
with each other um

815
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,558
you know you can you can see like a

816
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,320
method to the madness

817
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,519
and that's typically how like the

818
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,200
improvements go

819
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,278
you know so yeah

820
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,480
yep you would definitely definitely want

821
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,839
to do that

822
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
okay so i mean if you were going to do a

823
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,158
cubing project

824
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,200
for example would you want to use a male

825
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,679
that was

826
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,240
very similar to the female in question

827
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,240
or something

828
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,038
radically different in order to have

829
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,640
easier differentiation i guess

830
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:55,278
i guess like because after it's all said

831
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,919
and done you're gonna have six percent

832
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,359
of some genes after after four back

833
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,278
crosses right

834
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:05,678
so i guess it's whatever the

835
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,480
the six percent that you would want left

836
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,120
over

837
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,399
as well as like how something that was

838
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,719
opposite

839
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:13,918
how it bred into that first f1

840
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,880
generation

841
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,880
and and you know i've

842
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,720
you know there's two lines of thought

843
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,200
with it but i

844
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
you know i can say like if you do go the

845
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,720
opposite way

846
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,000
so it's easier to tell out traits in the

847
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,798
males you know for

848
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,919
further back cross and um using

849
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,599
something opposite

850
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,159
you know can make that easier but as the

851
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,839
the process continues you know you're

852
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
you're up in the frequency of those

853
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,079
genes from the mother that you're back

854
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,918
crossing to

855
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,839
or the dad that you're using in a back

856
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,360
crossing so

857
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:55,599
um you you know

858
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,599
it really comes down to like growing out

859
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,398
that that f1 generation

860
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,839
very very very thoroughly and it can

861
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,079
make it tricky if you're using something

862
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,879
that's

863
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,720
you know maybe looks the same but acts

864
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,480
completely different

865
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
but if i was gonna go like the

866
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,319
similarity route

867
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,079
me personally i've always been a fan of

868
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,720
like jumping back into the same gene

869
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,798
pool

870
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,480
maybe not the exact same clones and the

871
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,918
exact same thing

872
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,919
but but it is the same gene pool

873
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,519
you know might not be that clone and

874
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,600
that exact male

875
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,599
or what have you but if you're already

876
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,879
like jumping back into that gene pool

877
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,639
during your

878
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,320
you know your your first grow out of

879
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
this f1 that you're going to try to

880
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,839
select a male from

881
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,679
after you've looked at enough of those

882
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,959
females you can see how everything's

883
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
kind of put together

884
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,880
and then that'll you know can lead you

885
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,039
on your on your journey to finding your

886
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
mail that you're going to back cross

887
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,200
um and then that's where the

888
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,079
improvements can come in as well

889
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,919
you know so say like a green avenger if

890
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,439
that was or

891
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
you know if we were going to do that

892
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
genius project right

893
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,959
you know we'd want to go with that green

894
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,640
avenger and like you know we're already

895
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,159
kind of there because when we grow out

896
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,919
the f1

897
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,760
you know version of that of course it's

898
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,559
like very very similar

899
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,720
um the backside of it is like you have

900
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:20,000
so many of those genes that are already

901
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,960
back into that pool that you know you

902
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,480
you might really water it down like

903
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,159
sometimes you know not everything

904
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,079
responds the same so like you can

905
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,120
inbreed something

906
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,599
weak you know what i mean um

907
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,719
there's a lot to be said for for hybrid

908
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,119
vigor too

909
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,000
so i mean there's there's a lot of

910
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,678
different

911
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,200
different routes you could go with that

912
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,038
man

913
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,038
there's also the line of thought of um

914
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,519
using two different males to do the

915
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,798
first f1 that aren't related

916
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,159
um if you can have them both in that

917
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,158
same gene pool

918
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,159
and back cross two separate lines um

919
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,159
and at the end of their cubing combine

920
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,799
them um

921
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
that that like that little six percent

922
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,319
difference on

923
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,158
on both sides you know um can

924
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,038
reintroduce like a bit of the hybrid

925
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,039
bigger

926
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:18,558
you know so that's interesting i got

927
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:21,119
so many questions um first one

928
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,240
do you think that doing a few back

929
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,558
crosses let's say

930
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,278
you know more extreme example be cindy

931
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,319
where you know

932
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,000
got four do you think that you've really

933
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,278
lost hybrid bigger at that point or do

934
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,119
you think it takes a lot longer than

935
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,880
that to lose it

936
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,959
um it depends but if you think about it

937
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,480
like this like

938
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,480
say like you know you're talking about

939
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,240
the princess clone

940
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,759
if you knew it came out of some some

941
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,880
jack hair right

942
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,278
so you got that far um if you figure

943
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,399
that

944
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:55,599
nl5 and skunk are part of that jack hair

945
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,119
you use nl5 skunk to start your cubing

946
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,519
process

947
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,319
so you take in l5 skunk and pollinate

948
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,240
princess with

949
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,720
it you know that you're kind of you're

950
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,558
back into the gene pool

951
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,759
but yet you're you're still quite

952
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,079
different because

953
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,559
it's not jack that you're starting with

954
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,879
right you know you're using like a

955
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,799
two-thirds of the combination plus you

956
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,838
got an unknown male on there too

957
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,399
perhaps or you just say unknown pollen

958
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,440
donor

959
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:27,279
in there and

960
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,280
um you um

961
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,519
doing it like that i don't think like

962
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,878
you'll run it down as hard

963
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:39,119
um but say like

964
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:42,559
if the say like the bud

965
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,879
that the seed came out of that you had

966
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:50,799
that clone and

967
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:53,039
some other type of pollen donor um

968
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,440
if you started cubing from there you

969
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,480
might actually

970
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,480
kind of be more

971
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,519
more pure before like you would hit say

972
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:07,679
like that point of like where you're

973
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:10,079
you're starting to water down again um

974
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,440
so and and different things act

975
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,400
differently too

976
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,079
like we have a skunk at a f10 you know

977
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,920
it doesn't lose vigor but i've had

978
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,880
things that you know if you brought them

979
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,599
from f3 to f4 it hit like a big

980
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
a big drop off you know so different

981
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,920
things are gonna

982
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:30,078
kind of respond differently too and so

983
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,400
if we just jump back to a point you made

984
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,079
earlier in regards to say you know

985
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,240
you do your cubing project with two

986
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,200
lines and combine them at the end

987
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,719
do you think a lot of the

988
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,279
characteristics that people would

989
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:44,078
consider unique to a cubing process like

990
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,839
i guess most notably people will say

991
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
that the more inbred a line is

992
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,599
the more dominant it will be when you

993
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,400
cross it to things you know so if you

994
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,440
cross like

995
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,639
you know a bx4 to just like an f1

996
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,559
you generally get you know more

997
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,358
dominance from the bx4

998
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,199
and so with that in mind when you said

999
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,239
you know you combined those two lines

1000
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,159
together

1001
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,078
technically it'd be an f1 right because

1002
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,559
they've got slightly different genetics

1003
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,920
even though

1004
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,639
very similar um would you consider it to

1005
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,240
still be

1006
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,759
like have all the properties of like a

1007
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,838
cube at that point or

1008
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,520
more have like more f1 than the average

1009
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,480
cube so to speak or like you know what i

1010
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,639
mean

1011
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,440
well what you would have you would have

1012
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,078
extremely consistent f1

1013
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,599
you know like when you did hit that f1

1014
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,640
generation

1015
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,400
you you would have a lot of a lot of

1016
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,239
good attributes you know it wouldn't be

1017
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,160
like a poly hybrid f1

1018
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:40,879
you know um it would already kind of be

1019
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,078
kind of be locked up but still you know

1020
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,358
technically

1021
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,839
uh it's still a f1 hybrid just because

1022
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,000
you know

1023
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,599
from both sides you had six percent and

1024
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,960
six percent that weren't

1025
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,599
you know um they weren't that clone

1026
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,800
so you still have that difference and

1027
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,920
then when you combine you make the f1

1028
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,839
um you know you're you

1029
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,760
you've you've gotten it you've gotten it

1030
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,199
all back back together

1031
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,400
and um i think from there like if you

1032
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,519
you know if that's where you were

1033
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,920
looking to to breed from from there like

1034
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,440
you know

1035
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,680
by f3 like that should be

1036
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,800
consistent as hell you know like you

1037
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,199
should really be

1038
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,480
throwing like the very consistently the

1039
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,960
same phenotype

1040
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,480
by f3 if you you know if you cube two

1041
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,039
separate line

1042
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,920
you know to the same to the same mother

1043
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,880
and then combine

1044
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,880
make the f1 and continue to f3 by that

1045
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
point you should be really really really

1046
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,559
tight

1047
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,760
very tight tolerances at that point yeah

1048
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,440
wow

1049
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,320
i guess that's what we could only hope

1050
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,838
all f1 will become in the future right

1051
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,559
yeah that wouldn't hold your breath

1052
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,400
buddy

1053
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,639
so i've seen recently not only the use

1054
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,480
of

1055
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,920
s1s but even s2s as breeding mothers for

1056
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,039
a few different breeders out there how

1057
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,838
do you feel about this and is it

1058
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,159
something you would ever consider to do

1059
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:06,639
yourself

1060
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,799
it might be might be what you have to do

1061
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,199
you know i mean it's like

1062
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,119
you know reversing and filial breeding

1063
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,399
and back crossing i mean all that

1064
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,160
you know they're just like different

1065
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,639
tools to get to the goal

1066
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,000
that you're looking to get to and

1067
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,960
whatever

1068
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,880
whatever tool you need to use you know

1069
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,440
by all means go for it

1070
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,320
so like in the case of the the clone

1071
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,159
that can only

1072
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
you know really breed out that that real

1073
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,440
stellar potency through you know a

1074
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,519
reversal

1075
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,960
you know that might be what you have to

1076
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,719
do you know

1077
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,559
and then you know you might have to to

1078
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,279
go the other route you know with males

1079
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,759
and

1080
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
back crossing and out crossing and

1081
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,280
taking f3

1082
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,159
to read the rest of it you know very

1083
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,480
consistent

1084
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,759
and you might have to take that f3 that

1085
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,760
you've read

1086
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,520
and go to the one that you reversed to

1087
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
say like s2

1088
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,639
you know to make sure that you're

1089
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,480
hitting that uh if

1090
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,879
if you can get it to breed that way that

1091
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,079
is to to get that potency

1092
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,680
as well okay well the devil's in the

1093
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,039
details with this one so i'll give you a

1094
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,879
real example

1095
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,719
maybe not an s1 or an s2 but would you

1096
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,039
no not would you but let's just say you

1097
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,358
have to you have to breed with

1098
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,960
a feminized plant it's probably going to

1099
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,119
be like a pretty well known one which

1100
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,480
one would you pick out of all the femmes

1101
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,240
good clones that have come from a

1102
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,838
fantasy that you're aware of

1103
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,838
which one would you pick so to speak

1104
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,200
what none of them

1105
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,519
uh no no i just didn't um so you're just

1106
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:47,039
asking me like if i could pick like a

1107
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,159
like a reversed uh plant like which one

1108
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,119
would it be

1109
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,920
like yeah yeah well like there's a bunch

1110
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,119
there's a bunch of

1111
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,000
clones that have come from like femme

1112
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,160
seeds right

1113
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,519
and like or something right

1114
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,838
um yeah or like any of it right

1115
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:08,318
yeah yeah yeah yeah power diesel or

1116
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,838
something right

1117
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:16,079
yeah um yeah so yeah what do you reckon

1118
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,078
which one would you pick um

1119
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,719
for and you said for stability yeah

1120
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,559
i mean i guess maybe i figured what you

1121
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,239
pick would have be

1122
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,199
based on like something like stability

1123
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,879
but i mean you could pick up for

1124
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,159
whatever reason you want

1125
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,440
ah [ __ ] man

1126
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,519
um hmm

1127
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,358
you know like uh like from like some of

1128
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,759
the little side projects and working

1129
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,119
like

1130
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,359
headbands pretty damn gnarly like

1131
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,160
doesn't really have any like what i

1132
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,960
would call like bad tendencies to it

1133
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,519
it's well behaved yields good it's very

1134
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,760
potent

1135
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:58,239
you know so headband's always a good one

1136
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,359
jumping onto the next one i guess after

1137
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,239
you've finished

1138
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,159
the kind of skunk project is there

1139
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,159
anything on the horizon that you're kind

1140
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,199
of eyeing off already is maybe

1141
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,440
next project um

1142
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,719
no not really because like by the time

1143
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,519
it's all said and done

1144
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,919
like you know like i work on multiple

1145
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,039
things

1146
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,119
at the same time um

1147
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,559
so like when that's coming to fruition

1148
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,160
you know there's a bunch of other stuff

1149
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,838
coming to fruition too

1150
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:30,879
um that 187 with the screaming eagle

1151
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,519
that was you know um that was one of

1152
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,760
them

1153
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:37,759
um so essentially trying to make my own

1154
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,240
little

1155
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:45,119
uh g13 hash plan of sorts you know

1156
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,598
so i had to make all the all the steps

1157
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,559
to

1158
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,200
get to there so that was a little bit of

1159
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,318
a

1160
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:55,439
little bit of an endeavor is that

1161
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:58,480
the uh 88 bx or

1162
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,760
something a little different no that's

1163
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,760
um so i took a kandahar afghani and i

1164
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,680
pollinated the 88

1165
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,520
grew out a bunch select the male um

1166
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:15,679
real real nice you know very 88 dominant

1167
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:20,318
and then i hit the airborne g13 with it

1168
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,318
so that made the stream an eagle um

1169
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,519
like the the phenotypes of it um

1170
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,679
you know fairly consistent um here and

1171
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,679
there you'd see that afghani

1172
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,279
pop up like it made like a thicker bud

1173
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,358
but the smell flavor

1174
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,960
potency was like pretty true across the

1175
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,199
board which i liked

1176
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,760
but there was this one in particular

1177
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,799
that and i didn't keep a clone of it

1178
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,560
and like i told myself like no keeping

1179
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,240
claims of this run because it's going to

1180
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,599
make you complacent and then you're not

1181
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,598
going to grow anymore because like

1182
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,200
you're just going to have this clone

1183
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,599
so anyways man i don't take the clone

1184
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,118
and like i'm kicking myself in the ass

1185
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,800
for it but anyways

1186
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,599
it had a lot more um of the 88 dominance

1187
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,839
because like that airborne g13 like

1188
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,519
it's a strong breeder you know and like

1189
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,440
it really shines through

1190
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:16,400
later in the uh in the offspring so

1191
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,838
um that one in particular had that

1192
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,200
little bit more 88

1193
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:24,559
influence and um god man

1194
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,879
it was great it was like uh

1195
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,159
like taste the rainbow style you know

1196
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,160
like uh

1197
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,078
like every type of fruit candy like

1198
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,719
smell all wrapped into like one

1199
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,680
it was really really exceptional and it

1200
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,838
uh

1201
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,960
the the flavor of it too man it really

1202
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,199
coated your mouth

1203
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,039
you know stayed lingering for a long

1204
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,159
long time and i was like man that's

1205
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,519
really nice

1206
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:50,799
and uh really nice relaxing

1207
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,759
chill effect to it as well you know very

1208
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,960
potent

1209
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,400
so um anyways you know i was pretty

1210
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,280
happy with that

1211
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,119
yeah so had to continue to keep growing

1212
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,000
them keep growing them until

1213
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,519
you know if i'm like the girl that i'm

1214
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,559
really truly happy with

1215
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,440
and you know get that part done at the

1216
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,000
same time

1217
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,599
um i wanted to add a little more 88

1218
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,239
influence into it

1219
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,240
so knowing that the the cinderella 99

1220
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,039
male that i had picked out

1221
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,519
um it didn't really take too much away

1222
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,159
from the moms and if anything it donated

1223
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,480
a little

1224
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,639
few good things to it made it a little

1225
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,920
faster flowering

1226
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,559
made the the bud size pretty you know

1227
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,400
a lot bigger than what it was but it

1228
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,159
retained the purple color

1229
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:44,160
that purpley grapey smell um

1230
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:47,039
water a lot of really good things so um

1231
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,598
very potent as well so i wanted to take

1232
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,639
the uh

1233
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:55,440
i was calling it 187 because of the 88

1234
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:58,400
c99 you get it

1235
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,599
uh male 1 and hitting the best screaming

1236
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,760
eagle female

1237
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,240
and that should that should combine

1238
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,760
everything just right for me it should

1239
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,759
be real good

1240
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,119
and then i had stuff uh going on with

1241
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,319
the orange project

1242
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,640
um with that orange uh it was like cali

1243
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,759
o

1244
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:20,159
eric 77's calioclone

1245
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,640
to sativa c club skunk one and then um

1246
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,239
doing a few projects with that i mean

1247
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,759
i'd have the orange thing

1248
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,239
and then um had some other stuff going

1249
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,240
on with um

1250
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,799
oh the um uh smokers

1251
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,199
so i'm making some uh strawberry stuff

1252
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,200
as well

1253
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,358
cheese again that's a lot of a lot of

1254
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,039
little odds and ends plus the skunks

1255
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,119
plus the kim's and

1256
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,318
kimmy skunks and this and that's you

1257
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,680
know

1258
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,519
and everything yeah and i mean i just

1259
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:54,078
kind of figured just hold back and get

1260
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,719
it all

1261
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,880
you know work just right and perfect and

1262
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:02,239
when i'm real happy with it and then

1263
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,920
then it'll be done um

1264
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,439
then there was some other things that i

1265
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,880
had thrown into the mix

1266
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,400
that uh i had reversed the chem dog onto

1267
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,920
a bunch of stuff too

1268
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,720
and been hunting through that here

1269
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,159
lately so that's uh that's pretty cool

1270
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:20,799
too

1271
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:25,759
which cam come dog

1272
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,760
the only yeah 91 yeah

1273
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:34,078
so the next question i guess then is

1274
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,199
what do you think about uh the idea

1275
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,039
of like standout phenotypes being

1276
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,598
associated with

1277
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,440
uh trifoliation or you know whirling

1278
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,039
phyllo taxis

1279
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,720
soul mentioned that with the queen of

1280
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,239
soul and i've seen the idea also

1281
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,519
mentioned by a few other people and i

1282
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,000
was just always under the impression

1283
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,000
that

1284
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
you know the whole trifoliate slash

1285
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,318
whirling file taxi was

1286
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,318
actually like not related to like a

1287
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,358
phenotype per se but more just something

1288
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,039
which would have like you know like a

1289
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,759
probability of affecting each and every

1290
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,639
plant

1291
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,160
where do you sit on that one um i've

1292
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,920
seen it go both ways

1293
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,838
like um the the foul attacks is like

1294
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,119
i've seen that have like

1295
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:18,078
some adverse effects you know um

1296
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,000
you'll see it in certain plants like pop

1297
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,318
up here and there but not like

1298
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,559
consistently like where you could like

1299
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,079
apply like the golden mean to it or any

1300
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,680
[ __ ] like that

1301
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:34,318
but um on triple eights

1302
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:37,679
um i've always kind of viewed it as like

1303
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:40,159
um given the rarity of it you know it's

1304
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,639
not something you see every single day

1305
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,639
um that it was kind of like the plant's

1306
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,838
way of trying to evolve

1307
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,960
you know so you know i've seen it in

1308
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,799
certain cases

1309
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,400
where it didn't work out too good but

1310
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,160
that's not to say

1311
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,079
because it was a trifle eight you know

1312
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:56,799
it could just been like some [ __ ] jeans

1313
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,559
in the pool

1314
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,720
you know and it just came out shitty

1315
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,240
because trifle eight or not it was just

1316
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,959
destined to be shitty

1317
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,679
um but i've also seen it work out very

1318
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,519
exceptional and once again

1319
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:14,558
i you know i couldn't say for sure

1320
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:18,079
but it it's also turned out

1321
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,720
um to where that did

1322
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,599
become like a distinguishing trait that

1323
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:25,118
you wanted to

1324
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,440
look for in the males you know so

1325
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,440
um

1326
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,159
you know it actually make your make your

1327
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,559
hunt a lot easier if

1328
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,000
if that is like what you're kind of

1329
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,000
looking forward to

1330
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,800
so if you have noticed the correlation

1331
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,920
like definitely the trifoliate females

1332
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,519
you know were the ones that really

1333
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,280
really really kicked it off like

1334
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,318
100 notches um ideally you'd want to

1335
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,760
look for that

1336
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,519
that triflate male and you could

1337
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,079
actually you know if you knew that

1338
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,719
for fact is what you were going for you

1339
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,640
could sprout

1340
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:06,159
a pretty huge population and um

1341
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:08,159
not take up much space but you know i

1342
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,239
have seen trophies like turn into

1343
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,799
triflates later on too

1344
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,078
so but a lot of the times you know from

1345
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,559
the from the get-go

1346
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,480
they're you know going to be expressing

1347
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,640
themselves

1348
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,440
yeah okay so a question i've got

1349
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,960
which i mean you could apply to that

1350
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,760
previous question really perfectly if

1351
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,280
you wanted is

1352
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,119
how many generations do you think it

1353
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,559
would take to be able to breed

1354
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,880
one very specific trait into a strain

1355
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,319
you know while obviously trying to not

1356
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,480
[ __ ] up too much of the other things

1357
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,079
going on so you know yeah like if i said

1358
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,079
i've got a strain and it's perfect in

1359
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,200
every way and i just want to get one new

1360
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,200
trade in there you know

1361
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:48,639
how many generations approximately do

1362
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,399
you think you'd be looking at like if i

1363
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,960
said to you know can you give me an eta

1364
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
so

1365
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,079
you might you know what i mean like what

1366
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,960
would you tell me is what i'd be looking

1367
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,920
at

1368
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,800
um depends like because if it breeds

1369
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,599
true or not

1370
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,800
you know if it pops up as a recessive

1371
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,240
then

1372
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,280
and also like the you you're looking

1373
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,679
like for like uh

1374
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,599
like a clone or are you looking for a

1375
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,000
seed line that's like consistently

1376
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,119
spitting

1377
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,480
that trade out yeah i guess like a

1378
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,358
seedline

1379
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,679
all right well i mean it i i've seen it

1380
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,799
done

1381
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:26,159
in one i've seen it done in one step

1382
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,318
like and it just works you know but that

1383
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,199
doesn't happen a lot

1384
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,318
so it would depend on what trait if it

1385
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,199
breeds true

1386
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,800
for that trade or not and the frequency

1387
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,799
that you see of that trait

1388
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,280
and you know each generation and monitor

1389
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,839
the the percentage the increase of like

1390
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,040
the

1391
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:49,358
the the more desirable trait

1392
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,960
frequency that you're seeing until

1393
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:55,039
you're you know you're happy with it

1394
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,920
so um

1395
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,679
so like if it's like with color right so

1396
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,838
like they had to be purple

1397
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:05,838
um you know you might notice

1398
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,119
it could be like more like 30 percent

1399
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,480
you know showed color

1400
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,760
in the f1 generation um you took the f1

1401
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,400
generation right

1402
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,280
and you back crossed to the mom and then

1403
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,318
you also

1404
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,240
uh let's say you went f2 selected a

1405
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,960
purple and went to f3

1406
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,598
um you might grow out the f3 generation

1407
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,800
and say

1408
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:30,000
well um you know

1409
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,200
i'm only like 50 50. you know

1410
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,880
even after all that i'm at 50 50. um

1411
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:38,239
in the one back cross you might have

1412
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:43,039
noticed that you upped it to like 75

1413
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:46,078
you know purple you know so

1414
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,838
yeah you know in that case

1415
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,519
and say well you know if the only thing

1416
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,039
that's truly important to use that

1417
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,559
purple color i would say

1418
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:58,480
you know continue to back cross you know

1419
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,680
um or you know it might not work that

1420
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,719
way at all

1421
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:05,519
you might just say like yeah you know

1422
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,558
one in ten you know maybe purple and

1423
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:07,838
then the rest aren't

1424
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,160
and you know it's really hard to get

1425
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,318
that it's telling you you know it's not

1426
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,199
not really breeding true for that trait

1427
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,000
and um

1428
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,039
it'll take you know very large

1429
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,440
populations

1430
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,800
and probably a good good amount of time

1431
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,880
before you could really

1432
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,839
you know read that true so the

1433
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,720
differences in

1434
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:27,838
all this is like could be a year it'd be

1435
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,159
ten years man

1436
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,199
you know and anything in between and

1437
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,558
just kind of

1438
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:37,679
a lot of variables you know yeah okay

1439
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,599
so i got a bit of a devil's advocate one

1440
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,199
for you and i think me and gene kind of

1441
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,559
even referenced this the underlying

1442
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,399
principle in this question

1443
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,000
let's say you were doing a project and

1444
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,280
you know you obviously you know you've

1445
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,679
referenced already your

1446
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,400
high levels of standards let's say you

1447
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,480
could only get

1448
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,920
one in 10 seeds to give what you wanted

1449
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,280
but it was exactly what you wanted but

1450
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,960
no matter what you did you could never

1451
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,000
get it to be more than that

1452
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,838
would you want to release that or not

1453
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,519
give it out so to speak given it's kind

1454
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:05,358
of not really up to par with your

1455
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:09,280
standards

1456
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,279
um well it's

1457
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,440
if if we're talking like overall

1458
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,079
standards like it was like some straight

1459
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,720
[ __ ]

1460
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:21,920
like it's going in the trash can now if

1461
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,519
if you say like if i was gonna breed

1462
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,960
something and i want it to be

1463
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:31,039
very um i don't know

1464
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,280
uh high yielding and skunky um

1465
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,119
and like i said you know out of every

1466
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,640
pack you're gonna get that one

1467
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,880
that that does do that and like you have

1468
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,598
tried to further breed it and it just

1469
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,720
does not

1470
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,359
it just does not work but you do get

1471
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,639
one in ten that say well we'll do that

1472
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,920
and then the rest are like

1473
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:55,118
you know maybe subtle variances of it or

1474
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,838
um maybe different um

1475
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,838
if you just couldn't do it and people

1476
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,480
wanted it that bad and you were up front

1477
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:02,558
about it

1478
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,159
you know and just say look you know this

1479
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,200
is the one that you want

1480
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,000
it pops up one in ten like you know you

1481
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,759
just tell them

1482
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,599
you know right off the bat you know this

1483
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,680
is gonna be your hunt

1484
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,200
but you should have one out of you know

1485
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,239
if you sprout all these seeds you

1486
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,598
you know you'll have it um in that case

1487
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,199
i guess it would be cool

1488
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,280
you know long as it meets all the other

1489
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,159
criteria and that you're

1490
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,440
you're being upfront about it um but

1491
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,879
like i mean if it's some straight

1492
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,280
garbage and it's

1493
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,318
taken a lot of seeds to find that one

1494
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,319
like you

1495
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:35,920
probably wouldn't want to wouldn't want

1496
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:39,119
to let that one go

1497
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,838
let's throw it in the trash yeah

1498
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,599
interesting to me it it spurs this idea

1499
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:45,599
of mine whereby

1500
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,798
it's it's kind of like for me it's an

1501
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,599
odd thing the way

1502
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,358
a lot of strains are advertised in the

1503
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,240
sense that most strains you're going to

1504
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,358
get a

1505
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:57,679
large variety of phenotypes and so

1506
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,639
it it sits a bit weird with me the way

1507
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:05,358
four phenotypes all have the same name

1508
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:08,558
and so i don't know i almost think that

1509
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:10,318
it kind of is like the way in which you

1510
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,920
are describing things already you know

1511
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:13,358
like for example if you buy a packet of

1512
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,200
blue dream

1513
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,440
even if it's really well made there's

1514
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,118
maybe only one particular phenotype

1515
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,400
that's like representative of blue dream

1516
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,280
and the rest are kind of what we're

1517
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,760
mentioning now like

1518
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,040
variations maybe even a bit bunk you

1519
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,359
know what i mean so i kind of feel like

1520
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,798
that

1521
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:31,838
almost happens yeah it happens a lot man

1522
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,759
and like um if they were you know if

1523
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:34,719
they told like if i was like a seed

1524
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,280
buyer

1525
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:39,838
and i bought them and you know they're

1526
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,680
like yeah you know this is what you get

1527
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,519
and if i grow 10 of them out and don't

1528
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:45,199
see it and then if i grow 20 out and

1529
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:45,838
i'll see it and it's all a bunch of bunk

1530
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,480
like

1531
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:49,039
i'm gonna be pissed but if the guy told

1532
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,838
me like

1533
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,318
typical results are this this this and

1534
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,519
this

1535
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:57,920
but one in 50 etc

1536
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,000
may end up like this it was like that uh

1537
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,760
cherry ak-47

1538
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,199
you know and those guys like even put it

1539
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,920
to the test like

1540
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,960
how many how many seeds does it take to

1541
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,599
get that cherry

1542
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,880
cherry fina and serious seed dudes they

1543
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,880
grew out a thousand

1544
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,838
and they found one so they were like

1545
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
yeah cherry finna is about one in a

1546
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,719
thousand so

1547
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,318
you know if everybody had smoked cherry

1548
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,798
ak and was like wow that's

1549
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,039
[ __ ] then they went back united by you

1550
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,679
know pax ak-47

1551
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,358
um you know and didn't see it they'd be

1552
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,279
like bummed out but

1553
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:32,480
the thing is like they didn't advertise

1554
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,880
it as such

1555
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,559
you know what i mean yeah interesting i

1556
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,240
never knew that was the backstory behind

1557
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,280
that one

1558
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:43,919
yeah man yeah that was a real

1559
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,000
really rare gem and you know they ended

1560
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,000
up doing it over there just to see

1561
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,280
you know what what it would take to to

1562
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,719
find that one

1563
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,359
and yeah it was out of a thousand

1564
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:57,358
so one strain that we don't mention

1565
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,239
maybe as much as we should on the show

1566
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,598
coming from serious seas cali missed

1567
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,759
it's an interesting one because a lot of

1568
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,680
people are polarized by the fact

1569
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,839
some afghani genetics were introduced

1570
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,759
into it i think around the 2000s and for

1571
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,039
a lot of people it just ruined it

1572
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,799
where do you sit on all that and you

1573
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,159
know how do you view the original cali

1574
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,000
mist at least

1575
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:19,519
i was never really into it man i never

1576
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,159
you know maybe i just didn't get the

1577
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,798
right um

1578
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:26,000
the right expression or quality grow of

1579
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:28,239
it you know what i mean

1580
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,599
but like in my experiences through the

1581
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,719
days like

1582
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:36,000
it just never really appealed to me

1583
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:38,318
too much okay cool

1584
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
might do a bit of a random question what

1585
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:43,358
is the best barbecue dish

1586
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,039
you know brisket button bulk shoulder

1587
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:47,598
um i'm pretty i'm pretty keen on brisket

1588
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,880
man

1589
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,798
like i do like that but i don't know you

1590
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,838
can't really go wrong

1591
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:58,960
as long as this cooked right that's good

1592
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,558
oh yeah but yeah brisket is pretty good

1593
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,079
man

1594
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,319
i'm looking forward to the emerald cup

1595
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,599
getting some some good brisket from

1596
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,239
barbecue bee

1597
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,318
oh yeah yeah that'll be keller man i'm

1598
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,519
gonna tear it up too

1599
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,679
alright starved the whole time

1600
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,519
yeah yeah so i mean while we're on the

1601
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,919
topic of the emerald cup the inside

1602
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,159
scoop is that you and skunk va will have

1603
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,559
a booth together is this true

1604
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:26,399
yeah yeah he's going to be pressing

1605
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,640
rosin

1606
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,838
he's going to be hooking it up out there

1607
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,239
so

1608
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:34,558
yeah expect maybe a bit of a collab

1609
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,259
project in the future

1610
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,880
you never know man you never know

1611
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,799
[Music]

1612
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,318
i know he's not he's gonna have a lot of

1613
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,639

1618
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,599
an experience like come get some fresh

1619
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:59,679
rosin from skunk ba himself

1620
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,440
yeah yeah that's like that's pretty

1621
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,919
that's pretty darn good

1622
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,159
yeah get some chem 91 rosin and that's

1623
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,039
like your stoner story to top everyone

1624
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:09,598
else

1625
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,358
yeah that's pretty good uh i couldn't

1626
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,039
think of a better way to get it

1627
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:18,318
and i will be too sorry

1628
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:21,679
let me get a little bit of that man

1629
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:23,119
alrighty so um we were chatting about it

1630
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,078
a little while ago

1631
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,000
cindy 99 it's got crazy needs for

1632
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,240
calcium i've had a few people message me

1633
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,519
about this what's your tips for ta

1634
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:36,719
for staying on top of essentially a

1635
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:40,079
plant that's got crazy calcium demands

1636
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,959
um what the like when when you already

1637
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,400
know that

1638
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,199
in advance um like the way that i mix my

1639
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,920
soil up

1640
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:50,239
like i got some pretty good pretty good

1641
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,079
sources of calcium that are in there

1642
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:53,679
that you know break down you know nice

1643
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,798
and slow and steady

1644
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,960
um so it just

1645
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,000
you know it just revolves to me you know

1646
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,039
trying to facilitate

1647
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,440
that especially during bloom

1648
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:08,079
so i know before i even go into bloom

1649
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,440
like i'm feeding at a heavy dose

1650
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,400
um prior to that you know where most

1651
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,318
people would

1652
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,240
you know wouldn't wouldn't really slam

1653
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:19,279
it that early on

1654
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:21,598
i do um that way you're kind of kind of

1655
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,400
always like a week ahead of everything

1656
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,680
but the beauty in it is like when you do

1657
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,000
take it away

1658
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,039
like she really fades out really quick

1659
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,239
and really nice

1660
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:34,798
you know so that's kind of like the good

1661
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:34,798
point of it

1662
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,039
yeah okay so you use it to like yeah

1663
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:41,759
time you fade well

1664
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,358
yeah yeah exactly if you're in um if

1665
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,400
you're in hydroponics you know you're

1666
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,279
just

1667
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,240
you know upping up your calcium and [ __ ]

1668
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,798
um

1669
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,439
you know i'd say like the week prior to

1670
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:53,599
bloom

1671
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,519
you know like where normally you know

1672
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,000
you wait to be in bloom or

1673
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:59,039
you know you would go ahead and give it

1674
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,639
give it that

1675
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,639
that little boost prior to

1676
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:09,519
okay and so just as a bit of a

1677
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,879
change of questions here resonance males

1678
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:11,519
you know this is something that's come

1679
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,519
up before

1680
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,599
i got a bit of a specific question about

1681
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,759
them i've noticed

1682
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,920
when i look at like really closely at

1683
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,480
seedlings when they're really young

1684
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,680
i swear i find like little almost like

1685
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,280
trichomes

1686
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,199
on a lot of the small ones when they're

1687
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,680
really young do you think

1688
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,519
that's like a commonality thing or is

1689
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,960
that the same as like if i grew

1690
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,519
some of those males out they would be

1691
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,440
males with trichomes on them

1692
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,759
um i've kind of seen it hit and miss you

1693
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,000
know

1694
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,240
because like the little ones you know

1695
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,079
seem like a good majority of them do it

1696
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,879
it's just like to what degree

1697
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,000
and then like you know um they tend to

1698
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,079
keep that

1699
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,920
that type of characteristic you know

1700
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:58,318
through through the growth

1701
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:00,639
um with the with the males i mean i've

1702
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,358
i've never been so lucky as to see like

1703
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:06,318
the the one fellow from alaska

1704
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:07,119
he uh he constantly finds them like i

1705
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,239
mean

1706
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:13,039
full-on resin rails down the leaf

1707
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,798
down the petiole stems like pretty

1708
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,039
pretty nuts

1709
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,318
so like i can't imagine it would be a

1710
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,440
very bad thing

1711
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:23,440
so um but that that's telling me it's

1712
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,599
something i guess coming off the

1713
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,880
coming off the x chromosome wants to

1714
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,440
breed for resin

1715
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,559
resin production so that would tell me

1716
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,079
it's uh

1717
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:36,480
it's a good thing so would you

1718
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,880
be so willing as to say that you would

1719
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:43,519
go for resness males

1720
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:46,480
if i had one yeah absolutely absolutely

1721
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,159
all righty kind of somewhat related how

1722
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,119
detrimental is it to

1723
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:52,399
re-veg a plant some people i don't think

1724
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,519
it happens so much anymore but some

1725
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,119
people do struggle to

1726
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,639
tell the sex of the plants so they'll

1727
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,760
kind of change the light cycle up and

1728
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,279
re-batch it you know do you think this

1729
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,359
is damaging and i guess maybe at the

1730
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,119
more extreme end of the spectrum

1731
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:04,798
if you've forgotten to take a clone and

1732
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,200
you know you're like re-veging like a

1733
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:09,599
fully floured harvested plant

1734
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,279
do you think that's detrimental like is

1735
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,720
is the resulting plant going to be

1736
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,079
similar or maybe a bit

1737
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:19,519
worse um i think like both ways

1738
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:22,798
like totally doable thing but they take

1739
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,318
time so in the case of we just had like

1740
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:26,719
the lower

1741
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:28,400
third of a plant you know we left like a

1742
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,279
couple of buds on it right

1743
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,200
and we're just to re-badge it takes a

1744
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,880
long time before you really get any

1745
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,480
growth out of it anyway

1746
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,400
and then that growth is going to be kind

1747
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,960
of wacky for a little while

1748
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,960
so i just think it takes it takes a

1749
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,280
little longer

1750
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,159
for it to really get back into the swing

1751
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,798
of things

1752
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,199
before like you can start taking planes

1753
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,719
and blooming them again

1754
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:55,038
because i think like if you take another

1755
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,679
climb too early and throw it in bloom

1756
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,200
it'll act a little bit wacky on you so i

1757
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,639
think it's just more important just to

1758
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,759
give it that

1759
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:05,838
that time you know to fully fully

1760
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,520
revenge and start throwing out you know

1761
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,679
more than single leaves and

1762
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:12,000
a little mutated stuff you know throw

1763
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,000
out like some proper fans and

1764
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,400
become more of a plan again and then

1765
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,519
taking climbs from there

1766
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,079
but like i've re-veg stuff before in the

1767
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,679
past

1768
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,359
and i have one that we did five times we

1769
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,838
were just doing it just to see

1770
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,400
you know like what you know what

1771
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:30,480
happened

1772
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,838
like if it got better or got worse or

1773
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,880
whatever what not

1774
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,719
and um you know stayed the same every

1775
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:41,039
single time

1776
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:43,598
a bit unexpected in my opinion yeah

1777
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,720
okay so i mean we're on the topic of

1778
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,240
unexpected

1779
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:50,159
are you kind of of the mindset that some

1780
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,399
of the more memorable strains

1781
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,358
throughout history or just maybe ones

1782
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,358
you've made

1783
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:57,679
are ones that kind of produce really

1784
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,119
unexpected results like i guess you know

1785
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,719
if you've got one parent that's

1786
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,519
chocolate and one that's strawberry you

1787
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:02,719
know you kind of

1788
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:04,559
expect it to be like chocolate

1789
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,480
strawberry or whatever and

1790
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,000
the offspring instead is like rotten

1791
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,559
cheese i find that

1792
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,318
the predictable strains tend not to be

1793
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,839
ones that go down in history

1794
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:16,480
would you agree with that or what do you

1795
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:17,519
think yeah it seems like that's the case

1796
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,519
a lot of times

1797
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,759
but it's like the weird ones you know

1798
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,920
that's that's the reason why they're so

1799
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,520
memorable because they're really unique

1800
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,960
so um i did uh chem dog d

1801
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:33,519
and hindu kush and that

1802
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,199
in in theory should produce like a lot

1803
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:39,119
of like really nasty

1804
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:40,558
funky smells and um they did

1805
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,240
but there was one that popped up you

1806
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,400
know strawberry man

1807
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,838
the most strawberry strawberry i'd ever

1808
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,680
seen in weed

1809
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,358
and that was the one we called smuckers

1810
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:52,239
man but

1811
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,798
you know totally just blew my mind you

1812
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,279
know

1813
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:57,119
and then that turned into its own little

1814
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,280
and little project

1815
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,640
you know for strawberry stuff and like

1816
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,880
found out like it

1817
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,598
something that weird you wouldn't think

1818
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,519
like all right now if i take this

1819
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,880
and you know breed it to something else

1820
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,880
like will it

1821
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,720
will it retain any of the strawberry

1822
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,079
fruitiness or am i going to go back to

1823
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,519
like rank and ask

1824
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:19,519
and um we hit it with c99 and it stayed

1825
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,400
nice and strawberry and

1826
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,358
and good so that was like a big big plus

1827
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,400
lets me know that

1828
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,759
it could be work so i started working on

1829
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,760
that too

1830
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,039
you must be a mine reader so my next

1831
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,680
question was

1832
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,160
i have seen a photo of smucker's c99

1833
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:36,318
cross

1834
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,679
ii bubble berry what's what's the deal

1835
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:38,400
with bubble berry and what's the deal

1836
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:40,879
with this cross

1837
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,760
can we expect to see more of it yeah

1838
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,119
just uh

1839
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,599
messing around with it at the moment

1840
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,720
just seeing uh seeing what all it would

1841
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,960
all it holds

1842
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,639
because yeah it's like an old old bubble

1843
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,960
berry clone

1844
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:59,199
so it uh it's got more of that

1845
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,559
i don't know how to explain it really

1846
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,199
like a pungent

1847
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,760
very pungent skunky fruity it's kind of

1848
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,318
like that

1849
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:11,280
uh like that four-way it's kind of funky

1850
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:12,880
okay and do you plan to do any future

1851
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,680
work with the bubble berry because

1852
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,680
that's

1853
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,358
that's an interesting one that i don't

1854
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:18,960
think too many people are familiar with

1855
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:19,759
but the ones who are and the ones i've

1856
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,960
spoken to

1857
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,599
extremely fond of it oh yeah yeah that's

1858
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,119
a

1859
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:30,160
really killer killer plant um

1860
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,559
a lot like i reversed the 91 on to it

1861
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:33,519
as well so i think it's going to start

1862
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,039
digging through

1863
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:40,719
through those here really soon too

1864
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:43,520
so if we jump back to a comment bode

1865
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:44,078
made in his interview he said that he

1866
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:46,798
thinks

1867
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,880
the uh the hash plan neville used in the

1868
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:50,880
creation of skelly was the pnw

1869
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,400
hash plant i'm pretty sure you could get

1870
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,240
that one if you wanted you know have you

1871
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,920
ever grown it out and do you think that

1872
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,838
there's any possible relationship

1873
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,039
between the two

1874
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:04,480
um sorta um i

1875
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:06,880
think so i know that when

1876
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,480
he may i'll tell you what i'm gonna grab

1877
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,079
this catalog real quick

1878
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:15,679
that way i'm not guessing hold on

1879
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,680
all right so

1880
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,239
now it was always my understanding

1881
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:24,798
like he used that ash plant

1882
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:27,599
to make a hash plant but he also had one

1883
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:31,119
that was just a northern lights

1884
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:35,600
um hybrid

1885
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:38,559
so i know that uh

1886
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,000
they're very similar you know very very

1887
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,798
similar

1888
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,079
yeah so i mean i guess it maybe goes

1889
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:45,679
without saying that

1890
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,359
i think bodhi kind of referenced it as

1891
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,079
well skelly is like a big

1892
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,400
step up in potency than what the pnw one

1893
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:52,399
is right

1894
01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:00,560
all right so here we have

1895
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:03,600
uh out of the 1989

1896
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,719
seed bank catalog all right

1897
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,880
so hash plant pure

1898
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,759
says after years of inbreeding and

1899
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,159
testing

1900
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,079
we have decided to offer our famous hash

1901
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,079
plant as a pure variety

1902
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:18,079
the pure hash plant differs from the

1903
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:21,439
hash plant northern lights

1904
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:24,318
number one f1 hybrid and that is

1905
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,960
it is in red strain possessing the

1906
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,120
wonderful

1907
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,000
indica taste and high of the original

1908
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:30,960
cutting

1909
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,079
okay so that that tells me like he's

1910
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,279
he's talking about

1911
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:36,798
you know that original you know pacific

1912
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,920
northwest cutting

1913
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,960
um the yield vigor will be less than the

1914
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,798
hybrid

1915
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,480
under most conditions and that's like

1916
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,000
what we were talking about earlier

1917
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,678
you really you start inbreeding

1918
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,158
something you lose a little bit of that

1919
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:53,838
hybrid bigger

1920
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:55,839
but the quality will be better this one

1921
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,119
this is the one to get if you're a true

1922
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,239
indica connoisseur

1923
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,960
or serious breeder you can expect a very

1924
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,919
fast indoor finish copious resin and a

1925
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,800
flat top

1926
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,719
fudge structure now when i look at the

1927
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,360
picture of that

1928
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,719
that looks like you know skelly all all

1929
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:16,158
day long

1930
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:19,279
so now if you look at the um

1931
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,679
the um hash plant northern lights number

1932
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,679
one

1933
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,880
hybrid it looks like you know you just

1934
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,880
took that that

1935
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,920
pacific northwest cutting and hit it

1936
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:30,560
with a

1937
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:32,158
nl1 what else did he do here

1938
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,920
man if you could just order some of this

1939
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,920
[ __ ] still it'd be awesome

1940
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,480
the g13 hash plant

1941
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,279
but like uh unless he was making films

1942
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,439
you know that

1943
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:46,399
you couldn't have couldn't have done

1944
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:49,919
that

1945
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,960
and i think he said he still has some of

1946
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,079
the stock

1947
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:58,000
heck yeah so

1948
01:10:54,079 --> 01:11:02,479
northern lights 5 across to the nl2 then

1949
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,520
he was selling the nl2 and an f3

1950
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:09,039
and let's see

1951
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,560
what else got the garlic blood and he's

1952
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:13,198
got a lot of

1953
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,719
oh [ __ ] just basically every building

1954
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:17,759
blocks train ever

1955
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,880
yeah pretty pretty much but um

1956
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:24,079
so yeah i would i would say that um

1957
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,560
his hash plant pure was probably said

1958
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,439
that

1959
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,560
that pacific northwest cutting across to

1960
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,678
one of the

1961
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,239
one of the nl crosses that he did um

1962
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,119
i'm thinking like the the one within l1

1963
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:38,479
or two

1964
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,679
probably uh bat crossed or inbred

1965
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,639
somehow with that

1966
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,079
pacific northwest cutting again and then

1967
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,119
yeah that's where

1968
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:49,519
where it is interesting and so

1969
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,640
i guess the notable thing i find about

1970
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,199
scaly and

1971
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,000
uh some other plants is that the

1972
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:57,119
aesthetics

1973
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,479
isn't really the the be all end or with

1974
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:01,198
these plants

1975
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,799
yeah i guess it's a little different for

1976
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:04,238
you because you're quite familiar with

1977
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,279
this but overall

1978
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:09,759
where do aesthetics sit kind of in your

1979
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:11,920
little hierarchy of attributes do you

1980
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,360
value it or just given you're familiar

1981
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,000
with strains where it's

1982
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:17,839
totally not correlated in general do you

1983
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,198
not correlate it

1984
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,679
um oh man like

1985
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,479
i see i like i can see you know like

1986
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,440
beauty and

1987
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,158
all of it because like i know what it is

1988
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,279
you know

1989
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:33,279
like um certain things like said that

1990
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:36,000
skelly it's not the most aesthetic

1991
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:38,079
thing in the world but uh the smell the

1992
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,198
taste and the quality of the stone and

1993
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:42,880
everything

1994
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:43,759
um makes it makes up way way up for it

1995
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,920
you know

1996
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,520
um and there's other things say like

1997
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,399
purple punch you know

1998
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,440
they're purple real frosty and kind of

1999
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,279
worthless you know

2000
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:55,599
like in the in the standing department

2001
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:58,719
you know i looked real pretty

2002
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,320
so like i'm more of a smell

2003
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:05,119
taste quality type you know

2004
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:07,679
more so than like the looks alone you

2005
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:10,960
know what i mean

2006
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,560
yeah for sure and so i guess kind of

2007
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,039
with this in mind

2008
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,480
how can breeders better cater to the

2009
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:18,238
commercial market

2010
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:20,000
because i think me gene kind we kind of

2011
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:21,279
struck on this idea a little bit and

2012
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,359
he said something along the lines of

2013
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,960
like there's two major types of growers

2014
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:26,799
and cali's the one who pump out

2015
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,560
units and the ones who hold on to the

2016
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,960
rare heirloom strains and basically

2017
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:34,000
sacrifice the crop to do so

2018
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,279
so i guess with that in mind how can we

2019
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,840
try to cater

2020
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,920
you know to the guys pumping out units

2021
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,279
so that it's not just blue dream and

2022
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,039
it's not just

2023
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,880
you know certain strains that maybe

2024
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:47,119
aren't the best like you know purple

2025
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,000
punch as you just mentioned

2026
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,359
yeah you really have to you have to

2027
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,719
start breeding

2028
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,519
for um yield and mine too and that's

2029
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,439
whether

2030
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,120
you can breed yield into something

2031
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:01,519
without sacrificing

2032
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:04,079
a lot of other things or if there is

2033
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,159
some type of sacrifice and you can reach

2034
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,640
some form of a compromise with it like

2035
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:11,920
if it's yielding that much you know

2036
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,239
if it is like commercial commercial

2037
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,640
units as they put it

2038
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,359
it's normally not very good you know

2039
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,640
what i mean

2040
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,559
so if you can make that better um strike

2041
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:26,840
a happy medium or

2042
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:30,640
get better i think you could do that

2043
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,000
um if if i was gonna do it i'd probably

2044
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,960
be looking more to

2045
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,560
um cater a lot more to the greenhouse

2046
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,600
and outdoor dudes

2047
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,800
um they tend to you know

2048
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,400
they grow a lot um and since like the

2049
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,400
price of a pack in

2050
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,759
california for their outdoor it goes so

2051
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,960
low um

2052
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,800
you know they're looking to get it

2053
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,439
extracted you know so

2054
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,840
once they extract it you know the price

2055
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,319
went

2056
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,520
went back up you know because the oil

2057
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,559
that was produced from

2058
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:03,760
something that was greenhouse or outdoor

2059
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,520
um you know it's worth just as much as

2060
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,079
anything else long as the quality is

2061
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,640
good right so if you could

2062
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,559
if you could offer good outdoor and

2063
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,800
greenhouse producers that

2064
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,840
offer the yield and very high level of

2065
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,520
terpenes and

2066
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,880
be a good quality product with a lot of

2067
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,159
the

2068
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
pest and mildew and mold is right into

2069
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:27,839
it i think

2070
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:31,520
like that's where you would have it and

2071
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:35,119
then if you're marketing say toward

2072
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:37,440
like commercial indoor facilities

2073
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,279
you would be looking for very short

2074
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,158
flower times

2075
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,880
as well as you know the yield and trying

2076
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:45,039
to

2077
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,400
keep the happy medium but i think like

2078
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:48,238
if you can

2079
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:50,079
you can shorten your flower times enough

2080
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:52,799
you know you can get a whole extra

2081
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,439
run in per year you know versus the next

2082
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,840
guy

2083
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,119
if you're like really on it you know so

2084
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,600
i think like that would

2085
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,359
bring a lot of value to you know a

2086
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,079
commercial facility

2087
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,198
um and especially like if you can give

2088
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,000
them that

2089
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:10,559
ridiculously high yielding and also like

2090
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,439
pretty damn potent and stinky weed

2091
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,719
you know that that would help them out

2092
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,238
you know

2093
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,319
okay and so one question i personally

2094
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,359
wanted to ask was

2095
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:26,559
the genius haze the apollo haze

2096
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:28,000
fantastic line at first i was wondering

2097
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,640
are you going to work it forward but

2098
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,600
then i was like no more importantly

2099
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,360
are we ever going to see the grail haze

2100
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,120
released in straight form

2101
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,279
you know i really love all the crosses

2102
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,039
it's been used in what were the females

2103
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:43,679
of that like

2104
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:44,399
um they're really really gnarly and like

2105
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,560
the thing is

2106
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,000
is like a body of mine is the guy who

2107
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,039
made those

2108
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,880
so um you know unless

2109
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,399
that was something like he wanted to do

2110
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,520
you know he can do it

2111
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,238
but um you know nobody's heard from him

2112
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,480
in a while

2113
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:02,158
like it kind of he's kind of like half

2114
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,359
worried about him i don't know what

2115
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:06,639
happened to him

2116
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:09,039
but um yeah he was the one that made the

2117
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,239
the actual grill hayes so i was just

2118
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:13,439
selecting a

2119
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:14,959
select number out the bunch and so what

2120
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,559
were the girls like were they just kind

2121
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,560
of like bigger yielding cindy's

2122
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:26,079
sort of yeah more or less like a

2123
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:29,119
long like more like spear type buds and

2124
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:32,960
um still really quick flowering time

2125
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,519
um a lot of candied type type smells you

2126
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,039
know

2127
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,199
it's pretty nice so

2128
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:40,640
here's his interesting one i've

2129
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:42,079
mentioned before and i'd love to know

2130
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,400
your opinion on it

2131
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,238
i've noticed that you know often plants

2132
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:47,679
can basically be telling you that

2133
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:48,639
they're happy but then if you were to

2134
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:51,039
give them say a t

2135
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,280
i e externally more nutrients than they

2136
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,640
would have otherwise had access to

2137
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,238
you know they might have a bit of a

2138
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,199
bloom of growth and so it kind of

2139
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:59,359
signifies to me

2140
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,639
like although they might not have been

2141
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:03,359
showing deficiencies

2142
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,360
like they likewise could have used more

2143
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,279
than what they had access to

2144
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:09,839
do you think that that's kind of the

2145
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:10,639
case or have i kind of misanalyzed

2146
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,760
something

2147
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,800
how do you see that whole situation yeah

2148
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,400
i mean you're totally right um and i've

2149
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,279
seen it like the opposite too

2150
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:23,279
like it's not showing up it's not

2151
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:25,519
showing a toxicity

2152
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,920
but you're like stunning the yield you

2153
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,719
know like it's not like harming out or

2154
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,119
like burning

2155
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,158
or darkening up a whole lot but that

2156
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:34,960
extra bit of food

2157
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,119
caused it the yogi less and you know

2158
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,679
i've also seen it

2159
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:40,880
where it yields more so and then you got

2160
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,880
to find out why

2161
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,440
you know sometimes it has nothing to do

2162
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:47,279
with like any npk values

2163
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:49,279
a lot of times it has to do with a lot

2164
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:53,359
of you know like sulfur and

2165
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:55,679
magnesium and gaussian you know

2166
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:57,279
sometimes it has to do more with a

2167
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:01,039
certain timing

2168
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:03,759
of a of a tea like you said and also

2169
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:04,880
you know like a fulvic and veg or a

2170
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,360
humic and bloom

2171
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,719
type you know supplement to help it take

2172
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:10,559
it up you know

2173
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,039
and then some plants don't react well

2174
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,440
some plants freak out and hurt

2175
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:17,359
you know like uh it's really an

2176
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:19,599
individual basis

2177
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,119
like their eating habits and all it's

2178
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,480
like they're generally the same

2179
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:24,238
it's kind of like people i guess

2180
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,158
breakfast lunch dinner

2181
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:27,678
but what do they eat for breakfast what

2182
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,039
do they eat for lunch and what they eat

2183
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,800
for dinner you know you might have a

2184
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:33,198
vegan versus a

2185
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,520
you know meat eater vegetarian in the

2186
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:35,519
middle

2187
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,480
some people don't eat breakfast you know

2188
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,960
i mean you gotta kind of

2189
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:45,198
work with them and tune them every time

2190
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,920
so sometimes you get lucky and you know

2191
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,439
knock it out the park the first time and

2192
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,960
then you'll try something different like

2193
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:52,879
feeding it that little more

2194
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,640
and notice your yield went down or maybe

2195
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,560
it went up but that's what it's all

2196
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,679
about is repeating the

2197
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,800
same grow over you know over and over

2198
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:02,800
until you've really

2199
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,440
really tweaked it and that just takes

2200
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,279
time and trial and error

2201
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:09,039
so how do you feel about some of the

2202
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,279
organic additives that

2203
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:12,479
fall outside of kind of the norm of

2204
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:14,238
products so like you know obviously

2205
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,158
fulvic acid pretty common one

2206
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:18,559
what about some of the more i guess kind

2207
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:20,799
of exotic things we see nowadays like

2208
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,360
insect frass or like chitin based

2209
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,800
products or things like mammoth pee

2210
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:25,920
where do you sit on those ones have you

2211
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,360
dabbled with them and would you

2212
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,920
recommend them

2213
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,039
yeah we use insect breasts that's really

2214
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,239
nice stuff

2215
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:37,039
um yeah those kittens you know

2216
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:39,519
it's a big help um keeping the immune

2217
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:43,279
system rolling and everything too

2218
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,880
um that in correlation with like alloy

2219
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:48,000
water and everything

2220
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:51,679
um the mammoth p i tried out

2221
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,679
um it kind of

2222
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:56,239
like it did did what it was supposed to

2223
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,158
but it seems like it's like um

2224
01:20:56,238 --> 01:20:59,759
like got an enzyme in it or something

2225
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:01,920
too there's like certain things that

2226
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,320
made it like want to foxtail out

2227
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,119
so i kind of figured i was like ah it's

2228
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,559
probably like

2229
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:11,840
you know it's like an enzyme and

2230
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,880
you know some type of fungal fungal

2231
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,000
microbe

2232
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:18,800
so um

2233
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,119
so do you tend to like dabble with all

2234
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
the

2235
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:23,119
the new and latest things or are you

2236
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,440
more kind of like just sticking to like

2237
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:26,158
the

2238
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:27,198
the known and trusted things per se you

2239
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,960
know i

2240
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:34,719
i tried to be that guy and uh trying

2241
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,319
some things out and um and it didn't

2242
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,880
work out good

2243
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:40,960
you know i mean it was all right but the

2244
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:45,920
old tried and true system was better

2245
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:48,399
so kind of went back to that and um

2246
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,039
you know every now and again i'll i'll

2247
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:50,719
hear when

2248
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:53,279
but it's normally like through a friend

2249
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,880
or something like it said that you know

2250
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:57,039
they tried something out

2251
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,960
and it really really you know helped and

2252
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:02,158
there's only like a handful of people

2253
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:05,520
i know that i'm really gonna listen to

2254
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:08,158
you know what they have to say so um

2255
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,000
so yeah every now and again you know try

2256
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,879
something different

2257
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,639
and so what is kind of your tried and

2258
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,960
true staple like what's

2259
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,840
what's the one kind of amendment or the

2260
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,000
one

2261
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:24,079
thing in your soil mix that you just

2262
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,238
think does some serious good work

2263
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:27,439
that's all of it you know all but kind

2264
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:30,879
of working together

2265
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:34,559
but the soil mix with the dragonfly

2266
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,359
coconut for uh coconut water for an

2267
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,440
enzyme

2268
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:38,559
rotate that with like malted barley for

2269
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:40,079
an enzyme

2270
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,199
instead of the dragonfly and the

2271
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,960
microbes you know like the lush roots

2272
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,479
and then supplementing like you know

2273
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,198
some like juices and

2274
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:51,439
some sugars toward the end uh it seems

2275
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:54,238
to work the best

2276
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:55,919
nice nice and so question i've been

2277
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:57,519
asking a few people

2278
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,279
and you i guess you kind of brought it

2279
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,600
up once or twice already strains that

2280
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,639
throw

2281
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,159
nana's in like the last week or so

2282
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,159
i know that there are a lot that do it

2283
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:08,079
and they're like they don't have pollen

2284
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:09,679
they're infertile so that's really kind

2285
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:11,600
of like a no-brainer obviously

2286
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,039
it's not that you know it doesn't affect

2287
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,840
anything per se except for maybe

2288
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:16,158
aesthetics

2289
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,760
but the ones that do produce pollen it's

2290
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:19,599
in the last week

2291
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,960
do you find that to be like a negative

2292
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,480
trait or do you just think

2293
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,079
oh you know i guess it's only really a

2294
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:26,319
problem if you had like a plant

2295
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,679
several weeks behind in flower you know

2296
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,279
like do you think it's pretty

2297
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,199
acceptable because i mean there's a lot

2298
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:34,000
of strains that do it

2299
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:34,960
yeah i mean like i i grow some things

2300
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,439
that

2301
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,119
that do it you know and like they're

2302
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:42,479
they're that good so you know

2303
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:44,399
i cater to it but um

2304
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,799
if me and you was running like a big

2305
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,960
commercial facility and like

2306
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,320
you know we have like tables or like a

2307
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,198
quarter of the building

2308
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:55,439
or a room what have you comes down um

2309
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:57,839
when we're breaking plants down

2310
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:58,799
i mean the pollen could go over to the

2311
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,440
the part that's

2312
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,800
say week two week three flower and get

2313
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:04,559
pollinated

2314
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,159
and then you know people end up with the

2315
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,719
seeds and they're weed

2316
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:10,319
you know they don't they don't want that

2317
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:13,439
so uh

2318
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:15,279
um you know it would be a problem with

2319
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:16,079
that but if me and you're just like you

2320
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:18,000
know

2321
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:19,840
running our little grey rooms doing our

2322
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,880
thing and you know no big

2323
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,880
no big deal but um

2324
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,480
yeah like it just depends what you're

2325
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,520
what you're doing it could be a big

2326
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:29,678
problem but

2327
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,120
me and you're just running like grows at

2328
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,960
our house or

2329
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,800
where we're running like a monocrop or

2330
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,000
something and it all comes down at the

2331
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,679
same time you know

2332
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,920
that could be fine but um

2333
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,440
ideally yeah you wouldn't have it but

2334
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,520
that's just the way it works

2335
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,799
some of them are some of them are that

2336
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,159
good and they like it

2337
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:53,679
you know you just gotta do your best

2338
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:55,039
yeah yeah and i dig so switch it up for

2339
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,560
a moment

2340
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:59,679
when can the general public expect to be

2341
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,440
able to experience

2342
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:05,520
local h for themselves uh like smoking

2343
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:12,638
some weed of it

2344
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:15,840
yeah maybe growing it themselves oh

2345
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:17,600
well like giving a client you mean like

2346
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,480
if that's what you're gonna do

2347
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,480
no hell no

2348
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,880
um i don't know it plays like a nice

2349
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:30,479
little role on like a lot of the

2350
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:34,159
little breeding projects and stuff so

2351
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:37,919
i don't know man i couldn't tell you

2352
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:41,039
well there's your answer folks yeah

2353
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,119
um so a question i get

2354
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:45,039
asked from a lot of people because i

2355
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:46,319
think they probably think i ask

2356
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,760
people the question even though i don't

2357
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:49,119
include it in the interview which is not

2358
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,960
true i include basically everything in

2359
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:52,960
the interview

2360
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,319
basically i always get asked the

2361
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,639
question

2362
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:58,639
how do you guys source all the

2363
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,239
old-school gems that you work with you

2364
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:03,039
know is it like a

2365
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,399
a crazy seed hunt expedition or like you

2366
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:06,079
know how do you go about coming across

2367
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:10,079
some of these old ss

2368
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:13,039
c gems so to speak well a lot of that

2369
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,000
um it's like family heirloom type [ __ ]

2370
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:17,279
if you want to

2371
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,039
call it that um you know something like

2372
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:21,920
passed down to me

2373
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,639
um you know and then you got some old

2374
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,560
cats

2375
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,239
store the seeds up in the freezer and

2376
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,639
they're kept you know a long time that

2377
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:29,439
way

2378
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,880
and sometimes people get there get their

2379
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:34,000
stuff like that or

2380
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,400
if you travel around a lot and

2381
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,399
meet and greet people i guess you know

2382
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,879
like i've been to like shows before

2383
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:40,559
where

2384
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,920
dudes come out the woodwork and they're

2385
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,960
like hey

2386
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,880
yeah you know i was growing

2387
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,800
a bunch of williams wonder on the hill

2388
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,719
for like forever and

2389
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,920
i heard you you know you're into that

2390
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,760
and i made

2391
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,359
a batch of seeds every few years from

2392
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,440
the original so here you go

2393
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:59,599
so sometimes it could happen like that

2394
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:00,238
or somebody's just keeping a clone

2395
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,280
around

2396
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:05,519
or whatnot but a lot of it's just like

2397
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,279
what we've what we've had in our life

2398
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,120
leading up to this point it's not like

2399
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:11,599
we just started doing it

2400
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:12,960
you know a year or two ago yeah i've

2401
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:17,360
been doing a long

2402
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:20,399
long time yeah ain't no fresh meat

2403
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:23,759
no definitely not the first

2404
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:26,638
rodeo so

2405
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,320
how can growers be properly rewarded for

2406
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:31,440
finding kilafinos

2407
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,359
if if you have a certain space and you

2408
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:34,319
choose to use that space to entirely

2409
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:36,399
phenoh hunt

2410
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,639
and you sacrifice a large part of what

2411
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,879
would have been i guess like a good crop

2412
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,400
how can we as like a community like

2413
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,239
compensate people i guess not

2414
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:45,519
like in the literal sense but i feel

2415
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:47,759
like essentially

2416
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,600
if over the years and this kind of goes

2417
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,320
back to that point me and jean made

2418
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,000
about people

2419
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:53,359
either pumping out units or retaining

2420
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,639
the heirlooms it's like if you do the

2421
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:56,799
math over the years

2422
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:59,119
these people are foregoing a substantial

2423
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,039
amount of money to do essentially like

2424
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:02,399
you know obviously they enjoy the weed

2425
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:04,800
and enjoy keeping around but it's

2426
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:05,759
there's a bit of a community slasher you

2427
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,800
know like a

2428
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:11,280
a selfless aspect to it you know how how

2429
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,719
do we properly like thank and or

2430
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,439
you know what i mean like compensate

2431
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:19,119
people who do this

2432
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:20,960
um i mean it's it's kind of

2433
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,319
it's kind of crazy on like a lot of

2434
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,158
levels but

2435
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:25,519
i would say like the number one thing

2436
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:28,559
would be like

2437
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,719
people that do put in the time to

2438
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,920
either like do the big pinot hunts and

2439
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:35,279
like actually have

2440
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,960
like that very superior weed

2441
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:38,960
or if it's like you know they're growing

2442
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,760
an old heirloom strain

2443
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,000
um some of these things you know they

2444
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,800
don't

2445
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,279
particularly yield like blue dream does

2446
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,520
but

2447
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:49,439
they sure do smoke a whole lot better

2448
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,520
and like the mindset

2449
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:52,799
with a lot of the stores and the

2450
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,280
dispensary world

2451
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,039
like especially like in colorado's like

2452
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:57,840
they really want to lowball the hell out

2453
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:00,960
of you

2454
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,199
and they want to make out like it's kind

2455
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,560
of all the same a pound is a pound is a

2456
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:08,000
pound and

2457
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:11,039
um you know they don't want to pay

2458
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,960
pay the grower what it what it actually

2459
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:15,760
is worth and then they go and mark it up

2460
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:18,079
like 260 percent or something you know

2461
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,600
it's kind of ridiculous but i think like

2462
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:23,679
if you support good

2463
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:26,320
um good farmers good farms um

2464
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:28,158
you know don't don't be the one to

2465
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,679
complain about i guess like the price

2466
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:32,799
you know within reason

2467
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:35,760
you know if you're like a um

2468
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,639
like a distributor or a store owner or

2469
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,199
something you know

2470
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,000
like that that would help immensely you

2471
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:43,198
know

2472
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,520
but um you know if people would reward

2473
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:45,919
quality with you know sticking to that

2474
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,960
or

2475
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:51,039
you know i don't know just

2476
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,079
like with anything else i suppose like a

2477
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:54,238
good restaurant

2478
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,920
or what have you you know you'd

2479
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:59,678
recommend it to your friends

2480
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:02,079
you know yeah so the idea that jumps to

2481
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:04,800
my mind when you say that is

2482
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:06,000
i i know of some people who grow some

2483
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,719
incredibly boutique

2484
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,158
weed and it's it's more expensive than

2485
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,560
the average stuff

2486
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:14,638
and people you know there are some

2487
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,440
people who get really angry at that

2488
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,480
and like in my mind it's kind of a bit

2489
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:19,678
like well

2490
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,519
you know like if you want to drive a

2491
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:23,199
really expensive car like that's kind of

2492
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,880
your choice you know what i mean like

2493
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:26,399
it's not like a car that costs a hundred

2494
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,719
thousand dollars is

2495
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,079
literally five times as good as a car

2496
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,639
that costs twenty thousand dollars you

2497
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:32,719
know like the

2498
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:34,000
the scaling isn't linear it's you know

2499
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,000
it's probably like 50

2500
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,520
better or something like that you know

2501
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,198
but but nevertheless there are people

2502
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,480
who want that type of thing so in my

2503
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:41,759
mind it's like if you want to pay for a

2504
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:42,959
premium product like

2505
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,039
cool you know as long as no one's

2506
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,560
forcing you to but then the the

2507
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:48,079
naysayers will say

2508
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:51,039
yeah but this is different because this

2509
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:53,359
is medicine and and i kind of think like

2510
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:55,039
i don't really see how that works though

2511
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:56,639
are you with that same mindset or like

2512
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:59,119
how do you see that

2513
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,960
well i mean if it's if it's through

2514
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:04,000
somebody's medicine

2515
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,840
um i think it should all of it should be

2516
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,119
like of the utmost quality

2517
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:12,319
you know and if it's for

2518
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:14,238
like a truly sick individual then they

2519
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:17,039
should be helped along with that

2520
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,919
but i ain't talking about like you know

2521
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:21,359
i mean like

2522
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:22,480
us is like humanity on on earth like

2523
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,759
we're all sick

2524
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:27,439
right to some degree or another whether

2525
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,880
you know you back aches or you know

2526
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:31,519
you're tired or

2527
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,279
you know you're too jittery or you uh

2528
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,199
you know what i mean everybody

2529
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:37,279
everybody's got something wrong with

2530
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:38,879
them you know so like if you say like

2531
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:42,000
medicine in that regard

2532
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,960
you know whatever but like truly truly

2533
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,800
ill sick people that like rely on it

2534
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:50,319
need it they should be helped out

2535
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:53,360
you know um and yeah if it is

2536
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:56,479
for like genuinely you know for medicine

2537
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:59,039
medicine like um

2538
01:31:56,479 --> 01:32:01,119
it should be the utmost quality and like

2539
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:03,479
the the best it could possibly be

2540
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:05,840
you know that's my my standpoint on it

2541
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:08,879
recreationally i mean

2542
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,360
[ __ ] i mean if i was if i had a weed

2543
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,279
store

2544
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,679
or you know a grower that supplied

2545
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,439
stores of both you know like

2546
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,880
you know maybe it's just me but like i

2547
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:19,039
want it to be like the best

2548
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,279
possible i want people to say like hey

2549
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,800
wow you know that's awesome

2550
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,000
because i feel like if you're giving me

2551
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,719
money you know i'm gonna give you

2552
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,359
quality

2553
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,800
i'm not gonna give you dog [ __ ] and two

2554
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:29,519
like i want to stand out against my

2555
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,119
competition

2556
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:36,560
he does sling dog [ __ ] you know so

2557
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:38,158
um either way like me personally

2558
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,800
i'm gonna go for the quality and the

2559
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:44,238
best you know each time i don't like to

2560
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:46,960
sacrifice that type of stuff

2561
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:48,319
yeah it's interesting i think i guess i

2562
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:51,119
think kind of the underlying

2563
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,599
argument that some of the people make in

2564
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:53,039
the

2565
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,199
you know the australian scene at least

2566
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:56,719
is like if you're producing really high

2567
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:58,319
quality and maybe you want to be

2568
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:01,439
compensated for that it's like

2569
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:01,920
no you're like obliged to instead sell

2570
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:03,759
for

2571
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,359
like you know far less to someone who's

2572
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,880
really sick even though you may not like

2573
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:08,000
know someone who's sick and like you

2574
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,880
know what i mean like

2575
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,920
yes yeah so that's what i think is

2576
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,840
interesting because

2577
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:16,000
i also just think at least in my

2578
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,840
personal experience i haven't met a ton

2579
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,960
of like white collar growers

2580
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,000
and i have a feeling you need those guys

2581
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,679
as well

2582
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,359
and so yeah my my kind of thinking is

2583
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:28,639
that a lot of white collar guys just

2584
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:29,920
probably do it for themselves and don't

2585
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,199
talk to anyone

2586
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,000
you need those people to come to the

2587
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,279
table and so if there's pressure

2588
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,279
that you have to be doing a certain

2589
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:38,880
thing with your crop like it's not going

2590
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:40,559
to be incentivizing people to come to

2591
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,840
the table so to speak

2592
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:46,320
yeah yeah exactly like i said

2593
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,119
you know there's like varying degrees of

2594
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,719
like

2595
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:51,840
sick you know um so like when kids i

2596
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,079
take care of like

2597
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,119
they're reliant on it like without it

2598
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:57,519
they're

2599
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,319
most likely would die you know they need

2600
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,120
it

2601
01:33:58,319 --> 01:34:02,880
it's so like and you know very very ill

2602
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:04,399
but then like you know i got a couple of

2603
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,560
buddies that like

2604
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,399
i mean they could be like yeah my you

2605
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,280
know my back hurts a little bit

2606
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:13,279
or whatever you know they they're fine

2607
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,198
monetarily or whatever

2608
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:16,639
and that's one thing but it's yet

2609
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:19,119
another thing you know

2610
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,480
one it's kids two they're really sick

2611
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:22,719
very very sick

2612
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,000
and three like family doesn't have any

2613
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,760
money because you know

2614
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,119
all of it goes to doctor bills if they

2615
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,840
do got any you know

2616
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:30,479
so like with them like i don't charge a

2617
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,319
penny

2618
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:34,479
you know i just give it to them like

2619
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:37,439
here it is it's on the house

2620
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:38,399
but like if my buddy that like his back

2621
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,000
was you know

2622
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,359
whatever i don't i really don't give a

2623
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,960
[ __ ] what did it what it's for they're

2624
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:46,319
gonna they're gonna pay me

2625
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,719
and they're gonna pay me good for it

2626
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:49,759
yeah yeah that's that's kind of what i'm

2627
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,480
thinking

2628
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,920
yeah another kind of similar thing to

2629
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:56,079
what we're referencing with you know

2630
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,440
like compensating people for finding the

2631
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:01,198
clones

2632
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:03,599
is that often you'll hear stories of

2633
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:04,719
people being like oh yeah this this

2634
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,400
clone was worth

2635
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,920
five thousand dollars ten thousand

2636
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:09,279
dollars and you know and and the

2637
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,319
underlying tone is

2638
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:13,599
that's outrageous and it's like but at

2639
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:15,359
the same time

2640
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,880
the person who found that maybe had to

2641
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:17,599
do such a big phenomenon that they

2642
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,600
forego

2643
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,280
like more than that amount of money in

2644
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,280
you know what i mean potential crop

2645
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:25,198
and so i guess what i'm thinking is do

2646
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:26,800
you see a bit of a cognitive dissonance

2647
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:28,238
there in the way i do where it's like

2648
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,679
well to get these things you need to

2649
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:31,198
sacrifice and you're not willing to make

2650
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:33,520
that sacrifice so

2651
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:35,039
you kind of do have to compensate in a

2652
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,000
way you know what i mean or do you think

2653
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:37,359
like now you shouldn't

2654
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,279
really charge for clones or something

2655
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:42,399
along those lines well

2656
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:43,519
i mean people are going to pay and

2657
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:46,079
people are going to do

2658
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,520
and do what they want to do so like as

2659
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,760
long as there are people

2660
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,440
out there willing to pay it people are

2661
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:55,280
going to be out there selling it

2662
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:57,839
you know like um there there's a lot of

2663
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:59,679
things out there that go for astronaut

2664
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:01,039
astronomical amounts of money that

2665
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,079
aren't really

2666
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:05,920
there's no like real hard work into it

2667
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,679
or anything it's just based off of

2668
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,279
rarity you know there's a lot of

2669
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,520
paintings out there that are worth

2670
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,920
millions of dollars that

2671
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,760
frankly i mean to me this looks like

2672
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,679
[ __ ] this looks like somebody just

2673
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:20,079
[ __ ] threw up goddamn color

2674
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:21,199
on a canvas you know but to somebody

2675
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,559
that's

2676
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:27,839
priceless you know so you got that

2677
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:29,840
end of it um then you have

2678
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,360
the other end of it i guess like if it

2679
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,840
was like uh

2680
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:35,759
say like for breeding or what have you

2681
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,639
you know like if it was that rare of a

2682
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,400
genetic or something or whatnot i could

2683
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,210
see like value in that

2684
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:44,319
um or if like you were making um

2685
01:36:43,210 --> 01:36:46,880
[Music]

2686
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:48,079
making a seed line right like we have to

2687
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,079
do the same thing

2688
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:51,679
we have to grow out a whole lot you know

2689
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,439
stuff and

2690
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,800
you know a lot of it doesn't turn out

2691
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:57,439
that great you know

2692
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,880
like i mean it's all right most people

2693
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:01,919
would be stoked but

2694
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,760
i'm not so to me it was like you know

2695
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,118
it was filling up space where it could

2696
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,960
have been used for something else so

2697
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,880
like you take losses there

2698
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,639
but when you do have like your good seed

2699
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,319
lines and you sell it i mean that's why

2700
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:15,359
we charge money for it

2701
01:37:12,319 --> 01:37:16,479
because you know we had to put money and

2702
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:19,439
space and time

2703
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:21,678
into it you know um and then there's

2704
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:23,839
guys that sell like individual

2705
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,679
clones you know flats of clones like us

2706
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,840
to make their money back

2707
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,840
and then there's other people like we

2708
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:32,159
used to do back in the day we'd make

2709
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,360
[ __ ] that the other guy doesn't have and

2710
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:34,079
we know he don't got it because he

2711
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:36,158
couldn't make it

2712
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:38,079
you know it was something very unique

2713
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:39,279
but in that case we would hoard the hell

2714
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:41,679
out of the clone

2715
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:42,639
and um we'd be the one growing the wheat

2716
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,480
and selling the weed

2717
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:46,159
and nobody else had that weed because we

2718
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:47,839
had that weed you know

2719
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:49,920
so we were getting reimbursed in that

2720
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:52,239
way so

2721
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,520
it seems like no matter what you know

2722
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:56,638
somebody's gonna get

2723
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:59,520
reimbursed for it no matter what

2724
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,118
but to what degree you know because like

2725
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,880
there's people who sell like thousand

2726
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:04,880
dollar packs of

2727
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,400
randomly chucked together seeds and

2728
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,600
fancy boxes like

2729
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:11,599
people people do that [ __ ] you know but

2730
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,600
it was like real rare and maybe it's

2731
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,239
like the dankest [ __ ] on earth like i

2732
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,039
don't know

2733
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:18,238
but there were people there like waiting

2734
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:21,039
to pay it you know

2735
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,158
just because you know beauty's in the

2736
01:38:21,039 --> 01:38:25,760
eye of the beholder

2737
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:28,479
i guess you know yeah okay

2738
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,560
and so if we jump over to some more

2739
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:33,319
growing style questions

2740
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,039
we've seen a rise in popularity of

2741
01:38:33,319 --> 01:38:36,799
defoliation lately

2742
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:38,880
what's your kind of thoughts on this

2743
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,000
whole thing are you into it or do you

2744
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:45,359
feel it's maybe counterproductive

2745
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,560
uh it depends uh like it goes back to

2746
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:48,559
the feeding thing

2747
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:51,119
and how caliber plants kind of different

2748
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,000
you know some plants are into it some of

2749
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:53,599
them aren't

2750
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,359
some of them are into it but only at

2751
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:58,480
certain points during the cycle

2752
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:01,679
you know what i mean so i've never

2753
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:04,959
gone so extreme as like

2754
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:08,158
what i've what i've seen but i mean i

2755
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:10,239
like on headband you know i defoliate it

2756
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:11,359
you know fairly fairly heavy in the

2757
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:13,759
beginning and

2758
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:14,719
sometimes even like cut them back just

2759
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:17,199
so that way they'll

2760
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:19,039
um they'll stack a little bit harder you

2761
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:20,559
know

2762
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:24,238
certain things that want to stretch a

2763
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:26,719
lot like that and get viney on you

2764
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:27,678
they tend to respond a little bit better

2765
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:30,239
to that

2766
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:31,199
um you could take like that skelly hash

2767
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:35,039
plants a leaf

2768
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:37,678
monster you know um you can

2769
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:38,399
pull off so much leaf off of that thing

2770
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,440
but

2771
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:43,679
i found that it likes it like done at a

2772
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:46,479
couple different points you know

2773
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,960
so like pre pre-flower and then a little

2774
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:48,779
bit

2775
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,319
um a little bit later

2776
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:52,399
[Music]

2777
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:54,000
but it grows too much leaf so you have

2778
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:57,039
to pull it off

2779
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,479
and um but it still wants some

2780
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:00,079
you know i don't like it like if you

2781
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:03,198
just strip them all off

2782
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:05,359
and don't like that at all so it just

2783
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:08,158
depends you know

2784
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:10,238
and so you mentioned earlier you like to

2785
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:10,799
rotate your enzymes in your feedings be

2786
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:13,919
it the

2787
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,679
aloe the cocoa or the mold how do you

2788
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,158
kind of rotate your feedings you know

2789
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,960
because

2790
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:20,960
question i get asked a lot by people is

2791
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,000
should you try to like stagger each

2792
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,079
thing you know like as you

2793
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,359
reference like malt one time something

2794
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:26,238
else the next something else the

2795
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:28,479
following

2796
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:29,678
or a bit of everything in one do you

2797
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:30,000
think there's a difference between the

2798
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,079
two

2799
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,238
what's your breakdown on the situation

2800
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:35,519
i've messed around with a few different

2801
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:37,678
ways from like

2802
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,080
using nothing but the one thing each

2803
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,279
grow and then going to where i was like

2804
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:42,960
staggering it

2805
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:44,639
and then where i was going like half

2806
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:48,880
strength with both you know

2807
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:52,000
to kind of combine them and then um

2808
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:54,079
going with using one in the first

2809
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,319
part of the cycle and then another one

2810
01:40:54,079 --> 01:41:00,479
during the latter part of the cycle

2811
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:02,399
um and it does it does seem to

2812
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,079
it does seem to kind of have their their

2813
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:06,559
benefits on the timing

2814
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:07,279
but i don't know if it's just me or not

2815
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,400
so

2816
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:12,158
um i would just say like you know

2817
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:15,519
play around with all those things and

2818
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:15,519
see what works best for you

2819
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,440
okay and i had actually read some things

2820
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:21,839
saying that

2821
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,198
some of the specific cytokines in

2822
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,840
coconut water

2823
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:28,158
may not be all that um how should we say

2824
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,600
advantageous in flower versus say

2825
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:31,039
veg have you ever noticed anything like

2826
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,560
that or do you find coconut water and

2827
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:35,439
flour is still good

2828
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,360
yeah it's pretty damn good and um i

2829
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:39,439
think like a lot of the simple sugars

2830
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:42,238
and carbohydrates that are in it

2831
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:43,118
um help with the terpene production a

2832
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:45,678
little bit

2833
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:47,279
so like i'd be more inclined to use like

2834
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,399
make sure that i was using like the

2835
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,519
coconut water

2836
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:54,799
like later you know like mid bloom

2837
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:56,480
and stuff that's just my my opinion on

2838
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,520
it

2839
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:00,000
and so in some of your posts we've

2840
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,040
started

2841
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,000
to see more and more reference including

2842
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:09,600
other people as well the va afghani you

2843
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:13,679
know what can you tell us about this one

2844
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:16,719
oh it's just a really old um

2845
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:20,319
afghani like afghani one cut

2846
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:22,079
um i think like we've

2847
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:24,000
like i know i've talked to a couple

2848
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:26,800
people that were going to um

2849
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,960
dcu college like downtown richmond like

2850
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,920
the very early 80s that were

2851
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,359
smoking that same bug and same crew of

2852
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,880
dudes that were kind of running it

2853
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:38,158
around and growing it

2854
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:43,840
so it's just really old um it's really

2855
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:46,879
piney with eucalyptus pine um

2856
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:49,199
sagey sandalwoody you know

2857
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,239
very very funky but it's really really

2858
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:53,759
potent you know

2859
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:57,118
and very heavy and dense dense weed too

2860
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:59,760
so it was a always a good grower um

2861
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:00,639
the potency on it was like real top

2862
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,079
notch man

2863
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:05,359
it's real nice do you plan to braid with

2864
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:09,679
it at all

2865
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:11,920
oh yeah yeah man been doing it just uh

2866
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:13,440
haven't really been talking about it yet

2867
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,520
trying to make everything like a big

2868
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:19,839
surprise for everybody man

2869
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,840
i've probably already said too much but

2870
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:29,359
when can we expect a grand unveiling

2871
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:32,400
i don't even know man i reckon whenever

2872
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:36,158
whenever it's done okay

2873
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:39,439
okay shouldn't be too long

2874
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:40,000
so in recent interviews uh we've brought

2875
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:42,079
up the

2876
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,920
the topic of the brothers of eternal

2877
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:46,559
love and how

2878
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,600
you know their stock is kind of similar

2879
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,239
to the ssc

2880
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:51,840
regarded you know extremely highly if

2881
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:52,079
you had to choose between the two you

2882
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,560
know

2883
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:56,158
i know that they're not exactly apples

2884
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,719
to apples so to speak because you know

2885
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:00,319
like bowl didn't make packs of seeds but

2886
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,079
if you had to metaphorically choose

2887
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:03,279
between a pack of bowl and a pack of

2888
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:05,439
sssc

2889
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:08,000
and it could be either of either you

2890
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:11,039
know what what would you pick

2891
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,399
um it depends on what it does

2892
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:16,880
you know but i i'd like to think i'd

2893
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:18,960
i'd go with the brotherhood stuff you

2894
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,279
know a little bit more

2895
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,560
because a lot of like european stuff

2896
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,198
revolved around

2897
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,960
american stuff you know they got took

2898
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:30,638
back over there

2899
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:35,118
so i'd like to think like the bowl

2900
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:36,960
and the sacred seeds you know and dojo

2901
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:38,880
and those cats like i'd like to think

2902
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,800
like there's a little more stout

2903
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:42,159
you know a little more a little more

2904
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,600
hardcore

2905
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:47,279
but like ssc man like they won't

2906
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,880
they didn't produce no slouch [ __ ]

2907
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:51,359
either so

2908
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,159
um that's a tough one but like certain

2909
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:55,839
things

2910
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:58,319
you know i would definitely be

2911
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,279
you know looking at the seed club stuff

2912
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:01,519
but

2913
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,840
yeah if like if you you know had a gun

2914
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:07,679
in my head made me pick one and i'd go

2915
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,440
brotherhood [ __ ] nice okay

2916
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,600
and so are there any clones out there

2917
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:11,919
currently that you would love to work

2918
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,280
with

2919
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,840
like you know you know they're about but

2920
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:18,079
you just haven't got for one reason or

2921
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:19,840
another williams wonder man

2922
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:21,118
really good williams wonder would be

2923
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:24,880
nice

2924
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:28,000
and i don't know that's probably

2925
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:30,079
probably about it i've seen a few posts

2926
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,760
of that popping up do you think it's

2927
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:32,960
all legit or maybe there's a few people

2928
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,760
who think they have it but they don't

2929
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,800
have it

2930
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:39,119
no i don't know i haven't uh

2931
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,079
i haven't seen any or smelled or smoked

2932
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:43,359
them in

2933
01:45:40,079 --> 01:45:45,519
long time so yeah

2934
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:46,960
[ __ ] man ain't no telling i would

2935
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,119
imagine like

2936
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:51,198
you know that stuff was pretty damn good

2937
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:53,519
so i would imagine like people kept

2938
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:55,198
kept some clones rolling you know i'd

2939
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,880
find it hard to believe that it

2940
01:45:55,198 --> 01:46:02,559
you know it's extinct extinct yeah okay

2941
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:04,800
and so if you had to pick just one clone

2942
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,400
that you felt had the most potential to

2943
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,119
breed with what would it be

2944
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:10,960
and i guess by that i mean it pairs well

2945
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:12,000
with just like such a variety of

2946
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,920
different males

2947
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,520
you know he just consistently produces

2948
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,199
good results you know what's your one

2949
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,880
client

2950
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:24,158
uh as far as like a male to to

2951
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,440
to cross to or female yeah like a female

2952
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:28,638
yeah just works well in

2953
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:31,519
all the hybrids i don't know

2954
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:33,279
man like i mean there's there's certain

2955
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:35,119
ones it's like you can take it to the

2956
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:37,840
bank and count on it you know

2957
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:39,519
like producing a certain result and then

2958
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,679
there's other ones that like

2959
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,639
you could get like such a varied result

2960
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:44,399
where you could

2961
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,840
end up with 10 different other things to

2962
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:47,599
work on

2963
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,279
so if i was looking for like the old

2964
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,039
faithful or if i was looking for

2965
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:51,840
something to give me a multitude of

2966
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:55,760
variety

2967
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,369
you know yeah

2968
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,439
um

2969
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:59,439
[Music]

2970
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:04,559
i don't know that's that's a really hard

2971
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,239
question man

2972
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,600
yeah all right well how about another

2973
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:10,319
one that just came to mind

2974
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,039
out of all the females you work with

2975
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:13,279
what's your

2976
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,039
what's your go-to female for when you

2977
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:16,800
want to cross a male to

2978
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:18,319
you know like we referenced it early you

2979
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:19,920
know like you're going to cross a new

2980
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:22,559
male to something in a project but

2981
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,279
you've always got that one standby where

2982
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,360
you know

2983
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:27,920
how it reads you know what's predictable

2984
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:29,359
so you can use it as like a calibration

2985
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:32,560
reference almost

2986
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:35,118
what female is that for you um

2987
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,760
i can like local h is real good about

2988
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:38,079
that

2989
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,199
you know um there's a couple of them

2990
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,118
that are

2991
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:42,638
really good because like i know like if

2992
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:46,000
it can dominate over

2993
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:49,199
something from a particular cross then

2994
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,760
you know that i'm i'm doing pretty

2995
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:52,559
pretty damn good like that's my my goal

2996
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,400
is to

2997
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,960
you know have a male that's a little

2998
01:47:54,399 --> 01:48:00,719
more dominant you know

2999
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:02,319
so uh but that local is pretty good

3000
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:04,079
you know it can tell me a whole lot

3001
01:48:02,319 --> 01:48:06,000
about what what something's doing with

3002
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:09,279
structure especially

3003
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,560
um especially if i'm running down a

3004
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:13,279
particular

3005
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,199
set of genes you know it can tell me a

3006
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:18,800
whole lot

3007
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:20,960
yeah okay so another little personal

3008
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,920
question i wanted to sneak in there

3009
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,719
do you think it's detrimental at all to

3010
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,760
have

3011
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:28,480
a male in your flowering room from

3012
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,360
flower

3013
01:48:28,479 --> 01:48:33,039
day one such that essentially you know

3014
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:34,960
the the first pistols are that are

3015
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:35,679
emerging on the females are going to be

3016
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,158
pollinated

3017
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:40,158
fairly shortly after that or as soon as

3018
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:42,238
they emerge like do you think that's

3019
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,079
detrimental at all just because the

3020
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,000
common thing which you know i even say

3021
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:47,679
to people when they ask me is

3022
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,600
oh you know ideally you want to

3023
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,399
pollinate the females around week three

3024
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,719
week four

3025
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,399
so you know probably introduce the male

3026
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:55,679
into the room around about that time

3027
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:58,238
which is obviously

3028
01:48:55,679 --> 01:49:01,520
counter to what i just mentioned earlier

3029
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:03,439
what how do you feel about it all

3030
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,560
of course you know different females are

3031
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:08,000
going to have different

3032
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:11,199
flowering times um

3033
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,079
they all have their own

3034
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:14,719
peak time i would say like to get

3035
01:49:14,079 --> 01:49:18,319
overall

3036
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:21,679
saturation right now with your male

3037
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:24,399
it's going to be the same thing i have

3038
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:26,840
some males that are very fast

3039
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:28,000
that are actually faster than the

3040
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,039
females

3041
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,079
so he's already dumping pollen

3042
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:37,519
by the time that they're just getting

3043
01:49:34,079 --> 01:49:39,599
like tiny popcorn buds you know

3044
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,119
that and me personally that would be

3045
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:43,920
that would be too early

3046
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:44,719
you know i mean if you're making beans

3047
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,039
for yourself

3048
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,480
like just [ __ ] rounds whatever but

3049
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,359
like if you were doing it in a

3050
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:51,279
production

3051
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:53,118
type thing you know that wouldn't be

3052
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:54,319
good you know you'd want them a little

3053
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:57,039
further along

3054
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,719
so you'd really have to know when did

3055
01:49:57,039 --> 01:49:59,679
your when does your mail start to

3056
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:02,639
actually drop

3057
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:04,319
drop pollen you know and then you can

3058
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:07,359
kind of gauge that

3059
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:09,118
um versus like the peak time on the

3060
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:10,719
females that are going to go in

3061
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,479
and then that wouldn't bring them in

3062
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:16,158
because certain ones

3063
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:18,238
um there was like a

3064
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:19,598
certain sativa male in the past you

3065
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:23,198
would have to put it in

3066
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:25,679
almost a week ahead of all the females

3067
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:27,439
you know um and then there's another one

3068
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:30,480
that i can't put in the room until like

3069
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:32,879
day 14 of bloom for the females

3070
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:33,919
you know so there's some that go in on

3071
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,440
the same day

3072
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,000
you know so you got to really have it

3073
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:40,638
timed out on how your boy is

3074
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,359
um so to know like when you're going to

3075
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:45,920
hit your

3076
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:47,679
peak sack yeah peak saturation

3077
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,760
okay interesting and and what do you

3078
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:52,960
think is the peak saturation

3079
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:54,880
from most plants in the sense that i've

3080
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,719
heard pretty wildly varying

3081
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,079
figures in terms of like the number of

3082
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:59,760
seeds you can get off a plant

3083
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:01,279
obviously it's got a lot to do with the

3084
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,679
size of the plant but

3085
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:05,118
i mean often people will talk about a

3086
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:06,800
plant in a certain size

3087
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:08,719
pot and that helps to give a little bit

3088
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,960
of frame to the whole metric but

3089
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:12,639
some people say you get 15 000 off a

3090
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:16,079
plant where others will say for the same

3091
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:20,639
size plant you'll only get 1.5 000.

3092
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:23,439
what what is it um well one it's

3093
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,480
not just how many there are it's the

3094
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:27,839
quality

3095
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,158
of the ones that are there um if you're

3096
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,520
too

3097
01:51:28,158 --> 01:51:34,559
late going in you could end up with

3098
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:38,320
thirty thousand but you know

3099
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:40,719
twenty thousand are good you know um

3100
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:42,079
if you're too early you know you might

3101
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,000
end up with ten thousand

3102
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:45,359
really really perfect ones and not the

3103
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
first dud

3104
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:48,719
um so there's there is like a balance

3105
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,960
you know

3106
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:53,840
but i think like if you hit if you hit

3107
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,760
the plan at the right time i mean you

3108
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,079
you can get a lot of them and have them

3109
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:59,280
all all be good at the same time you

3110
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:00,960
know if you're giving them the right

3111
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:04,079
nutrition and

3112
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:07,520
um trying to facilitate seed production

3113
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:09,359
type type food you know

3114
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,280
you can have some really nice seeds and

3115
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:14,319
a whole whole lot of them

3116
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:17,519
fifteen twenty thousands not that

3117
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:20,719
you know it's not that unfathomable

3118
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,400
to have on a plant yeah okay and what

3119
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,520
would be your advice for helping to

3120
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:26,399
supplement

3121
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,159
the uh seeded plants nutrient demands

3122
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:29,279
after it has been pollinated because it

3123
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:31,039
seems as though

3124
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:32,800
the nutrient requirements for a seeded

3125
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:34,479
plant is probably about on par for a

3126
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,039
flowering plant at least from what i've

3127
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:37,039
seen

3128
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:38,719
but at the same time you know it's it

3129
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:40,319
seems as though you can certainly keep a

3130
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,359
seeded plant very happy and i think

3131
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:43,359
that's maybe a little bit of a

3132
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:45,039
misconception people think that

3133
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:46,880
seated plant will just look [ __ ] or

3134
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:49,679
maybe like they use it to give credence

3135
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:53,520
to the fact that their plant looks [ __ ]

3136
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:53,920
yeah nah like um like you they should

3137
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,360
look

3138
01:52:53,920 --> 01:53:00,079
look pretty good you know like on

3139
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:01,519
when i when i make seeds like a lot of

3140
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:03,920
the stuff it looks just

3141
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,119
very similar to the room like when it's

3142
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,480
unseated

3143
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:10,479
you know like very very fat and

3144
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:12,238
small calyxes because there's actually

3145
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:15,919
seeds in it instead of

3146
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:18,559
swelling um lots of resin lots of stink

3147
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,158
you know everything's right on point

3148
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,840
point with that

3149
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:26,399
i've always been under the

3150
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,599
thought of like i mean you're

3151
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,719
reproducing

3152
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:32,719
you know and um you know new life

3153
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:35,279
is being created not only is it being

3154
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:38,719
created but it's being created at like

3155
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:40,880
you know 15 or 20 000 fold

3156
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:43,279
that you would want to facilitate the

3157
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,239
building the dna building blocks as much

3158
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:48,399
as possible

3159
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:51,678
you know so i think like the amino acids

3160
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:54,879
and um heavy emphasis

3161
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:57,039
not so much on the npk side but a lot of

3162
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,440
other smaller things that go unnoticed

3163
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:00,719
like

3164
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:03,678
tend to tend to help facilitate the seed

3165
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:04,800
seed making as well boron's a real big

3166
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:08,079
one

3167
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,079
and yeah you know and like i said you

3168
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:11,439
know keeping a good steady diet or that

3169
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:15,198
type of stuff you know

3170
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:18,238
pretty moderate npk um seems to

3171
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:18,238
seem to do the best

3172
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:23,840
yeah okay awesome and so what would be

3173
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:25,679
your advice to people who feel like

3174
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,719
they've got a pretty solid grasp on

3175
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,319
organics

3176
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,158
that are really looking to take it to

3177
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:31,920
the next level whether it be you know in

3178
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:33,439
general maybe they're looking to

3179
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,679
get a bit more out of their crop you

3180
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:36,000
know like what's kind of your advice

3181
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,760
maybe

3182
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,359
in terms of resources to look up

3183
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,560
products to look into things like that

3184
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:42,238
you know like what's some of the more

3185
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,920
advanced stuff that

3186
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:45,919
you feel can help people take their game

3187
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:49,118
to the next level

3188
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:52,000
i really feel like the most simple

3189
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:54,158
approach is always the best in that a

3190
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,279
lot of it really falls into your

3191
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:58,638
environment

3192
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:59,519
and like you were saying earlier really

3193
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:01,920
tuning

3194
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,639
your plant knowing exactly how much it

3195
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:06,158
wants to eat or not eat so

3196
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:08,560
you know like you're saying like you got

3197
01:55:06,158 --> 01:55:10,238
a plant doesn't show any deficiencies at

3198
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,679
all but you know had you fed it that

3199
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:14,799
little more it would have

3200
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:16,800
doubled in size what have you um vice

3201
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:17,599
versa with the one that's not burning

3202
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,520
but

3203
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:21,920
you know it's being over fed so it

3204
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,880
doesn't doesn't want to blow out

3205
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:27,520
um so i think a lot of it has to do with

3206
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:29,760
like one's tuning to a plant

3207
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:31,520
and then also their environment you know

3208
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,079
making sure the environment's real nice

3209
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:35,119
temperature

3210
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:38,158
humidity was um

3211
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:39,679
light intensity is also a big one a lot

3212
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:42,719
of people overkill their

3213
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:45,920
their plants um

3214
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:47,118
so you know if you can get like a little

3215
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,880
cheap light meter

3216
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:50,319
play around with that a little bit that

3217
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,140
tends to help

3218
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:53,519
um

3219
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:56,159
[Music]

3220
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,920
as far as like nutrition wise like uh

3221
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:01,359
like i'm pretty sold on

3222
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:03,840
the dragonfly stuff man you know

3223
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:05,519
so i used to like make my own little

3224
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,039
tees from scratch you know raw

3225
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,520
amendments but

3226
01:56:07,039 --> 01:56:10,319
like the dragonfly's taking it up you

3227
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,000
know

3228
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:17,439
quite quite a substantial notch so

3229
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,960
i'm real big on that um adding grow

3230
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:21,198
stones and everything

3231
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,039
to the soil um when you're not breaking

3232
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:25,439
the root ball up and tilling it all

3233
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:29,039
up you know i don't want to say like i'm

3234
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:32,638
doing no-till but i mean essentially um

3235
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:35,599
yeah yeah you know agree

3236
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:36,880
but um i just remember i just remembered

3237
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:39,840
how you were like

3238
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:42,480
ain't no no-till going on here yeah yeah

3239
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:45,199
yeah exactly bad

3240
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:46,879
that was a really good accent too that's

3241
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:49,359
funny as [ __ ]

3242
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,639
well as it turns out we're down to like

3243
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,359
our last few questions

3244
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:55,118
so first one i've been asking everyone

3245
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:56,479
over the past few months it's kind of

3246
01:56:55,118 --> 01:56:58,559
like died off a bit but it's i think

3247
01:56:56,479 --> 01:57:00,559
it's still a bit of a pertinent question

3248
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:03,039
should you ask for permission so let's

3249
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,960
give the most extreme example

3250
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:06,560
um you know obviously given you've got a

3251
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,920
good relationship with mass g

3252
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,360
this would never actually happen but

3253
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,880
let's just say you went to recreate a

3254
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:11,598
batch of grim dog and for whatever

3255
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,440
reason

3256
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:14,880
he contacts you and says i'm really not

3257
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:16,238
comfortable with you doing that

3258
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,319
would that be enough for you to not do

3259
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:20,479
it or you know like do you feel like

3260
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:21,920
you need to respect someone's intentions

3261
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:24,000
to the point where like it could

3262
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:26,239
literally stop you from making something

3263
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,840
like that or you know what i mean where

3264
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:30,399
do you sit on that issue

3265
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:31,920
well me personally like you know i have

3266
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:34,559
a respect for people

3267
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,480
and you know i was raised pretty good so

3268
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:39,920
like me personally i'd be like yeah

3269
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:43,759
without a doubt you got it at 86 at

3270
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:44,800
that moment you know um i know a lot of

3271
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,119
people don't

3272
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:49,199
you know because like they don't their

3273
01:57:47,118 --> 01:57:49,759
circumstances are different than mine

3274
01:57:49,198 --> 01:57:53,039
you know

3275
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,960
if the guy the guy who you know popped

3276
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:57,279
the seed that found the clone is also

3277
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,760
the same dude that gave me the clone

3278
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:01,039
the whole reason i got it and you know

3279
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,760
i'm gonna respect that

3280
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:05,279
you know but a lot of these guys you

3281
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,920
know they

3282
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:09,519
they scored their clan off of a forum

3283
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:12,880
from a guys guys

3284
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:16,239
cousins uncles from maui and

good game plan alrighty so next little

3297
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:46,000
question i think you'll

3298
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,679
be able to help me resolve is after

3299
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,279
discussing it with a few people the

3300
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:52,880
consensus seems to be

3301
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:56,399
that the joshie d o g

3302
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:59,118
is the ghost og but it's not the tk

3303
01:58:56,399 --> 01:58:59,519
but people seem to be suggesting that

3304
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:02,559
it's

3305
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:04,560
probably an s1 of the tk

3306
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:07,520
how does that all sound to you in terms

3307
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:10,639
of like correctness so to speak

3308
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:12,239
shut up man like i

3309
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,560
always thought that they were all the

3310
01:59:12,238 --> 01:59:17,678
same but yeah

3311
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:21,119
okay i mean um

3312
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:23,599
yeah maybe maybe they are um

3313
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:24,479
because like i've never been able to

3314
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:27,520
like

3315
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:30,079
uh so like if let's say like josh d

3316
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:31,199
comes up and he's like hey buddy here's

3317
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:33,840
this this uh

3318
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,559
og kush you know i want you to get to

3319
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,199
grow it

3320
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:37,599
and i'm like okay and if he told me like

3321
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:39,839
yeah

3322
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,840
this like you know we had a buddy that

3323
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,159
held onto the clone and called him ghost

3324
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,159
and

3325
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:45,279
you know blah blah they run through the

3326
01:59:44,158 --> 01:59:47,359
story and it

3327
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:48,800
tells me like yeah it's the same clones

3328
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:51,519
just a different name

3329
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:53,360
it would be like skunk va chem dog right

3330
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,040
it's really it's chem dog right

3331
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:57,039
but you know there's something else

3332
01:59:55,039 --> 01:59:58,560
attached to it but you know

3333
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:01,359
you could say it's like yeah it's the

3334
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:03,679
same clan now if he gave that to me

3335
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:04,719
and then say like cornbread's like hey

3336
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,800
buddy

3337
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:09,439
here's my tk con and grow it now if i

3338
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:12,159
can grow them side by side

3339
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:12,638
then maybe i could i could answer that

3340
02:00:12,158 --> 02:00:16,238
better

3341
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:18,880
but i've never had that that happen

3342
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:19,759
so um and like it's weird too because

3343
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,159
like

3344
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:23,760
you know people's like grow style and

3345
02:00:22,158 --> 02:00:25,439
stuff like you know you can smoke

3346
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,000
something it tastes completely different

3347
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:27,759
than the other

3348
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,760
guy they're growing like the same [ __ ]

3349
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,639
but you know they have a little bit

3350
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,639
different

3351
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:34,719
way of doing it you know sometimes

3352
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:37,920
things express a little bit differently

3353
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:40,239
so that's always real real hard

3354
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:42,239
yeah totally i think it's actually quite

3355
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:43,118
dramatic the differences from person to

3356
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:44,559
person where

3357
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:46,719
it's at the point where even if you're

3358
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:48,320
running all the same strains as say you

3359
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,800
may like you're gonna kind of have your

3360
02:00:48,319 --> 02:00:50,399
own

3361
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,760
weed in a way like you know like it's

3362
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:53,519
you got your own little fingerprint of

3363
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:57,039
growing almost

3364
02:00:53,520 --> 02:01:00,639
yeah man yeah exactly

3365
02:00:57,039 --> 02:01:00,960
alrighty so one question i wanted to ask

3366
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:03,679
you

3367
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:04,399
was do you have like a cut of northern

3368
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:07,440
lights

3369
02:01:04,399 --> 02:01:09,519
or like something akin to that that you

3370
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:10,638
use or you're just never interested like

3371
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,000
it's never really come up when we've

3372
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:16,800
been chatting

3373
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:18,639
yeah i do but you know like uh

3374
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,320
northern lights is like one of them

3375
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:22,480
things um

3376
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:24,880
like if somebody like offers it to me

3377
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:26,799
right like i'm always real leery of it

3378
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,118
it's like sour diesel or something you

3379
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:31,599
know

3380
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:34,639
it's like ah you know i don't know man

3381
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:36,239
you know yeah um but yeah

3382
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:38,159
yeah and like that's that's another

3383
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:40,879
little another little project that's

3384
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:44,479
going on at the same time

3385
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:48,400
he said all all in due time buddy

3386
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:51,678
sneaky very sneaky all righty

3387
02:01:48,399 --> 02:01:54,960
lucky last question oh sorry going

3388
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:57,118
i was fun all right

3389
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,800
so yeah lucky last question for today at

3390
02:01:57,118 --> 02:02:01,839
least is

3391
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:03,279
would you and should other people use

3392
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,239
cindy 99

3393
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,920
as a male more so than a female in any

3394
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:09,118
breeding projects they're looking to do

3395
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,440
and the reason why i think of that is

3396
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:12,399
because all the females are consistently

3397
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:14,000
phenomenal

3398
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:16,000
and you know the males are basically

3399
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,238
just male versions of the females

3400
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,279
and so there's really like no guesswork

3401
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:22,959
in it you know it seems like um

3402
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:24,399
it seems like yeah like you're just

3403
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,960
going to have a killer mail no matter

3404
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:27,839
what

3405
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,480
so with that in mind would you not want

3406
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,960
to use

3407
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:34,319
it as a male in the cross because taking

3408
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:36,960
the guesswork out of finding a good male

3409
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:38,079
um no i mean it's it's a pretty good

3410
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:42,239
place to start

3411
02:02:38,079 --> 02:02:44,319
and like um anything that's been inbred

3412
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:47,039
you know heavily that still produces

3413
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:50,559
like really killer female offspring

3414
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:52,158
um and like you know fairly consistent

3415
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,080
you know that's that's gonna help you a

3416
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:56,158
lot so

3417
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:57,920
like skunk one you know that was like

3418
02:02:56,158 --> 02:02:59,519
bread to like f4

3419
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,599
you know that was that was a great one

3420
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,040
to use you know that's why it was like a

3421
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,639
pretty good backbone

3422
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:06,158
some of the northern lights that were

3423
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,079
worked same way

3424
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:11,279
um it gave you a pretty predictable

3425
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:13,599
outcome in that f1 generation you know

3426
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:14,880
and then the rest of it was kind of

3427
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,199
working up to you

3428
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:18,880
you know either philly would breed it or

3429
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:20,000
back cross it or whatever you were going

3430
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:23,279
to do

3431
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,479
yeah i mean my experience with the one

3432
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:27,279
that

3433
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:28,000
i had selected was um it wasn't taking

3434
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:29,599
anything away

3435
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,279
from the from the mother in the

3436
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:33,520
offspring you know

3437
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:36,238
it was just kind of adding adding some

3438
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:38,320
good some good notes to it you know

3439
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:39,759
so that that was nice it wasn't like

3440
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:42,639
overly dominating

3441
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,679
which to me is like kind of important

3442
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:46,560
like if you're making like

3443
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:48,560
f1 because you know the mother's like

3444
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,760
it's got so many good qualities that you

3445
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:52,079
really want to retain

3446
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,840
you could go that route and just kind of

3447
02:03:52,078 --> 02:03:55,359
enhance it a little bit you know it's

3448
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:57,920
going to change some

3449
02:03:55,359 --> 02:04:00,000
of course but you you retain a lot of

3450
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:03,118
those high notes from the mom

3451
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,800
so um that was a you know pretty good

3452
02:04:03,118 --> 02:04:08,078
thing

3453
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:10,960
okay i thought of a actually as a sneaky

3454
02:04:08,078 --> 02:04:12,880
last question for you hopefully this one

3455
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:14,480
will make you laugh

3456
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,920
we got we got the newest hype straight

3457
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:17,519
on the scene in my opinion

3458
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,880
and it's somewhat related to you so

3459
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,440
you're gonna have to have an opinion on

3460
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,118
it

3461
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:24,238
gmo oh yeah it's the chem d and the

3462
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:26,880
cooks

3463
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:28,638
yeah is it how do you feel you feel like

3464
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:33,199
