135
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,300
at Green Brothers Farm in Lockeford

136
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:46,079
California

139
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,960
and the lighting and have to get the

140
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,180
final approval you know from the city

141
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,659
that everything is proper so we're

142
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,300
hoping that we're operational

143
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:03,000
July 1st or July

144
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,918
15th and so I'm extremely excited about

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,519
this project because

146
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:12,599
it's uh it's quite a large one

147
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:14,639
and it's it's been being put together by

148
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,160
a group of people that I've known since

149
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,519
the beginning of the garden spout and

150
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,720
they're hiring people that they know and

151
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,418
trust

152
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,580

206
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,439
yeah that's it

207
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,900
wow this collab that sounds really

208
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,700
awesome when did this first uh come into

209
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:36,179
life you know when did the wheels start

210
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,560
turning on that one 30 years yeah 30

211
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,658
years ago that's exactly what I was

212
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,819
saying

213
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,500
we planned this ball up 30 years ago

214
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,839
we're just waited wow you know just

215
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,320
wanted to make it right so I think we

216
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,720
got it now but uh but yeah sometimes

217
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,640
there's a pause in the middle

218
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,440
you know but yeah Jason was actually the

219
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,819
first person that I ever partnered with

220
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,760
in cultivation really yes I mean I was

221
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,260
growing prior to that but I was doing it

222
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,379
on my own

223
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,838
and Jason was the first person that I

224
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,939
ever helped grow and that I you know

225
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,140
were Partners initially at the beginning

226
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,660
so

227
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,360
I I think and Jason's memory is much

228
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,278
better than mine but I think the

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,740
arrangement that I used to make with

230
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,019
people when I would set them up is that

231
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,180
like we would share the first harvest or

232
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,620
the first two harvests and then they

233
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,559
were on their own is that what I did

234
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,839
with you Jason do you remember no no you

235
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,099
had a much a much sweeter deal for me

236
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,040
you had a

237
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,560
so whatever we grow in the in the

238
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,120
bedroom I sell to you and you alone that

239
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,500
was the deal

240
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,379
[Laughter]

241
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,059
mine is my headstands for both of us

242
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,939
yeah it was pretty good deal yeah yeah

243
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,799
you know and I was already at the time I

244
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,080
was already buying every bit of aircraft

245
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,838
like I actually had a little piece of

246
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,240
paper in my wallet with phone numbers on

247
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,980
one side and you know these cases of

248
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,860
paper fall apart you have to redo it and

249
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,778
then on the back it was uh

250
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,940
um your Harvest dates that you kind of

251
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,379
would whisper out to me you know so I

252
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,300
could make sure to get and touch you so

253
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,320
when those buckets are super skunk were

254
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,359
ready I could go ahead and get them

255
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
because you always had a it was always

256
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,680
Tupperware so it was never bags it was

257
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,838
never bags anymore perfectly cured weed

258
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,338
and tupperwares brand new tupperware's

259
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,320
and the Tupperware of course came with

260
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,360
the weed you put about a quarter pound

261
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,700
of whatever it was

262
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,159
um in a tupperware and I was always

263
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,700
making sure that there was no reason to

264
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,778
sell anyone else because I would show up

265
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,620
they'd smoke with all my friends you

266
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,379
know

267
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,620
I was listening to the podcast number

268
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:49,980
two where Jason was telling the stories

269
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,560
about how we met and I hoped that you

270
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,899
know not to be too redundant but I hope

271
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,379
Jason will tell the story again because

272
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,659
if not for everybody else I just love to

273
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,700
hear it you know for my own selfish

274
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,639
reasons

275
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,800
you know I mean like he'll tell the

276
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,838
story to be way better than I can okay

277
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,159
please be surprised so awesome you'd be

278
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,779
surprised how often I get to tell people

279
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,480
that story and I actually [ __ ] love

280
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:17,399
don't be that story because you know my

281
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,139
memory the way the way my memory kind of

282
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,179
works is like I get visuals like I

283
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:22,980
remember like you know moments and like

284
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,359
very detailed moments almost sometimes I

285
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,920
can even smell

286
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,480
you know like the smells you know like

287
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,979
the Panhandle park it smells like

288
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,539
eucalyptus you know what I mean it

289
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,820
smells like San Francisco and that's got

290
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,099
a very unique smell to it like that jogs

291
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,820
my memory and I love that you know but

292
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,500
yeah so back in those days between you

293
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,720
know Grateful Dead tours was for three

294
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,240
times a year and I was uh at this time a

295
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
permanent you know on tour I was you

296
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,839
know would be called a lifer I was on

297
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,399
tour you know there was no place for me

298
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,240
to go after tour

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,799
so is the van in San Francisco and when

300
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,379
you're you know you're when you're in a

301
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,419
Grateful Dead Land money's just in the

302
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,919
air you just gotta you know you know

303
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,539
kind of do what you got to do reach up

304
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,458
and grab your bit it's a it's a

305
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:08,699
Marketplace you know a lot of people

306
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:11,099
kind of don't know that and the the ones

307
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,720
of us that were there kind of Overlook

308
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,060
it maybe we don't like to talk about it

309
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,300
because maybe what we were selling was

310
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,819
probably you know not legal still and so

311
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,559
but when you left tour you know making

312
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,540
your money was a little difficult so we

313
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,979
would end up in San Francisco

314
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,059
um mostly because the next shows are

315
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,100
probably going to be Jerry at The

316
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,559
Warfield and also that's just kind of

317
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,060
where everybody landed I mean also

318
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,659
because the Grateful Dead literally told

319
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,659
you to go there

320
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,480
yeah but anyway so you go to the

321
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,220
Panhandle and if you're if you you know

322
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,019
while you're there you might as well

323
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,160
sell a little herb to strangers to get

324
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,139
your head stashed and that's kind of

325
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,299
what my day was like every day

326
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,278
for those periods of time and I'm

327
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,958
sitting the thing about it was there was

328
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,600
a spot where everybody would hang out

329
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,179
and that was where you know there was a

330
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,579
rail there for skating and you know it's

331
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,500
like a big black top and the Panhandle

332
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,120
well if you hung out there the problem

333
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,100
was the cops would come sweep the park

334
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,740
every now and again and they would roll

335
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,240
up on dirt bikes and you know if you

336
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,440
were holding you know you might have a

337
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
problem and we're talking like an

338
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,540
instant felony this is you know 1990s

339
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,860
so we I would always stick away from it

340
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,778
because it wasn't really fun for me it

341
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,220
was kind of like stressful I don't think

342
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,740
it was fun for anyone a real stressful

343
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,120
so we just strangers and uh so I'm

344
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,159
sitting on the bench in the Panhandle

345
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,679
and the panhand was like a long straight

346
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,719
thin piece of the park of Golden Gate

347
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,338
that's why they call it the Panhandle

348
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,839
and I'm sitting on this sidewalk so you

349
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,519
can see people walking from very far

350
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,320
away and here comes this guy with this

351
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,839
big old grin on his face you know he's

352
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,879
got a hip sack on he's got a ponytail

353
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,519
and he definitely looks like he wants

354
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,019
some weed I'm like wow man I slow down

355
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,299
buddy like don't be so loud about that

356
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,799
the cops are everywhere you know but um

357
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,659
so when he got to me I was ready to

358
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,399
serve him and before I could say

359
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,639
anything he introduces himself in this

360
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,440
sick New York accent and he asked me he

361
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,879
says uh you know I asked him if you want

362
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,160
to buy some herb and he goes actually

363
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,100
I'd like to I was gonna ask you the same

364
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,778
thing and so I was like well what are

365
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,339
you talking about and so he's like I you

366
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:12,838
know he told me basically what was going

367
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,240
on he was very open he's like you know

368
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,980
I've moved to California I came out here

369
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,139
to see the Jerry Garcia band as much as

370
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,519
I can at The Warfield which I totally

371
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,620
understood it was no need to explain

372
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,299
that any further and he said that you

373
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,100
know he didn't know anybody which I

374
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,139
didn't know anybody either really so I

375
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,480
understood that part and he I was having

376
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,639
a rough time you know getting his ends

377
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,800
met financially because he couldn't sell

378
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,720
the weed let's go look at the weed so we

379
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,219
walked all the way over to uh the

380
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
Central District where he had his Vance

381
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,720
Park and I guess I'll just tell all the

382
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,600
details he had the band he had this long

383
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,800
navy blue van uh that's kind of hard to

384
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
explain but the only way I can explain

385
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,379
to your audience is you know if you see

386
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,480
a van like an old like uh you know Dodge

387
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,220
van or Chevy van and you'll see the

388
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,720
extended band you can see the line on

389
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,759
the back where it actually got extended

390
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,100
well this van actually had another line

391
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,600
with another two feet behind it I don't

392
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,040
know how long the thing was Gabby you

393
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,139
might build a number but it was like it

394
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,659
had to been like 16 feet long 18 feet

395
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,100
long it was incredibly long and we piled

396
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,539
up in that thing and we kind of leveled

397
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,720
out his scale and he pulled all this

398
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:18,240
amazing indoor weed out the Francine

399
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,620
and I don't remember the fluffy sativa

400
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,480
one but that was the one that really

401
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,578
crushed it that day

402
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,399
um I think those are the only two and it

403
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,019
was very little Francine and Gabby had

404
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,519
mentioned earlier in episode two on your

405
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,519
podcast that I mentioned that he was

406
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,720
filming the chemdog and he was writing

407
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,759
pointing out that that would have been

408
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,000
no way out he showed me Kim dock so it

409
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,000
was Francine and some fluffy sativa so

410
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
yeah

411
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,539

412
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:51,899

428
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,799
Island it's just you just didn't know it

429
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,919
until the other day

430
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,559
I didn't know it I I mean honestly at

431
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,179
first I'm just like I was so offended

432
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,299
that people were calling me Staten

433
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:39,838
Island I'm like what the [ __ ] like you

434
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:43,078
can't think of anything nicer to call me

435
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,940
you know like I mean you said such nice

436
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,519
things about me on the podcast how I

437
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,980
like grew the best indoor weeds you'd

438
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,480
ever seen and and this is but then

439
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,600
somehow I'm just known as Staten Island

440
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,820
like the [ __ ] place that smells bad

441
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,620
I did not name you Staten Island but I

442
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,199
have called you that because the public

443
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,659
led me to call you that but I did not

444
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,699
name you that I promise you however you

445
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:07,798

446
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,318

447
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,779
native like you are Staten Island's one

448
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,899
thing but to the rest of the universe

449
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:18,899
Staten Island is just New York now I

450
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,759

Island I just I just sound like there's

454
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,339
something wrong I don't know if you

455
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,159
remember a few years ago there was like

456
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,599
the Garbage barge that was stuck they

457
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,179
had nowhere to like put the garbage

458
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,159
because they wouldn't take it anymore on

459
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,798
Staten Island but it's just like

460
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,380
is literally just never ending garbage

461
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,639
I remember that it felt bad it smelled

462
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,380
bad

463
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,840
well it's a double muscle unless you

464
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,440
unless unless you were right outside a

465
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,538
Brother's Pizza it smelled bad so

466
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,820
go ahead continue the story

467
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:00,179
oh yeah the story um

468
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:02,579
oh so you know so back story what was

469
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:06,419
going on in the city and you know the

470
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:08,038
February of 1993 was you know so you

471
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,500
know you're gonna find some outdoor weed

472
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,839
October November December January

473
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,179
especially but around time January comes

474
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,119
February it starts to dry up especially

475
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,980
back then and those years for some

476
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,319
reason it was just so hard to get like

477
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,538
good weed and you have to get weight so

478
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,220
weight is what that means is you get

479
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:28,558
weight means you're going to get 28

480
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,179
grams for that ounce right weight is

481
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,298
what you get and then you go break up

482
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:36,660
some hates like eights but hate streets

483
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:38,940
of hate hates is where you get 10 if

484
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,700
you're nice 11 or 12 if you're kind of

485
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,460
Stingy eighths out of an ounce so 4 8

486
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,779
for you eight for the crowd you know

487
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,759
that's how you make a little bit money

488
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,019
on a 425

489
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,819
ounce and that's for your buddy this

490
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:53,579
isn't like tax this is just what it is

491
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:55,379
you know and so that's what's going on

492
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:56,699
in the city at the time it's you know it

493
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,380
makes things very difficult like the

494
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,440
money you don't make enough money to you

495
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,940
know barely get by or survive so there

496
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,279
he is Gabby we're in his band he shows

497
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,840
he opens up this duffel bag and I'm like

498
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,339
holy [ __ ] that's [ __ ] beautiful

499
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,019
indoor we haven't seen any of that

500
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,720
around here in a while you know most

501
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,279
people's like out throwing weed so

502
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,538
he said I was like all right well here's

503
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,879
the question how much you want for that

504
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:22,319
and I can't remember exactly but the

505
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,940
number 285 tops of my head or 325 Pops

506
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,399
in my head either one of those numbers

507
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,600
would have made me holy [ __ ] is what I

508
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,820
would have said because that would have

509
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,678
definitely helped and I said listen if

510
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,298
you just stay here and give me a minute

511
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,740
I cannot walk around this duffel bag in

512
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,519
this neighborhood that won't last very

513
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,220
long

514
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,319
but if you stay here and just bear with

515
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,880
me I got a lot of walking to do but I

516
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,339
can get rid of all that and so that's

517
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,500
what we did he just hung out there I

518
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:49,619
just want to interject something that

519
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,839
you said on the previous podcast I want

520
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:54,418
to make sure you don't skip it here you

521
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:58,519
said in that podcast that it was the

522
00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:01,380
greatest indoor you've ever seen I think

523
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,960
I think we should focus on that just

524
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,440
like for us you know not for too long

525
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,419
the greatest indoor you've ever seen and

526
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,860
he had seen some at that point

527
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:17,160
I have yeah so you know 20 year old JK

528
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:19,019
that's me 20 year old JK uh walks you

529
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,519
know his whole deal in the country was

530
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,619
to find the best weed that was what it

531
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,599
was all about I mean it was the music it

532
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,159
was the good times but really you know

533
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,678
the weed is right there it's at the top

534
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,179
so in order to do that you know back

535
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,220
then you kind of had to like you know

536
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,380
network with Growers and you know I was

537
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,360
happy to meet a new one and I mean I

538
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,039
can't disagree about it being the most

539
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,959
high quality indoor I've ever seen I

540
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,519
mean the guy puts his Gabby grows

541
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,720
incredible wheat he always has I mean

542
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,240
this is the man who taught me everything

543
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,360
I need to know on day one

544
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,798
cuts and all and so you know I was so

545
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,859
like elated I couldn't believe it it was

546
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,319
like my lucky day so it was you know it

547
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,759
helped me out so much but um that day it

548
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,740
was a rough day it was a rough period

549
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,019
like you know I just gotten off the

550
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,120
green tortoise coming from Eugene Oregon

551
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,740
left my girlfriend my dogs up there to

552
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,239
come to the city to make money I mean it

553
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,798
was it wasn't always easy it was really

554
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,798
hard actually a lot of times being on

555
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,019
the road and this was a hard period

556
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,460
um the cops rough on us I remember a few

557
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,259
of my friends were missing when I got

558
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,600
there who were in jail for selling weed

559
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,700
and you know so it was rough man so this

560
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,779
was like a shiny spot this is like one

561
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,120
of those moments though when you're

562
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:25,558
traveling around you know it's like [ __ ]

563
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,000
man what am I doing man like I don't

564
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:28,678
know what I'm doing like I can't make it

565
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,839
another day I'm like I'm in a park

566
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,400
practically homeless you know and where

567
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,139
I'm on the road and I you know I can

568
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,059
barely afford gas to get to the next

569
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,038
show and they're like I think it's time

570
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:40,079
for me to maybe go get a job or

571
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,940
something and go back home right then

572
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,980
you know something like this would

573
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,900
happen like meeting Gabby in a park or

574
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,700
acting them millions things where it's

575
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,620
just like it just gets you one more day

576
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,720
and that's all you need is just one more

577
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,459
day just to remember like hey I belong

578
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,259
here this is okay I can make this you

579
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,538
know so this was one of those moments

580
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,460
for me you know I was contemplating

581
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:01,319
wrapping it up and maybe going home and

582
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,900
trying to find a little easier way

583
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,538
and uh so anyways I sold all that weed

584
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,100
and when I was done you know Gabby

585
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,798
expressed to me that he was very

586
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,000
grateful and you know that he was

587
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,859
actually thinking about the same thing

588
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,538
he was thinking about maybe he'd made a

589
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:18,000
mistake by coming to California and that

590
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,679
he was hoping that and I think the quote

591
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,119
was his his uh

592
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,880
I don't know if it was you that told me

593
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,739
that's the Grateful Dead uh Grateful

594
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,500
Dead dream continue I'm so grateful that

595
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,759
fantasy continue one more day you know

596
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,440
um because he wanted to stay in the city

597
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,879
and see Jerry Garcia band that's why he

598
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,740
moved there that's what he told me so he

599
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,179
expressed to me and like I said I could

600
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,019
totally understand that

601
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:42,360
so I was there too and uh so in saying

602
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,679
that he also he wanted to show he by his

603
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,599
words he wanted to show gratitude he

604
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,580
said listen you know when you come to

605
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,259
The Warfield shows I always get this one

606
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,480
particular table in The Warfield I get

607
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,279
there at 5am I think he used to get

608
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,319
there and be first in line and just sit

609
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,720
on Market Street all day long

610
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,819

611
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,519

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,240
the first in line and so like you know

618

the floor

653
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,220
um and instead of being up in the

654
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,019
balcony anyway they're making the story

655
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,538
too long but

656
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,918
um I saw him some clear across the floor

657
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:43,079
in the dark

658
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,340
people dancing like crazy as they do

659
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,139
with these things and he's looking right

660
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,879
at me and he and he point he points to

661
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,320
the chair next to me and he's like come

662
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,960
on over here Justice need to come on

663
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,000
over I'm like wow so I go over there and

664
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,798
you know I sit down at the table and

665
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,019
it's like the best seat in the house the

666
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,779
best weed in the house for sure is being

667
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:02,279
smoked I mean this table became kind of

668
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,619
legendary there I mean you had Bob

669
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,000
Snodgrass and Maria come down and smoke

670
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,058
I remember smoking out of the Dragon

671
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,460
there I remember Dan Healy swung by at

672
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,619
one time and not to mention like pretty

673
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,480
much all the good [ __ ] indoor weed

674
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,279
you know that made it to San Francisco

675
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,419
for these shows would somehow make it to

676
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,379
the table you know that people would

677
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,720
stop by

678
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,640
and uh it was [ __ ] amazing

679
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,500
um so the next night the same thing and

680
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,140
the next night and then pretty much

681
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,819
every night until until Jerry you know

682
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,759
kicked the bucket and said goodbye to us

683
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,678
you know I hung out with Gabby at the at

684
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,240
The Warfield at his table and it was

685
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,640
amazing it was like a bar right in front

686
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,859
of it and just a few just a perfect view

687
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,140
of the fat man up there just rocking it

688
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:45,538
out it was amazing like I always tell

689
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,159
people who weren't around this I I would

690
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:48,960
give I would give like the right hand

691
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,120
almost for just one more night there you

692
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,460
know and like I don't really want to do

693
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,278
that but it's like that yeah I would do

694
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,778
anything I'm sure God feels the same one

695
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:59,519
more damn night's worth it I would do

696
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:01,798
anything you know

697
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,778
at least give a stub of my finger like

698
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,980
like Jerry had all

699
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,240
had a lot would take a little piece of

700
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,159
my finger off

701
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,960
that would be an easy trade yep I'd do

702
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,440
that yeah

703
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,900
wow that sounds legendary let me let me

704
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,360
ask one quick question I'm sure there

705
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,400
was some incredible different samples of

706
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,079
weed going across that table over the

707
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,419
years were there any particular

708
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,798
standouts to either of you

709
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,900
well

710
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,278
I mean mostly it was big Gabby's weed

711
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,559
you know that was the best at the table

712
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,179
I mean one other we would show up and be

713
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,678
like I mean you know all those people I

714
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,240
mentioned they came by because they knew

715
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,919
that he had the good lead there you know

716
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,019
like if they were going to come back

717
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,820
behind the stage or make their way

718
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,319
across the floor you know they were

719
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:45,119
gonna they were gonna come to that table

720
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,918
people just knew when the word got out

721
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,979
and you know Gabby was always so

722
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,179
generous with his weed and like

723
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,120
um you know I always wanted to turn

724
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,220
people onto it so a lot of people did

725
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,798
get turned on to it and they swing by

726
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,620
the table you know there was one famous

727
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,179
herb that I don't think I used to get it

728
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,038
at The Warfield but I used to get it

729
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,960
like on

730
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,599
Grateful Dead Tour on the west coast

731
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,240
that to this day I can remember the

732
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,699
taste and the way it looked and

733
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,880
um was the Big Sir holy weed

734
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,580
oh yeah and and they had one Gunk and

735
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,380
they had a haze they had the skunk

736
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,778
I know which one you like both of them

737
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,539
both of them were out of this world

738
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:30,599
and they were I remember like

739
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:33,000
at the way I found that weed was the

740
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,278
family that was selling that herb

741
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,720
that used to sell it a quarter ounce at

742
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:43,440
a time I think it was like 125 bucks for

743
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,900
a quarter ounce on on dead tour

744
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,538
and it's kind of similar to the stories

745
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,419
that you tell about the the skunk and

746
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:53,759
the chem dog I used to just buy it all

747
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,200
up you know like they wanted to sell in

748
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,000
his quarters and I was like [ __ ] it you

749
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,880
know I didn't buy that chicken the best

750
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,919
weed ever and then kind of similar to

751
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,080
the story with the chem dog is

752
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,159
only family and friends would get that

753
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,079
weed

754
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,720
you know because

755
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,939
it was already too expensive and too

756
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,220
rare like this wasn't the type of weed

757
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,320
that you went and sold for random people

758
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,659
that you didn't know on the deadline

759
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,278
exactly you want to share with your

760
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,840
friends you know you would wait and be

761
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,740
patient until you bumped into them you

762
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,899
know

763
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,278
yeah it's funny see you you say you have

764
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,778
no good memory you remember the Big Sir

765
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,700
holy weed though you remember those two

766
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:33,179
skunk and Hayes sometimes people bring

767
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,519
that up I mean I just have holes I just

768
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,580
I just have holes in my memory it's not

769
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,099
complete and you know I just wanna a lot

770
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:43,439
of people are telling this story to the

771
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:45,719
best of their ability

772
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,679
and I don't think that this is an issue

773
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,140
of like

774
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:54,120
people are lying and making [ __ ] up and

775
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,140
like you know not so dog he believes the

776
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,399
story

777
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,559
and

778
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,940
like you said how you realize you made a

779
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,918
mistake on something you said on the

780
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,940
other podcast like when I was teasing

781
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,500
you and making

782
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,919
this is what it's gonna be like for

783
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,619
everybody and you know we're dealing

784
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,720
with something that happened

785
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,058
a long time ago

786
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,278
your not so dog puts it you know put it

787
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:20,220
pretty clearly none of us knew how

788
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,619
important this history was gonna be so

789
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,558
we didn't keep detailed notes

790
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,839
you know and

791
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:32,099
you know

792
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:35,038
I don't think you or I or not so dog

793
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:37,139
there's really nothing to benefit from

794
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,538
the little mistakes that are being made

795
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,620
or discrepancies that are being made in

796
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:43,440
these stories

797
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,719
you know it's not like by saying this

798
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,038
this person's gonna make a have a big

799
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,778
payday

800
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,538
it doesn't look like anyone's trying to

801
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,298
do that you know so I think we should

802
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:57,058
have healthy debate about what we think

803
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:59,220
the story was and enjoy telling the

804
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:01,619
stories me particularly if I enjoy

805
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,259
listening to the stories from you guys

806
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,219
because your memory even if there's some

807
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:08,339
mistakes

808
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,079
it's so much more detailed than mine and

809
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:13,220
it's for me it's the most beautiful

810
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:16,199
thing to hear you tell the stories

811
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,058
I love that I love you brother I'm so

812
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,860
glad to hear that I love you

813
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:21,480
I'm glad that we're able to even like

814
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,119
share the story you know because it's a

815
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,558
miracle that any of this like it's like

816
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,519
I always tell people you know 30 years

817
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,319
later

818
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,139
um just from my viewpoint of all this

819
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,579
it's it's like it's a unique thing to be

820
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,320
able to look back and kind of see the

821
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,019
whole thing at least from my perspective

822
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,359
you know and and just to watch he like

823
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:42,058
kind of appreciate like all the little

824
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,038
twists and turns all the little nudges

825
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:46,379
in a certain direction you know

826
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:47,819
and and to like it all just kind of

827
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,399
seems like what the hell is going on

828
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,019
here like it seems like a like a divine

829
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,699
intervention almost you know what it is

830
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,379
the plant you know it has a divine

831
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,220
intervention it definitely does it

832
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,200
definitely

833
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,778
somehow it works with us whether we

834
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,640
understand it or not we don't and and

835
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:05,159
you know it's amazing that you know

836
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,480
she's still here and and then all the

837
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,679
different people and none of us knew

838
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,038
each other that's the other thing like

839
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,179
so you know like Gabby new Greg but I

840
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,919
didn't know I never even heard of the

841
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,140
guy you know it's like all these little

842
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,000
details I'm like if you take one little

843
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,880
piece of it out and she may not make it

844
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,159
and she's here and then we're here still

845
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
and we get to talk to each other now you

846
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,159
know now you know we all get to know

847
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,720
each other everybody who is involved

848
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,120
with what happened back then with this

849
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,319
particular plan or a few plants and to

850
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,099
me it's just like

851
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:37,139
I mean it's it's a it's it's hard it's

852
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:39,119
difficult to explain it to someone to

853
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,000
give them the perspective that you know

854
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,500
like I or Gabby has you know to see like

855
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,058
you know like what's really going on

856
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,519
here you're like you know this wasn't

857
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:49,019
about anything except for having the

858
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,839
best [ __ ] week that's all it was

859
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:54,658
there was no motivation so you know not

860
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,339
so dog and Gabby you know like he said

861
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:59,520
are correct it's like

862
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:01,139
um you know like you know it's it's just

863
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,639
it's to me it's just it's just amazing

864
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,440
that we can still tell the story you

865
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,659
know and that we can all talk about it

866
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,340
amongst each other none of us saw it and

867
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,500
like like those guys said like we

868
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,119
weren't like none of this was part none

869
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,278
of this was important it had no

870
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:16,739
importance whatsoever like not one of us

871
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,960
you know I know Gabby and I we didn't we

872
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,519
never like even once considered like you

873
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,558
know what's gonna happen 30 years later

874
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,480
you know it's just like let's smoke the

875
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,158
best weed today and laugh and have a

876
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,259
good time and go snowboarding and skiing

877
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,179
and watch Seinfeld like we used to do

878
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:32,519
you know and so that's what it was all

879
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,320
about and so it's all so delicate in

880
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,119
that sense you know like nobody was

881
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,678
trying to get to the Finish Line we were

882
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,500
just trying to you know have the best

883
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,899
weed in our pocket which we did and

884
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,460
maybe that was what that maybe that's

885
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:46,379
how it worked the plant gives us what we

886
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,058
want and we give the plant what it wants

887
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,340
and look at us all surviving you know

888
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:53,038
that's I think that's still the goal

889
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:54,720
today right so very uh full circle I I

890
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,640
want to quickly take us back a sec

891
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,100
because you I I agree with Gabby you're

892
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,559
doing such a good job with this story I

893
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,139
want to quickly rewind a second and ask

894
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,298
Gabby a question tell us about the

895
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,340
Francine this is one that a lot of

896
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,798
people are interested in mostly because

897
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,439
when that trade for the skunk eventually

898
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,119
went down that was what those VA dudes

899
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,278
were more interested in and I think a

900
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,898
lot of people are sort of like what like

901
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,819
why was it the Francine like what was

902
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:23,278
going on there and I think in the first

903
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:25,019
episode Jason said that it was sort of

904
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,579
like a Northern Lights thing but I'd

905
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:28,259
love to hear from Gabby like what was

906
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,240
your take on the Francine in terms of

907
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,519
like the flavor the effect how do you

908
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,620
remember it

909
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,319
okay so I hope this story isn't

910
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,359
disappointing to everyone because you

911
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,819
know

912
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:45,298
the ending isn't so great but so the

913
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:47,519
Francine was just bag seed that I had

914
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:51,240
acquired on Grateful Dead tour

915
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,159
and I have no idea what it was you know

916
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,980
we could speculate that it was Northern

917
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,580
Lights just based on what we thought we

918
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,798
knew which was limited about you know

919
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:05,759
other stuff like that and you know

920
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:09,480
photos we had seen but it was bag seed

921
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,679
and uh and you know I think not so dog

922
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,679
mentioned this

923
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,539
you know before and in multiple podcasts

924
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,878
a lot of the stuff

925
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:20,219
that was done back then

926
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:23,219
it was accidents

927
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:25,199
you know and you know you get a bag of

928
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,118
weed you find a couple seeds back then

929
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,799
you kept them

930
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,500
today most of the time if I find

931
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,480
backseat I don't keep it you know unless

932
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,619
it's like something that's truly amazing

933
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,500
but you know I don't try to plant

934
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:44,760
accidents like but that back then that's

935
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:48,480
all I had I didn't have access to clones

936
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,859
this was in a highly secretive New York

937
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,519
Market

938
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:56,219
you know so at the time I didn't really

939
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,039
have anyone uh I forget what his I think

940
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,539
that he goes by weasel

941
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,920
somebody named them weasels which could

942
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:04,460
be the only name that's worse than

943
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,460
Staten Island

944
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,000
I mean like I felt bad about Staten

945
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,739
Island and I found out they call him

946
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,500
weasel I was like oh [ __ ] this could

947
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:16,739
have been much worse he was he was

948
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,440
growing some seed grown stuff that that

949
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:21,059
he had uh you know from Bad Seed that he

950
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,539
collected as well

951
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,619
from like we went to a a dead show at

952
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,719
RFK

953
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,780
and I don't know if you guys heard of

954
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:34,559
the RFK but he had the RFK one two and

955
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,960
three three different females that he

956
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,599
kept from seed that he found there but

957
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,760
you know I wanted to try to wow

958
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,619
get something else from seeds that I had

959
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,839
I had been going to a lot more shows

960
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,099
than he did and

961
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,500
um

962
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,980
you know I uh I felt like I could uh

963
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,039
maybe find something nice out of my seed

964
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,858
and what I did was I named every six I

965
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,480
named every single one of my seeds a

966
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:03,239
girl's name

967
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,119
okay even this is prior to knowing what

968
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:09,799
their sex was just as like positive

969
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,019
affirmation everything had a girl's name

970
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,980
okay and and so you know I had Francine

971
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:19,739
I had Irene you know Michelle whatever

972
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,838
you know just like just because I didn't

973
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:24,419
want to name them one two three I wanted

974
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,099
it to be more personal than that

975
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,240
you know so I gave him a lot of girls

976
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,740
names

977
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,519
and um

978
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:35,279
the Francine ended up being the best

979
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,920
of those seeds that I planted

980
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,740
it was really I think partly what was

981
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,720
attractive to it was it was a very easy

982
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:46,139
plant to grow

983
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,219
it used to put out really big chunky

984
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,559
buds

985
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:52,618
and at the time

986
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:56,338
you know we were growing organically

987
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:59,519
and it was way hard to get those results

988
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:02,460
it was hard to get really big chunky

989
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,599
buds when you were growing organic in a

990
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,179
container

991
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,820
particularly with the limited knowledge

992
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:11,519
that we had at the time so the Francine

993
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,780
was a really easy plant to grow

994
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:19,380
I think it had like a mildly fruity

995
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:21,720
slash hash plant type taste and uh it

996
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,539
was really impressive to look at

997
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:27,480
you know kind of like the market today

998
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:28,980
how the visual look is so important back

999
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,679
then you know I was able to sell the

1000
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,900
Francine based on how it looks now

1001
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,639
when I think about it compared to all

1002
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,460
the other weed that we had gotten after

1003
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,379
and all the weed that we have today

1004
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,139
it's not on that level

1005
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,460
if not some I mean I wish I had it just

1006
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:47,519
for

1007
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,260
you know posterity and you know to say

1008
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,460
I've had this strained for as long you

1009
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,579
know but

1010
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,619
it really wasn't as good as everything

1011
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,119
else that we got and it used to have a

1012
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,559
problem getting moldy

1013
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,960
you know so once I started having

1014
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,139
because the budget was so dense

1015
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,119
yeah you know so they're very wet too I

1016
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:08,219
ran away from growing it yeah

1017
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,680
so I mean

1018
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,319
now the best part of the story about the

1019
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:17,039
Francine was that's how we got the

1020
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,559
chemdog right like he was so impressed

1021
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,659
with it I hope I can say his name

1022
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:26,159
um because I just did you did I I don't

1023
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:28,019
know what his stage name is do we need

1024
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,019
to edit that [ __ ] out

1025
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:30,019
um

1026
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:35,838
he's the most paranoid [ __ ] I

1027
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,838
ever met in my life

1028
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,179
hey okay we could just say yeah we could

1029
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:44,400
just say if that's his real name we

1030
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:47,399
could just say that my memory is garbage

1031
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,420
his real name probably isn't even

1032
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,300
it is

1033
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,720
well I mean it doesn't

1034
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:57,359
yeah hey if you hear this this is Jason

1035
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:00,239
we've been looking for you for 26 years

1036
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:03,539
where are you at come on now I'm just

1037
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:06,118
kidding I'm sorry sorry I just outed I'm

1038
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,500
sorry I just outed you I'm only sorry I

1039
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,039
can't see the look on his face if he

1040
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,000
actually heard that

1041
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:14,940
don't worry about it Gabby don't worry

1042
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,900
about that damn now I got a fear for my

1043
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,539
life

1044
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:22,200
so okay so something else about the

1045
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:25,320
Francine was I used to have a a bubbler

1046
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:28,259
Bob Snodgrass custom-made a bubbler

1047
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,780
that instead is Francine on it and that

1048
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,560
was the only herb that I ever smoked out

1049
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,900
of

1050
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,659
and when I stopped throwing the Francine

1051
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:40,320
I stopped smoking out of that bubbler

1052
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:43,440
never used it again and luckily one day

1053
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,960
I found some girl her name was Francine

1054
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,679
and she was a smoker and I was like yeah

1055
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,119
you need to have this I love it I just I

1056
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,500
just gave it to her because her name was

1057
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,180
Francine and

1058
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
yeah I was like if not it's just gonna

1059
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:59,399
sit in the drawer forever I'm never

1060
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,679
gonna use it now Francine can can use it

1061
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,139
forever

1062
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:06,719
so yeah right there that story

1063
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:09,358
encompasses why I I just adore you

1064
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,399
because you're so [ __ ] generous and

1065
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:12,960
like that pipe you could have carried

1066
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,700
out all the way never smoked out of it

1067
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,320
again you know a lot of people would

1068
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:18,000
have you know it's part of their life

1069
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,099
but to give it to someone like that

1070
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,900
that's I love that about you that's very

1071
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:25,099
very cool so you want to hear something

1072
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:29,400
funny about you saying how generous I am

1073
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:31,559
not so dog in his previous podcast

1074
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,660
he said how stingy I was

1075
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,679
he was like I'm super stingy he was

1076
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:36,539
talking about he was talking about the

1077
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,719
chem dog and he like mentioned it like

1078
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:42,358
three times that like she just didn't

1079
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:45,838
give everybody the chem dog you know

1080
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:48,179
yeah and what I pointed out to him was I

1081
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,380
gave it to my friends I gave it to my

1082
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,078
group

1083
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,900
you know like I gave it I gave it to you

1084
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,539
I gave it to him I gave it to others too

1085
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,820
so like just because I didn't like stand

1086
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,599
on a street corner peddling chem dog

1087
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:07,200
clones doesn't mean like

1088
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:09,059
you know I was stingy you know I I you

1089
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,819
know you said before you know I like to

1090
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:13,980
share my weed and you know Francis puts

1091
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,760
it out to the universe Staten Island's a

1092
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,760
stingy [ __ ]

1093
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,480
there's there's so many incredible

1094
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,759
details around this short period of time

1095
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,740
I'd love to quickly check in on a few of

1096
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,660
them I'm not sure if Jason said it

1097
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:30,239
earlier but when you guys had that

1098
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:32,338
initial first meeting did you have any

1099
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,479
chem dog with you at that time or not

1100
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:35,659
yet

1101
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,300
it's funny that you asked this question

1102
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:42,000
because in the previous podcast

1103
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,240
Jason said that I had a little chem dog

1104
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,739
during this encounter and like when I

1105
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,618
was listening to it I texted Jason I'm

1106
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:50,819
like you're a [ __ ] liar

1107
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,800
you know because I

1108
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,260
and you know basically I was just making

1109
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,720
a point that like it's possible for any

1110
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,480
of us to get this story wrong

1111
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:02,459
right and Jason made a mistake when he

1112
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,039
was telling the story and he said that I

1113
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,460
had the chem dog when we first met but

1114
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:11,159
the reality is I got the chem dog

1115
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:15,240
after going to New York

1116
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:17,519
and I got the VA skunk and I traded the

1117
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,098
skunk for the camera

1118
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:23,039
so I'm not sure what year it was I think

1119
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:25,640
it was 93 like you said earlier

1120
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:28,559
um yeah but yeah so like

1121
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:29,819
Jason's connection to getting the chem

1122
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,858
dog

1123
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,720
is pretty crucial you know he likes to

1124
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:36,598
give me all the credit but I can turn it

1125
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:40,199
around and give him the credit because

1126
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,338
um chem dog you know G he would not have

1127
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:43,858
given me

1128
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:46,679
the chem dog if I didn't have something

1129
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:49,259
you really wanted like the skunk

1130
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:51,960
yeah I wanted to quickly ask you about

1131
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,180
that like firstly how did you meet Greg

1132
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,159
and then as a follow-up was he holding

1133
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:58,379
out because he knew the chem dog was so

1134
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,000
good and he wanted to trade or he was he

1135
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,559
just like a recluse dude and just didn't

1136
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,358
really trade

1137
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:05,219
um no he was willing to trade just not

1138
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,019
the chem dog because he knew it was

1139
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:09,779
super valuable that he was the only one

1140
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:12,300
had it but you know I lived in

1141
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,099
California he was mostly working it on

1142
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,260
the East Coast so he didn't see me as

1143
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:17,700
much of a threat and like because when I

1144
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,780
lived in New York he didn't want to give

1145
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:21,419
it to us

1146
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,640
you know but

1147
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,200
um so did you meet him through klopping

1148
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,000
that or did you manage to meet him some

1149
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,419
other way I did

1150
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,460
I I met him through Club wow okay so

1151
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,400
like that that's another thing is like

1152
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:38,579
people discount

1153
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,639
weasel or clops you know placing all of

1154
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:44,160
this you know I know they do but like

1155
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:46,500
if it wasn't for klopp I don't meet

1156
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,019
chemdogs and none of this happens either

1157
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,619
and it's funny because like you know

1158
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:55,019
people give you Jason and clap [ __ ]

1159
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:58,920
saying like they're making up this story

1160
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:00,900
and but and you know it's like he was he

1161
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,300
was critical in me getting it I wouldn't

1162
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,300
have got it and so were you if I didn't

1163
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,220
have the skunk Greg was being tight Greg

1164
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,700
was the one that was [ __ ] cheap not

1165
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:13,019
me I Greg was being stingy I had to have

1166
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:14,759
something to trade he wasn't gonna just

1167
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,259
give it to me you know finally when I

1168
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,720
had something that good to trade you did

1169
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,160
it yeah do you remember I don't know if

1170
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:21,598
you've ever even told me this but do you

1171
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,358
remember the first time you ever smoked

1172
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,760
Kim Dong yeah it was with Kemp it was

1173
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:29,159
with the G damn dog

1174
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,700
was it like before you moved out or

1175
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:34,799
before you moved out earlier

1176
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:37,559
yeah I think I had moved out already I

1177
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,599
had moved out in 91 and that's like when

1178
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:42,358
he had first got it so it was like on a

1179
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,000
visit to New York or you know

1180
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:46,559
and what was it like was he was he

1181
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,300
growing it really good back then or was

1182
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,639
he still figuring it out

1183
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:55,440
man I hate to throw people under the bus

1184
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:59,699
but like his growth setup in my view was

1185
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,500
pretty pathetic it was like I mean he

1186
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:04,019
had this Garden called the Emily's

1187
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,940
Garden are you guys familiar with it

1188
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,699
no

1189
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,619
okay it's a prefabricated hydroponic

1190
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:14,818
garden which is just like a little

1191
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:19,260
Reservoir with a lid on top with like

1192
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:20,579
four holes for like baskets or rockwool

1193
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,380
cubes

1194
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:26,519
and then it's like deep water culture

1195
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:28,740
you just like have a air stone in there

1196
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,659
um you know and that's how he was

1197
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:33,779
growing the chem dog

1198
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:35,759
and one part of the story that I like to

1199
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,519
tell us he called it the chem dog he

1200
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,980
used to say you can't grow it organic

1201
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,900
that's why it's the chem dub

1202
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:46,260
and at the time I was the biggest

1203
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,119
organic snob there was you know like if

1204
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,220
you were to give me a pound of

1205
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,599
hydroponically grown weed that was the

1206
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:53,578
best ever

1207
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,680
I would just like turn my nose to it I

1208
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:58,619
was I was just snob

1209
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:01,739
and so I tried to grow it organic and we

1210
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:05,579
did grow it organic and you know

1211
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:07,858
it barely survived before Harvest you

1212
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:10,440
know it was like almost dead by the time

1213
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:12,920
it was time to cut it you know it's such

1214
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,318
a hard plant to grow particularly

1215
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,818
organic and then and I told this story

1216
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:19,679
on the other podcast too but I think

1217
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:21,659
it's important for me at least

1218
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,118
I had this moment

1219
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:27,480
where

1220
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,858
um I read something in a pamphlet from a

1221
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,940
company that was selling hydroponic

1222
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:33,420
nutrients

1223
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,858
and what it said is Organics are mineral

1224
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,260
compounds

1225
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:39,779
that contain carbon

1226
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:43,500
and need to be broken down into them

1227
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,599
more common mineral form before they can

1228
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,539
be uptaken by the plants

1229
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,000
and minerals are the building blocks of

1230
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:53,940
all life on the planet

1231
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,239
and when I read that

1232
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:00,720
I was like oh [ __ ] like maybe I should

1233
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,818
try growing using minerals

1234
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,338
and I did

1235
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:07,440
and I never turned back you know so now

1236
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:10,078
I've seen you know if you're growing in

1237
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,720
a container indoors or outdoors and

1238
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,240
you're trying to you know do it organic

1239
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,919
you got your work cut out for you you

1240
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,779
know it's not really

1241
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,659
and and generally I don't think you get

1242
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,480
as good of a quality now I add Organics

1243
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:26,039
to my mineral nutrition you know I'll

1244
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,599
add some seaweed I'll add some other

1245
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,259
organic additives

1246
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,480
but the base of what my plants eat

1247
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,040
is mineral nutrition and you know

1248
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,679
there's like a thing right now where

1249
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:40,318
people are trying to do living soil

1250
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:43,639
indoors they're like this is no-till

1251
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:46,400
indoors I'm like bro that's just like

1252
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:49,858
what a stupid thing to say in my opinion

1253
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,740
no offense you know to the like really

1254
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:53,639
you know popular Growers that are doing

1255
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:55,979
that but

1256
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,118
thing that you don't till indoors like

1257
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,679
how are you gonna [ __ ] get that

1258
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,500
tiller indoors anyway

1259
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,358
oh man yeah

1260
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,039
that's a good point that's a good point

1261
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,199
I want to quickly ask you before I

1262
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,480
forget in the first episode Jason was

1263
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,098
talking about how when you were growing

1264
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,719
organically you had like these really

1265
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,420
sort of Cutting Edge methods for the

1266
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,578
time and what was it the vat like the

1267
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,019
the living compost tea tell me about

1268
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:21,780
that quickly

1269
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:24,019
it it was cutting edge and crude at the

1270
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,060
very same time like

1271
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:28,679
you know I used to have a couple of

1272
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,578
trash cans

1273
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:34,078
that I would fill up with organic

1274
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:36,960
fertilizer it'd be one that would be for

1275
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,519
guanos you know so I'd make guano teas

1276
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,699
and it would have some seaweed in it and

1277
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:44,219
stuff like that and my logic was I never

1278
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:46,799
let it get more than half empty

1279
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:49,199
and it's always being aerated

1280
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,140
and so I thought like it was kind of

1281
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:54,358
like a starter for like yeast like for

1282
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:56,039
sourdough you can't get rid of it

1283
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:57,659
because that's what you got all that

1284
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:00,358
life in that thing so you always want to

1285
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:02,279
just like do it halfway

1286
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:05,818
and I would literally keep this vat

1287
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,579
going for years and if I moved from one

1288
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:11,099
location to another I would like take

1289
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,720
the starter with me you know and then

1290
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:16,079
the other thing that I tried doing which

1291
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,818
was super disgusting was in another vat

1292
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,339
and I had to do this outside eventually

1293
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:24,719
because it was so [ __ ] gross

1294
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:28,019
um I would put food scraps in the water

1295
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,299
and you know just aerate it and agitate

1296
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:33,599
it and then I would water that to my

1297
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:35,700
plants so it was pretty disgusting stuff

1298
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,559
when I when I started scooping one

1299
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:38,818
teaspoon per gallon of mineral

1300
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,858
fertilizer

1301
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:42,659
you know people like Hydroponics that

1302
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:45,259
shit's so dirty I was like you think so

1303
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:48,059
you should see them so again

1304
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,500
you know like [ __ ] blast the

1305
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:52,078
pneumonia like

1306
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,000
and if the if the pump if the aerating

1307
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,099
pump would die for you the power outage

1308
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,480
I don't I know Gabby's the same way the

1309
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,940
first thing you think about is the vat

1310
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,440
because it would just be a matter of you

1311
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,780
know hours before you'd start to smell

1312
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,880
the decay of the background or uh

1313
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,680
bacteria and I knew that because I would

1314
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,119
take my hand and Stir It Up I was the

1315
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:10,679
same thing Gabby taught me this and this

1316
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,119
is what I did and it worked amazing like

1317
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,399
sometimes I'm like maybe I should do

1318
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,660
that again but I would take my hand and

1319
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,700
stir it up because it would be a lot of

1320
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:19,139
sediment on the bottom and then if you

1321
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:20,519
know if you like you know how you're

1322
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:21,659
working you always got little cuts on

1323
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,639
your fingers they would get like

1324
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,679
infected in seconds and like get on red

1325
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:27,960
you know like oh [ __ ] that hot it's

1326
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,759
ready to feed you know and same thing

1327
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,280
always when they get you know take half

1328
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,300
the trash can and you know hey gab you

1329
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,040
remember the other day I told you about

1330
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,099
your buddy who took that Horticulture

1331
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,719
class with you in Santa Rosa well that

1332
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:41,900
the second thing he mentioned was the

1333
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,899
bat

1334
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:46,618
well it's funny I was going to mention

1335
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,440
that before how we were talking about

1336
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:51,720
how small world it is and you run into

1337
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,019
one of my college buddies when you're

1338
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,939
just around what a crazy small world

1339
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:59,759
what a small world

1340
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:02,880
can I can I bring us back for one second

1341
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,099
I I love that point about how Gabby you

1342
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,318
mentioned that um you know in a sense

1343
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:09,420
the chem dog coming out to the east

1344
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:12,358
coast could equally be attributed you

1345
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,858
know to to skunk via to Jason and I

1346
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:15,539
remember in that first interview I did

1347
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:17,098
with him he made a comment he said you

1348
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,440
know this this guy was really impressive

1349
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:21,720
you know he was a real good networker

1350
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,579
and I guess it I just want to sort of

1351
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:25,939
confirm because it sounds pretty

1352
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:28,859
impressive that like you were able to

1353
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,920
Mastermind this plan to get the chem dog

1354
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:33,719
through this through the skunk trade had

1355
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,579
you been thinking about like how can I

1356
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:36,899
get this cam dog off Greg for a while or

1357
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,980
was it just like a spur-of-the-moment

1358
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,800
thing and you

1359
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:43,260
oh yeah Greg didn't want to give it up

1360
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,640
you know yeah he didn't want to give it

1361
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,099
up so

1362
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,199
so then run us through how the trade

1363
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:52,980
went down how did how did it all go down

1364
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:55,558
logistically well so I don't have the

1365
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,599
exact details of like I don't remember

1366
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,880
the exact conversation that made it

1367
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,280
happen but

1368
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,440
I think Jason got it a little bit wrong

1369
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,500
but again it doesn't like change any of

1370
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,480
the stories at all so what happened was

1371
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,760
uh our buddy that we're not supposed to

1372
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,500
say his name from Virginia well how

1373
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,200
about we how about we call him not so

1374
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,980
loud does that work

1375
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,980
that works

1376
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,220
I think that's way funnier

1377
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,358
um he came out to see Jerry at The

1378
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:29,399
Warfield

1379
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,880
that's when Jason introduced me to him

1380
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,220
he saw the Francine and was interested

1381
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,660
in trading the France scene for the

1382
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:39,239
skunk

1383
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:41,039
and and I do believe we were also always

1384
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,659
trying to get the Beatrix Choice which I

1385
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,779
don't think we actually ever got

1386
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:47,940
yeah but uh yeah so he wanted the

1387
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,040
Francine and he wanted to trade for the

1388
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,679
skunk and then somehow I arranged to

1389
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,380
trade the skunk with Greg

1390
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:57,419
for um

1391
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,700
for the chem dogs and that's how I got

1392
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,818
it and

1393
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:04,879
I um I went

1394
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:08,300
first to New York City

1395
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,000
where I met not so

1396
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,019
and traded him the Francine for the

1397
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,960
skunk

1398
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:18,300
and I believe he gave me a couple clones

1399
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,900
which I took up to

1400
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,818
Massachusetts and I traded one of them

1401
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,849
for I think I got a couple of clones of

1402
00:53:23,818 --> 00:53:28,079
the chem dog from G

1403
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:31,259
[Applause]

1404
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:34,318
and then I went back down I did leave

1405
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,540
one with klopp because

1406
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,558
again if it wasn't for him none of this

1407
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:39,719
happens

1408
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,660
and

1409
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,399
um then I drove West and

1410
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:48,420
I you know I told the story on the other

1411
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,300
podcast as well I had it in a Burger

1412
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,579
King cup with a lid at two Burger King

1413
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,599
cups one with skunk and one with the

1414
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:56,640
chem dog

1415
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,740
and you know when I was driving down the

1416
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,239
road if a truck was coming by or if I

1417
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,379
was scared of police I just put the lid

1418
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,899
on the cuff

1419
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,280
and when that wasn't happening you know

1420
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,200
it was getting sunlight through the

1421
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,900
front window and then like whatever

1422
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:12,899
light I could give it in the hotel room

1423
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,280
to get that [ __ ] across country

1424
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,920
so

1425
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,880
I mean that's the short story I don't

1426
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,619
know if you want to ask any more

1427
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,800
questions for me to make it more

1428
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,960
detailed but no that that's incredible

1429
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,220
so that oh I got one last quick question

1430
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,559
and then I want to start talking some

1431
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:31,618
more about the skunk but I heard mixed

1432
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,660
reports about some people say oh you

1433
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:35,039
know weasel was the head of that New

1434
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:37,679
York crew and then other people are like

1435
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,519
no it was JJ he was the head who was

1436
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:44,279
sort of the head honcho in your eyes

1437
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:46,199
well I wasn't there right so like you

1438
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,780
know I I certainly wasn't the head

1439
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:53,460
honcho because I wasn't there

1440
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,839
you know and JJ he used to buy the weed

1441
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,179
from klopp

1442
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:59,940
this is prior to him growing

1443
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:01,139
you know JJ was the was the connect to

1444
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,780
get rid of it

1445
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:06,358
so I mean I don't think anyone any of us

1446
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:12,059
ever thought of us as the the leader or

1447
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:14,279
the Kingpin you know but but cloth or

1448
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:16,800
weasel was the one

1449
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,920
that you know started all this stuff

1450
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,240
getting grown on Staten Island I've

1451
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,858
mentioned before he should probably be

1452
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,318
called Staten Island because he lived

1453
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:26,940
there longer than me

1454
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:29,519
um but whatever at this point I'm gonna

1455
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:32,780
embrace the [ __ ] nobody nobody would try

1456
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,780
to pick that name away from me

1457
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,960
but uh yeah and so he also gave it to a

1458
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:43,559
couple of our Staten Island friends

1459
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,858
so you know if I had to answer your

1460
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:49,500
question I would say yeah it was weasel

1461
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:52,318
that is really responsible for all that

1462
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:55,318
growing on that island and

1463
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:58,920
he was the first person that I ever saw

1464
00:55:55,318 --> 00:56:01,199
growing cannabis indoors now I I can

1465
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,300
tell you that story briefly

1466
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,159
um another one that I told on this other

1467
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,260
podcast but

1468
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:09,598
um

1469
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,520
so me and my it's like an old girlfriend

1470
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,300
that I had at the time were literally

1471
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,500
sitting outside of a subway station on

1472
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,079
Staten Island

1473
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,239
there's like a few like you know trains

1474
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:22,920
on Staten Island and we had just like

1475
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:25,139
come back from

1476
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,380
I think seeing a dead show at the Garden

1477
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:30,980
or something like that and so we're like

1478
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,000
sitting on the street like on the curb

1479
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:35,519
smoking weed

1480
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,619
right outside this train station

1481
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,380
and weasel's like hey what are you doing

1482
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:42,539
down there and we're like uh

1483
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,579
it's like smoking weed and we're like

1484
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:47,179
yeah he's like oh well come up here and

1485
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:50,220
smoke it with me

1486
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:51,659
you know like he smelt some good weed he

1487
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,480
wasn't used to seeing weed like that

1488
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:58,739
okay like I I believe that was the first

1489
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,619
time he ever encountered kind buds

1490
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:03,838
and so we showed him this weed that we

1491
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:06,180
were getting on dead tour and he was

1492
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,940
like this shit's grown indoors like you

1493
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:09,719
can grow this indoors and we're like

1494
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,599
yeah

1495
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:15,000
and that was the point where he got

1496
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:17,338
inspired to grow weed

1497
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,318
and I remember like he first like

1498
00:57:17,338 --> 00:57:21,599
dropped a couple of seeds in a 10 gallon

1499
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:23,759
fish tank and his like cat used to dig

1500
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,700
it up all the time you know before he

1501
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,619
like made it like more secure

1502
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:31,799
and then he had rent eventually was

1503
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:34,980
growing with just normal T5 for not T5

1504
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,859
it's like T8 like the regular fat tube

1505
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:40,920
fluorescence in his closet

1506
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:44,039
and that was the first time even though

1507
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:47,300
we had gotten kind bud and indoor on

1508
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:50,579
tour that was the first time I ever saw

1509
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,859
indoor was growing

1510
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,318
and that was the moment like you know I

1511
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:59,279
inspired him to start it and then he

1512
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:02,699
inspired me to like stop being a gypsy

1513
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,160
to get a house where I could grow weed

1514
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:07,259
too

1515
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:09,440
okay and so that's when I got an

1516
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:13,440
apartment in Brooklyn

1517
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,579
and that's where I grew my first weed

1518
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,960
because

1519
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:19,160
um

1520
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:21,679
I was inspired by uh

1521
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:25,199
by Mike

1522
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:28,078
wow that's a cool backstory I would love

1523
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:31,379
to hear tell me about you got the skunk

1524
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,359
to California and you harvested it the

1525
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,298
first time I want to hear both you guys

1526
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:38,519
opinions slash Recollections of what was

1527
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:41,480
that first skunk crop like when it was

1528
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,480
your own homegrown

1529
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,460
I don't get this day

1530
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:51,838
to this day

1531
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:54,599
people call me up or message me and ask

1532
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:57,179
me about that weed and tell me that it

1533
00:58:54,599 --> 00:59:00,660
was some of the best weed ever

1534
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:04,078
so a very respected breeder out here his

1535
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:07,379
name is Shiloh and he has a seed company

1536
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,220
called Shiloh massive genetics so I have

1537
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,980
um

1538
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:12,598
I have some of his genetics

1539
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,760
you know I was doing some Nursery work

1540
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:16,980
and I have so much genetics and I asked

1541
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,900
him I was like hey do you want copies

1542
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,639
of this stuff you know I just sent him a

1543
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,960
message I wanted to know like hey I've

1544
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:23,759
got some of your genetics I don't know

1545
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,659
if you if you still have it if you want

1546
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,359
it

1547
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:29,659
and his response to me is do you have

1548
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:32,480
any of that VA skunk

1549
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:34,440
and I

1550
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,059
said to him I was like you heard the

1551
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,760
podcast because I had just done this

1552
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:40,559
other podcast and he's like oh no that

1553
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,000
was just the best weed I've ever had in

1554
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,240
my life

1555
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,818
so yeah I think we all I think we all

1556
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,798
had that same

1557
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:52,380
you know the same feeling about that

1558
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:54,298
herb is that that was some of the best

1559
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,460
weed we ever smoked in our life

1560
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:58,980
like to grow it

1561
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:01,199
was way better than growing the pemdom

1562
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,599
you know it was you have to remember

1563
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,298
like we weren't that skilled Growers

1564
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:09,180
like Jason earlier said you know is the

1565
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:12,599
best indoor weed he ever smoked I mean

1566
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:14,399
there wasn't a lot of really good indoor

1567
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:16,559
being grown there wasn't a lot of

1568
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,880
knowledge on how to do it it was still a

1569
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,160
pretty

1570
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,740
pretty new thing you know I think about

1571
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,358
it now like a lot of the [ __ ] that we

1572
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:26,159
were doing it's like

1573
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:27,179
it's amazing that we got the results we

1574
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,980
did

1575
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:36,058
yeah it was it was it was like that that

1576
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:37,380
super skunk the number six it was it's

1577
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,940
hard to

1578
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,798
it's hard to like explain to someone

1579
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,480
these days like how amazing it was like

1580
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:43,920
it's difficult especially when they

1581
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,240
start talking about you know skunk

1582
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,220
itself you know

1583
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,899
I mean this stuff was more skunky than

1584
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:50,519
skunk you know it was it was it was

1585
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,680
incredible you know and the high was

1586
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:54,539
perfect you know it wasn't it was like

1587
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:55,618
it wasn't great it wasn't very strong

1588
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:57,420
yeah

1589
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,460
yeah it wasn't overpowered the Kim dog

1590
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,500
was like you know I can't I'm just gonna

1591
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,059
stare at the wall and drool whereas the

1592
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,559
super skunk was what you smoked all day

1593
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,880
you could do your thing you could go do

1594
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,200
your errands you're gonna run to the

1595
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,720
store whatever you got to do you know

1596
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,098
but the flavor and the other and you

1597
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:12,598
know the thing that the super skunk and

1598
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,798
the chem dog and probably many other

1599
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,539
strands but at least those two haven't

1600
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:17,400
comments like every single time you

1601
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,659
smoke it you got stoned there was

1602
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,160
something about it where you couldn't

1603
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:22,078
really build a tolerance I mean we were

1604
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,179
smoking bong heads bubblers and fatties

1605
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,700
and [ __ ] all day and every single time

1606
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:27,779
it just hits you just right I don't

1607
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:29,818
really think there's a lot of herb like

1608
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:31,260
that in my opinion you know there's not

1609
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:33,298
a lot of herb that just hits you just

1610
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,339
right every time you know and chem dog

1611
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:37,139
is definitely on that list and Superstar

1612
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:38,639
plus too and I wish that you know more

1613
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:39,900
people could enjoy it

1614
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,480
but

1615
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:45,660
it was all about that it was so good it

1616
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,179
was so good easy to grow uh it just gave

1617
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:49,858
you a lot big Yoder you know it did

1618
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:51,480
stretch out a lot like the sour diesel

1619
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:54,298
does but

1620
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,579
um you know sticks of weed you know just

1621
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:59,579
tons of sticks of meat it was amazing

1622
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:03,599
that's beautiful and I know that there

1623
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:05,760
was two iterations of the Superdog can

1624
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,298
you tell us about the first one the the

1625
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,799
original chemdog cross Super Skunk seeds

1626
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:13,500
how did they come about and what were

1627
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,059
those seeds like when you grew them

1628
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,280
um well

1629
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,298
there was many iterations of the

1630
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,760
Superdog

1631
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:23,699
you know it would make you know we were

1632
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,319
trying or what I was trying to do and

1633
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,419
this was

1634
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:32,099
um me and not so dog

1635
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:34,798
we were trying to make crosses that had

1636
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,900
that had chem dominance

1637
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,519
you know like we we tried to cross

1638
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,880
everything we had

1639
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:43,679
hoping hoping that we could get I mean

1640
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,420
we obviously you know we wouldn't have

1641
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,578
crossed it with everything we had if we

1642
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:49,680
didn't want diversity right

1643
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:53,059
but yet we really wanted something that

1644
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:56,578
had chem traits and that grew better

1645
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:58,380
than the chem dog because it was such a

1646
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:59,880
difficult plant to grow

1647
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,180
and

1648
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,460
I had gotten seeds from Scentsy

1649
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:06,558
and we had gotten super skunk from

1650
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:10,920
Scentsy

1651
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:13,680
based on the fact that the this VA skunk

1652
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,680
was so good we felt like this is the

1653
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:18,838
best thing you know to buy from Scentsy

1654
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:20,818
in order to cross

1655
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:23,039
with the chem dog I don't know what year

1656
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:25,619
this was and I do know that there's been

1657
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:29,039
a bunch of confusion over whether like

1658
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:33,119
what what we made to cross the camp the

1659
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:36,000
Superdog with but like at the time I was

1660
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,440
dead set against using any seeds that

1661
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,480
you know although

1662
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,519
you know everything we did was made from

1663
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:44,219
bag seed

1664
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,780
I would never germinate purposefully

1665
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:49,980
something that I knew that was grown

1666
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:51,480
like from a Herm right so we tried to

1667
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:55,199
buy thieves

1668
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,338
from Holland because we wanted true a

1669
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,399
true male

1670
01:03:56,338 --> 01:04:01,699
that we could cross with the temdog and

1671
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,460
the super skunk was the obvious choice

1672
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:06,659
we wanted to get that [ __ ] back and

1673
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,059
um

1674
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:11,399
you know that's how we did it so we got

1675
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:13,980
the the seeds from Scentsy

1676
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,079
you know Scentsy feeds

1677
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,519
you couldn't count on many things but

1678
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,339
one thing you could count on is if you

1679
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:23,159
bought the super skunk that [ __ ] looked

1680
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:25,440
exactly like the catalog we used to like

1681
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,960
grow the flower and then hold the Sentry

1682
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,019
Seed Catalog up against the buds and be

1683
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,039
like yeah that's it you know it was

1684
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:37,679
incredible

1685
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:40,019
and so we crossed those males with the

1686
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,539
dog and everything else we had

1687
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:47,099
many times and I tried to do inbreeding

1688
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:49,139
with the chem dog so the first time

1689
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:51,660
um you know we did it

1690
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:54,298
you know we called the the super dog and

1691
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:56,578
then we crossed it back to the dog again

1692
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:57,539
and did it again I think we did it three

1693
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:02,039
times

1694
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:03,420
and honestly the the skunk genetics was

1695
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:06,599
so dominant

1696
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,240
and our knowledge of selection

1697
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,760
was so limited

1698
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:14,459
that I never got anything

1699
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,500
that was like what I wanted

1700
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:20,280
you know there's a ton of great things

1701
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:22,798
that you know the stuff was nice but it

1702
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:26,519
wasn't I never produced what I wanted

1703
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:29,460
ah can I quickly ask I could be wrong

1704
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:32,759
here I I thought the the very first

1705
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:35,940
integration of the super dog seeds was

1706
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,619
the VA skunk on to the chem dog am I

1707
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,720
incorrect was it actually the first

1708
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:43,039
integration was just the Scentsy seeds

1709
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:45,239
and it never had the VA skunk in it

1710
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,159
what are you asking about is when you

1711
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:49,139
made the seeds when you were over at a

1712
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:51,480
water trough you know and so I answered

1713
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:55,318
that question already when I said I

1714
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,639
wouldn't do a perm right and the the

1715
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:59,579
super skunk

1716
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:03,058
the VA skunk that we had was a female

1717
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:05,519
plant yeah I wanted to do what I

1718
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:08,460
considered legitimate breeding

1719
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,199
and to me breeding with seeds that could

1720
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:13,679
potentially have hermaphrodite traits

1721
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:15,838
wasn't legitimate breeding so we had to

1722
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,779
get ourselves males

1723
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,779
from a reliable source in order to make

1724
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:23,760
any of this stuff happen yeah yeah

1725
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:26,880
certainly I can appreciate that you

1726
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,940
wanted males to work with so exactly and

1727
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,280
like this part you know who knows so gab

1728
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,599
when you were over at water troughs um

1729
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,400
you may not totally remember this

1730
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,380
because it was kind of a blip in your

1731
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,559
room you know like in your timeline but

1732
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:44,420
you actually had some NL uh five hay

1733
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,420
seeds and I don't know exactly

1734
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,099
yeah this was like 1997. and you you had

1735
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,380
uh what happened is you had bought those

1736
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:57,539
you crossed them with either the chem

1737
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,818
dog or either the super skunk the number

1738
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:01,440
six I don't remember which one and then

1739
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:02,880
you took a mail you found the mail in

1740
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,380
that you did this pretty quick too I

1741
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,940
remember that was the one thing looking

1742
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,920
back now knowing what I know I'm like

1743
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:10,500
damn that happened quick and then he you

1744
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,838
cross that back with the chem dog and we

1745
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,760
started calling that super dog

1746
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:16,019
um it was a very small amount of Siege

1747
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,400
and I don't really know what you did

1748
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:19,798
with them all I remember is that one

1749
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,298
time you went out of town and you'd

1750
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:23,400
harvested as the first the reason I

1751
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:25,019
remembered so clearly is because it was

1752
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,599
the first time I'd ever seen you know

1753
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:29,519
cannabis right from Steve you know and

1754
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,960
you had that cardboard box thing and you

1755
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,719
harvest it and you were calling super

1756
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,639
super dogs like super skunk dog

1757
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:36,838
um but they definitely had that nl5 Haze

1758
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:38,159
because we discussed it I remember

1759
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:39,719
sitting in your bedroom in that bathroom

1760
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,759
where you grew in where you showed me

1761
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:43,078
the pack and you know we looked at we

1762
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,000
actually had some pictures you had a

1763
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:46,200
catalog I think or or I don't know how

1764
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,719
he saw the pictures but we looked at

1765
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:51,538
pictures and he discussed it with me I

1766
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,679
was like you do you Gabby but and then

1767
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:55,020
the only thing I remember was when we

1768
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:57,118
harvested that or you harvested it you

1769
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:58,440
went out of town and you asked me to go

1770
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,700
over to the cardboard box and box

1771
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,619
everything up you know like put it in

1772
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:04,078
tupperwares because it was on the lines

1773
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:06,119
drying in that box and it was [ __ ]

1774
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,280
dank it was so good you know it was a

1775
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:10,500
nice blend of super uh super skunk and

1776
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,539
chem dog actually and of course I wasn't

1777
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,039
familiar with the no5 haze then but you

1778
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:15,420
know I don't I can't in my memory I

1779
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,900
don't remember seeing much of that in it

1780
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,899
you know what I mean

1781
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:22,979
too probably

1782
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:25,259
you know I'm pretty sure that I did get

1783
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:27,178
NL seeds but I remember getting the

1784
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:29,338
super skunk seeds because the thing is

1785
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:32,100
the NL seeds were almost like an

1786
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:34,500
afterthought because hey if we're gonna

1787
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,960
go order seeds from Amsterdam we're not

1788
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:40,798
just gonna order one pack right right

1789
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,259
and so the super skunk was the like main

1790
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:45,420
thing that we wanted you know and then

1791
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:48,119
we picked up some other [ __ ] too

1792
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:50,880
yeah yeah beautiful

1793
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:53,399
memory's a funny thing this is the way I

1794
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,900
I remember the story

1795
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:57,659
but you know

1796
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:58,979
it sounds like you guys did a lot a lot

1797
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:00,960
more extensive work when you guys

1798
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:04,099
started working with those Scentsy seeds

1799
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,100
Super Skunk seeds

1800
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:12,838
what yeah you know because he had a

1801
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,899
whole bunch of genetics

1802
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:18,359
you know he had the Mendo perps he had

1803
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:21,179
the Maui he had

1804
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:22,259
a ton of [ __ ] that we crossed when we

1805
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:25,980
did this

1806
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:28,679
you know and he was the one that I

1807
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:29,639
remember coming up with the name not so

1808
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:31,500
dog

1809
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,259
you know he reminded me of this when we

1810
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,060
talked and the reason why the [ __ ] we

1811
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:40,979
call the [ __ ] not so dog the original

1812
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:43,798
ones we called them the SD the super dog

1813
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:46,259
the original SD right

1814
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:47,759
um but then after doing it again you

1815
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:50,460
know one day Francis says hey you know

1816
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:52,738
what this is not so dog

1817
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:55,560
and we're like oh [ __ ] that's what we

1818
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:57,779
got to call it the not so dog because

1819
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,060
because it was great it just wasn't the

1820
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:03,179
dog

1821
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:05,940
you know that's brilliant so yeah so

1822
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:08,579
tell me how long were you growing the

1823
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:11,339
original skunk six the VA skunk for

1824
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:13,979
before you lost it

1825
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:16,440
I think Jason might know better than

1826
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:20,759
that yeah I have no idea I remember that

1827
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:22,198
so well so I guess you would say hmm if

1828
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,800
you got it and

1829
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:26,879
you must have got it in 1993.

1830
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,079
um so yeah we can go back to the

1831
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,900
beginning so

1832
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,899
let's [ __ ] your name

1833
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:38,879

1838
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:50,579
the last time I saw him was at the

1839
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:51,960
funeral and you know like we felt like

1840
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,219
there was law enforcement there and

1841
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,779
there had there was reason for law

1842
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:56,698
enforcement to be at my friend's funeral

1843
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:58,679
and

1844
01:10:56,698 --> 01:11:00,979
saw that and we talked about it and that

1845
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,899
was the last time I saw it

1846
01:11:00,979 --> 01:11:07,139
never heard from him again never saw him

1847
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:09,719
again but anyway so this is the one that

1848
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,739
came out but also that night when I

1849
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:12,179
don't know what you guys talked about I

1850
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:14,639
wasn't part of the discussion obviously

1851
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:16,800
but there was some other Brokers from

1852
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,239
Virginia uh the night where you guys

1853
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,940
talked about trading you know like

1854
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:23,039
talking about superstars

1855
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:24,238
no I was there but I wasn't part of the

1856
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,158
discussion

1857
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:29,158
well I was there I wasn't part of the

1858
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,599
discussion so I was there and but there

1859
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:33,238
was some other characters there from

1860
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:36,360
Virginia who were kind of more like you

1861
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:38,939
know uh not Kingpin like you guys called

1862
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:41,279
but like more more in control of those

1863
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:43,678
cuts was you know it was kind of like

1864
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,579
the guy who can maybe get the cuts you

1865
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,779
know

1866
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:47,279
um but those were the ones that were

1867
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:49,500
keeping holding the cuts and they were

1868
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,019
there too and you know so that's why I

1869
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,640
was so surprised by all this because I I

1870
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,199
don't even know those guys and I was

1871
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,340
surprised I acted like I don't know who

1872
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:58,619
they were because I knew that would make

1873
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:00,360
them more comfortable although I grew up

1874
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:03,198
smoking their weed in Virginia you know

1875
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:06,899
the weed they actually grew and um so

1876
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:08,639
they actually asked to ask you you know

1877
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:10,859
about that you know they've been talking

1878
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,719
about it you know they were there I was

1879
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,219
there and they actually asked you and

1880
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,380
then they actually asked me

1881
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:17,460
as a [ __ ] kid you know what I thought

1882
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,840
about it because that's just how people

1883
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,279
are from there and that's how those guys

1884
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,719
were and I was like dude it's none of my

1885
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:24,119
business you know I just want to hang

1886
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:26,279
out with the good weeds you know and so

1887
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:28,619
that's how it all went down they agreed

1888
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,479
to to share that cut you know on to give

1889
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:31,859
Gabby that cut and I guess they would

1890
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,939
have gotten I cut it up Francine at

1891
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:36,539
least I hope they did but uh so

1892
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:38,759
um

1893
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:41,039
we had it from that point Gabby had it

1894
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,320
from that point on and he passed it to

1895
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,359
me in 1995 just right before Jerry

1896
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:48,059
Garcia died you know like so July of

1897
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:50,460
1995 when I came up to Sonoma County and

1898
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,739
got a house up there and uh he told me

1899
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,658
he would set me up and he did

1900
01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:56,399
um

1901
01:12:53,658 --> 01:12:58,759
going to see Jerry right when you put

1902
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,738
Jerry yeah right

1903
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,760
here

1904
01:13:00,738 --> 01:13:05,399
when he decided you don't want to see

1905
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,780
Jerry no more yeah well you know we

1906
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:08,698
talked about that earlier what you meant

1907
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:10,738
what you were saying was is because you

1908
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:12,359
used to always be like you were hard on

1909
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:14,099
the vents and of course everybody was

1910
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:16,019
you know but uh you're a little bit

1911
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,219
older than me too so you know it's

1912
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,560
easier for you to be in this position

1913
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:22,079
you know and you said uh to me is like

1914
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,400
you know Jay can't Jason when this whole

1915
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,380
grateful when you're done with this

1916
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,639
whole Grateful Dead thing let me know

1917
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,020
and I'm gonna hook you up with some

1918
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,880
clothes I'm gonna show you what I know

1919
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,100
and we'll get you growing and when you

1920
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,699
told me that you were like fulfilling my

1921
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,699
big dream because

1922
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,020
A Grateful Dead tour but all the whole

1923
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,579
thing is like you know I want to grow my

1924
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,900
own weed and sell some weed out of the

1925
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:44,100
you know my house that I'm growing you

1926
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:45,719
know what I mean and kind of grow the

1927
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,560
best weeds you know the whole thing it's

1928
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:52,619
like the big dream so anyway we

1929
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,940
lost the super skunk don't really you

1930
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:56,819
know it's easier to remember like an

1931
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:58,259
event that's catastrophic it's hard to

1932
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:00,299
remember like the events that led up to

1933
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,640
that and I do admit that I have a hard

1934
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:05,219
time admitting or not admitting uh

1935
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,320
remembering why like what has happened

1936
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:11,219
up to the point where

1937
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:13,920
um the story so you had a outlet it was

1938
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:15,480
uh right left your toaster oven in your

1939
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,039
kitchen and you're having a lot of

1940
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:19,019
trouble with it it was causing problems

1941
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:20,340
in other circuits in the house not

1942
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,840
necessarily your grow room but like you

1943
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,579
know your living circus so you like your

1944
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,560
laundry room and your kitchen and you're

1945
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:27,119
using a vacuum to suck water out of it

1946
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,739
and you were convinced that the water

1947
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:30,319
that you kept getting out of it had

1948
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:33,479
something to do with it

1949
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:35,279
so you know eventually you know you had

1950
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:36,599
me look at it and I wasn't electrician

1951
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:39,119
yet but I knew a thing or two I couldn't

1952
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,039
figure it out and so you had to call the

1953
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:42,779
landlord and so the landlord had to call

1954
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,479
an electrician and they also had to come

1955
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:46,979
over and check it out and

1956
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:48,718
um at that point you had to take down

1957
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:50,218
your grow room you had to kind of box up

1958
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,619
your broom and you had the boxes through

1959
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,119
plants the part I don't remember is how

1960
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:55,760
is it that we only had one mother of

1961
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:58,859
that you know I don't think we really

1962
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,600
coordinated like like super like

1963
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:01,799
organized on who had what mothers to

1964
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,840
make sure we didn't really think about

1965
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,760
it much you know we just knew we both

1966
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,619
had it because me and Gabby and it was

1967
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,659
an emergency situation

1968
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:11,340
not and it was an emergency and it had

1969
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:13,019
been going on for like a week and it had

1970
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,940
become a bigger emergency like oh [ __ ]

1971
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,860
we got to deal with this you know it's

1972
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:18,419
hard for people to understand these days

1973
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:20,880
it's kind of hard for me to even express

1974
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:22,739
it or anybody probably like how

1975
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,480
stressful a situation like this can be

1976
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:26,399
you know because of the way things are

1977
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,959
now compared to this could like wreck

1978
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:29,519
your whole deal you know this could be

1979
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,158
like the end for you at least that's our

1980
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,840
perception you know and so he had to put

1981
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:35,879
that thing in a box or along with all

1982
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,739
his other mothers and probably had to I

1983
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,119
don't remember this but knowing him he

1984
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:40,678
probably had a crop going in he probably

1985
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:41,819
had to chop some [ __ ] down you know and

1986
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:44,760
toss it

1987
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,198
but the models were in a box and I don't

1988
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,840
know exactly what happened but that's

1989
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:52,559
where the super skunk died and it was

1990
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:56,520
I want to say 1997 or 1998 but I'm I'm

1991
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:58,739
like more like 82 or 89 sure it was

1992
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,420
actually 1998.

1993
01:15:58,738 --> 01:16:02,279
um and that was there we lost it right

1994
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,480
then I had passed it to someone in

1995
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,219
Humboldt County

1996
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:07,439
and those people are different they're

1997
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:10,800
up in white Thorns oh man I shouldn't

1998
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:12,899
say that in Tumble and they um

1999
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,400
the guy I gave it to pass it to his

2000
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:16,679
neighbor and his neighbor was a friend

2001
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,719
of mine now but at the time she was like

2002
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:20,279
super duper private person and you

2003
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,319
couldn't you know like she didn't come

2004
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:25,439
over and hang out when the one you know

2005
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:28,559
anybody besides her neighbor was there

2006
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:30,059
um so he passed it to her and you know

2007
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,620
we we thought we had it for a little

2008
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,300
while after we lost it probably in early

2009
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:35,460
2000s we thought we had to hunted down

2010
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,659
when me and her became friends and then

2011
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,000
we lost it because she had passed

2012
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:40,799
someone back into Sonoma County and then

2013
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,198
she set up a meeting between me and him

2014
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,179
and he had lost it too so and that was

2015
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,678
the end of it but it was 1998 and that

2016
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:49,380
was the end of it you know and it was a

2017
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:51,779
bummer you know so so let me say we were

2018
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:54,539
just let me say something real fast

2019
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:55,460
yeah so you know you reminded me of this

2020
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:57,238
story

2021
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:59,340
earlier today

2022
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:02,099
and it kind of like brought light to

2023
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:04,980
something that you know maybe it's going

2024
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:07,739
to be upsetting to some people including

2025
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:10,979
not so dog okay and I'm gonna talk to

2026
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:12,718
him about it but so you know he asked me

2027
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:16,319
when I did the podcast

2028
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:19,800
he said well you know was it the Scentsy

2029
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:23,219
skunk or the the ace Gunk and I was like

2030
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:24,360
well I don't remember you know like I I

2031
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:26,760
hadn't been thinking about it I don't

2032
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:29,939
remember right but so now

2033
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:33,539
when Jason's reminding me of this what

2034
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:35,119
I'm realizing is that what I must have

2035
01:17:33,539 --> 01:17:38,219
given Francis

2036
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:42,300
and breadwisk I know that we've read

2037
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:43,500
with it was the census seeds not the VA

2038
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,279
scum

2039
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:49,319
you know Francis never had the VA skunk

2040
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,840
because I had lost it

2041
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:55,019
prior to ever meeting him what I want to

2042
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,140
say is this doesn't make Francis a liar

2043
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,580
no you know like you like you know a

2044
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,679
bunch of trolls on the internet are

2045
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:03,420
gonna you know be like oh Francis was

2046
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,920
lying about this vote no it doesn't make

2047
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,960
Francis a liar

2048
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,179
he's just

2049
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,640
you know mistaken about something that

2050
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:12,719
happened so many [ __ ] years ago and

2051
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,219
like

2052
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,579
you know

2053
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:19,439
I called her shut up he knew yeah he

2054
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:21,179
knew that we had the connection and you

2055
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:23,519
know I'm gonna go and talk to those guys

2056
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:27,600
and maybe do another podcast with them

2057
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:31,620
where me and Francis talk about it

2058
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,820
you know he has no incentive to make

2059
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:35,279
[ __ ] up

2060
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:37,679
it doesn't it doesn't benefit him in any

2061
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,899
way to say that it was a VA skunk and

2062
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:43,500
not the Scentsy seeds Gunk and

2063
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:45,799
you know so so many people get so worked

2064
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:49,140
up about this [ __ ] and I'm just laughing

2065
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:51,119
I'm like why like why does you know

2066
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,920
maybe I could understand Francis caring

2067
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,019
and you're caring and I'm caring but

2068
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,359
like all these people getting so worked

2069
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,699
up and calling people liars and fakes

2070
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:02,759
and that they don't really know Staten

2071
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:06,059
Island and it's just like it's crazy

2072
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:09,960
it's crazy nonsense spirit

2073
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:12,719
well you know it is crazy welcome to

2074
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,279
crazy but you know the truth is your

2075
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,679
perspective and so your perspective is

2076
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:18,179
you know larger and or different you

2077
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:20,399
know and so that's what it is I mean

2078
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:21,719
yeah I mean of course you know like

2079
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,099
nobody here is trying to and that's what

2080
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:25,020
these conversations are that's what

2081
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,820
these conversations do

2082
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:28,620
that's what this conversations do right

2083
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:29,639
they change their perspective a little

2084
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:32,340
bit I mean like

2085
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,800
maybe me you and Francis you know

2086
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:37,319
talking together on a podcast you know

2087
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,239
that's the best I have no connection

2088
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:41,219
with him at all

2089
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:43,019
I just want the super skulls back I

2090
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:44,760
don't actually care yeah but we got that

2091
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:47,219
we got we gotta we have to we have to

2092
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,719
give up on that one and just make sure

2093
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:50,939
that we never lose the chem dog right

2094
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,719
because like oh that's what's lost is

2095
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:53,539
lost

2096
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:57,300
yeah you know

2097
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:59,939
I don't think anyone now

2098
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,619
I've seen some stuff that looks similar

2099
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:04,379
you know so maybe it has enough of the

2100
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:07,380
traits in it and you know with some of

2101
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:10,260
your uh quality selection maybe we can

2102
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:13,920
find stuff that reminds us of it more

2103
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:16,679
but also you know yeah that's the best

2104
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,539
we can do folks you're right and like I

2105
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:20,640
said there's no disagreement it's just

2106
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:22,198
perspective you know of course like it's

2107
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,679
nice to be able to talk about it and

2108
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:26,879
hear like like like make it make sense I

2109
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,560
guess you know from my perspective

2110
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,719
because I you know like these things are

2111
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,520
just plants I mean well they are just

2112
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,439
plants but they're not just like they're

2113
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,840
not possessions they're friends they're

2114
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:39,658
allies they're like they're like my dog

2115
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,819
my cat my kid it's family that's what

2116
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:43,859
they're family it's family to me so to

2117
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:45,059
find out a member of my family's out

2118
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:47,399
there somewhere and I've been missing

2119
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:49,140
that member all these years I mean it's

2120
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:51,899
going to affect you if you have that

2121
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:53,699
kind of love I do or you do and so you

2122
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:55,139
know but as you work through it you

2123
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:57,419
understand it like okay there's

2124
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:58,800
obviously some more stuff here that's

2125
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,480
not you know

2126
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,100
make you know it's going to make sense

2127
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:03,718
to me at some point and now it does you

2128
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,980
know and that's good you know not that

2129
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:07,380
it's important that it makes sense to me

2130
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:08,698
but it is to me you know because like

2131
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,380
that's how I go to bed at night because

2132
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:12,000
you know I remember what happened and

2133
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,619
like it's a shame would happen it's

2134
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,899
terrible and

2135
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:17,880
um it's also a learning time a learning

2136
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:19,979
like a lesson point in my life because

2137
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,060
that's why that's why we don't lose

2138
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:22,799
anything else

2139
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,940
that's right that's why we don't lose

2140
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,719
anything else because of what happened

2141
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:26,639
there

2142
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,500
and that's how I took it you know and I

2143
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,760
and you took it that way too you know

2144
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:33,539
like

2145
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:35,940
you know it was a rough time

2146
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:38,519
the VA skunk is to us

2147
01:21:35,939 --> 01:21:41,579
what like the previous generation to us

2148
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:44,100
they used to say oh I remember back in

2149
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:47,658
the day there was the Colombian gold in

2150
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:49,280
the Panama Red you know like now

2151
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:55,519
yeah

2152
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:55,519
this is the Panama Red of our lifetime

2153
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:03,960
That Got Away exactly yeah like years

2154
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:05,879
later years later people like Shiloh go

2155
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,719
that was the best food I ever had in my

2156
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,179
life

2157
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,859
yeah you know I mean there's a lot of

2158
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,539
great weed around but if that one still

2159
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:14,399
rolls around your head I mean that tells

2160
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:16,079
you everything you need to know and the

2161
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:18,000
more years that go by the more it says

2162
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,140
you know because it was that good it was

2163
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,238
just that good people just don't

2164
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:23,520
understand like when people like oh it's

2165
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:25,198
so stunky and I just I want to believe

2166
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,280
it but I also roll my eyes because I'm

2167
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,379
like you just

2168
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:31,019
yeah you know it's like now they have

2169
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,039
roadkill skunk skunk spray they have all

2170
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,260
these different ways of describing

2171
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:36,060
skunks back then it was simple skunk

2172
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:37,699
because that's what it smelled like it

2173
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:40,980
smelled like a [ __ ] skunk

2174
01:22:37,698 --> 01:22:43,979
yeah that's amazing you know however it

2175
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:45,599
happened it was amazing and I I for what

2176
01:22:43,979 --> 01:22:47,819
I'm grateful to have been able to enjoy

2177
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,460
it and kind of remember it and

2178
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:52,319
but at the same time everything that I

2179
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,060
come across in my life including

2180
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:55,579
anything I make or anything that I enjoy

2181
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,380
you know

2182
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:59,819
immensely these days it always is going

2183
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:02,819
to get compared to that you know because

2184
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:04,279
it's hard not to it's so unique you know

2185
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:06,420
so

2186
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:07,979
you know the guy who made this number

2187
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,899
six I just talked to him you know

2188
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:13,079
yesterday and the day before and he

2189
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,879
heard your podcast and uh you know he

2190
01:23:13,079 --> 01:23:16,198
was he reached out to me it's like you

2191
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,460
know those guys they got some cool

2192
01:23:16,198 --> 01:23:19,738
stories but they don't have any of the

2193
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:22,079
back story you know and I'm like I know

2194
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:24,658
you know and I and I told him Gabby I

2195
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:27,479
said I said hey I'm one more closer to

2196
01:23:24,658 --> 01:23:28,859
my uh to one of my fantasies I don't

2197
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:30,899
know if I use the word fantasy but it is

2198
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:33,059
kind of and he said what's that I said I

2199
01:23:30,899 --> 01:23:34,439
want you me and Gabby to sit down smoke

2200
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:36,000
a joint and talk about [ __ ] let's talk

2201
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:37,579
about weed he's like we can make that

2202
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,340
happen at least

2203
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:43,140
and I told you that earlier

2204
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:45,119
yeah he's an unknown Legend as they say

2205
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,800
you know and uh you know that might

2206
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:47,698
change pretty soon here I'm working on

2207
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,380
it but

2208
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:51,359
he's a good guy it means a lot to me

2209
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,640
just like you do Gavin you know his his

2210
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:55,500
work needs to be you know it should be

2211
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,880
you know kind of recognized you know

2212
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,260
because he wasn't doing it for the

2213
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,380
[ __ ] Fame of the money either believe

2214
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:02,760
that you know in the late 80s so he was

2215
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,500
just like Gabby and I just trying to

2216
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,000
have the best [ __ ] weed in his pocket

2217
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,119
you know that's the game there's no more

2218
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,579
to it than that right take a quick

2219
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:13,198
moment to sort of ask a quick question

2220
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,179
which is oh there's someone else here

2221
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:16,799
there's someone else here besides Jason

2222
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:19,260
tonight

2223
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,760
there is um who is it do you I thought

2224
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:23,119
we Jason and I were having a private

2225
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:26,699
conversation

2226
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:28,979
do you feel at all Vindicated that

2227
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:32,158
essentially the goal of what you were

2228
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:34,799
going for with the super dog is

2229
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:38,698
essentially the genetic combination that

2230
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:41,219
led to Sour Diesel as far as we can tell

2231
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:43,559
so we'll have the sour diesel

2232
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:45,779
conversation in a second but what I was

2233
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:49,920
going for was something that had the

2234
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:53,779
structure and the Vigor of the skunk

2235
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:58,020
with the terpene profile of the chem dog

2236
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:59,880
and you know when uh not so dog talked

2237
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:03,780
about it in his podcast he was like well

2238
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:06,359
we were looking for was the high because

2239
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:07,319
the chem dog was the most potent weed of

2240
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:10,380
its day

2241
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:13,198
and what I disputed that I said what I

2242
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:16,020
wanted was [ __ ] that tasted like the

2243
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:18,059
chem dog you know I've always been like

2244
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:20,460
you know the potency is nice but if the

2245
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:21,539
weed's that good I want to hit it twice

2246
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:24,300
anyway

2247
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:25,859
you know so I'd rather I'd rather smoke

2248
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:28,020
more of something that tastes like the

2249
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:32,939
chem dogs than be concerned about

2250
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:35,340
whether it was 15 20 or 30 THC and I

2251
01:25:32,939 --> 01:25:38,759
still feel the same today

2252
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:40,679
as far as the skunk uh excuse me the

2253
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:44,159
sour diesel

2254
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:46,619
what I believe the sour diesel was

2255
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:49,799
an accidental cross

2256
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:51,719
that clock made

2257
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,640
you know I don't believe that it was a

2258
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:56,158
breeding project

2259
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,500
or weasel I you know and you know we can

2260
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:02,460
talk to him about it but I didn't make

2261
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:04,319
it you know and it was out there East

2262
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:08,939
with

2263
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:11,158
um JJ and AJ and

2264
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:14,039
um weasel

2265
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:16,259
and you know that's you know kind of why

2266
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:17,880
I assume it is what it is

2267
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,219
but

2268
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:22,859
yeah it's just my best guess

2269
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:26,698
that's what I think it is but we'll have

2270
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:28,259
to get weasel and Jade AJ on the podcast

2271
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:30,539
and

2272
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:33,060
you know we'll see what they have to say

2273
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:35,880
because they they really were more there

2274
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:38,940
at the beginning than I was look at that

2275
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,800
I I would say you know the way you know

2276
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:43,019
individuals speculate about what a

2277
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,300
strain is nowadays when they have no way

2278
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:46,800
to like you know there's no evidence of

2279
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,739
it you know it's just speculation so

2280
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,600
like if you look at the super skunk and

2281
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:53,759
you taste the chem dog and you taste

2282
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,639
Superstar and then you just try the sour

2283
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,619
diesel it's it's hard I would you know

2284
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,119
of all the speculation there's only one

2285
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:02,279
that I would agree with and that is that

2286
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:03,899
that is probably true the super skunk

2287
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:05,819
and the chem dog since those guys were

2288
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:07,379
growing it too both of them and we both

2289
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:09,059
know the chem dog harms every time and

2290
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:11,579
the super skunk certainly few bananas

2291
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,800
too early if you even had the slightest

2292
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:15,899
uh lightly it's been well documented

2293
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,060
many people talked about it

2294
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:20,099
um you know it's pretty it doesn't take

2295
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,080
like a large jump of your imagination

2296
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,460
say yeah that probably is what it is you

2297
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:24,359
know it came from that area at the same

2298
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:26,219
time

2299
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:27,839
but you know who wants to get involved

2300
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:29,579
with that conversation argument or

2301
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,380
whatever not me because I wasn't there

2302
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:32,880
and like a lot of people do a lot of

2303
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,920
people left a lot of people are spending

2304
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,420
their life having that conversation and

2305
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,100
arguing about it and I just think that

2306
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:39,359
it's going to be speculation to the end

2307
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,739
of time you know and that's you know

2308
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:43,019
that's right yeah you know people go

2309
01:27:40,738 --> 01:27:45,419
which headband cut did you use what's

2310
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,100
your you know master cut Kush cut using

2311
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:48,719
it's like I would love to answer you

2312
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:50,579
that but when someone hands you a cut

2313
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,158
and says this is the Master Kush I'm

2314
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:55,859
supposed to add on another you know

2315
01:27:53,158 --> 01:27:57,719
adjective or pronoun for you for the for

2316
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:59,759
somebody out there on the internet like

2317
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:01,139
I I can't do that like what it's told to

2318
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,000
me is what it is I understand there's

2319
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:04,739
more of one cut ahead then I understand

2320
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,960
there's more than one cut of Master Kush

2321
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:08,579
but when someone hands that to you you

2322
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,899
know you know obviously you're basing

2323
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:12,179
your experience with this cup in the

2324
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:14,099
past which I do I'm not going to rename

2325
01:28:12,179 --> 01:28:16,020
it you know just to suit somebody on the

2326
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,219
internet and how they feel about it and

2327
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,980
I can't do that and what difference does

2328
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:21,359
it make you know Mike I don't mean to be

2329
01:28:19,979 --> 01:28:22,919
an [ __ ] but sometimes I ask the

2330
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:24,779
question back so how many sour diesels

2331
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,100
have you smoked and they're like well

2332
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:28,500
i've smoked this one I'm like so what

2333
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:31,199
difference does it make to you you only

2334
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:33,300
smoked one you know what I mean so keep

2335
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:34,738
it as true as it was when it's handed to

2336
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:36,239
you you know like leave the speculation

2337
01:28:34,738 --> 01:28:38,519
out you know because that's all it is or

2338
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,019
if your game is speculation be really

2339
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,300
clear that that's what you do you

2340
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:44,400
speculate you know I think that I think

2341
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,619
that's a legitimate thing to do is to

2342
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:48,899
speculate as long as that's the way

2343
01:28:46,619 --> 01:28:52,679
we're putting it and not putting too

2344
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:55,319
much you know into it you know and there

2345
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:57,779
certainly shouldn't be like heavy drama

2346
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:59,579
and arguments over it because we should

2347
01:28:57,779 --> 01:29:01,619
just be saying yeah I really don't know

2348
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:03,840
this is my best guess

2349
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:07,559
and I'd love to ask did either of you

2350
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:10,079
guys ever really get into or try any of

2351
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,600
the other clones to come out of G's

2352
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,579
Library like the uh the diesel or the

2353
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,920
snow dog I think some of that work was

2354
01:29:14,579 --> 01:29:19,439
done by Bundy but did you guys ever try

2355
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:23,039
interested in it at all

2356
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:24,599
I've grown the diesel out yeah

2357
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,340
what was your thoughts on it because

2358
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,719
it's meant to be the same genetic combo

2359
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:30,119
as Sour Diesel right it's meant to be

2360
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:33,600
like chemd skunk

2361
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:35,039
it is and but I can't imagine anyone

2362
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,179
would put on that same level of course

2363
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:37,800
not many people have tried the number

2364
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:40,319
six but

2365
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:44,279
um it just didn't do it for me

2366
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:45,479
um it was Standalone but it's it goes

2367
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:47,698
back to perspective like when your

2368
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:49,979
perspective is oh this says Super Skunk

2369
01:29:47,698 --> 01:29:51,658
in it well your your expectations in

2370
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:53,459
some areas have risen without you even

2371
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:55,619
wanting it to your bias has risen

2372
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:57,420
without your any you know effort on your

2373
01:29:55,619 --> 01:29:59,519
part and therefore it becomes

2374
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:01,079
disappointing you know unfortunately you

2375
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,940
know just like the mass superstroke

2376
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:05,460
which I've told you about before you

2377
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:07,439
know I got that sent to me and you know

2378
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:10,198
I grew it out when you gave it to me in

2379
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:11,579
2006 and I was expecting the number six

2380
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:13,379
because that's what I told it was that's

2381
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:14,579
what he said would be and I mean and I

2382
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:18,000
believe he thought that that's what it

2383
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:19,679
was but it wasn't and you know

2384
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,179
who knows maybe in some Gardens it would

2385
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,980
have been a winner but in my garden it

2386
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:25,079
was just like a point of disappointment

2387
01:30:22,979 --> 01:30:28,559
like a massive disappointment you know

2388
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:30,658
it's like so couldn't do it

2389
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,880
that makes sense

2390
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:35,219
yeah interesting how about you Gabby did

2391
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:38,639
you ever try either of those

2392
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:42,139
I didn't but what I did try were the

2393
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:45,060
other cams like the chem sister

2394
01:30:42,139 --> 01:30:47,699
and the cam d

2395
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:50,280
and I never thought any of that stuff

2396
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:51,238
actually matched up and as a matter of

2397
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:53,519
fact like

2398
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:54,839
I told the story you know with Francis

2399
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:58,020
that

2400
01:30:54,840 --> 01:31:00,239
I don't really believe that and I'm

2401
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:01,860
saying this with all due respect to Greg

2402
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,379
who produced some of the most important

2403
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:06,839
genetics of a Lifetime right

2404
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:08,880
um when he says that like five years

2405
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,980
later he popped more seeds from the same

2406
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:14,699
batch and then five years later he Pat

2407
01:31:10,979 --> 01:31:16,859
you know I question that because like he

2408
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:20,158
only had like 10 or 12 seeds initially

2409
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:21,479
and if you had 12 seeds of the most epic

2410
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,579
[ __ ] ever

2411
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:24,359
and you just pulled the chem dog out of

2412
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:27,359
it

2413
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:29,939
and you lost the chem dog which he did

2414
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:32,460
would you wait five years and then five

2415
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:35,759
years more to plant those seeds like

2416
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:37,859
that doesn't seem like a logical story

2417
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,079
you know and the one thing that Kim does

2418
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:41,759
said many times is that he called the

2419
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,079
chem dog whatever he was growing at the

2420
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,060
time

2421
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:47,219
you know so

2422
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:48,380
I really don't think that those are

2423
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:51,658
actually

2424
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:53,819
close cam crosses they might have the

2425
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:56,399
chem dog in it somewhere kind of like

2426
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:58,439
the not so dog or the Superdog

2427
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:59,039
but

2428
01:31:58,439 --> 01:32:01,619
um

2429
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:04,439
yeah I don't believe that's what

2430
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:07,738
we were all looking for at the time

2431
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:10,500
I mean I would say I I can't distribute

2432
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:12,059
that I just I can't you know like Kim D

2433
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,800
doesn't look anything like chem dog and

2434
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,900
like of course there's variation in F1

2435
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:18,300
that's the most controversial [ __ ] that

2436
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:20,579
I say that's the most controversial [ __ ]

2437
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:21,900
that I say well you know I mean I try

2438
01:32:20,579 --> 01:32:23,760
not to get it it's not really conscious

2439
01:32:21,899 --> 01:32:25,920
you just said it's your opinion it's not

2440
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,960
controversial and you know you you you

2441
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,460
were a standalone too and you get to

2442
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,779
have your own opinion you've had a lot

2443
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:33,600
of experience with this stuff you know

2444
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:35,519
just like myself and and you know I I

2445
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,260
would agree with you you know like you

2446
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,360
know I've told the story a dozen times

2447
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,920
where you know like I saw the Kim's

2448
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,960
sister the one that I wanted in a

2449
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,158
magazine picture you know in 2006 that's

2450
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,380
the one I wanted

2451
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:48,899
to kill sister I hold currently is not

2452
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:50,279
the same plan however it was handed to

2453
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:52,259
me as the Kim says so I still call it

2454
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:54,119
the Kim says now everybody wants to call

2455
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:55,500
it the Bundy cut I'm okay with that you

2456
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:57,420
know I kind of know this backstory a

2457
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:59,279
little bit on that but I still just call

2458
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:02,158
it the chemist you know

2459
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:03,719
um but the kimdi and especially the Kim

2460
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:05,179
one two and three and four they don't I

2461
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:08,460
don't know you know they're definitely

2462
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:10,260
like well definitely in my opinion I

2463
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:12,779
would say they're probably related but

2464
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:15,000
not directly related as in the same

2465
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:15,899
project right it becomes that's what I

2466
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,060
think

2467
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:20,719
yeah but yeah

2468
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:24,960
we'll never know for sure you know

2469
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:26,760
interesting and just probably not to to

2470
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,939
get a bit of a baseline I wanted to ask

2471
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:31,579
you both how did when when OG Kush first

2472
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:34,079
came out you know in sort of the early

2473
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:35,639
2000s how did that change your

2474
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:37,198
perspective did you still think that

2475
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:38,699
like the chem dog was the best [ __ ] or

2476
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:40,559
did you think like oh this OG really

2477
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:41,759
stands up to it like how did that change

2478
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:45,420
things

2479
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,699
I definitely felt like OG stood up to it

2480
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:50,219
because it's in the same you know like

2481
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:52,500
range of profile I guess might be a way

2482
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:53,939
to put it that I am attracted to you

2483
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,520
know as the chem dog like that deep

2484
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:59,099
earthy a lot of painting you know a lot

2485
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,560
of like certain similar serps you know

2486
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:03,239
similar effects you know I was

2487
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,739
pleasantly surprised to find out that

2488
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:05,899
you know Kim dog wasn't the only good

2489
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:08,459
weed around

2490
01:34:05,899 --> 01:34:10,079
you know I was happy to hear that you

2491
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:13,619
know so

2492
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:17,340
that's my take on so the way my take on

2493
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:19,619
it is pretty similar is I wish I had

2494
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:20,819
made that [ __ ] because that's what I was

2495
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:24,000
trying to do

2496
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:27,000
I was trying to make [ __ ] that was

2497
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,359
similar to the chem dog but more robust

2498
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,279
plants and and those plants were it

2499
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:34,979
you know and

2500
01:34:32,279 --> 01:34:38,099
you know I remember

2501
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:40,559
look I don't think I was stingy but I

2502
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:44,579
did keep the chem dog close to the vest

2503
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:46,800
right and when it got when it got out

2504
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:50,519
I was a little bummed at first

2505
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:51,900
right and now when I think about it I'm

2506
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:55,199
grateful for that

2507
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:58,259
because because it got out

2508
01:34:55,198 --> 01:35:01,319
a lot of great [ __ ] was made

2509
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:02,940
you know not just from you know Jason

2510
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:04,679
and

2511
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:06,599
um the others that have read with the

2512
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:08,399
chem dog you know

2513
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,980
um you know lots of people got it

2514
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:13,138
however they got it and made some of the

2515
01:35:10,979 --> 01:35:14,638
strains that I think are my favorite

2516
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:15,840
[ __ ]

2517
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:18,900
you know

2518
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,219
till today you know so I

2519
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:21,658
like I said at the time I was a little

2520
01:35:20,219 --> 01:35:24,658
upset when the [ __ ] got you know

2521
01:35:21,658 --> 01:35:26,939
completely out there now

2522
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:29,039
you know now I don't even have the chem

2523
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:31,979
dogs you know I know I can get it back

2524
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:34,380
from Jason and and others but

2525
01:35:31,979 --> 01:35:37,198
um I'm grateful it got out

2526
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,819
you know so

2527
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:40,500
yeah

2528
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:42,960
effective on that

2529
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:45,840
when I got to Kim dog from Gabby he told

2530
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:48,359
me never give this to anyone ever you

2531
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,100
know and so I did give it to three

2532
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:52,079
people

2533
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:54,960
a couple of them more than once you know

2534
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:57,300
one of them a lot more than once and uh

2535
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,819
you know I'm grateful for that you know

2536
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:01,860
um and I didn't I the third person I

2537
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:03,658
gave it to I barely knew and he's

2538
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:05,339
probably the number one reason why it's

2539
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:08,279
everywhere now

2540
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:10,619
um you know breeding or just clones

2541
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:12,899
available you know so and it's still

2542
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:15,119
hard who's that first but his name's

2543
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:16,500
Shea bud and he runs a company called

2544
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:19,260
707

2545
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,639
seed bank and I was a little high on

2546
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,139
acid one night and he came by the

2547
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,340
apartment to buy some weed and we

2548
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:24,659
started talking about breeding and I was

2549
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:27,119
like man this [ __ ] there's a lot

2550
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:29,339
about breeding and so I was like I have

2551
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:31,439
this notion just to give him the cut you

2552
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,500
know it's like I want to say 2006 come

2553
01:36:31,439 --> 01:36:36,960
in 2005 and I never really saw the guy

2554
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,119
again I think we talked on the phone

2555
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:41,579
um but anyway so that's and then it went

2556
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:43,859
from there to Humboldt County which they

2557
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:46,260
spread it amongst their their circles

2558
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:47,939
far and wide and then eventually it went

2559
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:49,260
to Colorado

2560
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:51,299
um and then a guy there gave it to

2561
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:53,520
peabutt and then he was responsible for

2562
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,320
for spreading it around p-bud gab I

2563
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:58,199
don't know if you know who he is again

2564
01:36:55,319 --> 01:37:00,479
is the guy that sold the weed to Greg

2565
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:02,759
yeah he's one of the guys yeah so he he

2566
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:04,799
was uh coming back into cannabis at the

2567
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,420
time I guess you could say and

2568
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,460
um you know the connection had been made

2569
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:10,440
and so you know that's how that got

2570
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,600
around but honestly at the time I was

2571
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:15,839
like I was on probation I was looking at

2572
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,699
like serious [ __ ] you know uh you

2573
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,380
know law enforcement issues that I had

2574
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:21,658
had from the bus that I just had when

2575
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:25,800
all this started happening in 2014

2576
01:37:21,658 --> 01:37:28,500
15-ish 15 16 ish and but now I look back

2577
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,119
and I'm like I'm really you know the

2578
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,500
plant does what it's going to do you try

2579
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:33,500
not to get in the way you know and

2580
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:36,658
that's that's where we're at you know so

2581
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:38,520
she's an amazing plant and in light of

2582
01:37:36,658 --> 01:37:40,259
all that and then looking back and

2583
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,480
seeing like what's available today what

2584
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:44,340
people are in love with today I'm really

2585
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:45,959
glad it happened because it'd be shitty

2586
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,940
if it wasn't part of that conversation

2587
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:50,279
or equation you know what what cannabis

2588
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:53,460
is today right now you know so I'm glad

2589
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:56,698
it's there I agree with you 100

2590
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:59,219
that's brilliant so we've chatted a lot

2591
01:37:56,698 --> 01:38:00,479
about some of the things in the past but

2592
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:02,219
I'd love to chat a bit about the future

2593
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,678
you know at the start of the episode you

2594
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:07,319
guys revealed there's an exciting collab

2595
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:08,819
in the works where can people find the

2596
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:11,238
clones and and what can they expect

2597
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:14,639
going forward

2598
01:38:11,238 --> 01:38:16,979
well me and Gabby been talking and um

2599
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:19,260
you know it was 30 years ago when we

2600
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:22,559
when we kind of had that fateful day and

2601
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:24,659
met and you know it's like where he's at

2602
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,159
right now where I'm at right now it just

2603
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:28,619
made a lot of sense and you know we

2604
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:30,179
decided after talking and back and forth

2605
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:32,279
and going back and forth I mean me and

2606
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:33,658
GAP talk it's usually just laughing

2607
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:35,219
about stories and stuff like that but

2608
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:38,460
every now and again these things come up

2609
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:41,158
and you know gab's got a good uh

2610
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,020
extensive lab library and like I

2611
01:38:41,158 --> 01:38:46,138
mentioned my partner you know she has a

2612
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:47,940
way to sell clones through her website

2613
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:49,500
um we here at Lucky Dog cannabis and

2614
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:51,238
Lucky Dog Chico are going to start

2615
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:53,579
selling our own clones you know we're

2616
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:55,198
gonna start uh selecting other breeders

2617
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:57,000
stuff

2618
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:58,138
um and so we started talking about all

2619
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,639
this and I don't really think it was

2620
01:38:58,139 --> 01:39:01,319
anyone had to push it was just kind of

2621
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:03,239
one of them ideas was just sitting there

2622
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:05,340
for the taken and we decided to just

2623
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:06,899
team up and we're gonna do some breeding

2624
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:09,179
collaborations we're gonna do this

2625
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:11,158

2650
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:03,719
like you know we're only a few years

2651

2653
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,619
that's that's all there is and you know

2654
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:13,079
the guy's giving me so much knowledge of

2655
01:40:10,619 --> 01:40:14,399
course he shared the genetics with me I

2656
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:16,079
always will have the respect that he was

2657
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:18,899
brave enough to drive that [ __ ] across

2658
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:20,519
country I know people who you know they

2659
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:21,839

2660
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,540
don't have the balls to do that you know

2661
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,100
so I have respect for that and I love my

2662
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:27,359
friend Gabby I respect my friend Gavin

2663
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,699

2664
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:32,099
capacity is like a dream for me you know

2665
01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:35,279

2672
01:40:46,579 --> 01:40:51,179
co.com and Gabby's Library will be

01:40:52,738 --> 01:40:56,819
on all this stuff and

2676
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,900
um you know so we have like we don't

2677
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:00,119
know what to call it yet we don't know

2678
01:40:57,899 --> 01:41:01,679
if we should name it but uh you know

2679
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:03,658
it's a collaboration between two old

2680
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:05,158
friends who give a [ __ ] about weed and I

2681
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:06,719
think the whole world who gives a [ __ ]

2682
01:41:05,158 --> 01:41:10,920
about weed is gonna [ __ ] love it I

2683
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:13,520
really do so that's my take on it

2684
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:17,760
well I I appreciate what you said Jason

2685
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:19,440
I'll add to that by saying so um

2686
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,260
these other guys from this other podcast

2687
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:25,859
they reached out to me saying that

2688
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:28,739
people wanted to clear what I had to say

2689
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:31,979
and I was kind of like why

2690
01:41:28,738 --> 01:41:33,539
you know I was confused because

2691
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:35,698
I've you know

2692
01:41:33,539 --> 01:41:38,639
like I felt like I haven't really done

2693
01:41:35,698 --> 01:41:39,479
anything with the chem dog or with the

2694
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,460
skunk

2695
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:44,279
in a really long time

2696
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:45,960
you know that's that's what Jason's been

2697
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:48,779
doing and and I've been doing other

2698
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:51,179
stuff I honestly I I do you know Jason

2699
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:52,439
is gonna get me the chem dog back and

2700
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:55,618
we're gonna do some breeding together

2701
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:56,519
with it but you know for a while I kind

2702
01:41:55,618 --> 01:41:59,039
of just

2703
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:00,179
wasn't doing that I had other projects

2704
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:04,079
going on

2705
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:05,760
and when people when you know it was

2706
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:08,519
mentioned to me that people really want

2707
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:12,239
to hear what I have to say and I'm this

2708
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:13,820
like known person on the internet as

2709
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:15,959
Staten Island

2710
01:42:13,819 --> 01:42:18,779
you know I

2711
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:22,260
I you know said to myself you know maybe

2712
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:24,539
people actually do care about what I've

2713
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:27,119
done it like it was like surprising you

2714
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:30,238
know like because I haven't been in the

2715
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:31,618
public eye the way others have you know

2716
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:32,399
I've just been trying to get my work

2717
01:42:31,618 --> 01:42:35,819
done

2718
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:38,219
you know and but you know it's also was

2719
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:41,340
presented like I'm a super shy person

2720
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:43,560
and I don't want to like like people you

2721
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:45,420
know were scared to ask me including

2722
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:48,179
Jason for some reason didn't want to ask

2723
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:51,239
me if I wanted to do a podcast like this

2724
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:54,000
I was like bro I'm I'm not that private

2725
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:56,638
particularly about like [ __ ] that we did

2726
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,319
you know 20 years ago I'm not really

2727
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,760
worried about like that coming back to

2728
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:01,559
me right now you know

2729
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:05,100
so

2730
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:08,340
that discussion led into like hey you

2731
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:10,920
know maybe people would be interested in

2732
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:15,300
a collaboration between

2733
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:18,118
you know skunk VA and Staten Island you

2734
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:19,860
know and so

2735
01:43:18,118 --> 01:43:21,539
that's you know

2736
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:24,658
that's what we're doing and like I said

2737
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:25,800
we have been working together for 30

2738
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:27,960
years

2739
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:30,480
you know doing breeding and other

2740
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:31,618
projects and yeah you know took a little

2741
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:33,359
time off

2742
01:43:31,618 --> 01:43:36,599
but now our

2743
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:40,439
our friendship is rejuvenated

2744
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:43,440
and you know like like I said

2745
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:45,059
Jason was the first person I ever went

2746
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:46,738
into business with

2747
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:51,239
you know he's the first person I ever

2748
01:43:46,738 --> 01:43:53,039
worked with that way you know so it

2749
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:54,238
seems like a perfect thing for us 30

2750
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:55,859
years later

2751
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:57,539
to get back into it and do another

2752
01:43:55,859 --> 01:43:58,819
project together

2753
01:43:57,539 --> 01:44:02,219
and

2754
01:43:58,819 --> 01:44:04,198
honestly when Jason mentioned to me that

2755
01:44:02,219 --> 01:44:05,939
he wanted to do this

2756
01:44:04,198 --> 01:44:08,519
I was honored

2757
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:10,678
because I consider him the big dog

2758
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,119
you know I consider he's the one that's

2759
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:15,239
doing all this great work with the chem

2760
01:44:12,118 --> 01:44:17,219
dog for years now so the fact that he

2761
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:19,678
wanted to collaborate with me is

2762
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:21,300
it was an honor for me as well

2763
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:24,300
same here

2764
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:26,159
it's amazing are you feeling are you

2765
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:28,560
feeling the love partner

2766
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:31,859
me oh [ __ ] yeah man I've been feeling a

2767
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:33,840
little I'm so happy yeah this is I mean

2768
01:44:31,859 --> 01:44:36,238
I've lost so many [ __ ] people that I

2769
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,860
won't be able to reconnect with in this

2770
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:39,479
life to be able to reconnect with you

2771
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:41,939
and to be able to have what we have at

2772
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:43,559
this very [ __ ] moment it's it you

2773
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:45,299
can't put a price on it you can't you

2774
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:47,159
can't put anything on it it's everything

2775
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:49,679
to me this is life this is what it's all

2776
01:44:47,158 --> 01:44:51,000
about you know I've I've lost all the

2777
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,440
different people that are listening are

2778
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,880
saying right now people that are

2779
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:55,879
listening are saying you guys need to

2780
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:58,800
get a room

2781
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:01,739
well you know I don't need a room maybe

2782
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,659
they need to get it yeah that's that's

2783
01:45:01,738 --> 01:45:05,359
what I would be thinking if I'm hearing

2784
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:08,039
this conversation about anyone else yeah

2785
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:10,380
I know I don't care that's the way

2786
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:12,899
that's the way I feel you know I'm Latin

2787
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:16,560
I'm not going to express express love

2788
01:45:12,899 --> 01:45:19,079
with my fellow man you know yeah me

2789
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,699
neither dude me neither hey like that's

2790
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:23,279
what I'm saying we're lucky to have it

2791
01:45:20,698 --> 01:45:24,779
it's so precious like I mean people say

2792
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:28,079
it and they talk about it but they

2793
01:45:24,779 --> 01:45:30,118
almost sound cliche it really is any

2794
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:31,679
second she laughs you know and to have

2795
01:45:30,118 --> 01:45:33,420
people you love and the ones that you

2796
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:36,600
mean the most to you in your life on a

2797

2798
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:41,100
basis you know daily or whatever basis

2799
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,560

2828

[ __ ]

2829
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:42,779
that's why Jason and I get along so well

2830
01:46:40,859 --> 01:46:45,359
I'm not either

2831
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:47,219
now what what a beautiful sentiment it's

2832
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:48,779
all full circle it's all love I really

2833
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:50,819
like that and I was gonna just quickly

2834
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:52,500
mention you know shout out to the the

2835
01:46:50,819 --> 01:46:54,299
breed of Syndicate podcast for getting

2836
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:56,279
you on I know both Jason and I have

2837
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:58,440
listened to the episode and enjoyed it a

2838
01:46:56,279 --> 01:46:59,819
lot and uh just certainly not trying to

2839
01:46:58,439 --> 01:47:02,339
avoid saying the name so I wanted to

2840
01:46:59,819 --> 01:47:03,840
give kudos to not so and Matt for for

2841
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:05,100
helping make that happen otherwise we

2842
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,980
probably wouldn't be chatting right now

2843
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:09,360
and I wanted to quickly follow up you

2844
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:11,658
know people have heard they can get

2845
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:14,099
Gabby's clone library in the near future

2846
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:15,479
the question is on the breed of

2847
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,400
Syndicate you mentioned you were smoking

2848
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:19,019
on the orangutan titties I think we all

2849
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:21,539
collectively got a laugh when we heard

2850
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:23,219
that one what other clones are you uh

2851
01:47:21,539 --> 01:47:24,600
vibing on at the moment Gabby what are

2852
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:28,139
some of the things from your collection

2853
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:30,900
that you'd be excited for people to try

2854
01:47:28,139 --> 01:47:33,000
so the three strains that I'm most

2855
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:35,339
excited about currently are the

2856
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,520
orangutan titties which is Grease Monkey

2857
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:41,039
Time Skittles it's extremely Skittles

2858
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,900
dominant and Skittles is making a big

2859
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,899
comeback out here in California at least

2860
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:48,839
it's really beautiful weed it actually

2861
01:47:45,899 --> 01:47:50,579
won the emerald Cup last year for the

2862
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,980
personal use category

2863
01:47:50,579 --> 01:47:56,519
and the personal use category for those

2864
01:47:52,979 --> 01:47:57,299
that don't know it's the most

2865
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,760
um

2866
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:02,279
the most respected category because it

2867
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:05,460
includes everything so the emerald cup

2868
01:48:02,279 --> 01:48:08,219
they break everything down by

2869
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:10,739
um chirp profile whether it's indoor

2870
01:48:08,219 --> 01:48:12,779
Greenhouse outdoor they break it down to

2871
01:48:10,738 --> 01:48:14,519
a whole bunch of categories and that's

2872
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:16,139
where all the licensed stuff

2873
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,659
and then they have the personal use

2874
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:21,719
category which is just like anything

2875
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:24,179
goes anyone can enter and the license

2876
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:25,800
facilities enter as well and my buddy

2877
01:48:24,179 --> 01:48:27,239
Parker Mozelle

2878
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:31,079
um Fino hunted it

2879
01:48:27,238 --> 01:48:33,238
and entered it into the emerald cup and

2880
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:36,300
was the winner with that strain it's

2881
01:48:33,238 --> 01:48:39,059
extremely rare and it's it's super nice

2882
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:41,699
so that's one of them that I'm really

2883
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:46,679
excited about the other ones are the

2884
01:48:41,698 --> 01:48:48,118
slaps which is Grease Monkey times runs

2885
01:48:46,679 --> 01:48:51,000
um I just

2886
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:53,698
I just received some flour from

2887
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,219
a cultivator that's just finishing it

2888
01:48:53,698 --> 01:48:57,960
and it's just it's unbelievable it's

2889
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:01,319
really beautiful weed

2890
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:03,239
and then it's it the it's it is rainbow

2891
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:05,939
chip times gelato

2892
01:49:03,238 --> 01:49:08,279
and out here in California everybody's

2893
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:10,979
asking for candy gas

2894
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:14,099
and what I think the

2895
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:16,319
um if it is is gas candy

2896
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:18,539
because it leaves with the gas but

2897
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:19,979
there's a little bit of candy there and

2898
01:49:18,539 --> 01:49:21,719
it has color

2899
01:49:19,979 --> 01:49:23,399
so

2900
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:26,219
you know those are the strains that I

2901
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:28,319
I'm currently most excited about

2902
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:30,719
um being able to release to the public I

2903
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,698
do want to add since you uh you thanked

2904
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,800
Matt and the breed of Syndicate I wanted

2905
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:36,238
to do the same thing

2906
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,560
um I did want to mention them and I'm

2907
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,919
you know I'm glad it's not an issue

2908
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:43,320
because if it wasn't for them we would

2909
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:45,300
not be having this conversation because

2910
01:49:43,319 --> 01:49:47,399
you know that's what convinced Jason

2911
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:49,380
that I'm not a Herman you know scared to

2912
01:49:47,399 --> 01:49:51,899
like talk to people

2913
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:54,779
and you know if I hadn't done that

2914
01:49:51,899 --> 01:49:57,599
podcast you know because Jason was like

2915
01:49:54,779 --> 01:49:59,158
yeah you know like we should we should

2916
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,840
do something I was like yeah we should

2917
01:49:59,158 --> 01:50:04,259
do something like this why the [ __ ] not

2918
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:07,860
he was literally there when it began and

2919
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:10,199
one of my closest and uh

2920
01:50:07,859 --> 01:50:12,779
you know I I've known him longer than

2921
01:50:10,198 --> 01:50:15,960
I've known anyone in California

2922
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:19,439
you know so when I moved to California

2923
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:20,939
I was scared to talk to people like who

2924
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:22,979
lived near me

2925
01:50:20,939 --> 01:50:25,439
about my growth

2926
01:50:22,979 --> 01:50:27,479
you know so that's why you know I lived

2927
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:29,759
in Sonoma County I would drive down to

2928
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:32,158
Golden Gate Park to try to find people

2929
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:34,320
because I was scared that you know local

2930
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:38,279
people would know that I grew

2931
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:40,920
so you know meeting Jason when I first

2932
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:42,479
moved to California pretty much you know

2933
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:44,219
maybe a year or two later

2934
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,738
it was a

2935
01:50:44,219 --> 01:50:49,198
it was a critical part of my life

2936
01:50:46,738 --> 01:50:51,539
that I I want to keep fresh in my brain

2937
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:53,698
you know that's why I like Jason to tell

2938
01:50:51,539 --> 01:50:56,340
these stories to remind me

2939
01:50:53,698 --> 01:51:00,059
you know of everything yeah same here

2940
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:01,619
dude definitely obviously huge Junction

2941
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:04,020
in my life you know meeting you in that

2942
01:51:01,618 --> 01:51:05,579

2943
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:07,020

know

2946
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:13,079
so it's it's worth noting for sure even

2947
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,699
though we didn't care about it too much

2948
01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:17,639
until really but

2949
01:51:14,698 --> 01:51:19,559

2963
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:52,199
you know people may or may we think may

2964
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:54,539
find it entertaining just to hear our

2965
01:51:52,198 --> 01:51:56,638
[ __ ] conversations we have outside of

2966
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:58,380
a situation like this you know an arena

2967
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:59,880
like this where we just talk about life

2968
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:02,579
weed stories and everything else

2969
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:03,960
involved you know like yeah this is

2970
01:52:02,579 --> 01:52:05,760
definitely not the end of that you know

2971
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:09,480
and that you know that's what I was

2972
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:11,940
going to say it's like I I told uh and

2973
01:52:09,479 --> 01:52:13,678
his audience just December

2974
01:52:11,939 --> 01:52:15,419
um yeah he asked me do you think we'll

2975
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:17,399
ever get a chance to talk to Staten

2976
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:18,480
Island and you know I only call you

2977
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:19,618
Staten Island because that's what they

2978
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:22,319
call you on the internet just so you

2979
01:52:19,618 --> 01:52:24,359
know and so you know I'm not gonna name

2980
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:25,979
drop you if uh if everyone else is going

2981
01:52:24,359 --> 01:52:28,920
to Staten Island

2982
01:52:25,979 --> 01:52:31,259
um and then uh and then was I told him I

2983
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:32,760
said hey no he's very private and then

2984
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:34,619
the other day I told you that story and

2985
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:36,900
you made the [ __ ] you made the

2986
01:52:34,618 --> 01:52:39,719
funniest point you said my name is Gabby

2987
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:41,599
I'm from New York I'm not private

2988
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:44,579
there's nothing private about me which

2989
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:47,159
you know and so you know I don't know

2990
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:49,979
where I got that idea from but yeah yeah

2991
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:51,079
that's what you said to me than what I

2992
01:52:49,979 --> 01:52:54,118
thought

2993
01:52:51,079 --> 01:52:56,340
that's brilliant yeah I mean it's funny

2994
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:59,099
I used to have a commercial

2995
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:02,100
on the radio in Mendocino County

2996
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:04,079

3001
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:15,420
I put myself out there so hard I feel

3002
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,159
like I'm the least private person in the

3003
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:19,579
world like I don't I don't know many

3004
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:24,299
people that put them at least that early

3005
01:53:19,579 --> 01:53:27,420
you know and to be to hear that like I'm

3006
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:30,779
this private guy I was like man news to

3007
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:32,219
me you know like I you know and I was

3008
01:53:30,779 --> 01:53:34,439
really so

3009
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:37,679
just blown away that

3010
01:53:34,439 --> 01:53:39,899
people wanted to hear what I had to say

3011
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:42,359
yeah people wanted to hear what I had to

3012
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:44,099
say I I um

3013
01:53:42,359 --> 01:53:46,618
I couldn't believe it you know like when

3014
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:48,420
when Matt from The Syndicate called me

3015
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:50,698
up and said you know people really want

3016
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:55,139
to hear what you have to say I was like

3017
01:53:50,698 --> 01:54:00,000
what I why does anyone want to do what I

3018
01:53:55,139 --> 01:54:02,699
have to say you know I just and so it's

3019
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,500
a good feeling you know people have said

3020
01:54:02,698 --> 01:54:06,359
a lot of nice things about me there's

3021
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:08,039
been very little shade thrown in my

3022
01:54:06,359 --> 01:54:09,960
direction

3023
01:54:08,039 --> 01:54:12,779
um actually zero shade thrown in my

3024
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:14,939
direction and you know you know the most

3025
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:17,399
respected Growers out there like Jason

3026
01:54:14,939 --> 01:54:19,678
are saying that I grew the best weed he

3027
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:20,698
ever saw in his life at the time you

3028
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,819
know like

3029
01:54:20,698 --> 01:54:25,678
it's all super nice [ __ ] you know and

3030
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:28,738
I'm grateful

3031
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:30,719
that's beautiful look and I I think on

3032
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:32,638
when you say you know you're surprised

3033
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,500
people are interested to hear from you I

3034
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:36,060
think honestly it just speaks to one of

3035
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,679
the points Jason made on one of the

3036
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:39,719
early episodes I did with him which is

3037
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:41,699
that you know fact is more interesting

3038
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:43,859
Than Fiction most of the time you know a

3039
01:54:41,698 --> 01:54:45,479
lot of people have these weird stories

3040
01:54:43,859 --> 01:54:47,219
about chem dog on the internet and I

3041
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:50,238
think the real one is actually by far

3042
01:54:47,219 --> 01:54:50,239
the most interesting

3043
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:58,440
he had said to me he said well people

3044
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,940
find so endearing about you was that you

3045
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:01,559
didn't Flex

3046
01:54:59,939 --> 01:55:04,138
and I said to him

3047
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:06,719
I don't know what I have to flex about

3048
01:55:04,139 --> 01:55:08,039
like like you know and actually I

3049
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:10,079
corrected him I was like you know there

3050
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:13,319
are things that I will Flex about

3051
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:16,920
I'm really proud of how many people I

3052
01:55:13,319 --> 01:55:19,439
taught to grow and inspired to grow and

3053
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,960
you know help take their grows to the

3054
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,419
next level and you know I had the first

3055
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:27,899
indoor garden shop in Mendocino County

3056
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:30,359
and I put grow lights on on Highway 101

3057
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:32,519
so when you were driving you know from

3058
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:34,198
Mendocino County North

3059
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:37,739
you saw

3060
01:55:34,198 --> 01:55:39,000
you saw my grow lights in the window you

3061
01:55:37,738 --> 01:55:41,879
know and

3062
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,198
you know so like I'm proud of that and

3063
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:46,079
that and that's

3064
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:48,419
that's my Flex you know like

3065
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:50,219
what I did for the Ken dog like

3066
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:52,560
maybe I didn't see enough value in it

3067
01:55:50,219 --> 01:55:55,198
maybe I needed other people to like

3068
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,119
tell me how important it was for them to

3069
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:59,759
for me to put more value but I I always

3070
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:00,960
felt like if I did a big Flex about the

3071
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,239
chem dog

3072
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,579
but I'd look like an [ __ ] because

3073
01:56:03,238 --> 01:56:07,019
really all I was was the delivery driver

3074
01:56:05,579 --> 01:56:10,380
and somebody that grew it you know like

3075
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:14,820
Greg was the one that you know grew the

3076
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:16,920
seed and you know VA Jason here he's the

3077
01:56:14,819 --> 01:56:18,658
one that made all these subsequent

3078
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:21,600
crosses afterwards

3079
01:56:18,658 --> 01:56:24,179
and so what's my legacy I'm I'm the bus

3080
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,199
driver I'm I'm the the delivery driver

3081
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:28,440
like

3082
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:31,198
I just didn't see what my Flex was you

3083
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:33,000
know and I appreciate

3084
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:35,339
being told that it was more important

3085
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,939
than I I give my you know give myself

3086
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:40,980
credit for I'm still not gonna Flex

3087
01:56:38,939 --> 01:56:43,738
you know I'm still not gonna be like

3088
01:56:40,979 --> 01:56:46,138
yeah that's right this is me not yet you

3089
01:56:43,738 --> 01:56:48,658
know when I will after me and Jason put

3090
01:56:46,139 --> 01:56:51,600
out some legendary [ __ ] that changes

3091
01:56:48,658 --> 01:56:53,099
things and changes the way people think

3092
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:55,500
about cannabis

3093
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:57,840
then you know maybe I'll Flex

3094
01:56:55,500 --> 01:57:00,719
but I'm not there yet

3095
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:02,819
you know gab the thing is about flexing

3096
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,139
and I don't really understand exactly

3097
01:57:02,819 --> 01:57:06,000
what that means but I'll tell you what I

3098
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:07,679
think is that just coming out here and

3099
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,300
like talking to people and saying your

3100
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:11,279
stories showing your point of view

3101
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:14,039
that's all the flux is needed I mean

3102
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:16,439
it's it's it's to us it's just our life

3103
01:57:14,039 --> 01:57:18,719
and goodness but to people who you know

3104

um it has made me blush you know has

3112
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:37,139

good friends that I really care about

3114

3116
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:47,880
stories with my friends like Jason and

3117
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:50,400
not so dog

3118
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:52,980

3119
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:55,379
last couple of weeks and then like all

01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:20,940

I hope to return the favor

3130
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:26,579
of course of course well before we wrap

3131
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:28,439
things up I want to ask you guys a few

3132
01:58:26,579 --> 01:58:30,599
quick fire questions as we normally do

3133
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:32,579
before we end the episodes so first

3134
01:58:30,599 --> 01:58:37,199
one's for you Gabby what's the most

3135
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:39,300
memorable terpen profile in your mind

3136
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:41,638
there's two of them

3137
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:45,239
the first one is the chem dog

3138
01:58:41,639 --> 01:58:48,539
and then the second one is the

3139
01:58:45,238 --> 01:58:50,879
the holy weed the big star holy weed I

3140
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:52,800
can still smell that weed and and taste

3141
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,960
it in the back of my throat and I

3142
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,300
haven't had it since the 90s

3143
01:58:54,960 --> 01:59:00,239
wow beautiful what sort of smells does

3144
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:03,840
it have or is it hard to describe

3145
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:06,238
I mean the skunk was truly skunky and

3146
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,380
the haze is like what the original type

3147
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:09,178
of haze

3148
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:10,980
when I think of haze I always think of

3149
01:59:09,179 --> 01:59:12,118
that big sir holy weed so it's

3150
01:59:10,979 --> 01:59:13,439
everything else that I would be

3151
01:59:12,118 --> 01:59:15,059
comparing it to that

3152
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:18,419
because that was my first experience of

3153
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:20,520
haze weed yeah beautiful beautiful and

3154
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:21,960
Jason yourself most memorable top end

3155
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:25,139
profiles

3156
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:27,000
I I mean you know Superstar for sure I

3157
01:59:25,139 --> 01:59:29,039
can't forget it it's the same thing I

3158
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,500
can feel it in my nasals I could feel it

3159
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,479
in my you know that coating it does in

3160
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:35,698
your sinus I still feel that earthy

3161
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:36,839
sharp skunk

3162
01:59:35,698 --> 01:59:38,759
um

3163
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:41,219
I would like to go back a little long

3164
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:43,980
further to the Beatrix choice that deep

3165
01:59:41,219 --> 01:59:45,300
uh great bubble gum flavor but it's

3166
01:59:43,979 --> 01:59:46,198
starting to fade now to be honest with

3167
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,480
you

3168
01:59:46,198 --> 01:59:50,638
I had it for a long time so the super

3169
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:52,979
skunk is still in my mind you know the

3170
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,659
way it would break up into that cotton

3171
01:59:52,979 --> 01:59:56,158
it's really soft much like the sour

3172
01:59:54,658 --> 01:59:59,039
diesel when you twist it up it's like

3173
01:59:56,158 --> 02:00:01,500
it's not like hard it's kind of smooshy

3174
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:04,279
you're fatty you know it's earned

3175
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:06,899
perfectly it's like that cotton

3176
02:00:04,279 --> 02:00:08,819
so for me it's that

3177
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:10,759
I think if I had to add a third one it

3178
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:14,460
would be the Super Skunk

3179
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:16,980
but you know but I mean I I was already

3180
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:19,618
stretching it when I when I did too

3181
02:00:16,979 --> 02:00:21,598
you know I felt like yeah for one and I

3182
02:00:19,618 --> 02:00:24,539
I gave you two

3183
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:27,179
um that's a tough question you know yeah

3184
02:00:24,539 --> 02:00:31,139
the Big Sir holy weed

3185
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:33,179
um yeah that was just I remember like I

3186
02:00:31,139 --> 02:00:35,340
had gotten a batch of it sent to New

3187
02:00:33,179 --> 02:00:37,800
York City when I was living in New York

3188
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:41,159
and growing it and it was this was

3189
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:42,960
outdoor weed full-term outdoor weed not

3190
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:46,439
Greenhouse grown

3191
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:48,599
and to this day I think like man that

3192
02:00:46,439 --> 02:00:51,719
weed stood up to anything today

3193
02:00:48,599 --> 02:00:54,779
you know and so that's an herb I'd like

3194
02:00:51,719 --> 02:00:57,658
to to connect with again

3195
02:00:54,779 --> 02:01:00,059
beautiful beautiful stuff well for the

3196
02:00:57,658 --> 02:01:02,399
last question before we wrap up if you

3197
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:04,260
could only have one strain to smoke for

3198
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,359
the rest of your life we'll go to skunk

3199
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:07,679
VA first this time and Gabby second one

3200
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:10,098
strain for the rest of your life what

3201
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:10,099
would it be

3202
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:15,658
can I answer first

3203
02:01:13,618 --> 02:01:16,679
yes

3204
02:01:15,658 --> 02:01:19,019
yes didn't

3205
02:01:16,679 --> 02:01:21,020
didn't you just ask that question

3206
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:24,080
it's the same answer

3207
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:27,239
yeah yeah it's the same [ __ ] question

3208
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:29,340
Honestly though I think the Kim dog

3209
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:31,919
because the effects of the chem dog just

3210
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:33,539
shoots me much better but it's tough I

3211
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:35,880
mean it is the same question Gabby's

3212
02:01:33,539 --> 02:01:38,219
right but I would say that Kim dog

3213
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:40,260
because it works all day long every day

3214
02:01:38,219 --> 02:01:42,118
all night long all night it's just

3215
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:43,800
perfect for me you know I don't even

3216
02:01:42,118 --> 02:01:45,960
like getting high

3217
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:47,579
for me I just smoked a lot of weed so I

3218
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:50,760
don't get high

3219
02:01:47,579 --> 02:01:54,118
you know for me it's strictly about the

3220
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:56,039
term profile of the chem dog

3221
02:01:54,118 --> 02:01:58,139
that's just the [ __ ]

3222
02:01:56,039 --> 02:02:00,000

3226
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:08,880

3227
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:11,819
Strain with [ __ ] seven percent Terps

3228
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:14,219
it has that drippy gas flavor it doesn't

3229
02:02:11,819 --> 02:02:16,979
get you high that's the person who wins

3230
02:02:14,219 --> 02:02:19,020
the game right there

3231
02:02:16,979 --> 02:02:20,939
and I agree with that I agree because

3232
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:22,619
you know you can only smoke as much as

3233
02:02:20,939 --> 02:02:25,259
you [ __ ] head can take you know but

3234
02:02:22,618 --> 02:02:27,960
just your mouth your that that flavor

3235
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:29,820
that mouth coat that um in the back your

3236
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:31,319
throat on the back your teeth you just

3237
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:33,059
you want more and more and more of it

3238
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:34,738
you know what I mean so when you're when

3239
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:37,020
we were young and daddy gave me the

3240
02:02:34,738 --> 02:02:38,638
Kindle he's like two rules first off

3241
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:39,840
you're not gonna like don't get the same

3242
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:41,639
one but you're not gonna really want to

3243
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,659
grow this one it doesn't root well it's

3244
02:02:41,639 --> 02:02:44,940
hard to grow

3245
02:02:42,658 --> 02:02:47,399
secondly don't smoke it in a bubber

3246
02:02:44,939 --> 02:02:48,658
before 11 A.M right which was funny at

3247
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:51,118
the time because all we did was Smoke

3248
02:02:48,658 --> 02:02:53,638
fatties all [ __ ] day well that was

3249
02:02:51,118 --> 02:02:55,259
then I could smoke chem dog fatties all

3250
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:57,359
day when I'm like 20. nowadays I'm like

3251
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:58,619
I start to like drool and stare at the

3252
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:01,679
wall but I still want to take another

3253
02:02:58,618 --> 02:03:04,380
hit it tastes so [ __ ] good so

3254
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:06,779
you know I'm not gonna like tout less

3255
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:10,139
THC and more flavor but kind of yeah I

3256
02:03:06,779 --> 02:03:11,219
am that'd be amazing you know what I

3257
02:03:10,139 --> 02:03:12,960
mean

3258
02:03:11,219 --> 02:03:14,158
you how about you answer the same

3259
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,840
question for

3260
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,879
familiar

3261
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,679
look at you to get you more involved in

3262
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:21,960
this podcast you've barely been involved

3263
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:25,520
uh I was enjoying being a fly on the

3264
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:29,520
wall did you fall did you take a nap

3265
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:32,460
for periods for periods um look I think

3266
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:34,080
that I uh I would struggle to match you

3267
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:35,819
two guys I think if I picked the chem

3268
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:38,279
dog I would that would be like a

3269
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:40,500
non-functional for the rest of my life I

3270
02:03:38,279 --> 02:03:42,719
I would need something a bit more sativ

3271
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:45,539
or I'm a bit of a sativa guy maybe like

3272
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:47,698
uh a nice Super Silver Haze hybrid or

3273
02:03:45,539 --> 02:03:50,039
like maybe that's what we got to do the

3274
02:03:47,698 --> 02:03:51,238
the Chaska Super Silver Haze cross chem

3275
