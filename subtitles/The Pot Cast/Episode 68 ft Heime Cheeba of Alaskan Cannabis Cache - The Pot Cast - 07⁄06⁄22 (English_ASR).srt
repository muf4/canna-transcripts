65
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,759
you so much for joining us today

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,620
you're welcome thanks for having me as

67
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,000
always I'd love to start the show by

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,519
asking our guests what have you been

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
smoking on recently

70
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,658
well we got a local strain here called

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,580
Mud bite delight and it's pretty much a

72
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,039
staple for me so

73
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,459
I kind of kind of stick with that it's

74
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,098
it's an old school strain uh originally

75
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,920
developed in the early 60s by a chemist

76
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,738
believe it or not who brought it back

77
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,958
from South Africa

78
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,219
wow that's actually one of the strains I

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,900
was going to ask you about not just

80
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,000
because it's sort of in your repertoire

81
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,739
but I I'd actually dug up some posts on

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
various forums where people were like

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,700
you know talking about how much they

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,739
enjoyed it does that mean that it's sort

85
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,780
of um South African genetics is what

86
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,599
it's made up of

87
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,340
yes totally back then there wasn't uh

88
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,518
you know everything was in seed there

89
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,340
was no clones or or anything so pretty

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,280
much uh the seeds in someone's pocket is

91
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,200
is what ended up being some of the stuff

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,419
that was you know grown here in Alaska

93
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,759
and California

94
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,158
yeah well and so would you describe that

95
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,340
as sort of like a more uplifting effect

96
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,298
and like what's the flavors on it

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,540
you know it's it's got a really heavy uh

98
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,500
ripe strawberry chirp to it uh real

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,919
heavy

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,839
um anise and this is another one so

101
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,099
um you know kind of leads me to think

102
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,579
that uh

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,800
there might be uh a few more strains in

104
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,680
there than than I thought it might be a

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,040
a wild hybrid so to speak

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,620
a lot of that was going on in in uh it

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,360
was Rhodesia at the time

108
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,280
um so

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,040
yeah it's hard to say because the

110
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,459
breeder the original breeder I never met

111
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,520
him I met the people that inherited uh

112
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,978
The Strain and then I just kept it going

113
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,180
my first job as a pot grower was to pack

114
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:59,819
water

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,800
for mud by Delight that's really

116
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,139
interesting and I mean you know you

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,759
reference the anise flavor in there and

118
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,680
that's one that commonly gets thrown

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,500
around as like the typical description

120
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,819
for a Durban do you see some overlap

121
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,600
there

122
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:19,259
yeah it has uh you know I want to say it

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,620
has uh Durbin in it most definitely and

124
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,180
then some heavy Afghani uh presents and

125
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,759
they're also

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,360
but it's a great daytime smoke keeps you

127
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,240
uh motivated uh doing things but it's

128
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,580
got a good Stone so if you got any aches

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,960
and pains and you're old like I am it

130
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,939
helps

131
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,579
helps a lot

132
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,199
that's awesome to hear I had noticed

133
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,379
while scrolling through your Instagram

134
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,538
that obviously a wide variety of

135
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,339
different strains but a lot of them sort

136
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,038
of fell under the general umbrella of

137
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,619
Afghani and I was sort of wondering are

138
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,719
you like me in the you would say sort of

139
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,240
generally speaking you're you're a fan

140
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,020
of the afghanis

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,180
I am but I'm also a fan of sativas I'm a

142
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,859
um you know you say breeder I'm more of

143
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,538
a preservationist that's what I call

144
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,699
myself

145
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,339
um you know some people have called me

146
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,160
the crazy seed collector

147
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,959
um a lot of people came to my home over

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,419
the years and the few people that I

149
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,638
showed what I had going on thought I was

150
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,120
you know insane for

151
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,460
just growing weed with seeds in it and

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,319
preserving strains instead of selling

153
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,019
weed you know that was the thing and

154
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,400
that's what everybody did during my era

155
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,019
so

156
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,198
um you know it's kind of this is

157
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:43,439
validation to an old crazy guy after all

158
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,939
these years of uh having seeded plants

159
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,120
and trying to explain it to good friends

160
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,579
and uh and people that I that I meet in

161
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,000
the in the industry over the years

162
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,620
it's uh it's a little bit different

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,279
um now

164
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,038
um

165
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,839
you know as far as the breeding goes I I

166
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,180
took what came to me

167
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,758
and I crossed it but I did a lot of work

168
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,879
so it's the work that you put in that

169
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,860
makes you a breeder and the testing and

170
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,600
sending it out there and getting results

171
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,660
from other people

172
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,180
that in that sense I think makes you a

173
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,460
breeder I call myself a breeder only

174
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,259
because I do that I have everything

175
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,598
tested by other people and I accept

176
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,300
whatever they have to say about whatever

177
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,819
I put out there and

178
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,460
um I'll either release something

179
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:35,340
or I won't depending on what they what

180
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:38,038
they give me what their feedback is

181
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,779
yeah wow it's funny because like as you

182
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,579
were saying that in my mind I'm like

183
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,839
ticking these boxes I'm like yep that

184
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,459
that checks out that checks out that

185
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,379
checks out and then at the end of it I'm

186
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,758
like wait you just described like what

187
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,759
being a good breeder is really

188
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,000
it's you know like I said before my

189
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,220
currency is time it's not money

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,519
um all everything I do just to bring

191
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,900
something to an F5 will take me six to

192
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,299
seven years

193
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,638
you know and I've worked with a lot of

194
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,379
different uh strains and and brought

195
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,259
them up to that point

196
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,839
but I haven't released a lot because

197
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,300
it's been so much work to just set it

198
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,878
out there and have somebody grab it up

199
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,639
and call it something else uh kind of

200
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,060
would break my heart uh it's kind of a

201
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:30,960
collector thing I guess or or part of my

202
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,418
mental illness of of uh collecting uh

203
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,360
seeds and and working with strains for

204
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:39,059
over these years not uh not giving them

205
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,680
away might call me a hoarder a lot of

206
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,218
people call me a hoarder when I wouldn't

207
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,219
release a roadkill skunk and uh that's

208
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,800
basically what prompted me to release it

209
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,040
that and being called uh greedy and

210
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:56,819
selfish and I I'm none of those things

211
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,939
it was just that I could have released a

212
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,180
stable version or an IBL and I thought

213
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,839
you know the IBL that would release

214
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,239
the whole genome to everybody so they

215
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,700
can work with it and find what they want

216
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,039
in there and there's been a myriad of

217
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,080
things but there is no floral accents

218
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,958
like a lot of people are fighting in

219
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,580
some skunks uh the roadkill originally

220
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,018
had none of that well that's what it was

221
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,620
originally called it was originally

222
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:27,839
called roadkill not roadkill skunk that

223
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,799
came that came about in uh

224
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,500
uh the late 80s early 90s people started

225
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,579
calling it rks and roadkill skunk when I

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,740
I started uh selling clones

227
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,320
yeah wow a lot of a lot of like sort of

228
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,299
notable uh points to touch on in that

229
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,580
one we'll have to loop back to a few of

230
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,679
them before we jump into the road cool

231
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,320
skunk stuff I just wanted to quickly ask

232
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,939
in the prior question you reference you

233
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,760
know like you were hanging onto all

234
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,640
these seeds all through the 80s and 90s

235
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm wondering did you have the foresight

236
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,958
back then to know that like at some

237
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
point in the future these seeds would be

238
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,259
valuable or was it more different and it

239
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,680
was just like I just want to retain my

240
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:14,039
own seeds really

241
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:17,278
that's how it started out and um then um

242
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,439
in my travels I traveled extensively

243
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,019
well I met a few people that were doing

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,580
the same thing as me but they seemed as

245
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,899
crazy as I was and got the same feedback

246
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,420
um

247
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,500
what really spurred me on and the part

248
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,620
that most people don't understand

249
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,159
because it was illegal there was a lot

250
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,620
of people that would lose their strains

251
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,079
because girlfriend would turn them in or

252
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,600
they were stupid or they let somebody in

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,879
or they just plain got busted dork got

254
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,240
kicked in and they lost their strain

255
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,639
well I started to think well if if I'm

256
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,399
going to keep doing this

257
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,759
um to to collect more and again more I

258
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,620
can guarantee people that have a salable

259
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,100
product that they're they're making

260
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:09,000
money on out there selling every day

261
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,159
uh bags to the public if I take their

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,919
strain and I save it

263
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,078
then um I have those genetics if they

264
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,958
want to start over I have those in seed

265
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,659
form sometimes it was clones but I I

266
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,458
prefer not to work with clones

267
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,159
um trying to keep them alive over a long

268
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:29,039
period of time I've kept some clones

269
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,360
alive most longer than I ever should

270
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,500
have but

271
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,320
um

272
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,659
that's a lot more work than breeding or

273
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,000
working with seeds stock

274
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:42,719
the toughest thing for me was the

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,799
retention of males trying to keep

276
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,060
um I have a pretty extensive seed stock

277
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:50,099
and trying to keep all these things

278
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,299
alive or regenerate them every three

279
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,079
years

280
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:58,259
so every three years I'll I'll regrow as

281
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,299
much as I can in a rotating basis so

282
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,039
nothing gets older than three years and

283
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,719
doesn't lose its viability for

284
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,480
germination

285
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,240
but that's uh you know a lot of people

286
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,920
don't do that but that's the only way if

287
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,019
you're gonna make sure that somebody

288
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,240
gets the product that they want or they

289
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,060
were working with before

290
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,500
that they have a reasonable uh

291
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,559
experience

292
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,399
in uh growing it out germinating it and

293
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,500
and getting what they had before

294
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,120
yeah certainly I think what you just

295
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,179
referenced there with strains being lost

296
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,259
is a plight felt by most breeders I

297
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,599
think most people who've come on the

298
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,100
show can talk of a few strains they've

299
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,680
regrettably lost over the years that

300
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,360
they wish they still had I wanted to

301
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,958
quickly ask though you mentioned you

302
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,459
know

303
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,500
um breeding things over multiple

304
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,259
generations and I'd be interested to

305
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,000
know from your perspective let's use the

306
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,139
roadkill skunk for example because I'm

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,419
sure we'll talk about it a bunch

308
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,759
throughout the episode I think I think

309
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,919
you've got the F5 or maybe even a little

310
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,778
further at the moment what have you sort

311
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,219
of noticed change over the generations

312
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,019
as you've worked with it have you been

313
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,600
able to narrow things a bit or are you

314
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,000
trying to open it up

315
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,759
I'm trying to open it up what I what I

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,759
find what has really happened was it's

317
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,240
lost its uh heavy Stone effect

318
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:21,360
um it's uh more of a

319
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,360
um a happier Stone a lot of people are

320
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,120
enjoying it it does have that old uh old

321
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,240
school uh effect but it doesn't have the

322
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,500
original heavy Stone uh when I first

323
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,759
sourced it

324
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,559
when I sourced it in in Albion area of

325
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,919
Mendocino

326
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,500
um from some old hippie couple and their

327
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,699
commune like people that was growing

328
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:50,159
outdoors in in that region

329
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,920
and in California they have what are

330
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,699
called planning holes and you dig a hole

331
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:59,458
in this clay soil is dense clay soil and

332
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,800
then you'd add soil or amended soil to

333
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:04,259
that that you made your own soil

334
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,379
and you grow your plants in that

335
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:10,319
well in that region there's a pH problem

336
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:13,139
or alkalinity problem that stunts the

337
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,399
trees and natural growth of of the

338
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:19,500
bushes and plants around there so um

339
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,899
one of the things I recommend to people

340
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,659
with roadkill is that you adjust your pH

341
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,059
downwards

342
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:28,860
to to bring out the the heavier scent I

343
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,239
noticed the furthest further you get

344
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,579
away

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,180
um with your pH the higher you go with

346
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:37,919
it the uh the less it stinks wow that's

347
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,019
that's really interesting I mean it

348
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,539
makes sense you know sort of using the

349
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,980
known terroir effect I'd be interested

350
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:47,759
to know have you ever fiddled around

351
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,320
with adding or subtracting sulfur from

352
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,759
the soil and seeing because a lot of

353
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,339
people always throw out the idea like

354
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,100
roadkill skunk maybe has like some thile

355
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,019
some sulfur type compounds in it do you

356
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,278
have any thoughts on that

357
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,339
yeah

358
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:06,958
you know I've a lot of people use sulfur

359
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:09,300
uh up here you know we we

360
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:13,679
really don't have issues where we

361
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:15,899
require sulfur uh so I I never uh

362
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,419
experimented too much with sulfur at all

363
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,519
but I have heard that I have heard about

364
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,379
the thyles

365
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,440
um you know

366
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:28,379
without having DNA testing or you know

367
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,620
genetic testing on things

368
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:33,659
um it's hard to say exactly what's in

369
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,839
there that creates the stench but the

370
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:40,679
the plant when it's when it was growing

371
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:45,360
in its prime uh you the place that I I

372
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:47,458
sourced it from was uh up River about uh

373
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,440
three quarters of a mile you could

374
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:52,979
actually smell part of the Grove from

375
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,100
one or Highway one on the coast

376
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,800
so you had you had uh Ocean Air blowing

377
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,839
in but you could still down river smell

378
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,179
the smell of of that grow that

379
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,680
particular grow it was one of the first

380
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:08,519
ones on the river

381
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,739
yeah wow okay and so do you think that

382
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,198
the reason why we don't see it anymore

383
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:17,060
is because it just was as people sort of

384
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:19,500
say it people just got busted with it

385
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,778
you know that's the reason I stopped

386
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,458
making clones available

387
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:25,679
um there was just too many people

388
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:28,619
getting busted I mean uh really good

389
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,559
people that that I know really well and

390
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,299
and with uh I don't know if you had it

391
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,458
going on over there in Australia but

392
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,399
they were taking everything you had

393
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:40,559
under Federal forfeiture laws and police

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,799
departments were getting rich and and

395
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,979
good Folks at uh the only thing that you

396
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,919
know they were doing was you know

397
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,139
selling marijuana for for a living uh

398
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,299
they were they were getting uh busted

399
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,620
and losing everything they had sometimes

400
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,620
their children

401
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,019
so those stories uh you know they're

402
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,039
they're too horrible to listen to

403
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:07,500
for a plant that you know you had a part

404
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,199
in making sure it got distributed widely

405
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,599
but I think its downfall really was that

406
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,140
it's a medium yield or at best

407
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,698
and when Big Bud came in BC big bud it

408
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,220
kind of stole the show that and the

409
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:24,660
widows and the whites kind of stole the

410
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,620
show as as a uh a commercial grow so to

411
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,820
speak

412
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:31,739
and and a lot of what I did as far as uh

413
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:34,139
unknown strands a lot of people say

414
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,880
what's the name of that well sometimes

415
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,220
I've got a strain that's just called Bob

416
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,840
strands but it's completely a knockout

417
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,940
strength

418
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,699
um you know I don't know the background

419
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,320
of the strain because when I got it from

420
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,660
Bob he didn't know you know it might

421
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,399
have been bag seed he doesn't know its

422
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,700
Origins but it made him a lot of money

423
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,440
so I preserved it and then when you know

424
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,200
especially around here where people got

425
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,140
used to smoking it for years I would let

426
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,600
it back out and uh they're like oh yeah

427
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,419
what's what's the genetics on this I'm

428
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,819
like your guess is as good as mine

429
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,340
so on that end like I say being a

430
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,918
preservationist and a breeder

431
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,899
uh are two separate things if I'm

432
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,759
preserving something I want to preserve

433
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,780
something as close to the original as

434
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:24,960
possible especially in those instances

435
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:27,178
in seed form so I could get that person

436
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,600
that lost everything up and running

437
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,900
again yeah that's that's a very sort of

438
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,178
noble uh cause I I can definitely jive

439
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,519
with that and I mean while we're on the

440
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,919
topic of talking about the genetics and

441
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,599
a strain one of the tales you hear about

442
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,100
the roadkill skunk and I think you'd be

443
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,159
the perfect person to ask is that it

444
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:49,319
sort of originally had its roots in uh

445
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,240
like the bikey scene do you believe

446
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,558
there's any truth to that given you just

447
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,279
said you know you actually got her from

448
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,279
a hippie community

449
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,140
well to be honest with you I I went I

450
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,480
used to go to

451
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,559
um Garberville California to the Redwood

452
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,660
Run I am a biker and uh when I'd go to

453
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,038
Garberville to the Redwood Run they'd

454
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,298
have all these different rock and roll

455
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,400
shows

456
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:18,179
well I also uh hooked up with a lot of

457
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,038
regional uh Humboldt area breeders and I

458
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,100
just came across this hippie couple that

459
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,798
came up to see one of the shows and uh

460
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,798
they offered to show me their grow and

461
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,418
uh and uh hook me up with some stuff I

462
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,400
could bring back to Alaska to share with

463
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,200
everybody here

464
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,340
is one of the things I did when

465
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:42,779
traveling uh I smug a lot of weed Hawaii

466
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:46,379
California Kentucky Tennessee

467
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:48,899
so yeah a lot of it uh you know

468
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,539
I bring it back here and and uh friends

469
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,580
that uh go ahead and get rid of me get

470
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:55,798
rid of it for me because uh I didn't

471
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:58,798
sell weed the problem with me selling

472
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:01,798
weed is is if I got busted I didn't just

473
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,980
lose my seed stock I lost everybody's

474
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:07,679
seed stock so I try to be at you know as

475
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,319
careful as I could with with uh what I

476
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,620
was entrusted with I mean some of those

477
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,619
people are gone today and I asked their

478
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:20,339
relatives to this day you know can I go

479
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:22,319
ahead and and you know reuse this strain

480
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,019
this used to be your uncles or your or

481
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,659
your fathers or your grandfather's uh

482
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:30,179
can I reintroduce us and do you have a

483
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,860
problem with that and mo almost none of

484
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,080
them have

485
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,479
I did notice in California there was

486
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,240
really no interest in seeds uh when I

487
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,640
tried to reintroduce them years ago I

488
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,019
went to the Redwood Run for for almost

489
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,080
40 years

490
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:48,660
and uh tried to reintroduce some of the

491
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,579
seed stock or just give them back uh

492
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,660
here's these genetics I got these from

493
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:55,859
your grandpa your father Aunt Uncle Etc

494
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,840
and they just weren't interested they

495
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,479
said hey dude we do everything from

496
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,339
established clones here we know what

497
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,019
works here and I'm like okay I'm just

498
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,000
telling you I got the seed stock from

499
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,798
your your folks and I've kept it all

500
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,880
these years if you want it's yours and

501
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,879
they're like nah

502
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,960
wow I think there's probably a lot of

503
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:17,939
people who are like wishing they could

504
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,519
have traded places that like you know

505
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,740
kudos to you for for restraining

506
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,298
yourself in that conversation and just

507
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,980
being able to be like well you don't

508
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:27,058
know what you don't know

509
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,298
yeah

510
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:32,158
I you know it it's sad because there

511
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,980
there is a lot of stuff that got lost

512
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,100
because I can only collect so much

513
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,798
myself you know I know what I liked and

514
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,839
what my friends liked you know we all

515
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,019
have our group that that we have our

516
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:49,019
sessions with that that we enjoy uh

517
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:52,259
cannabis with and then we have uh

518
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,720
another extension of people that we give

519
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,740
uh part two or share with because they

520
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,900
have ailments or certain things going on

521
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,880
and uh to lose some of those things that

522
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,280
are that have been out there for for

523
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,760
years I think was you know

524
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:11,579
the biggest crime that was committed uh

525
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,259
during the whole pot prohibition was

526
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:15,240
losing all those things that could have

527
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,339
been beneficial

528
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,620
um you know all pot is medicinal I tell

529
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,298
everybody that if it makes you feel good

530
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,519
that's medicinal

531
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:25,139
if it changes your mindset that's

532
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,079
medicinal

533
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,299
that just my personal opinion yeah no I

534
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,579
can I can greatly get on board with that

535
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,319
so that's really interesting to hear

536
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,699
that just to quickly loop back you'd

537
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,259
mentioned a few other states you'd been

538
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,480
to and brought some cannabis back from

539
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,400
over the years did you ever get a chance

540
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,140
to see the fade wood could you mentioned

541
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,259
Kentucky so I was wondering did you see

542
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,280
Kentucky Bluegrass which is a somewhat

543
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,279
well-known strain at all

544
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,839
you know on under that name I couldn't

545
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,659
tell you but I I probably haven't and my

546
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,058
in my uh in my bank probably about eight

547
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,580
uh strains left from Kentucky older

548
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:06,298
strands a lot of it's red hair and

549
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:08,879
stinky uh you know a lot of skunks uh

550
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:11,460
that that don't exist anymore but some

551
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,580
of those folks I I can't get in touch

552
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,740
with uh I haven't you know I don't know

553
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,558
what happened to them over the years

554
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,839
so some things I'm reluctant to release

555
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,000
uh simply because

556
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,759
I don't know how it'll affect people

557
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,279
that might still be growing at and and

558
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,980
their ability to regenerate it

559
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:35,700
which is what I do I I regenerate things

560
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,500
uh I do the best I can with what I have

561
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,100
um so it doesn't get lost

562
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,900
but I regenerate the seeds and and try

563
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,359
and keep them viable

564
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,600
but in that process you know I can't I'm

565
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,759
I'm not perfect and uh some things can

566
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,759
get lost with parents you know if you're

567
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,619
a breeder and you don't choose or select

568
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,779
the exact

569
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:59,699
um you know or as close to what you're

570
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:00,960
looking for in the plant that everybody

571
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,019
loves

572
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,679
you can inadvertently change it without

573
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,798
trying to do so and I you know challenge

574
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,980
any breeder to keep ten strains for one

575
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,440
year and try not to try not to change

576
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,099
anything about them from the original

577
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,919
donors both parents both you know your

578
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:26,339
original uh parent lineage it's it's

579
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,880
it's a task you know so like I said uh

580
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:32,038
my currency is time more than anything

581
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,799
and Karma you know if you don't keep a

582
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,839
good karma while you're doing all this

583
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:39,119
uh what I've seen uh when especially

584
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,839
when it's associated with all about the

585
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,759
money that bad things seem to happen and

586
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,220
bad things happen to good people in

587
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,980
those situations so you got to keep a

588
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,980
clear head and uh you know just be

589
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,960
practical just be a farmer yeah some

590
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,819
really wise words there I can definitely

591
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,919
get on board with that try to keep track

592
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,259
of the comma meter I would love to

593
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,520
quickly run this idea by you

594
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,919
um because we hear it a lot in the

595
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,259
community as a general sentiment do you

596
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,140
believe that there was only ever one

597
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:12,599
road kill skunk or do you think it was a

598
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,460
profile that actually occurred in maybe

599
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,740
a few different strains and people are

600
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,860
just noticing that

601
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,740
but I think there could be a myriad of

602
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:26,219
of roadkills I see it within uh with

603
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,679
what I've released as an IBL uh there's

604
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm down to seven

605
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:35,640
um male plants now that I use for open

606
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:38,759
pollination so uh the last time I did I

607
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,980
had 11 uh but I went through a series of

608
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,819
the last couple years wasn't so kind to

609
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,960
me as far as uh illnesses and health uh

610
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,418
so

611
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,360
um during that time uh my help I had to

612
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,240
have help for a long time my my health

613
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,058
came and went so in that process I lost

614
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,960
some uh some male donor plants parent

615
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:02,879
plants for the IBL and uh so I had to

616
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,519
create new ones out of seed stock that I

617
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,500
have so it's changed a bit even doing

618
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,740
that that's why I said challenge anybody

619
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,200
to try and keep the original stock all

620
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,579
you can do is do the best you can with

621
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,740
what you're given I mean there's

622
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,000
probably if somebody has a large enough

623
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,839
facility

624
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,659
and they run enough uh Finos they they

625
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:28,500
can keep and Preserve

626
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,059
exact replicas especially doing tissue

627
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,880
culture

628
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:35,339
I'm not much of a feminized guy I used

629
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,679
to do rodalization which is when the

630
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:39,778
plant gets older it'll it'll

631
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,778
self-terminate itself

632
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:45,179
and I I was a big believer in that and

633
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:47,278
trying to preserve an original mother

634
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,860
plant that I may have been losing just

635
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,859
let her go to flower let her rhodolize

636
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:55,979
and let her uh self-pollinate and

637
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:58,319
basically an S1 just to keep that gene

638
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,839
pool intact

639
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,939
but you know I'm no scientist I just do

640
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,619
the best I can with what I I've learned

641
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,019
over the years

642
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:10,678
some people when they start talking uh

643
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:13,740
pot or breeding or preserving strains uh

644
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,900
with me they get kind of I go over their

645
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,839
head a little bit I don't mean to it's

646
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,320
just this has been my passion for

647
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,480
um you know as long as I've been alive

648
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,619
since I was a teenager this is what I

649
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,759
did

650
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:32,639
my first job was with Matt nuska uh

651
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,079
[ __ ] I took an ad in the paper to

652
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,940
go clean some

653
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,038
some buses I didn't know what it

654
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,058
entailed and met this old biker did and

655
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:41,278
he said

656
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,200
now I'm raising Hawaiian fighting dogs

657
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,819
and these buses back here but I got

658
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
something else going on can you keep

659
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:48,678
your mouth shut

660
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,260
I said yeah

661
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,759
he said I'll pay you well but you have

662
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:56,460
to promise me you'll keep your mouth

663
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,440
shut and I said okay no problem

664
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,079
what he wanted done was I had to clean

665
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,140
dog [ __ ] out of this school bus that he

666
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,599
raised these Hawaiian fighting dogs in

667
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,720
and the other buses had Matt nuska

668
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:13,099
[ __ ] in them and I had to keep

669
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,200
those uh plants going and call any males

670
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:18,000
and and the on smaller plants as they

671
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,880
were showing

672
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,278
so he showed me all of that and that was

673
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,860
a summer job for me

674
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,259
and after a while he got to trust me so

675
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:31,379
much that uh I I was able to get

676
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:33,179
original genetics from him too wow what

677
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,799
a what an introduction was that your

678
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,500
first sort of

679
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,839
um hands-on experience with growing

680
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,819
that was my first hands-on experience

681
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,759
with uh

682
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:48,178
yeah just even working with a pot plant

683
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,400
uh knowing what was going on with it uh

684
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:53,460
I didn't I didn't know I was gonna go be

685
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,640
cleaning uh school buses with dog [ __ ]

686
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:00,900
and and uh pot plants in them but uh

687
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,960
yeah it was uh it was a a real uh

688
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,940
education uh he was up in Anchorage and

689
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,298
I was up there for the summer with uh

690
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,880
with my father when I was younger and uh

691
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:13,859
I needed a job during the day my dad

692
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,960
said go get a job so I went and got a

693
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:18,298
job and that's of course I didn't tell

694
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,319
them what I was doing oh man he kept

695
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,339
your wood

696
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,460
yeah

697
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,798
yeah like totally kept my word yeah I

698
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,558
learned a lot from that old biker that's

699
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,658
great look so many questions to ask tell

700
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,678
me a bit about the Matanuska [ __ ]

701
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,778
it's one of those ones where like

702
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,460
everyone knows the name and has heard of

703
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:37,740
it but it's hard to get clear

704
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,620
descriptions about like the smells the

705
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,038
flavors the the overall effect

706
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,119
yeah it's you know it's a good Stone uh

707
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:47,759
you know

708
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,759
um a heady Stone

709
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,879
um gets you uh

710
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:55,440
you you know in the place you want to be

711
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,580
not debilitating

712
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,820
um has a lot of pain killing and uh you

713
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:04,859
know let you sleep fairly easy so I I

714
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:07,259
want to say that there has to be a

715
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:10,740
certain extent of uh

716
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,538
uh Afghani and the original uh crosses

717
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,480
that I was working with but mostly

718
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:18,379
sativa I would say it was a

719
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,599
um probably a 60 40 on the sativa side

720
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:24,000
but without having genetics or testing I

721
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,398
couldn't tell you exactly and then

722
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,220
looking at the plants

723
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:32,339
um they would throw sometimes narrowly

724
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,298
sometimes wide Leaf so you could see the

725
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:38,038
the mix in there so it was a true hybrid

726
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:40,319
back in the day when

727
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:43,200
um when I was working with this plant I

728
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,278
actually talked a guy in to let me make

729
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,380
seeds

730
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,480
because he believed if he was going to

731
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,240
get the plant to someone else so they

732
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,058
could they could grow it he did

733
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,940
something called grafting and he would

734
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:59,819
he would take a a another plant and

735
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,679
graft on the mat nuska thunderfluck and

736
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,839
get it to this other guy

737
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,059
and then you would think that those

738
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,459
genetics would somehow mix in that plant

739
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:10,740
or something but that's how he liked to

740
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,679
do it he cut a little notch in the in

741
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,620
the plant he he notched both plants and

742
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,960
then would wrap it up with some poulstas

743
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:22,678
that he didn't share with me and then

744
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,720
bandage it up and then he'd have me set

745
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,580
him off to the side and and I would take

746
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,360
care of these things until they were

747
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:32,639
ready to uh to go to one of his Pals now

748
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,979
it was a way for him to get the actual

749
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,740
plant to someone else that was going to

750
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,419
grow it to for commercial value they

751
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,538
were all bikers

752
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,278
and and so you know I like I said I kept

753
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:46,798
my mouth shut pretty much up until now

754
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,319
and I still kept my keep my mouth shut

755
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,480
about names and who they are

756
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:56,038
um you know and in this game

757
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,640
forever uh name dropping was a No-No

758
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:01,919
you just you just didn't do it and um so

759
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,720
that's that's what I did I still do that

760
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,220
to this day

761
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,659
um there's a lot of people that get

762
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,360
upset about me because they want to know

763
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,220
who her original breeder was and

764
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,740
especially if it's a biker or a club

765
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,538
biker I'm never throwing that name out

766
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,519
there I'm never throwing that

767
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:20,759
affiliation out there that's Nobody's

768
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,480
Business by my own I mean running with

769
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,740
that thread one of the sort of General

770
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,079
lines of discussion you hear in the

771
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,120
Cannabis Community is that many of the

772
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,000
old school clones that are now sort of

773
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,339
fable did have their roots in the biker

774
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,200
scene do you think that's true where the

775
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,778
bike is sort of reasonably involved in

776
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,440
the Cannabis scene over the years

777
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:42,619
yeah

778
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,620
foreign

779
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:51,179
clubs you have the ability to have a

780
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:54,000
clubhouse and and uh you know you're

781
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,399
protecting your Clubhouse and you have

782
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,038
uh

783
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,038
basically a sanctuary where you're not

784
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,960
letting the general public in anyway or

785
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,480
uh law enforcement

786
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,860
usually has to get a warrant to blow the

787
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,140
doors down and so uh you know that

788
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,319
system of being able to

789
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,620
um move things around

790
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:22,200
clandestinely and uh closed-mouth people

791
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:26,398
uh yeah a lot of genetics uh stayed

792
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,519
viable and around because of uh what was

793
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,379
available within that with the in that

794
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,899
system

795
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,720
otherwise they they wouldn't you know um

796
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:38,699
it's just mainly a culture within a

797
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,860
culture you know that you have The

798
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,798
Counter Culture

799
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:45,778
um and then you had us bikers you know I

800
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:48,298
I never call myself a hippie I was

801
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:51,058
always impressed by you know I still

802
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:52,859
think to this day every time I look at

803
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:54,538
what's going on today I go yep the

804
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:56,939
hippies were right again

805
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:59,759
I could never be one but I I really

806
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,100
respected uh their their attitude and

807
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,140
what they did and and uh their

808
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:07,678
resolution to everything peace and love

809
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,659
and and and all that I just uh

810
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,320
that wasn't me I didn't live in that

811
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:14,220
world so I I kind of kept to myself no

812
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,919
that

813
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,779
that's good I think we need people from

814
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,079
all sort of different Corners to

815
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,240
ultimately be represented so let's jump

816
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,098
back into some of the rks stuff because

817
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,779
I know that a lot of people are Keen to

818
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,879
hear about it so we may as well bash out

819
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,379
some of the sort of uh more pressing

820
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,779
questions I think that are on people's

821
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,098
minds

822
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,899
fairly recently on the show we had uh

823
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,300
Todd McCormick come on as a great

824
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:41,159
episode and he uh spoke about his

825
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,780
friendship with you and and some of the

826
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,940
seeds he'd got off you and and he

827
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,280
vouched for your seeds he said hey the

828
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,599
rks home he's got it's real deal he said

829
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,300
you just you might have to hunt through

830
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:54,179
a few seeds to find it but he said that

831
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,099
you you could probably refine it to be a

832
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,559
little more louder but it was definitely

833
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,000
there right what are your thoughts on

834
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,679
that is that how you would describe it

835
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,960
to someone who comes to you and says hey

836
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,539
I want to find you know that nostril

837
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,119
flaring roadkill skunk

838
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:12,000
right well you know that's a big big

839
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,599
controversy and and uh when I originally

840
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,760
agreed to release it uh Todd was one of

841
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,519
the people that I always respected for

842
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,140
his sacrifice and his dedication to this

843
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,900
plan over the years

844
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:28,618
and um

845
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:31,019
I I reluctantly released the IBL because

846
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,780
I thought that would release

847
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,599
a wider

848
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:40,260
variety for somebody to work with yet

849
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,740
the inside of the IBL there's definitely

850
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:46,920
the heavy stinkers all the way down to

851
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:49,799
uh you know some people have reported uh

852
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,780
not having uh the heavy scent or any

853
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,480
skunk scent at all

854
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,099
um sometimes I've replaced those because

855
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,679
I knew the people and I knew they

856
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:01,559
weren't bsing me but you're gonna find

857
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,078
that with femos that across the board

858
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,838
especially on you using 11 male donors

859
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,640
and I I never work with less than 130

860
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,880
female plants

861
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:16,019
so um

862
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,180
yeah it's it it's hard to uh pin it down

863
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:22,199
but I I've pinned it down it's just like

864
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:24,539
I I told Todd if I released you know the

865
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,279
absolute stinker you know what kind of

866
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:27,719
price point do you put on something like

867
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,400
that because you can only release it

868
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,379
once and then everybody's knocking it

869
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,180
off immediately

870
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,500
and and then they're calling it

871
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:40,139
something else and I put in uh 15 years

872
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,139
of work on getting up to where it's at

873
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:45,239
right now and do I just want to just

874
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:46,259
throw it out there

875
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,539
um

876
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,820
you know and everybody said it was too

877
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,338
expensive to begin with uh what I

878
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:57,359
originally set it out there and Todd

879
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:59,400
took it f2ed it and then released it

880
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,519
um and you know dropped the price down

881
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,280
so it was more readily available I'm not

882
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,519
a seed bank I'm not a big guy I'm I'm

883
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,680
just uh holding on to genetics and and

884
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:15,119
doing the best I can

885
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:19,139
and to be honest with you I I told you

886
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,680
um how I made a living at it was backing

887
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:24,598
up Growers and other people that were

888
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:28,078
saying there were breeders I would sell

889
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,900
them I I would go to shows and bring

890
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,579
them uh six or seven different strands

891
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,740
that they're getting directly from me

892
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,980
but like I say

893
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:40,379
my business and and the people that I

894
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,838
hung out with you don't name drop you

895
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:46,079
know uh so I I've always believed in

896
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:48,358
open source genetics I don't uh because

897
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,000
that I anything less I'd used to be a

898
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,400
hypocrite that's how I live my life I

899
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,219
would get these uh genetics

900
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,519
and sometimes for nothing just to

901
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:00,539
preserve them and so for me not to share

902
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,440
them

903
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:07,980
or you know um I'm not trying to to get

904
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,900
rich or or anything I I just don't want

905
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,300
to give something away I have

906
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,338
grandchildren that I hope that someday

907
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,859
that maybe they'll pick this up and run

908
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:18,779
with it when it's uh fully illegal and

909
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:21,539
there is no worries like there is today

910
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:25,200
I mean globally it still hasn't been

911
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,699
resolved in in my opinion uh and and a

912
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,279
lot of people are left hanging because

913
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:31,139
of that and like I said if it ever gets

914
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,060
back to how it was I mean that's going

915
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:35,279
to be a total tragedy but I could see it

916
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:36,960
moving that way if governments aren't

917
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,519
making the kind of money that they want

918
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,500
to make off of it

919
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,780
those days are gone that's what I tell

920
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,300
most of my friends those days of making

921
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,820
all that money and and living the

922
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,900
lifestyle that you were they're gone for

923
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,119
good

924
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,338
but fortunately a lot of the strains

925
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,880
aren't because there's a few crazy guys

926
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:59,460
like myself have hung on to things yeah

927
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,740
you know what it's it's so interesting

928
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,619
that you touch on that topic about like

929
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,239
those days are gone because I I feel

930
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,920
like I have that conversation with

931
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,559
people more and more you know you hear

932
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,240
people talking about how producers who

933
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,699
used to produce the best quality of her

934
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,679
but getting out of the game and I always

935
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,559
just say like yeah yeah like you can't

936
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,539
make like the 30k off your crop every

937
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,460
three months anymore it's not like that

938
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,019
but you know you look at other Farmers

939
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,460
they're not making any win like you know

940
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,838
someone growing corn or whatever like

941
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,400
they don't grow that sort of money and

942
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,519
and I feel like there's this sort of

943
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,500
underlying entitlement and I try to

944
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,759
explain look like yeah the reason why

945
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,460
you got paid that in the past was

946
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,380
because of the very real threat and to a

947
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,960
large degree you know there's less

948
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,039
threat depending on where you're based

949
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,320
um and they don't seem to understand

950
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,539
that like that's where that price was

951
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,820
coming from was from the threat and now

952
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:53,960
that's going on that's the price is

953
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,820
dropping would you say that over Time

954
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,320
Cannabis will become like corn in the

955
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,359
sense that like it'll just become like

956
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,460
an everyday

957
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:05,219
Pharma sort of income

958
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,740
tournament I'm sure of it and and the

959
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:10,019
people that continue on uh will do it

960
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,598
for the love of farming and For the Love

961
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,460
of the plant and and you know the

962
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,640
culture and the and Mystique that went

963
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,960
behind this plant uh for all these ages

964
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,920
I mean

965
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,760
um I saw all this stuff from the 60s 70s

966
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,220
80s 90s now now we're up into the 2000s

967
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,619
and I'm still seeing stuff every day if

968
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,739
you keep your eyes open and you

969
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:37,858
appreciate things for what they are

970
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:41,759
um you don't miss every because just

971
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:45,299
myself I I can only keep so much alive

972
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,940
uh and preserve that that I loved and my

973
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,220
friends loved and and uh some friends

974
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,838
profited from

975
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:54,118
um but there's

976
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,199
you know there's no way that any one

977
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,619
person

978
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:01,439
can can keep a lot of things together

979
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:03,660
for a long period of time and I I'm

980
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,420
slowly learning that and and I lose

981
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:08,578
stuff every day just because I can't do

982
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,119
what I used to do I used to do up to

983
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:15,539
1200 plants in rotation you know every

984
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,519
every year uh three different cycles and

985
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,099
and try and keep the the seeds

986
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,739
regenerated so they were somebody wanted

987
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:25,260
them they were viable they germinated

988
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:28,618
right away uh they were good strong

989
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:32,820
genetics and they were as close to or

990
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:37,019
equal to what people remember them being

991
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:41,460
so um like I said without DNA testing or

992
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:43,679
or actual genetic testing it it's hard

993
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,519
to say you know

994
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,019
um

995
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,179
when you're getting from different

996
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:51,838
sources I try to Source things myself

997
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:54,299
from the regions I go to and for years

998
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:58,259
that was my vacation go somewhere and

999
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:00,180
and uh and and it was my job too get

1000
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,240
strains for me you know some people go

1001
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:06,179
to the barn and after work I'd go look

1002
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:08,699
for cannabis seeds and uh you know he

1003
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:10,919
could you get them from the strangest uh

1004
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:13,019
uh sources and sometimes some of the

1005
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,420
best people that you ever want to meet

1006
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:18,900
you've gotten some really scary crazy

1007
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,700
situations even for me being a biker

1008
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,338
um I can tell you A lot of times I'm

1009
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:26,159
like man is this guy gonna kill me uh

1010
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:28,858
you know I a pig farmer comes to mind

1011
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,960
you know and uh you know he talks some

1012
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:33,119
crazy stuff but man he had the best weed

1013
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,099
in the world and it you know that I'd

1014
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,220
seen to that day and I I just wanted

1015
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:41,280
that strain that he had so you know to

1016
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:43,559
uh to get it I had to put myself in a

1017
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,380
situation that I probably wouldn't do

1018
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,659
today don't mean to ramble on but it's

1019
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,338
been a long strange trip and now Dead

1020
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,059
shows were really good for them a

1021
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:55,679
deadhead and uh those shows were were a

1022
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,559
blast that thanks to the hippies and

1023
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,318
deadheads everywhere but I I wasn't much

1024
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,059
of a dancer to stand in the middle of 30

1025
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:06,539
000 people jumping up and down and

1026
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:08,639
dancing is a real experience that you

1027
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,219
know I wish everybody could experience

1028
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,799
because it it does change your heart as

1029
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:16,679
a person I was pretty callous after

1030
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,480
coming out of the military and and uh

1031
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,779
you know a lot different person than I

1032
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,838
am today it was a lot harder biker but

1033
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,180
you know cannabis and uh deadheads

1034
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:29,519
pretty much changed my life for me for

1035
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:31,019
the positive yeah that's beautiful to

1036
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,179
hear you're sort of echoing the

1037
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:35,818
sentiment almost every guest on this

1038
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,879
show has said I think that's probably

1039
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:40,858
one of the most uh unknown things to the

1040
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,960
general public is how much of a

1041
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:46,019
contribution The Grateful Dead played to

1042
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,179
cannabis over the past 40 years

1043
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:50,159
oh yeah a Shakedown Street you could get

1044
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:52,199
every anything you wanted on Shakedown

1045
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,019
Street and

1046
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:57,899
um a lot of people you know my Alias

1047
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:00,420
Jaime Chiba a lot of people knew my

1048
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,260
Alias as that crazy guy that's looking

1049
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,300
for seeds and is willing to pay so I got

1050
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,500
scammed a lot but I got some great

1051
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,619
genetics uh on Shakedown Street too

1052
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,318
that's great I love it so if we link

1053
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:18,420
back to sort of some of the details of

1054
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,940
the answers you've given already you

1055
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,519
talk about how you've had quite decent

1056
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,740
plant numbers in terms of your when

1057
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,599
you're creating seed but I know at the

1058
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:30,719
same time you're not exactly operating

1059
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,539
on scale so it's sort of like you've got

1060
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,578
a relatively small to medium scale setup

1061
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,559
but lots of plant numbers in there right

1062
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,940
how do you how do you find it is

1063
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,980
navigating that because I think for a

1064
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,720
lot of people they get quite scared by

1065
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,219
the idea of how many plants you have in

1066
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,059
that space

1067
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:50,759
right well I I was uh pretty lucky on on

1068
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,619
having remote property and then people

1069
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,460
that were interested in making their

1070
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,180
living

1071
00:44:53,460 --> 00:45:00,240
by selling uh unseated weed that we

1072
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:01,739
would grow side by side with with my

1073
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,219
seated plants

1074
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,759
so to enlist those people

1075
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:08,699
um

1076
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,380
to help me with my work which is pretty

1077
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:12,299
extensive when you're growing 1200

1078
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,420
plants on your own it's almost

1079
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:18,000
impossible uh to get two or three people

1080
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:22,019
to help me with that work uh during the

1081
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,260
summer season was a godsend so

1082
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:28,259
um I I had some remote cabins and a

1083
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:31,920
large Lodge to work in and pretty much

1084
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,900
uh so so remote that uh we never hardly

1085
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,900
ever saw anybody there uh Canadian

1086
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,139
miners would stop by every once in a

1087
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,180
while and uh uh I was amazed at how

1088
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:45,539
close Mount they were about everything

1089
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:48,419
and uh non-judgmental uh you know a

1090
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:50,400
bottle of whiskey bought a mile of uh

1091
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,639
zepper on their on their Mouse you know

1092
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,519
so uh or or just having cigarettes

1093
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,960
around or you know it was uh you know

1094
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,539
somebody wasn't in the pot they were

1095
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,460
always into something else so they they

1096
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:05,838
pretty much kept quiet about things and

1097
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,159
we we only had uh real trouble one time

1098
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,420
that I can remember in all those years

1099
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,078
so

1100
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,400
yeah it's it it's not easy to do

1101
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,720
anything

1102
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:22,680
outside of of your own home

1103
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,419
large scale and as far as breeding I I

1104
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,598
wouldn't recommend you know unless you

1105
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:30,240
have large outbuildings and you can do

1106
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,119
isolation work and you can isolate your

1107
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,039
mails you can isolate clones that you

1108
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,800
might bring in from someone else to work

1109
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,699
with that genetic material unless you

1110
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:45,000
have specific build-outs uh

1111
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:47,939
rooms to separate separate and segregate

1112
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,079
uh your plants and your plant stock and

1113
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,059
your strains

1114
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,539
then you're doing yourself and everyone

1115
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:57,599
else a disservice by trying to breed

1116
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:59,880
under those circumstances so like I said

1117
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,480
I got lucky but there were people

1118
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,099
profiting off what I did I just I wasn't

1119
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,519
interested in that and no one could

1120
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:10,800
understand uh my preoccupational seeds

1121
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:13,920
even myself probably

1122
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,680
um I would I would compare myself to a

1123
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,559
crazy collector that you might see on uh

1124
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:22,500
on one of those television programs that

1125
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,858
these guys go through the some a hoarder

1126
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,358
you know yeah yeah yeah yeah but in my

1127
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:28,858
instance they're walking through all

1128
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,818
these plants going

1129
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:36,299
why is all your weed seated are you nuts

1130
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:39,960
so I mean I got that for years for most

1131
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:41,400
of my life so uh the transition to all

1132
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,980
of a sudden people are interested in

1133
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,740
things like Acapulco Gold and Panama Red

1134
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,719
I'm like have you even tried it I mean

1135
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:52,259
it looked like skanky weed back in the

1136
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:55,019
day it's uh you know bunk compared to to

1137
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,640
what you think of as great weed you're

1138
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:58,739
showing me you're telling me there's a

1139
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:02,639
lot of weed snobs where I live right

1140
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:05,338
here in in in Alaska and I might have

1141
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:08,400
created that problem because over the

1142
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:09,960
years they've they've had access to some

1143
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,920
things that people will never see in a

1144
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,159
lifetime

1145
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,858
so to be able to smoke that kind of weed

1146
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,838
uh you know generates a certain type of

1147
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:21,559
of person over time

1148
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:25,739
I can't apologize for it either

1149
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:27,480
I envy those people gosh I I so it's

1150
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,219
some weird parallels there you got me

1151
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,159
thinking about my brother who's like

1152
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,899
only a very casual weed smoker and I try

1153
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,759
to explain to him I'm like dude do you

1154
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,160
understand like the [ __ ] I'm giving you

1155
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,720
like no one gets can try this like

1156
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,338
exactly

1157
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:43,799
exactly

1158
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,539
that's cool okay so it sounds like

1159
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,940
you're quite a fan of open pollinating

1160
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:49,858
is that the primary method in which you

1161
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,780
choose to breed and is there any degree

1162
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:54,000
of sort of selection around the males or

1163
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:57,300
it's just like everything stays and does

1164
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,119
its thing no one uh only when I'm doing

1165
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,700
ibls does that happen

1166
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,220
um when I'm breathing I breed and if I'm

1167
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:07,799
going to bring something on F5 uh I'll

1168
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:10,259
back cross it a couple of times

1169
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,960
um I'm sure I'm looking for traits

1170
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,060
um I'm looking for recessive traits I'm

1171
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,460
looking for traits that that I want to

1172
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:20,699
keep in the plant and

1173
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,920
um to do that uh that selection I keep

1174
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:25,679
away from everybody else at you know

1175
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,720
especially when I was uh having people

1176
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,299
growing commercial weed right alongside

1177
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:33,118
what I'm trying to do they knew certain

1178
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:35,220
rooms are off limits to them because I

1179
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,680
didn't want an introduction of of a

1180
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:40,439
pollen from a mail room I didn't want to

1181
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:42,539
have uh you know cross pollination I

1182
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,220
didn't want to have any any any kind of

1183
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:45,119
issues so

1184
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:47,279
um

1185
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,338
I you know I've been called an [ __ ]

1186
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,640
more than once over over my protocols

1187
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:58,318
with uh with having people grow for me

1188
00:49:53,639 --> 00:50:00,420
and and uh and you know uh had quite a

1189
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,460
few people quit you know saying you know

1190
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,460
just way too strict I had to loosen up

1191
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,400
and smoke more of what I'm growing and

1192
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:11,338
um but uh to to do it right

1193
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:15,119
and to to to keep it

1194
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:17,219
um for the future I mean the future for

1195
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,838
me is now just making sure that it goes

1196
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:21,719
to

1197
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:23,400
um family and and friends that a lot of

1198
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,858
these things can be carried on and

1199
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,000
shared with everybody else

1200
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:33,358
um but yeah I don't have the uh the

1201
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,039
health and uh and Longevity

1202
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,920
um no one lives forever

1203
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:41,219
and I've been pushing the limits

1204
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,858
um you know to keep keep these things in

1205
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:45,719
a in a box would be a crime and I've

1206
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:46,920
always said that you know everybody says

1207
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,500
what are you going to do with all those

1208
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,720
damn seeds you know you've got you know

1209
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,099
for a long time I used to feed old seeds

1210
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,219
to chickens

1211
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:58,740
and uh yeah then one friend talked me

1212
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,779
out of it and he started a seed uh a

1213
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:02,879
seed bank and a business out of it and I

1214
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:05,720
go well maybe I just ought to hang on to

1215
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,720
those old seeds

1216
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,460
oh yeah there's a reason why you thought

1217
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,780
you shouldn't give them to the chickens

1218
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:16,260
that's interesting that's interesting

1219
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:19,140
okay so are there any specific sort of

1220
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,359
traits or what you might consider to be

1221
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:23,219
like telltale signs that you look for in

1222
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,039
a male that you think oh that's like

1223
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:29,219
usually a sign of a good male

1224
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:31,259
you know I I've tried to tell every I've

1225
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:33,719
I've mentored a lot of different Growers

1226
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,160
uh some of them are on Instagram some of

1227
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,098
them uh

1228
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,440
um personally here at home and uh the

1229
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:44,760
first thing I look for in a Seedling

1230
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:46,800
when it pops up is that it develops like

1231
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,460
trichome hairs on it

1232
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,099
or it doesn't so a shiny leaf usually

1233
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,900
that phenol all eliminate it right away

1234
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:57,838
I'll start out with us a thousand

1235
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,780
seedlings and pretty quickly get down to

1236
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,179
a hundred the same thing goes with the

1237
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,780
mail when I start turning a mail I'm

1238
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:09,779
looking for it to actually produce its

1239
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:12,300
trichomes early and have a resinous

1240
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,059
coating on the stock itself

1241
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:18,180
uh so a lot of a lot of people have said

1242
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,339
well your weed gets me I don't want to

1243
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:22,679
go to The Dispensary because your weed

1244
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:24,719
gets me stolen more than you know and

1245
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,639
even though it's seated than than

1246
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,939
anything at the dispenser I'm like well

1247
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:33,299
if we don't support these people then

1248
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,980
we're gonna lose legalization so

1249
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,260
um you know I can still give you stuff

1250
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:40,139
but not in the not in the amounts that I

1251
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:44,700
have before and and please support those

1252
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:47,879
people I'm doing this to breed uh not

1253
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:48,960
not to not to sell specifically

1254
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,000
um

1255
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,880
yeah it's hard to explain I sound like a

1256
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,219
crazy person to myself now

1257
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,140
no no no no you're on the money and I

1258
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:00,719
think we are really congruent in a lot

1259
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:03,118
of our beliefs I'd love to ask you you

1260
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,039
sort of without directly touching on it

1261
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,140
did reference some of the problems with

1262
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,818
the dispensaries not just the quality of

1263
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:11,219
the dispensaries which is a problem

1264
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:14,699
sometimes but more importantly that

1265
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:17,159
there seems to be a lack of consumer

1266
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:18,779
education occurring at the dispensaries

1267
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,118
and we're in this position now where

1268
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,280
someone walks into a dispensary and they

1269
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,960
just say what's got the highest THC

1270
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,180
percentage like that's sort of where

1271
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,639
we're at exactly how how do you think we

1272
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:31,980
can help move past this and help educate

1273
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:34,199
the Casual consumer who in all honesty

1274
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,019
is probably never going to want to learn

1275
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,639
too much about you know the Genesis of

1276
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,800
chemdog or whatever you know they just

1277
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,019
want to get high but how do we reach

1278
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,720
that sort of customer and help keep the

1279
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:48,239
legalization fight alive

1280
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:50,039
I think with what you're doing and I

1281
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:53,039
really believe in it

1282
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:54,960
um and with uh a really good book we

1283
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,480
need a book out there it's as simple as

1284
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,059
possible I mean just as simple as it can

1285
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,338
possibly be with the best tips on

1286
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:05,220
growing the best possible weed and the

1287
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:07,739
best possible weed starts with the best

1288
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:10,739
possible genetics you can get your hands

1289
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:14,699
on and seeds that are viable

1290
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:16,858
so like I said before my model to

1291
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:20,399
everybody has always been since day one

1292
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:24,480
since I started moving uh genetics

1293
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,900
moving seeds was if in doubt grow it out

1294
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,900
if if you have any doubt about uh my

1295
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:33,960
strains or or or what I'm trying to

1296
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,539
preserve just grow it out and then you

1297
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,400
can give me feedback on on what you're

1298
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,338
finding but don't [ __ ] before you've

1299
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,139
grown it out don't buy into the

1300
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:45,480
anti-hype

1301
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:49,199
um what what also needs to happen is

1302
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,719
this needs to become a more positive in

1303
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,480
my I know I don't live in rainbows and

1304
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:57,419
fairy tales but it needs to be more of a

1305
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,800
positive Community where we're aiding

1306
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,240
each other

1307
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,300
um you know kind of the reason I'm doing

1308
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,919
the podcast we're teaching the younger

1309
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,619
generation hey you don't have as many

1310
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,400
roadblocks or hurdles to go through so

1311
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:13,380
concentrate on teaching people about the

1312
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,619
benefits of cannabis

1313
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:19,440
and the benefits of growing your own and

1314
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:22,740
the benefits of growing the best you can

1315
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,420
possibly grow turn it into a competent

1316
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:28,019
like I always believe in competitive

1317
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:30,659
Sports very highly competitive person

1318
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:33,059
um turn it into a competitive sport you

1319
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:35,460
know who can who can outgrow their their

1320
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:37,380
friends and using what genetics

1321
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,079
things like that

1322
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,220
um got us to where we're at today and

1323
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,980
the hippies

1324
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:46,980
they were they were a huge part in it

1325
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,599
you know that that whole subculture

1326
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,818
um God bless them you know if they

1327
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,740
hadn't kept it alive it would have

1328
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:56,579
disappeared and there was a lot of

1329
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:58,739
obstacles in the way Lots

1330
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:00,660
yeah hugely I can say that from my

1331
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:03,179
perspective when I talk to people like

1332
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:04,739
can certainly identify in my own Journey

1333
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:07,139
that it feels as though it's been

1334
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:09,659
certainly a lot easier than many of the

1335
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:12,420
stories I hear from guests I just wanted

1336
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:15,480
to quickly loop back one moment to the

1337
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,400
rks because I think a sentiment that I

1338
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,639
hear really commonly in the community is

1339
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,400
people keep saying look if if the rks

1340
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,259
really existed it would be out we'd all

1341
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,180
be sharing the Clone and like that would

1342
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,920
be the end of it it's sort of I guess

1343
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:31,139
the gist of it is like if it exists it

1344
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,539
would have been found what's your

1345
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:37,259
thoughts to that sentiment

1346
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:41,759
well I don't I don't particularly know

1347
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:44,400
that my roadkill skunk that I you know

1348
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,260
inherited from someone else they've

1349
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,920
passed on to

1350
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,740
um

1351
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:53,159
I don't know if it's what people were

1352
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:56,219
trying somewhere else I personally can't

1353
00:56:53,159 --> 00:57:00,118
remember a smell or taste

1354
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:02,818
from a week ago maybe yesterday I could

1355
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:07,318
remember a smell or taste specifically

1356
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:09,960
but uh a week ago no so uh all these

1357
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:11,759
years down the road I will tell you that

1358
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,800
it was actively

1359
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,680
um you know supplying people with with

1360
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:20,400
these seeds and with clones up and down

1361
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:22,500
the Pacific up I-5 up and down I-5 the

1362
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,539
Pacific Northwest Corridor especially

1363
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,760
but I'd go all the way to San Diego

1364
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:29,039
because I was trading genetics down

1365
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,020
there years ago too and there was some

1366
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:34,199
awfully good genetics that came out of

1367
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,838
San Diego especially in the 90s

1368
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:38,960
and um you know a lot can be done in

1369
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:42,299
full sun that can't be done

1370
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,960
indoors so you know my hat's off to the

1371
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:50,339
gorilla glow Growers that risk uh fires

1372
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:52,858
uh law enforcement uh feral animals it

1373
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:55,619
was unbelievable uh with somebody in a

1374
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:58,858
almost a desert climate was able to

1375
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:01,440
produce Outdoors just blow me away and

1376
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:05,338
of course I wanted any genetics I could

1377
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,220
I could call from that and um I went out

1378
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:10,318
of my way to find them

1379
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:12,419
yeah I think we have heard in the past

1380
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,239
about some mythical strains coming out

1381
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:16,920
of San Diego so sounds like you're in a

1382
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,618
the right spot at the right time which

1383
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,599
is beautiful to hear I wanted to quickly

1384
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:24,480
follow up um I had seen on your

1385
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:27,420
Instagram that you had crossed what I

1386
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,818
think is an rks male to a few different

1387
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,318
things like doing outcrosses right and I

1388
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:33,179
was interested to hear your thoughts

1389
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:35,219
because obviously you know a lot of

1390
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:36,838
people are keen on the IBL but I'm

1391
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:39,659
interested to hear about the outcrosses

1392
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,759
because they I think outcrossing is the

1393
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:43,798
spice of life to me you know

1394
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,599
um so yeah I noticed specifically you

1395
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:47,338
did a Bubble Kush out cross I'm such a

1396
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,140
big fan of Bubba Kush how did that one

1397
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:51,179
turn out and what sort of things do you

1398
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:56,219
think rks brings to the table when you

1399
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:59,818
do hybridize it well I I select actually

1400
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:02,639
for like I like I did when I when I'm at

1401
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:06,179
it probably about an f13 right now on

1402
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:09,179
what I've worked the rks up to now and

1403
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:12,659
that includes eight back crosses uh

1404
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:14,338
looking for select trades and and it

1405
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:18,179
really is

1406
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:21,719
um it's a complex uh strain to work with

1407
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:24,960
to to find those recessive traits to get

1408
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:27,539
rid of some and to amend others

1409
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,318
um so over time that that was that was

1410
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:31,440
uh

1411
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:34,139
really difficult but I mean I the chem

1412
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,798
the chem dog that I got from tricome

1413
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:40,739
Tech in the 90s there were a couple of

1414
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,420
guys in uh um kind of central Northern

1415
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:44,519
California

1416
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,619
um that had an ad in High Times I got

1417
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:48,719
their chem dog I got quite a few

1418
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:50,579
different strands from them

1419
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:53,578
um you know that I bought online at the

1420
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:57,240
time and uh I heard that they were

1421
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:59,760
really uh finicky like I was uh

1422
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:01,979
um you know just uh

1423
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,839
I don't know you get you get to a point

1424
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:07,199
where other people just think you're a

1425
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,358
mad scientist and you know kind of kind

1426
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,578
of like the Cheech and Chong movie uh

1427
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,519
Nice Dreams where the the guy down in

1428
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:16,619
the pool uh his name was Jimmy and on

1429
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:18,358
that go in there and uh ask him a

1430
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:21,119
question and that's all he'd say was big

1431
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:23,400
buds and uh you kind of get to be that

1432
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,740
guy and that's I I got poked a lot of

1433
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,079
fun at over the years that you know

1434
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:30,000
because I had friends come and you know

1435
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,339
getting weed you know they're just out

1436
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,780
trying to you know score a bag the best

1437
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:36,539
way they could and the best way they

1438
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:39,780
could was hey let's go see if Jim needs

1439
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:42,119
a a hand or you know go out there and uh

1440
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,559
check out his place and if he needs a

1441
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:47,039
hand with something maybe we could score

1442
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:50,700
some weed and um

1443
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:52,920
the the back crosses have been

1444
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:54,779
probably like you say some of the most

1445
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,440
interesting things that I've I've done

1446
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:01,200
for a while I didn't know uh that the

1447
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:03,260
roadkill had that potential now I've

1448
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:05,879
already gotten back from several people

1449
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,859
uh seeds

1450
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,160
um with their their crosses with

1451
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:13,440
roadkill uh one comes to mind uh a

1452
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:15,719
blueberry that I recently received from

1453
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,579
somebody and and I popped and they're

1454
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:20,818
they're going uh I could give you the

1455
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:23,339
results at a later date but

1456
01:01:20,818 --> 01:01:27,420
um everything I've crossed it with uh

1457
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:30,779
turns out to be a better plan but it

1458
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:33,180
retains a lot of uh the roadkill uh

1459
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:36,298
skunk sent to it

1460
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:40,318
so even throwing it in into skunk number

1461
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:43,139
one uh I've I've got uh skunk number one

1462
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:45,779
and super skunk I threw it into that

1463
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:48,420
I've got Nirvana Super Skunk I threw it

1464
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:50,819
into that all they did was accentuate

1465
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,818
that skunk and make it stronger with

1466
01:01:50,818 --> 01:01:56,460
with uh when I'm using the males now

1467
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:58,619
when you're using the females

1468
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,440
and you're Crossing to a male of a

1469
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:03,780
different uh parentage

1470
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,740
um you're you're uh finding that it's

1471
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:09,298
not as heavy on the skunk side

1472
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:10,919
so

1473
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:13,259
um you're not you're not getting those

1474
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:16,858
Terps coming through as heavy as if if

1475
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,020
you used uh the male roadkill skunk

1476
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:22,078
as a parent

1477
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:24,719
if that makes any sense uh I'm trying to

1478
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,200
keep them as F ones but I've sent them

1479
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:30,959
out uh to testers uh four corners of

1480
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:33,419
this nation uh use a tester a friend of

1481
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,059
mine in Maine who's been working with me

1482
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:38,298
for years A friend of mine in Florida

1483
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:40,440
same thing friend of mine in San Diego

1484
01:02:38,298 --> 01:02:42,420
and a friend of mine in Seattle

1485
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,798
Washington I also have a friend in

1486
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,079
Canada

1487
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:49,440
um that's uh been running a lot of my

1488
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:52,680
stuff and I take everything they give me

1489
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:57,900
and try and improve upon it but the f1s

1490
01:02:52,679 --> 01:03:00,298
are saying of the roadkill skunk by um

1491
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,400
uh different crosses I can give you a

1492
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:04,139
list of some of the crosses I recently

1493
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,220
did

1494
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:10,980
and uh they came out phenomenal

1495
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:13,858
but I'm I guess I'm never happy

1496
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,440
that's the problem about uh being a

1497
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:19,500
breeder and having the original uh

1498
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:22,440
genetics to work with you're never happy

1499
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,179
with what somebody else says oh this is

1500
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,400
great because you see something that

1501
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:28,500
that no one else does because you've

1502
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,579
worked with that particular plant for so

1503
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:34,380
long yeah look a true perfectionist uh

1504
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:37,039
yeah to a point that it really irritates

1505
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:40,559
a lot of people

1506
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:43,079
I can't I can't apologize uh for it

1507
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:47,160
because it's taken me to hear

1508
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:48,539
um but as far as as far as a breeders

1509
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:51,539
using

1510
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:54,779
um our genetics I

1511
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:56,699
I just uh like with Todd's situation I

1512
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,339
really respect Todd

1513
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,739
um you know and and I like what he's

1514
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:04,920
doing and trying to preserve the seeds

1515
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:07,739
but I honestly think it's in his best

1516
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:10,440
interest to send things out to tests

1517
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:14,219
uh because he'll he'll grow more as a

1518
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,019
breeder and if he learns to take other

1519
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:19,679
people's uh

1520
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:22,440
um objective criticism and and wherever

1521
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,539
they're at and they're uh they're uh

1522
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,858
growing and then they might not even be

1523
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:28,679
as uh

1524
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:30,480
as competent a grower as taught is but

1525
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,639
they they might be better at breeding

1526
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,219
and finding recessive traits and things

1527
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:38,578
that that he's just not looking for

1528
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:41,219
certainly so um yeah

1529
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,839
the the Bubba Kush that you mentioned I

1530
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:46,858
got from

1531
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:48,539
uh a breeder and um

1532
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:49,858
he's in the southern part of Washington

1533
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:53,039
State

1534
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:55,679
really well known I met him on a on a

1535
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,779
seed trip I was in this group and

1536
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:00,298
Facebook it's you know that was my

1537
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,540
introduction to this uh another crackpot

1538
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:06,000
guy named Preston White uh started a

1539
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:08,460
seed group and a lot of people I know to

1540
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,119
this day on Instagram

1541
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:14,699
um and their their prolific breeders now

1542
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,740
they started out uh trading genetics and

1543
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:19,259
I that's all I did was just trade

1544
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:20,399
genetics try and get some of this stuff

1545
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,960
out there

1546
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,660
um that I I thought was just gonna

1547
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,699
disappear otherwise but they were really

1548
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:29,639
interested in it and they were really

1549
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:32,639
interested in Crossing using using those

1550
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:34,318
strains to cross with uh a friend of

1551
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:35,759
mine in Michigan

1552
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,940
um

1553
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:42,599
he's a good guy he uh

1554
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:45,000
he's got a company called 517. he has

1555
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,039
used a lot of these uh these older

1556
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,920
strains and crossed them the newer stuff

1557
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,838
some of the hype stuff that I I'm not

1558
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,838
familiar with and I I don't have the

1559
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:57,119
wherewithal to uh to preserve them

1560
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,798
because I've got so much in my library

1561
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,940
as it is

1562
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,460
so

1563
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:05,039
um uh on your Instagram page I saw that

1564
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,740
there was Mac Crossroad kill skunk is

1565
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,440
this where that project came from you

1566
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:14,459
know yeah that that was you know this is

1567
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:16,559
a recent project too the Mac uh really

1568
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:19,380
kind of blew me away because it doesn't

1569
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,319
accept pollen very well

1570
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,358
yeah yeah I think actually funny you

1571
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:27,239
mentioned that just a few days ago some

1572
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:30,659
studies came out showing that Mac is one

1573
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:33,000
of the few true polyploidy plants out

1574
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,338
there so it's effectively as you said

1575
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,440
yeah incapable I mean obviously you can

1576
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:38,880
make crosses with if you really force it

1577
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,338
but generally speaking as you said

1578
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,380
doesn't want to take pollen oh yeah a

1579
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:47,038
lot of tri-folate on it

1580
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:50,160
um on on the Mac and uh to get it the

1581
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,559
polynoid I had to use six different I

1582
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:54,779
finally found the right mail that it

1583
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,839
would accept pollen from Wow from The

1584
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:00,780
Arc rks and uh yeah I'm currently

1585
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:04,619
working on that uh trying to trying to

1586
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:06,019
get it to be more stable uh but the

1587
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:08,579
results are

1588
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:12,019
alarmingly great

1589
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:14,760
um the reports last summer from the the

1590
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:18,239
f1s that that I sent out

1591
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,319
uh were just great and and and I thought

1592
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:21,719
so too

1593
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:25,079
um when I grew it out unseated I'm like

1594
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:27,239
oh wow this is this is really good stuff

1595
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:30,298
um I don't want to take somebody's

1596
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:32,399
genetics without their authorization and

1597
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:35,280
and release it to anybody so I didn't

1598
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,318
and I've I've kind of you know until I

1599
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,319
run into that fellow with the fake beard

1600
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:43,440
at uh the emerald cup again or one of

1601
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,298
the shows then uh then I I would I

1602
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,760
wouldn't even uh think about releasing

1603
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:50,099
it unless I got his approval and I'd

1604
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,799
make sure he got seed stock first

1605
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:54,539
I think Cap's a pretty reasonable guy

1606
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,599
and he would probably take you up on

1607
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:59,819
that offer yeah I I don't know him but

1608
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,980
I'm just saying you know

1609
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:03,960
um that's what I do you know I just I

1610
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,818
preserve stuff and then I then I work

1611
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,460
with stuff that I really like but I was

1612
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:12,538
still really surprised that

1613
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:16,380
um some of my more resilient uh male uh

1614
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:20,119
donors for uh pollen were not accepted

1615
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:24,420
by this uh caps cut that I I

1616
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:27,838
sourced and um you know I was just blown

1617
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:30,298
away by its production by not seeding it

1618
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:33,960
so I thought this is one that I'm gonna

1619
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:36,778
I'm gonna go ahead and and push forward

1620
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:40,859
um another friend of mine Antonio Diaz

1621
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:43,140
great guy met him on this uh group uh

1622
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:44,940
the seed Trading Group uh that Preston

1623
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:49,020
White uh started

1624
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:51,479
he uh created a a strain called lamula

1625
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:54,440
and it was just out of this world so I

1626
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:58,139
had to to add the roadkill skunk to that

1627
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:00,000
and uh trying to dial that in right now

1628
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:02,759
the f1s

1629
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,460
they're just producing mad but the

1630
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:08,279
yields are really low on it and it was

1631
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,500
more of a decently plant had the real

1632
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:15,179
strong diesel turps but you add that to

1633
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:18,420
rks and uh honestly Rogue kill skunk

1634
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:20,640
just pales in comparison as to the skunk

1635
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,920
Terps that are thrown out there from

1636
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,100
that added diesel

1637
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:29,759
wow okay so that could be the real combo

1638
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:31,500
is like a real Fury gassy in combo with

1639
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,679
the rks

1640
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,259
right I hadn't you know I did uh I took

1641
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:40,140
uh Selma's New York City uh Diesel and I

1642
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:42,600
crossed it to roadkill skunk and that

1643
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:45,480
also produced some awesome f1s that I

1644
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:48,838
that I recently released

1645
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:50,338
um just uh just blew me away that um

1646
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:54,119
that diesel

1647
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:56,159
uh was actually a fuel for the the skunk

1648
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:57,539
Terps you know it just kicked it up a

1649
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,599
notch

1650
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:03,539
um even more than uh where I've gotten

1651
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:06,239
my f-13 roadkill skunk I'm like well

1652
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:09,179
this this stinks heavier I mean it's a

1653
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:12,299
it lingers in the room yeah I mean if

1654
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:14,640
you wipe the walls you're you're getting

1655
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:17,880
that perspiration from the plant

1656
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,500
and you go outside and it stinks to high

1657
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,239
heaven

1658
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,039
so

1659
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:25,799
that's really interesting to hear

1660
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:28,439
because I could see that you have worked

1661
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,140
with some other modern genetics in the

1662
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:34,379
past specifically uh the driving rain

1663
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:36,000
which uses Sunset sherbet Bruce Banner

1664
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:37,980
purple Afghani

1665
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,319
it sort of made me wonder was there

1666
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,238
anything specifically that stimulated

1667
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,679
you to think you know what I'm gonna do

1668
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,559
a cross with some more modern stuff

1669
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,359
because I think largely it's

1670
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,300
um probably one of the only crosses you

1671
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:53,698
offer that doesn't have quite a uh

1672
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,619
what's the word um a provenance to it

1673
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:57,479
you know like a very long established

1674
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:59,640
sort of History was there anything that

1675
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:03,119
stimulated you to do that one

1676
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:06,300
uh you know a friend of mine wanted a

1677
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:10,979
sherbert so I went in search of sherbert

1678
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:13,860
I got my hands on uh uh my son a sunset

1679
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:17,158
Sherbert uh cuttings

1680
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:19,319
in Fremont Washington at the uh High

1681
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:23,698
Times uh Cannabis Cup

1682
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:25,019
and um guy over there with Adam and you

1683
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:26,399
know he said yeah this is a great

1684
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,159
Sherbert but it's not the original

1685
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:31,619
Sherbert you gotta you gotta try this

1686
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:34,379
it's called Sunset Sherbert from this

1687
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:37,439
dude I'll call sherbinsky and I said

1688
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:39,900
well cool man and uh yeah I'll buy some

1689
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:42,059
clones from you and and I I brought them

1690
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:45,899
home and

1691
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:49,140
um you know that cross is epic up here

1692
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:52,079
uh driving ran is probably

1693
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:54,840
one of the most surprising

1694
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:58,039
I would say killer crosses that I've

1695
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:01,460
ever created uh it's a beautiful plant

1696
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:05,158
uh the terpenes are are across the map

1697
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:07,739
uh the stone I think because of dark

1698
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:10,019
horses genetics in there the Bruce

1699
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:12,539
Banner number three that I used

1700
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:15,060
it was it was a bomber

1701
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:18,479
um yeah I wasn't into Paulie's and I

1702
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:21,120
wanted to try my hand at uh poly hybrids

1703
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:23,579
because uh my belief and and a lot of

1704
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:26,939
others beliefs was if you use any more

1705
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:29,960
than uh one indica or one sativa or two

1706
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:35,460
sativas or two indicas as a hybrid

1707
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:37,340
you're you're gonna breed out resiliency

1708
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:40,020
um some of the uh

1709
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:43,020
environmental factors that are that are

1710
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:44,880
a strong genetic plant brings to the

1711
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:48,360
table or a land race something that's

1712
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,980
been grown by people for Generations as

1713
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:53,759
food or medicine

1714
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:56,339
and uh once you breed out of that then

1715
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,699
you're gonna lose uh some of uh the

1716
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:01,619
stability of the plan itself here that

1717
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:02,698
that particular cross is one of my

1718
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:05,579
favorites

1719
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:08,698
as far as what it's done to help people

1720
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:11,519
medicinally I mean I know personally two

1721
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:15,119
cancer survivors here that grew it out

1722
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,040
and and it's had wonderful results

1723
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:19,800
for them locally

1724
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:22,380
uh and and they swear by it and they

1725
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,539
keep you know growing that particular

1726
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:27,319
strain

1727
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:31,198
um so you know as far as what it's done

1728
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:34,198
and it out produced my wildest imagining

1729
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,819
on on poly hybrids and it kind of

1730
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:37,979
changed my mind

1731
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:40,198
on uh poly hybrids because that

1732
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:43,379
particular plant even though it's more

1733
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:46,198
sativa leaning outside our growing

1734
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:48,480
season ends in October it'll finish

1735
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:51,719
before October outside up here even a

1736
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:54,599
rainy environment with no uh powdery

1737
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,380
mildew so the strains that I used in

1738
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,560
there

1739
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:01,920
seem to retain their strength and vigor

1740
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,980
and pass on uh some of their ability

1741
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,980
with the environmental stresses

1742
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:10,198
to uh stand the test of time so it's

1743
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:11,399
strange for me yeah it's funny you bring

1744
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:13,738
that up because I don't I don't really

1745
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:15,539
advertise it that much because uh it's

1746
01:14:13,738 --> 01:14:18,299
been so great locally

1747
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:19,380
I should have made more uh more f1s of

1748
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:22,020
that

1749
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,060
it looks like a killer on paper it sort

1750
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,560
of caught my eye so I thought yeah that

1751
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,500
that seems like a good one to talk about

1752
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,140
out of curiosity was there any specific

1753
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:33,119
reason you thought that purple Afghani

1754
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,980
would pair well with that sort of more

1755
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,079
modern combo

1756
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:39,059
to tell you the honest truth that purple

1757
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:41,340
Afghani is one of the first that I

1758
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:46,199
personally sourced

1759
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:47,880
um in Afghanistan myself wow um yeah I

1760
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:51,178
almost got in trouble for that uh

1761
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,400
particular plant but uh I happened to

1762
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:56,579
glean this the seeds off the plant and

1763
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:59,819
uh and uh tell a few fibs to get myself

1764
01:14:56,579 --> 01:15:02,760
back to where I had to be and uh back to

1765
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:06,238
the states with them so um yeah that

1766
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,300
that Afghani has thrown a uh

1767
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,879
a blue tint

1768
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:14,640
into everything that I've grown

1769
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:17,699
um and bread with bread towards certain

1770
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,239
things it I bread a blueberry years and

1771
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:23,579
years ago here 40 years ago

1772
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:25,979
uh we have a blueberry festival here so

1773
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:28,859
somebody was like Hey man wanna why

1774
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:30,599
don't you have a blueberry pot I said

1775
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:33,658
well you know I'll work that's a good

1776
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,340
idea I'll work towards that and um that

1777
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:38,339
was one of the things I used but you cut

1778
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:40,260
the plant uh some uh sorry if I'm

1779
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:43,920
rambling on but some Colombians and

1780
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:46,440
Mexicans will bleed a red

1781
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:49,500
well this purple Afghani bleeds purple

1782
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:51,419
and it was stained anything I mean it

1783
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:54,779
actually stains the blood from that

1784
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:57,899
plant will stain uh clothing fabric

1785
01:15:54,779 --> 01:16:00,899
paper linen

1786
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:04,079
um but as far as a breeding stock it

1787
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:05,939
brings a blue beautiful lavender tint to

1788
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,399
anything I put into it and that's what I

1789
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:10,738
was trying to bring out when I added it

1790
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:13,679
in with that uh Sunset Sherbert because

1791
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:17,218
it already had that lilt already it had

1792
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:19,260
that uh lavender vibrancy but I didn't

1793
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:22,500
think it was deep enough so I added that

1794
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:25,500
and uh that brought it up a notch and

1795
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,819
the Bruce Banner uh to be quite honest

1796
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,738
with you a lot of my strains were

1797
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,979
medicinal for people here

1798
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:34,139
and uh um I told a local dispensary

1799
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:36,839
owner that I was adding this Bruce

1800
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:40,260
Banner I added to Green Crack and that's

1801
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:43,260
just been a stellar Stellar Stellar uh

1802
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:46,020
plant uh both uh they sell it uh

1803
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:48,060
commercially in their dispensary got the

1804
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:51,600
seeds from me and have been growing it

1805
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:53,820
out and a skunk by Bruce Banner has been

1806
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,219
available locally here too and it's been

1807
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:59,639
a knockout success

1808
01:16:56,219 --> 01:17:01,500
uh so I wanted to increase people get to

1809
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,000
a certain point where pot doesn't get

1810
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,698
them stoned anymore

1811
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,679
and if they're using it for medicine if

1812
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:09,479
it's not getting them stoned they begin

1813
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,819
to look for something else and they they

1814
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:13,439
said you know I love these strains can

1815
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:15,599
you take these strands

1816
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:17,399
and and make them a little stronger

1817
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,100
somehow and I said well

1818
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:23,339
I'll try my best and and I think I know

1819
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:25,860
a strain you know at the time Dark Horse

1820
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,940
um had produced uh you know was fairly

1821
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:29,460
new

1822
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:33,059
the Bruce Banner number three was coming

1823
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:36,300
out as the most stable so I used it and

1824
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:39,600
and uh it actually increased the THC

1825
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:41,279
level where people were just uh going

1826
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,300
nuts over you know they wanted to grow

1827
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:45,119
their own

1828
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,880
and that was actually before

1829
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:51,840
um legalization we've been legal in

1830
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:55,440
Alaska since 1975. Raven versus Alaska

1831
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,260
if anybody wants to look it up uh we we

1832
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:00,119
won the rights to legalization uh

1833
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:03,539
different administrations have tried to

1834
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:05,340
to make it legal illegal but Alaska's

1835
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:08,158
Constitution

1836
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:11,039
and that was the key kept it legal in

1837
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:14,460
Alaska since 1975 no matter what the

1838
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:17,760
efforts of prohibitionist was to change

1839
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:19,619
that fact so even uh if you just brought

1840
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,320
that up in court along with the

1841
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:24,779
government having a medicinal patent of

1842
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:27,899
marijuana uh pretty much you want every

1843
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:29,639
court case that you had the uh the nuts

1844
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:31,019
and the and the money to go to court

1845
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,840
with

1846
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:36,360
yeah definitely a definingly unique

1847
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,940
characteristic of Alaska

1848
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:40,979
uh just to sort of follow up on what

1849
01:18:38,939 --> 01:18:44,158
we've been talking about I was curious

1850
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:45,839
are there any modern strains that do

1851
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:48,299
impress you it sounds like largely

1852
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,600
speaking you enjoy the more old world

1853
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:56,100
strains but does anything strike you as

1854
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,140
as special or as unique as maybe say the

1855
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:01,560
Roadkill

1856
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:04,679
you know the roadkill is

1857
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:07,320
it's just a special strain period

1858
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:10,260
um it it takes you back it makes it it's

1859
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:12,960
basically a time traveling strain what I

1860
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:15,239
call several these strains because the

1861
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,000
unique effect is to bring you back to

1862
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:20,218
that time and place where you're drive

1863
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,279
driving down the road listening to BTO

1864
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:26,399
taking care of business and uh you were

1865
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:28,738
all that back in in the day again uh

1866
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:31,139
except you know in actuality you're an

1867
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:33,599
old fat man and you're cruising down the

1868
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:36,840
road in an old truck so

1869
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:40,079
um yeah for for those those specific

1870
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,880
things that I look for

1871
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,219
um I'm not looking for a time travel

1872
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:47,760
weed I'm I'm looking for

1873
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:51,600
a spatial weed that that takes you out

1874
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,880
there and then lets you down uh fairly

1875
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:57,120
easy towards the end of the day so I'm

1876
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:59,219
I'm I'm really uh working with sativas a

1877
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,460
lot right now from uh Colombia and

1878
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:04,380
Mexico uh trying to find that one

1879
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:06,960
specific hybrid

1880
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:10,679
uh that'll do that again

1881
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,399
I used to have in my stable a couple and

1882
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:14,699
um

1883
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:16,859
Punta Rojo comes to mind that that we're

1884
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:19,799
an all-day Stone you know pretty much

1885
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:21,960
you know you the fabled three hour high

1886
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,480
that you could you know kick around town

1887
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:27,480
and do everything you wanted to do but

1888
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:30,718
still be uh uh high with a with a

1889
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:33,419
positive outlook so anything that does

1890
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:36,260
that for me and somebody turns me on to

1891
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:39,480
it I'm investigating I start to

1892
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:41,340
disseminate it take it apart uh figure

1893
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:44,339
out how it grows

1894
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,840
um somebody tells me about a specific

1895
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,880
Stone like that

1896
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,539
that's what I'm after

1897
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,800
um

1898
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:54,359
personally and for people that

1899
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:58,199
medicinally and that's how I got in I

1900
01:20:54,359 --> 01:21:02,099
lost two wives to cancer and and those

1901
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:05,579
strains when I was growing them out that

1902
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:09,179
helped them to uplift them to uh give

1903
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:12,600
them a normal day without opiates uh to

1904
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:16,260
help raise my children uh to bring a

1905
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:19,140
level of Happiness to them uh in you

1906
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:21,300
know in the process of death

1907
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:23,460
that you know there's no higher calling

1908
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:27,659
for cannabis in my opinion in my

1909
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:30,960
personal opinion and in my uh experience

1910
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:33,658
with it I mean I had I had police in

1911
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,219
Washington state come to my house ready

1912
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:37,859
to kick down the door because somebody

1913
01:21:35,219 --> 01:21:39,420
reported you know smelling a grow at

1914
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:42,359
this house and

1915
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:45,179
I I was in the in the yard in handcuffs

1916
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:47,880
my wife was upstairs and she'd lost all

1917
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:52,079
her hair from chemo

1918
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:54,300
and uh I told them I said look officer

1919
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,640

1920
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,800
and take my wife's medicine and I'm

1921
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,239
serious about this she's you know stage

1922
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,640
four

1923
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,139
um you know she's been told that there's

1924
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,420
not much left for her and she's just

1925
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:07,380
trying to be here for our little

1926
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,739
children

1927
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:12,900
so just tread carefully I'll go with you

1928
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:14,639
and tell you anything you want you can

1929
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:17,879

01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:21,119
where my grow is uh downstairs in my

01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,760
garage uh just you know be careful with

1932
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:26,279
what's there and uh be respectful and

1933
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,840
and he went in the house

1934
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:30,179
saw my wife

1935
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,579
talked to my wife tip his hat walked out

1936
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:34,739
came unlocked my cuffs

1937
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:37,500
and this is when it was still super

1938
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:38,519
illegal there was no compassion or

1939
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,380
anything

1940
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,780
he says you know we didn't find anything

1941
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:45,600
in there he said you have a great day

1942
01:22:42,779 --> 01:22:47,939
I'm sorry to have bothered you but I had

1943
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:51,060
to investigate this and I have to fill

1944
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:53,279
out my report now and I'll just say that

1945
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:55,920
there was use going on but I didn't

1946
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:58,559
personally see it

1947
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,359
and that's where it ended and uh to this

1948
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:04,020
day I've never been able to thank that

1949
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:07,198
guy but uh you know that's a kind of

1950
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:09,360
positive stuff that that I like to see

1951
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,158
behind cannabis

1952
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:12,179
um you know what it does to help other

1953
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:14,939
people

1954
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:17,239
is Way Beyond anything that I'm

1955
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:21,139
personally doing I don't have any

1956
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:23,939
aspirations or or you know Financial

1957
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:26,159
aspirations or otherwise I'm just a

1958
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:28,619
crazy old guy that's uh preserved a

1959
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:31,079
bunch of strains and and work with uh

1960
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:34,738
what I can to help other people and to

1961
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:36,719
me I made good money at doing what I did

1962
01:23:34,738 --> 01:23:39,779
for a living as a commercial diver and

1963
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:42,359
uh and a union electrician

1964
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:43,579
that I could support my family just off

1965
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,500
of that

1966
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:48,600
what I what I did otherwise just a crazy

1967
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,279
hobby that no one could really quite

1968
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:54,000
figure out they're like well you don't

1969
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:56,698
sell pot but you help people with seeds

1970
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,560
and you give seeds away and what's all

1971
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,419
that about and I you know I really could

1972
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,760
never tell anybody it's probably the

1973
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:04,800
most I've ever talked about it

1974
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,179
outside of a few friends here that know

1975
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,820
me

1976
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:10,380
oh what a really personal and touching

1977
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:12,500
story you know thank you so much for

1978
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:14,880
sharing that I I think you really hit

1979
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,738
the head of the problem of that

1980
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,199
Community which is yeah sometimes I

1981
01:24:16,738 --> 01:24:21,419
think we lose sight of what the real

1982
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:23,158
utility of this plant is which is to

1983
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:26,158
help us all get through life a little

1984
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:28,859
bit easier if you're willing to discuss

1985
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,719
it are there any strains you have that

1986
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:33,599
if someone listening was a little bit

1987
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,939
unwell themselves you might recommend

1988
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,280
from your catalog that might be what you

1989
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:40,678
feel is particularly medicinal

1990
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:44,158
well because of because of the profile

1991
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:45,779
that's left in it the 1974 mat nuska

1992
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:48,359
[ __ ]

1993
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:52,198
is one of the best because it has a CBD

1994
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:56,639
still in the plant the CBG

1995
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:59,099
um the thcv it hasn't been bred out

1996
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:01,980
um it's been you know as much as I could

1997
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:05,579
kept it as close as possible

1998
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:08,579
the Maui Wowie is at an F-18

1999
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:11,640
um it's it's about it's about as as uh

2000
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:13,019
original as as they come my Concha

2001
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:16,679
Cambodian

2002
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:21,300
uh it's a really good uh Cambodian that

2003
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:25,859
like I said it has the THC and CBD it's

2004
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:30,360
not a really high uh soaring uh like a

2005
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:33,299
tie but it's a heavy enough Stone and uh

2006
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:36,059
I think it's a essential to people's uh

2007
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:40,380
mental well-being it really uh brings uh

2008
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:41,039
about a uh a calming effect uh you know

2009
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:44,420
um

2010
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:48,060
I have a string called uh

2011
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:50,219
fob which is forward operating base I

2012
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,020
created it specifically for people with

2013
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:54,960
PTSD

2014
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:57,659
um you know fellow veterans and and uh

2015
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,739
you know you'd be surprised uh how many

2016
01:25:57,658 --> 01:26:04,500
people have PT PTSD were never veterans

2017
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:07,439
uh but life experiences trauma

2018
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:09,840
um you know uh a range of crimes that

2019
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:12,238
were committed against people

2020
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,119
um just even Growers you know that have

2021
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:17,339
spent years like myself there's only a

2022
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,920
certain amount of crazy people that can

2023
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:21,860
stay locked up in uh little rooms

2024
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,899
growing plants for all these years

2025
01:26:21,859 --> 01:26:27,238
waiting for you know a gun at your back

2026
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:28,559
your head or your door to be kicked in

2027
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:31,559
or

2028
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,659
um you know that that mentality you need

2029
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:37,080
something that is going to help you

2030
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:40,079
every day and uh that's what I created

2031
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:42,539
uh fob for

2032
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:45,899
um I've I've made that available as much

2033
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:47,219
as I can to to anybody that needs it

2034
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:49,859
um

2035
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:51,359
a chocolate tie that I picked up

2036
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:54,059
um years ago

2037
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:56,759
um down in California it's one of those

2038
01:26:54,060 --> 01:27:00,719
uh Thai strains that

2039
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:03,060
um really helps with uh anxiety uh

2040
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,800
mental fatigue a lot of people are are

2041
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:07,739
just worn out it's helped a lot of my

2042
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:11,279
friends uh just recently with everything

2043
01:27:07,738 --> 01:27:13,799
going on from covid lockup to just even

2044
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:16,500
wearing a mask you know they tell me hey

2045
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,420
I have to go out with this damn thing uh

2046
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:21,779
everywhere if I smoke some of that

2047
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:24,000
chocolate Thai I'm cool I don't lose it

2048
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:26,399
I'm not too high I don't have any

2049
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,939
anxiety and I can get done what I need

2050
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:30,500
to get done while wearing that mask

2051
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:32,399
um

2052
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:36,600
Mastodon

2053
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:39,658
um is a very sedative

2054
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:43,079
um Indica plant It's a combination of

2055
01:27:39,658 --> 01:27:45,658
two local strains two Growers that that

2056
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:47,819
I inherited their strands are passed on

2057
01:27:45,658 --> 01:27:52,799
now so I combine them and call them

2058
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:56,279
Mastodon years ago 20 some years ago

2059
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,480
it's it's a beautiful plant uh very

2060
01:27:56,279 --> 01:28:01,139
gassy

2061
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:04,500
but it's a strong sedative painkiller

2062
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:06,900
and it helps with insomnia and sleep

2063
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:10,439
problems

2064
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:12,899
uh the cat piss I got in uh

2065
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:16,439
I originally sourced it

2066
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:19,619
in uh Garberville but I had to go to San

2067
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:22,279
Diego to actually get the cuttings that

2068
01:28:19,619 --> 01:28:26,460
was uh it was owned by a motorcycle club

2069
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:28,079
uh priority uh proprietary uh genetics

2070
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:31,198
they didn't want to really release it

2071
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:33,179
they asked me not to release it in its

2072
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:35,158
uh form but they knew I was breeding

2073
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:37,380
they said we can go ahead and cross it

2074
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:39,179
to whatever you want just leave our name

2075
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:42,060
off of it

2076
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:46,380
um so the the cat piss

2077
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:49,320
has an effect a speedy effect uh pick

2078
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:51,179
you up move you throughout the day uh

2079
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:53,579
get you from point A to point B that's

2080
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:56,639
why it was really popular with uh the

2081
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:58,880
biker culture and uh for something like

2082
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:01,319
that when somebody's trying to recover

2083
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,420
it just uh

2084
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:06,119
over and above any other strain I've

2085
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:09,000
ever seen the cat piss crossed with just

2086
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:10,859
about anything picks people up and

2087
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,020
propels them through the day it's a

2088
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:17,759
really really good

2089
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:20,120
um strand for Recovery in my opinion

2090
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,380
I could I could keep going

2091
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:24,539
what I'm picking up is that you're

2092
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,340
obviously very passionate about old

2093
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:28,920
school lines and I'd be interested to

2094
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:31,139
find out what are some of your absolute

2095
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,179
favorites because something I've picked

2096
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:36,239
up as a sort of recent trend is that

2097
01:29:33,179 --> 01:29:39,480
more and more I feel like there's a

2098
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:43,379
wider appreciation for Mexican lines

2099
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:45,299
Acapulco Gold Punta Rojo even Colombian

2100
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:47,340
you know people really really getting

2101
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:50,100
into these strains yes what are some of

2102
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:53,819
the most memorable lines in your mind I

2103
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:56,820
love Michoacan michoacana's uh you know

2104
01:29:53,819 --> 01:30:01,619
one of those uh uh Mexican strains so

2105
01:29:56,819 --> 01:30:04,139
oaxacan another Mexican strain I have

2106
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:07,460
two different uh

2107
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:11,039
um well Hawkins uh Oaxaca is a large

2108
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:12,600
District kind of like a a state here in

2109
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,460
the United States you know it's a large

2110
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,760
District so

2111
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:21,779
um the oaxacan that I have comes from a

2112
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,880
uh more of a hill mountainous region

2113
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:30,238
part of Oaxaca

2114
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:33,420
um so it it has thcv and uh THC and CBD

2115
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,859
in it has some of its original and and

2116
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:38,179
it um

2117
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:41,339
it retains a lot of its uh

2118
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:42,480
Vigor that it has Outdoors when grown

2119
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:46,679
indoors

2120
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:49,559
and it's not a super long flowering uh

2121
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:51,480
plant for a sativa dominant

2122
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,320
so that oaxacan

2123
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:55,738
um

2124
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:58,799
yeah it's it's been worked a lot but

2125
01:30:55,738 --> 01:31:01,138
probably before I got it probably by you

2126
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,320
know original cartels

2127
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:06,119
um you know basically what built Mexican

2128
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:09,359
drug cartels a lot of people don't know

2129
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:11,119
this was marijuana that you know where

2130
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:15,119
before they got into anything else

2131
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,979
marijuana was the product of Mexico when

2132
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,779
it crossed the border it was degraded

2133
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:21,479
because they pressed it into bricks and

2134
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:23,579
it and it fermented and got mold in it

2135
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:26,638
and there's a whole lot of chemistry

2136
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:29,399
that happened in them bricks uh but if

2137
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:32,579
you could Source the weed like I did

2138
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:35,420
across the border and actually go to

2139
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:37,819
where the Growers were were

2140
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:40,079
growing the plants those Mexican

2141
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:42,719
breeders and Growers were really

2142
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:47,219
knowledgeable and ahead of their time I

2143
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:50,639
mean we got sensimilia seedless weed

2144
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:53,100
from the Mexican people uh back in that

2145
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:55,260
era that I mean if if it hadn't been for

2146
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:58,260
them trying to develop a seedless

2147
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:00,000
product to send across the border

2148
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:02,940
um you know it was just a matter of time

2149
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,520
before people discovered wow we we get

2150
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:09,359
you know a better stone and a heavier

2151
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,620
product if we don't let it seed but you

2152
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:12,899
know you got to give credit where

2153
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:15,719
credits do too with with uh marijuana

2154
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:17,339
and cannabis history the people that

2155
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:20,039
came before us the people that that

2156
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:23,219
really did the work and I'm a huge

2157
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:25,019
believer in putting in the work

2158
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:27,239
so your end product

2159
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:30,239
uh meets or exceeds what people are

2160
01:32:27,238 --> 01:32:32,839
looking for yeah I know it's not a

2161
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:32,839
popular thing

2162
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:39,839
I love that I love that uh one of our

2163
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:42,119
listeners our patreon supporters asks

2164
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:45,000
can you ask if he can expand a little

2165
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:46,559
bit on his creation Big Tuna that stuff

2166
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,779
looks killer

2167
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:55,199
Big Tuna

2168
01:32:48,779 --> 01:32:57,779
um I yeah no Big Tuna I I can't really

2169
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:59,939
it's not my creation

2170
01:32:57,779 --> 01:33:02,460
so I don't want to take credit for it

2171
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:04,919
it's just something I've continued on to

2172
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:06,719
this day and that's a person that uh

2173
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:10,679
that created that strain is recently

2174
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:12,179
deceased so you know I I kind of um hit

2175
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:15,980
on some of that

2176
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:18,899
um just recently with with the relatives

2177
01:33:15,979 --> 01:33:20,339
on on what I could do with that strain

2178
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:22,019
and right now they're just kind of

2179
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,539
they're not talking about a lot of

2180
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:28,500
things and this seemed to be their least

2181
01:33:24,539 --> 01:33:30,658
uh prior priority in life so

2182
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:33,300
um yeah

2183
01:33:30,658 --> 01:33:34,859
sorry not to answer that question it's

2184
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,840
understandable you know more sort of

2185
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:38,639
pressing things on their mind at the

2186
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:41,460
moment so you can appreciate that

2187
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,319
obviously we had another fan submitted

2188
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:45,779
question which I'm actually very curious

2189
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:48,420
about myself they said can you ask Jaime

2190
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:52,099
about the poster he's got that says good

2191
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:52,100
for the head Panama Red

2192
01:33:52,279 --> 01:33:57,179
well you know there's another I don't

2193
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,300
know if you listen to a lot of music but

2194
01:33:57,179 --> 01:34:02,699
there's an old Stoner band uh called

2195
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:04,560
writers of the Purple Sage

2196
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:07,379
um you know Jerry Garcia played in there

2197
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,080
for a while so they had they had a song

2198
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:13,380
called Panama Red and if you listen to

2199
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:15,359
it you'll hear uh similar lyrics to that

2200
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:17,340
in the song

2201
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:20,099
there you go so it's like an old sort of

2202
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:21,900
Jerry throwback well yeah with New

2203
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:23,460
Riders of the Purple Sage

2204
01:34:21,899 --> 01:34:26,339
um you know if I had

2205
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:28,020
the albums almost within arm reach

2206
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:30,360
um you know I

2207
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:32,580
grabbed the album and show you but uh

2208
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:35,099
yeah if you just look up uh new writers

2209
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:38,460
of the Purple Sage uh on the front the

2210
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:41,159
artwork is a cover uh of the album as a

2211
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:45,000
picture of Panama Red himself you know

2212
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:48,539
so it's it's a great old song and that

2213
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,279
uh probably that particular post came

2214
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:53,158
from that

2215
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:54,779
yeah okay that that makes sense

2216
01:34:53,158 --> 01:34:57,420
while I was cruising through all the

2217
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:59,519
strains you offered I I noticed that uh

2218
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:01,859
Alaskan cannabis case sells just a

2219
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,639
straight Afghani and I was curious to

2220
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:04,319
know

2221
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,659
um like what's the origins of this

2222
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:09,238
Afghani is it from Afghani number one or

2223
01:35:06,658 --> 01:35:11,939
something you collected

2224
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:16,379
oh that's that's actually a great story

2225
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:19,019
in itself uh I I went to Innsbruck

2226
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:22,079
uh for the Winter Olympics and I ran

2227
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:25,020
into a hippie couple that was uh had

2228
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:29,158
traveled all the way from India uh

2229
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:32,460
through Afghanistan and uh

2230
01:35:29,158 --> 01:35:34,859
I asked him you know we're we're back

2231
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:37,139
and forth talking I was a young man and

2232
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:40,619
and uh really interested in sports at

2233
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:42,779
the time and basically there to to uh

2234
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:46,319
you know first Olympics I was ever ever

2235
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:49,019
able to attend uh just see what's going

2236
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:51,479
on there but I'd run into people that

2237
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:54,300
were as interested in marijuana as I was

2238
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:57,359
and we're transporting seeds so they had

2239
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:59,880
some uh pure Afghani

2240
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,619
um from an Afghani Farmer they stayed

2241
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,500
with for about a week

2242
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:07,319
and uh he helped them make some bricks

2243
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,539
of hash which they were going from at

2244
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:13,259
that time Innsbruck Germany to somewhere

2245
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:15,840
in France uh I I don't remember where

2246
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:17,639
and I probably wouldn't say if I did but

2247
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,279
um then they they brought it back to the

2248
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:23,279
States and uh I actually got in touch

2249
01:36:20,279 --> 01:36:25,259
with them in California again and and

2250
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,779
got picked up some of that black hash

2251
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:31,380
that they brought back that they were

2252
01:36:27,779 --> 01:36:34,979
part of uh of making in Afghanistan

2253
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:36,739
uh but I kept those uh seeds uh forever

2254
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:39,658
yeah it's a

2255
01:36:36,738 --> 01:36:41,218
pure Afghani you would call it a land

2256
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:42,960
race but

2257
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:44,760
um you know when it was grown

2258
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,980
commercially I don't know if you can

2259
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:49,699
call that a land race because somebody's

2260
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:53,638
growing it uh for the production of hash

2261
01:36:49,698 --> 01:36:56,219
not not for the plant itself there I

2262
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:58,500
mean they if you if you saw what they

2263
01:36:56,219 --> 01:37:01,679
did to the plants you know it it's

2264
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:03,479
almost important uh to us because yeah

2265
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,699
that's all about just beating the hell

2266
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:08,099
out of the plants and and the seeds go

2267
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:10,019
flying everywhere and uh for somebody

2268
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:12,539
like me I've witnessed that a couple of

2269
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:14,880
times once in Morocco and and another

2270
01:37:12,539 --> 01:37:16,920
time and if Afghanistan myself and I'm

2271
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:20,719
like oh my God

2272
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:23,699
yeah let me pick these up for you

2273
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:26,460
oh I can imagine that's hilarious that's

2274
01:37:23,698 --> 01:37:28,799
hilarious I I had also noticed um on

2275
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:31,739
your Instagram that you had grown out

2276
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,360
some pakistanis sort of more recently in

2277
01:37:31,738 --> 01:37:35,399
fact and I I wanted to ask you about

2278
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:37,439
your thoughts on it because I I I feel

2279
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:39,420
like Pakistan is like a great Indica

2280
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:41,579
that often gets overlooked because of

2281
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,739
the fact that Afghanistan's right next

2282
01:37:41,579 --> 01:37:45,359
to it and obviously Afghani is right

2283
01:37:43,738 --> 01:37:46,859
just incredible in its own right but

2284
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,238
yeah what's your thoughts on Pakistani

2285
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:50,099
do you think they're a little bit um

2286
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:54,359
underrated

2287
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:56,780
way underrated uh the chitral area uh

2288
01:37:54,359 --> 01:38:03,420
the what you're referencing to probably

2289
01:37:56,779 --> 01:38:06,719
uh the purple uh Pakistani chitral Kush

2290
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:09,899
um that's a River Regional area a very

2291
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:13,739
beautiful area and um those people take

2292
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:16,979
extreme pride in in their uh production

2293
01:38:13,738 --> 01:38:18,419
of hash uh but their their plants are

2294
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:20,939
are

2295
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:23,158
just astounding

2296
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:25,678
um you know the vibrancy of the the

2297
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:29,158
colors the purples that come out of

2298
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:33,300
those and uh the production of trichomes

2299
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:35,399
it you know to see them uh Outdoors is

2300
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:38,100
on you know it's almost magical I mean

2301
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:39,960
my my Recollections of actually seeing

2302
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:42,120
them in that area

2303
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,039
um got me kind of hooked on and that's

2304
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:46,859
yeah you're right that's something I

2305
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:49,619
just worked on recently

2306
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:52,920
so a Pakistani shitral cushion I'm

2307
01:38:49,619 --> 01:38:55,738
trying to get it um two and F uh four

2308
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:59,100
right now it's at an F3 it's been to

2309
01:38:55,738 --> 01:39:01,979
testers I back crossed it once uh trying

2310
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:04,380
to trying to pull it up to an F4

2311
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:06,899
um it'll be a be a hard push for me

2312
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:09,960
because I've got a lot of other projects

2313
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:12,119
going on right now so that'd probably be

2314
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:14,399
a year off before I even think about

2315
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:15,719
releasing that but yeah it's a beautiful

2316
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:18,179
plant

2317
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:21,539
yeah look we'll all have the weight with

2318
01:39:18,179 --> 01:39:23,399
anticipation you you almost answer the

2319
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:25,319
next question for me so I'll try to bait

2320
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:27,899
it out of you a little more I'm always

2321
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:29,460
curious to ask breeders what is the

2322
01:39:27,899 --> 01:39:30,899
thing that you're most excited about

2323
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,460
like what's the next project you're

2324
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:34,619
about to start that you're like oh man

2325
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:38,039
this one's going to be great

2326
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:40,619
and um you know again I call myself a

2327
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:42,960
preservationist

2328
01:39:40,619 --> 01:39:46,439
um but I've really taken to this

2329
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:50,219
breeding thing because I've been uh

2330
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:53,219
lucky and fortunate enough to to be able

2331
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:58,380
to access all these different genetics

2332
01:39:53,219 --> 01:40:02,219
and to be able to uh cross them together

2333
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:04,859
um is just phenomenal and I've I've

2334
01:40:02,219 --> 01:40:06,840
worked extensively with Hawaiian strains

2335
01:40:04,859 --> 01:40:10,019
trying to bring back some of the

2336
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:12,960
original Hawaiian strains and

2337
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:17,400
um I'm I'm uh working again to to bring

2338
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:19,260
the haleaka Haleakala silver sword

2339
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:21,658
um up to its uh

2340
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:25,560
um it was grown on the backside of Hana

2341
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:28,439
uh the back side of the Haleakala crater

2342
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,000
um you know a pretty good elevation in

2343
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:33,299
the jungle

2344
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,100
um by several Growers from Lower nuhiku

2345
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,719
Road and

2346
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,179
um they're prominent Growers they've

2347
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,800
been doing it all their lives uh

2348
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:43,199
basically since they got back from

2349
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:46,079
Vietnam they didn't even go back they

2350
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:49,099
went back to California long enough to

2351
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:52,679
uh to get discharged from the service

2352
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:56,520
went right over to Hana and became pot

2353
01:40:52,679 --> 01:41:00,600
growing Hermits and uh these guys are

2354
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:03,239
exceptional and uh it's it's actually my

2355
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:06,780
honor to uh preserve that particular

2356
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:09,599
strain and and to bring it back so

2357
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:12,719
that's what I'm trying to do and uh

2358
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,820
they're they're old enough where that's

2359
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,100
all passed that's not something that

2360
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:18,899
they're doing anymore but they're all

2361
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,900
behind me and want to know its progress

2362
01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:25,019
so that's something I'm actively working

2363
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:28,439
on right now and and look forward to

2364
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:30,840
getting it stabilized

2365
01:41:28,439 --> 01:41:32,219
that's really exciting I think that

2366
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,139
there would be a lot of people

2367
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:36,539
interested in that one

2368
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:40,020
I mean we've we've spoken a lot about

2369
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:42,600
indicas and you you mentioned you've got

2370
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:44,520
a profound love of sativas I I too

2371
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,500
actually really love sativas myself and

2372
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:49,860
I noticed there was a few posts on your

2373
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:52,439
Instagram of some sneaky Neville's Hayes

2374
01:41:49,859 --> 01:41:55,380
slash Neville's Hayes hybrids right

2375
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:56,939
obviously Todd has sort of made some

2376
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:59,819
ripples in the water with his

2377
01:41:56,939 --> 01:42:01,979
re-releases of Hayes more recently do

2378
01:41:59,819 --> 01:42:04,019
you think that the Neville's Haze is

2379
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:06,299
what you would consider to be one of the

2380
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:09,719
the better representations of Hayes or

2381
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:11,520
do you think that maybe like an nl5 Haze

2382
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:13,439
is like a better sort of representation

2383
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,380
in your mind

2384
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:18,779
well Neville taste I I had the unique

2385
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:21,300
opportunity to meet Neville and play

2386
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:23,399
chess with him and and talk to him and

2387
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:27,000
and I have a different perception of

2388
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:31,138
that the man and and his ethos than most

2389
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:34,679
people do everybody uh degrades to the

2390
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:36,600
worst common denominator and uh if you

2391
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:39,420
didn't get to know him and know what a

2392
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:42,179
kind giving person he was and what an

2393
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:45,539
exceptional breeder he was he actually

2394
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:47,279
made such an imprint on me that I just

2395
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:49,679
continued doing what I was doing and

2396
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:53,519
didn't think I was completely nuts for

2397
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:55,260
doing so because he was he was uh you

2398
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:58,739
know making good money doing what he was

2399
01:42:55,260 --> 01:43:01,560
doing taking a lot of chances uh his

2400
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:04,919
family was 100 behind him

2401
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:08,100
um he is also an Australian great great

2402
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,719
personality I mean always outgoing I

2403
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:13,679
didn't see any of the things that some

2404
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:16,198
people of of accused him of um he was an

2405
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:19,260
exceptional chess player and I beat him

2406
01:43:16,198 --> 01:43:21,839
once and I was really proud of that so

2407
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:24,179
um getting the haze from him I knew his

2408
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,440
parents uh you know he had a Northern

2409
01:43:24,179 --> 01:43:28,079
Lights uh

2410
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:30,500
one two and three he had the hazes were

2411
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:34,198
the same thing he he numbered everything

2412
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:36,359
classified those things the same way and

2413
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:38,759
then made separate crosses of them I

2414
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:41,519
also got Northern Lights number nine

2415
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:43,020
from him which he never really released

2416
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,300
in a pure form

2417
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:48,179
uh it was one of the greatest Northern

2418
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:51,360
Lights but it was uh unique enough to

2419
01:43:48,179 --> 01:43:53,279
preserve so I've preserved it and um

2420
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:55,920
yeah if I ever released that I'd

2421
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:58,198
definitely ask permission from his uh

2422
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,960
family but the Neville says did have

2423
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:03,059
Northern Lights in it I mean it he

2424
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,980
crossed the Hayes with with the northern

2425
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:08,460
lights and I think he told me it was the

2426
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:10,678
uh Haze number three uh his his most

2427
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:13,260
worked hazes were one two and three so

2428
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:15,060
number three and I think it was a

2429
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:17,820
Northern Lights Number Two that it used

2430
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:21,000
to create Neville's Haze and he was

2431
01:44:17,819 --> 01:44:22,618
really proud of it and I when I brought

2432
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,600
it back

2433
01:44:22,618 --> 01:44:27,139
um the commercial Growers couldn't get

2434
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:30,480
enough of it uh It produced really well

2435
01:44:27,139 --> 01:44:33,300
indoors it wasn't like a normal uh

2436
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:36,059
sativa it it had plenty of trichome

2437
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:38,219
production uh maybe only thing

2438
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:41,699
comparable at that time was White Widow

2439
01:44:38,219 --> 01:44:44,698
which I know uh him and Scott had uh

2440
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:45,658
some work together on producing Shanti

2441
01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:48,599
Baba

2442
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:50,579
uh they they worked together on that and

2443
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,920
I I know there was you know back and

2444
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:56,219
forth but I never experienced that with

2445
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:59,279
Nell it was a just a gentleman to me uh

2446
01:44:56,219 --> 01:45:02,698
you know I went to his so-called castle

2447
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:05,279
and you know went down in the played

2448
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:08,939
chess with him on the table downstairs

2449
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:12,238
and and that's uh a lot like me and just

2450
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:13,979
a nut about uh pot at the time I

2451
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:16,138
couldn't read enough about it I couldn't

2452
01:45:13,979 --> 01:45:19,198
see enough I couldn't get enough

2453
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:21,480
exposure I couldn't find enough genetics

2454
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:24,479
and he goes yeah just be careful because

2455
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:27,599
uh it it's a never-ending Road he says

2456
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:29,579
you go down this road and he says it

2457
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,520
just keeps expanding in front of you and

2458
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:36,238
uh there's really no end to it and he

2459
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:38,520
was right I I you know to this point I

2460
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:40,919
never thought I would be or

2461
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:43,080
um even still talking to people that

2462
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:45,420
were interested in pot I thought once it

2463
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:47,399
got legal that all these strains these

2464
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:49,679
old ones that I spent all this time

2465
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:51,179
preserving I would have done everything

2466
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,819
in vain because no one would want him

2467
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:56,118
because they want the new shiny uh next

2468
01:45:53,819 --> 01:46:01,198
grade poly hybrid

2469
01:45:56,118 --> 01:46:03,420
that shines like a diamond in comparison

2470
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:06,118
um to some of these old uh building

2471
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:08,340
block strains I call them that I've kept

2472
01:46:06,118 --> 01:46:11,099
viable for all these years

2473
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:12,719
yeah wow what a really unique history

2474
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:15,119
you've had with Neville that's really

2475
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:17,939
cool I'm quite envious I'd love to ask

2476
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:19,618
quickly can you describe that Northern

2477
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:22,439
Lights nine I don't think I've ever

2478
01:46:19,618 --> 01:46:26,039
heard anything like that

2479
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:29,039
yeah it's it's a uh you know a lot a lot

2480
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:31,139
like Northern Lights number five but I

2481
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:35,399
don't think it draws anything from uh

2482
01:46:31,139 --> 01:46:38,940
Northern Lights five it has uh

2483
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:40,920
um narrow leaves on the top of the plant

2484
01:46:38,939 --> 01:46:42,899
really broad leaves on the bottom some

2485
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:44,819
of the land the the bottom leaves

2486
01:46:42,899 --> 01:46:46,379
getting as big as my hand more of an

2487
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:49,259
Afghani leaning

2488
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:52,739
but then uh when it goes into flour most

2489
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:57,239
everything on top is all narrow leaf

2490
01:46:52,738 --> 01:47:02,399
heavily tricomed uh really dense uh

2491
01:46:57,238 --> 01:47:04,919
buds uh very uh strong sedative Stone

2492
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,899
but uplifting at the same time like a

2493
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:08,219
haze

2494
01:47:05,899 --> 01:47:09,059
keeps you going keeps you running all

2495
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:10,980
day

2496
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:13,739
uh kind of like that Doobie Brothers

2497
01:47:10,979 --> 01:47:17,899
song keeps you running sounds like

2498
01:47:13,738 --> 01:47:17,899
beautiful stuff dating myself

2499
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:24,238
oh that's that's really lovely to hear

2500
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:26,460
okay cool cool cool cool so you've

2501
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:29,879
spoken about you know enjoying some of

2502
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:32,399
Neville's works and uh unfortunately our

2503
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:34,079
listeners won't be able to see this

2504
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,899
because this is an audio only podcast

2505
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:39,359
but I can see sneakily in the background

2506
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:42,779
there's a plant more seed sticker body

2507
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:44,219
oh yeah I'm interested to know what

2508
01:47:42,779 --> 01:47:47,039
other breeders do you think are doing

2509
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:49,880
good work at the moment well any anybody

2510
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:53,639
that's done it for the love of the plant

2511
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:55,500
is in in in my opinion and anybody

2512
01:47:53,639 --> 01:47:58,020
that's breeding and testing their gear

2513
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,600
is working towards

2514
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:04,020
a future in cannabis

2515
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:06,360
uh there can only be commended uh I

2516
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:10,619
can't I can't take away from anything

2517
01:48:06,359 --> 01:48:12,839
that's anybody's doing uh bodies uh work

2518
01:48:10,618 --> 01:48:15,238
with with some of the land races and

2519
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:20,159
bringing back uh some of these older

2520
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:23,339
strains uh I I do uh on occasion uh talk

2521
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:26,039
to people that um and and real recently

2522
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:28,020
even today talk with people that are are

2523
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:31,679
giving him genetics to work with or

2524
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:34,139
they're doing collaborations with him

2525
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:37,800
um so I know that some of his genetics

2526
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:40,440
or or all of them are true and that's

2527
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:43,199
kind of what I look for you know uh it's

2528
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:45,899
like my model if in doubt grow it out so

2529
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:48,599
I've grown out Bodhi strains uh that

2530
01:48:45,899 --> 01:48:50,579
that I'm interested in uh just from

2531
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,500
people's descriptions of the plants when

2532
01:48:50,579 --> 01:48:54,658
they finish them I'm like oh yeah that's

2533
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,979
that's kind of you you hit me right on

2534
01:48:54,658 --> 01:49:00,059
the head that sounds like an old school

2535
01:48:55,979 --> 01:49:02,099
plant I'm gonna run that and uh yeah I I

2536
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:04,980
really like what he's doing

2537
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:08,280
um he's a really nice guy met him one

2538
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:09,299
time probably doesn't remember me

2539
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:12,000
um

2540
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:15,420
but you know that's the way I prefer it

2541
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:19,139
yeah you know I spent a lot of time in

2542
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:22,260
the shadows uh very very recently uh

2543
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:24,420
having coming out and and uh

2544
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:26,039
sharing things I I just don't want

2545
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:27,600
things to disappear

2546
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:30,658
you know and

2547
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:34,980
um that's why I'm here today I guess

2548
01:49:30,658 --> 01:49:37,019
yeah nice and I can 100 vouch for all of

2549
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:38,698
that boat he's got to be one of the

2550
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:40,260
nicest guys you'll ever meet and I'm

2551
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:42,299
sure he probably does remember you to be

2552
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:43,800
honest I remember thinking that myself

2553
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:45,060
the first time I met him I'm like he's

2554
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,800
never gonna remember me but that's what

2555
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:49,139
makes him so magical is he's so

2556
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,279
personable you know he he I bet he does

2557
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:52,618
remember you

2558
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:55,618
yeah they talked about playing a bass

2559
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:58,019
and I you know as as one of my hobbies

2560
01:49:55,618 --> 01:50:00,000
that's one of the things that that I did

2561
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:02,280
was you know I had friends that were

2562
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,158
musicians and we all loved the smoke pot

2563
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:07,500
so we'd play you know I had a house we

2564
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:10,500
all played and there was instruments and

2565
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:12,238
uh you know in the house and and all

2566
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:13,380
hours of the day people would come and

2567
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:15,959
crash and

2568
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:18,239
smoked smoke sessions going on all hours

2569
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:20,579
of the night and you know police had

2570
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:22,259
actually come to the door and say you

2571
01:50:20,579 --> 01:50:23,819
know have the neighbors have said this

2572
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:26,100
and that you want to keep it down or

2573
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:29,698
we'll bust your grow and I'm like okay

2574
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:32,280
you put it like that uh but you know

2575
01:50:29,698 --> 01:50:35,099
music is another is another thing that I

2576
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:37,319
I kind of connect with because it's for

2577
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,219
a Pastime if you're a grower

2578
01:50:37,319 --> 01:50:40,079
um

2579
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:42,060
it's one of those things you can stay

2580
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:44,880
home and do you know you can play music

2581
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:47,460
and and take care of your plants

2582
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,980
um you know anybody that's uh farming or

2583
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:51,539
or growing knows that you only have a

2584
01:50:49,979 --> 01:50:55,138
limited amount of time that you can go

2585
01:50:51,539 --> 01:50:58,439
do other things other hobbies and uh you

2586
01:50:55,139 --> 01:51:00,840
know music and musicians I met some

2587
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:03,599
fantastic musicians I met some great

2588
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:06,119
collectors uh I met

2589
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:09,960
um I gave a guitar to Paul Allen from

2590
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:13,259
Microsoft met him went to his home

2591
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:17,039
um so music people I I knew Al Hendricks

2592
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:20,460
and Leon Jimi hendrix's dad and Leon his

2593
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:22,618
cousin and I had spent time uh gigging

2594
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:26,880

2602
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:46,500
going you don't want to revitalizes if

2603

you're plugged into music and and you

2604

01:51:56,399 --> 01:52:00,238
um yeah links to the Hendricks family

2609
01:51:58,198 --> 01:52:03,479
that's pretty cool

2610
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:05,339
yeah just you know I'll I'll uh just

2611
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:08,039
happen to be at the same bar we were at

2612
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:10,679
and uh me and my friends played red

2613
01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:13,380
house which is a blue Hendrix tune that

2614
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:15,539
would just absolutely loved and Leon

2615
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:18,359
came up on stage and wanted to play with

2616
01:52:15,539 --> 01:52:20,399
us played a couple of tunes and then we

2617
01:52:18,359 --> 01:52:22,859
went out back and

2618
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:26,819
shared some whiskey with Al and talked

2619
01:52:22,859 --> 01:52:29,639
about Jimmy and uh yeah it was it was a

2620
01:52:26,819 --> 01:52:32,340
great time and that was before you know

2621
01:52:29,639 --> 01:52:34,859
everybody was after uh Jimmy's Legacy

2622
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:36,060
and and uh what he owned and writes to

2623
01:52:34,859 --> 01:52:38,339
music and

2624
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:40,139
they are part of the Hendricks family

2625
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:42,239
that was the family

2626
01:52:40,139 --> 01:52:45,600
and uh but there was you know

2627
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:48,658
differences opinion with uh the sister I

2628
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:49,860
guess with Leon and and and Al you know

2629
01:52:48,658 --> 01:52:51,960
was

2630
01:52:49,859 --> 01:52:55,319
he was Jimmy's dad he was a great guy

2631
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:58,980
you know his uh 90 of Jimmy's upbringing

2632
01:52:55,319 --> 01:53:01,559
is what was with Al and to just sit back

2633
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:04,138
I'm a great listener uh I know I'm

2634
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:06,780
talking a lot right now but now's my

2635
01:53:04,139 --> 01:53:10,079
opportunity I listen to people more than

2636
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:12,539
than I'll put out because I also want to

2637
01:53:10,079 --> 01:53:15,719
learn I'm a great learner and and how I

2638
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:17,639
learn is listening and I can gauge uh

2639
01:53:15,719 --> 01:53:20,279
what people are all about and their

2640
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:25,020
passions toward things just by listening

2641
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:27,238
to them and Al's uh Al Hendrix his

2642
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:30,239
greatest passion was his was his son

2643
01:53:27,238 --> 01:53:33,238
Jimmy and his upbringing um a lot of

2644
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:36,238
people don't understand uh how patriotic

2645
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:38,638
Jimmy was uh other than he played The

2646
01:53:36,238 --> 01:53:42,178
Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock

2647
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:44,819
but uh Jimmy was a veteran of the 101st

2648
01:53:42,179 --> 01:53:46,679
Airborne uh not an easy outfit to get

2649
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:48,719
into and

2650
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:51,239
um you know he had a guitar the whole

2651
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:53,579
time he was in boot camp and and you

2652
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:55,979
know Al major he sent him a guitar so

2653
01:53:53,579 --> 01:53:58,380
hearing those stories that you hear

2654
01:53:55,979 --> 01:54:01,678
firsthand from a parent are different

2655
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:05,039
than you hear about folklore and read

2656
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:08,100
from uh books and stuff so that's the

2657
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:08,960
kind of stuff I get from music

2658
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,119
foreign

2659
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:15,239
online I have some I have some uh crazy

2660
01:54:12,118 --> 01:54:19,079
videos that a buddy of mine put on to

2661
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:21,658
YouTube years ago under my Alias Jaime

2662
01:54:19,079 --> 01:54:25,920
Chiba and you know those have come back

2663
01:54:21,658 --> 01:54:27,599
to haunt me and uh people talking she's

2664
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,520
you're a lot crazier than I thought you

2665
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:31,800
were and and uh you know it's kind of

2666
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:35,880
just all out there and it's a mixed

2667
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:38,820
match of of some plants and uh

2668
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:41,520
um you know Hemp Fest number four uh my

2669
01:54:38,819 --> 01:54:45,059
son who's who's already a former Marine

2670
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:48,360
he's in there as a uh you know 18 month

2671
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:51,719
old child in a in a stroller at Hempfest

2672
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:54,779
down a Gas Works Park uh Hempfest by the

2673
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:56,520
way great inspiration Vivian McPeak one

2674
01:54:54,779 --> 01:55:00,238
of the finest people he ever meet on the

2675
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:02,520
planet my experiences with Hempfest and

2676
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:04,319
all the people surrounding it especially

2677
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,940
Jack Herrera

2678
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:08,039
um

2679
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:10,500
phenomenal event and I think that's why

2680
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:13,500
uh we're here today

2681
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:17,698
at this point of legalization is because

2682
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:21,300
of uh Hempfest and and festivals like it

2683
01:55:17,698 --> 01:55:25,019
and I'll even include High Times uh uh

2684
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:26,820
efforts with the Cannabis Cup and and

2685
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:29,280
and their promotion they might have made

2686
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:31,500
a lot of money but you know they stayed

2687
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:35,219
in business they they weathered the

2688
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:37,260
storms and and lawsuits and and uh their

2689
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:38,819
founder Tomic man let's call myself a

2690
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,739
criminal I do call myself an outlaw

2691
01:55:38,819 --> 01:55:42,059
because that's the life I've lived my

2692
01:55:40,738 --> 01:55:46,559
entire life

2693
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:49,260
and and you had to to be a grower a

2694
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:51,060
breeder a preservationist

2695
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:55,739
um that's the price you paid that wasn't

2696
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:58,860
uh um a monetary price it was a price of

2697
01:55:55,738 --> 01:56:03,000
isolation and and uh

2698
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:06,238
Anonymous being anonymous always

2699
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:08,520
yeah wow what a what a rich life you've

2700
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:10,738
LED that's that's so cool to hear and

2701
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:12,480
almost perfect timing you throw that in

2702
01:56:10,738 --> 01:56:15,118
because we're sort of on the tail end of

2703
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:16,738
things uh last question or two before we

2704
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:19,738
get into our quick fire questions that

2705
01:56:16,738 --> 01:56:21,359
we always do at the end okay I realized

2706
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:23,759
I hadn't actually asked you this yet I'm

2707
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:26,099
sort of kicking myself what grow style

2708
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:28,139
do you utilize are you an Organics guy

2709
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:31,619
are you a more salt

2710
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:35,100
I'm an organic totally organic soil

2711
01:56:31,618 --> 01:56:37,259
um I I believe in Earth boxes as a

2712
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:41,880
passive hydroponic

2713
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:44,520
um soil system organic but um using

2714
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:47,279
using the Earth boxes I know they're

2715
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:48,600
expensive and it's a commercial uh way

2716
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:51,118
to go I know you can make them

2717
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:53,579
yourselves now nowadays but I I'd

2718
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:56,039
purchased so many over the years

2719
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:58,800
I still use them to this day I can walk

2720
01:56:56,039 --> 01:57:02,939
away from a grow for up to two days and

2721
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:06,119
not have to worry about watering with my

2722
01:57:02,939 --> 01:57:09,059
raising children and and having a real

2723
01:57:06,118 --> 01:57:11,880
job in life that that was a real benefit

2724
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:15,599
to me when it ended up doing everything

2725
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:18,239
alone and and didn't have some of the

2726
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:20,099
backup I've been uh really blessed to

2727
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:22,799
have in my life I've had people come and

2728
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:24,900
go in my life that uh you know we're

2729
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,539
more passionate about the plant than

2730
01:57:24,899 --> 01:57:29,219
just about anybody I've ever met some of

2731
01:57:27,539 --> 01:57:32,760
them were in it for their own financial

2732
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:34,679
gain and they did really well but

2733
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:37,380
um you know just for their assistance

2734
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:40,618
and everything they did to help me along

2735
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:43,380
the way to keep these seeds going I I

2736
01:57:40,618 --> 01:57:46,920
can't thank them enough

2737
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:48,599
yeah hugely hugely I I think that having

2738
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:50,760
the ability to run things with a busy

2739
01:57:48,599 --> 01:57:52,739
life is really important and people

2740
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:55,139
around to help is always very very

2741
01:57:52,738 --> 01:57:56,459
useful I probably should have

2742
01:57:55,139 --> 01:57:58,079
slaughtered this next question a little

2743
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:59,939
earlier on when we were talking about it

2744
01:57:58,079 --> 01:58:02,099
but we had a two or three different

2745
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:03,598
listeners chime in with essentially the

2746
01:58:02,099 --> 01:58:06,539
same question and they were wondering

2747
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:07,500
have you ever grown out skunk cabbage

2748
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:09,779
and do you think there's any

2749
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:11,460
relationship between skunk cabbage and

2750
01:58:09,779 --> 01:58:14,399
the Roadkill

2751
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:17,158
you know I got I got some uh skunk

2752
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:20,939
cabbage seeds uh from

2753
01:58:17,158 --> 01:58:24,359
um Alaska Bean Brands yeah yeah and and

2754
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:27,178
uh they didn't germinate I I didn't know

2755
01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:30,238
that he kept them in a freezer and

2756
01:58:27,179 --> 01:58:33,980
um I probably hung on to them uh to drop

2757
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:36,539
him into a cycle of of uh growth cycle

2758
01:58:33,979 --> 01:58:38,218
uh longer than I should have because I

2759
01:58:36,539 --> 01:58:42,420
didn't know probably that they were

2760
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:46,079
frozen and so that might have been a

2761
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:48,480
a reason they never germinated yeah but

2762
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:49,738
yeah you know Alaska Bean Brand's a

2763
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:51,959
great guy

2764
01:58:49,738 --> 01:58:54,479
um I you know I wish I had the

2765
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:56,399
opportunity to to uh finish him out

2766
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:59,879
because he said they were it was a great

2767
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:03,179
strain but we I have I have a cover crop

2768
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:06,239
outside of uh all my grows is is uh

2769
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:09,179
skunk cabbage it's it's it's an actual

2770
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:11,399
plant oh is it the bears eat it the deer

2771
01:59:09,179 --> 01:59:15,779
eat it yeah it's it's a plant that grows

2772
01:59:11,399 --> 01:59:18,079
uh extensively in Southeast Alaska and

2773
01:59:15,779 --> 01:59:21,118
uh British Columbia

2774
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:23,399
up the coast of Alaska here

2775
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:24,899
there you go that's neat what a sort of

2776
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:27,118
like a small world sort of thing almost

2777
01:59:24,899 --> 01:59:30,420
that's that's really cool to hear

2778
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:32,698
so on to our quick fire questions which

2779
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:33,960
is the four or five questions we ask all

2780
01:59:32,698 --> 01:59:35,579
of our guests at the end of the episode

2781
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,698
and I'm always Keen to hear people's

2782
01:59:35,579 --> 01:59:40,859
answer first one being what is the

2783
01:59:38,698 --> 01:59:43,439
single most memorable cannabis

2784
01:59:40,859 --> 01:59:46,618
experience you've ever had

2785
01:59:43,439 --> 01:59:49,859
the single most memorable experience I

2786
01:59:46,618 --> 01:59:51,139
ever had with cannabis was uh on a New

2787
01:59:49,859 --> 01:59:55,139
Year's Eve

2788
01:59:51,139 --> 01:59:58,039
in uh Maui Hawaii

2789
01:59:55,139 --> 01:59:58,500
uh I walked upstairs

2790
01:59:58,039 --> 02:00:00,179
[Music]

2791
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:04,560
um

2792
02:00:00,179 --> 02:00:06,359
is a restaurant uh bar I went I walked

2793
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,480
upstairs from Front Street in downtown

2794
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:13,519
Lahaina to a bar called the Blue Max

2795
02:00:09,479 --> 02:00:17,698
now the Blue Max was uh just fantastic

2796
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:20,099
old school bar open air but the music

2797
02:00:17,698 --> 02:00:25,979
coming out of it just sucked me right in

2798
02:00:20,099 --> 02:00:28,139
and uh I smoked a joint with uh Paco de

2799
02:00:25,979 --> 02:00:28,939
Lucia and

2800
02:00:28,139 --> 02:00:33,239
um

2801
02:00:28,939 --> 02:00:37,019
Cecilia and capona from Hawaii they were

2802
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:40,198
there with uh Al Di Meola but they had

2803
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:41,099
played played up at a resort North of

2804
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:43,019
there

2805
02:00:41,099 --> 02:00:45,060
but I smoked a joint with that and then

2806
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:46,500
I listened to some music that they were

2807
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:50,280
playing

2808
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:51,000
um as and just just a magical night

2809
02:00:50,279 --> 02:00:53,460
um

2810
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,698
and I you know I think the pot was a

2811
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,920
catalyst but uh I always that's one of

2812
02:00:56,698 --> 02:01:01,979
the strains I I didn't find out what it

2813
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:06,118
was that I had always wished that I had

2814
02:01:01,979 --> 02:01:08,879
uh ask them or or you know found out you

2815
02:01:06,118 --> 02:01:10,679
know what the genetics were so I could

2816
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:13,560
re recreate that stone because I was

2817
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:17,340
like the most magical High I've ever had

2818
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:20,039
in my life uh to remember it to this day

2819
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:23,819
um there's uh in the Old Blue Max there

2820
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:25,738
was uh uh couches for seating and you

2821
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:27,719
would sit like five feet away from the

2822
02:01:25,738 --> 02:01:30,299
band while they were playing and people

2823
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:31,500
would be coming streaming up the stairs

2824
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:34,980
and uh

2825
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:36,899
it was just uh just a like an out of

2826
02:01:34,979 --> 02:01:39,299
body experience I can't even explain it

2827
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:43,079
uh just sitting there floating in the

2828
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:45,840
music and uh and the uh the the great

2829
02:01:43,079 --> 02:01:49,079
high that I had from whatever pot that

2830
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:51,300
was that I got from them yeah the great

2831
02:01:49,079 --> 02:01:53,779
unknown some of the best are the ones

2832
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,779
that got away

2833
02:01:54,738 --> 02:02:00,238
I love that that's a great story so on

2834
02:01:58,198 --> 02:02:02,098
the other end of the spectrum what was

2835
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,500
something that you were really excited

2836
02:02:02,099 --> 02:02:06,539
to try maybe your friends had even like

2837
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:07,679
sort of hyped it up a bit to you and

2838
02:02:06,539 --> 02:02:09,658
then when you finally got around to

2839
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:10,920
trying it you were left feeling a little

2840
02:02:09,658 --> 02:02:13,019
disappointed

2841
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,539
oh man

2842
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:17,460
true

2843
02:02:14,539 --> 02:02:20,460
there's a purple strain that came out a

2844
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:22,279
while ago purple punch yeah okay I was

2845
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:25,679
told that it was this was the the the

2846
02:02:22,279 --> 02:02:27,539
be-all end-all poly hybrid that would

2847
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:31,079
just knock your socks out and a friend

2848
02:02:27,539 --> 02:02:33,899
of mine got it from uh a place in Oregon

2849
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:36,479
that sold clones so it was like a

2850
02:02:33,899 --> 02:02:40,079
certifiable clone and you know bought it

2851
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:42,359
from a legitimate uh breeder so uh grew

2852
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:45,719
it out and uh yeah it was a total

2853
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:47,819
letdown it wasn't uh anything I was

2854
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:50,579
expecting I'm like yeah sorry I'm going

2855
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:53,158
to pass on on working with us yeah we've

2856
02:02:50,579 --> 02:02:54,840
had a few guests mention that uh it

2857
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:59,158
certainly has the purple but maybe not

2858
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:59,159
the punch right exactly

2859
02:03:00,118 --> 02:03:05,579
okay so this is one I really enjoy I'm

2860
02:03:03,779 --> 02:03:08,399
gonna drop you off on a desert island

2861
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:10,439
and theoretically you can grow infinite

2862
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:12,000
weed for the rest of your life but you

2863
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:14,638
can only take three strains with you

2864
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,020
they can be either clones or seeds if

2865
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:18,118
you want to maybe do some breeding or

2866
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:19,380
whatever what three things are you gonna

2867
02:03:18,118 --> 02:03:22,799
take with you

2868
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:24,920
that's pretty easy uh mud by Delight

2869
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:28,260
number one

2870
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:31,739
uh number two is a strain that I created

2871
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:34,139
called Pax which is a sativa dominant

2872
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:37,799
and I created it right after the

2873
02:03:34,139 --> 02:03:40,380
shooting in uh in France

2874
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:43,560
um with all the tourists were there to

2875
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:48,179
see an American heavy metal band and uh

2876
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:51,420
Pax means uh peace and French and

2877
02:03:48,179 --> 02:03:55,260
um I took a couple of uh sativas

2878
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:57,719
and uh this is Steve a hybrid

2879
02:03:55,260 --> 02:04:00,360
um so I had some amount of Indica in

2880
02:03:57,719 --> 02:04:01,859
there and um yeah it's definitely

2881
02:04:00,359 --> 02:04:04,079
something you'd want to have on a

2882
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:06,779
deserted island because it's a it's a

2883
02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:08,819
Time waster that uh

2884
02:04:06,779 --> 02:04:10,380
time is not wasted when you're high on

2885
02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:14,219
it

2886
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:16,099
that's that's my best uh uh

2887
02:04:14,219 --> 02:04:18,420
recollection and

2888
02:04:16,099 --> 02:04:22,079
Lahaina Luna Puna butter which is a

2889
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:25,800
peanut butter originally from uh Kona

2890
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:27,779
area uh actually the Puna District which

2891
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:31,260
is on the big island

2892
02:04:27,779 --> 02:04:33,779
um and that particular strain even today

2893
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:37,199
is just uh

2894
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:39,779
just a knockout um I Source did it in in

2895
02:04:37,198 --> 02:04:41,579
Lahaina on the streets of Lahaina I went

2896
02:04:39,779 --> 02:04:43,859
up to where it was grown in the

2897
02:04:41,579 --> 02:04:46,618
mountains uh they actually had a few

2898
02:04:43,859 --> 02:04:49,859
Sandalwood trees uh which had become a

2899
02:04:46,618 --> 02:04:52,139
real Rarity and I had an opportunity to

2900
02:04:49,859 --> 02:04:55,259
go back to Hawaii again I went up to

2901
02:04:52,139 --> 02:04:57,719
that that particular patch all the

2902
02:04:55,260 --> 02:05:00,060
evidence of growing pot back then is is

2903
02:04:57,719 --> 02:05:03,359
long gone but the sandalwood trees are

2904
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:06,739
nice and healthy I had locals ask me

2905
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:10,618
about their exact location because uh

2906
02:05:06,738 --> 02:05:12,598
Carvers and and P I said you know

2907
02:05:10,618 --> 02:05:14,579
I could show you the pictures but I

2908
02:05:12,599 --> 02:05:16,319
can't remember I could I could walk back

2909
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:19,019
there blindfolded probably but I'll

2910
02:05:16,319 --> 02:05:20,279
never tell anybody where exactly they

2911
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:22,920
are

2912
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:26,460
but uh beautiful trees

2913
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:29,099
I I like I like plants and trees I got I

2914
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:32,460
got redwoods growing in my own uh my own

2915
02:05:29,099 --> 02:05:36,960
yard one of them's uh 30 feet high and I

2916
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:40,380
started it uh from a seed

2917
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:42,300
um 21 year no 24 years ago

2918
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:43,440
wow that's really neat

2919
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:46,079
yeah

2920
02:05:43,439 --> 02:05:48,719
that's cool that's cool okay we're gonna

2921
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:50,819
do a remix of the last question we're

2922
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,800
now going to you're you're the captain

2923
02:05:50,819 --> 02:05:55,979
of the boat you're dropping someone else

2924
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:58,199
off on the island and it's someone who

2925
02:05:55,979 --> 02:05:59,879
you're not a big fan of you know you

2926
02:05:58,198 --> 02:06:02,638
might even go so far as to say you don't

2927
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:04,500
really like them and you get to choose

2928
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:06,420
what three strains you're gonna leave

2929
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,698
them with what are you gonna leave them

2930
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:10,380
on the island with

2931
02:06:08,698 --> 02:06:11,698
you know it might straighten them out so

2932
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:14,159
I'll leave them my three favorite

2933
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:15,658
strengths I love it maybe they'll become

2934
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:18,000
a better person

2935
02:06:15,658 --> 02:06:20,039
beautiful stuff very diplomatic I like

2936
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,079
that a lot we've heard some interesting

2937
02:06:20,039 --> 02:06:24,779
answers from that question and I like

2938
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:27,599
your response a lot there uh so on to

2939
02:06:24,779 --> 02:06:29,579
our final question for the episode if I

2940
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:32,099
gave you a time machine and you could go

2941
02:06:29,579 --> 02:06:34,380
to any place in history geographically

2942
02:06:32,099 --> 02:06:36,960
any time in terms of like

2943
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:38,579
chronologically where would you go and

2944
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,439
what are you going to collect presumably

2945
02:06:38,579 --> 02:06:42,420
you're going to collect some seeds or a

2946
02:06:40,439 --> 02:06:44,339
clone or something like that where are

2947
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:46,560
you going to go and what are you getting

2948
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:48,539
I'm gonna go back to Hawaii to the Blue

2949
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:51,060
Max and I'm actually going to ask those

2950
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:53,460
people the musicians I was talking to

2951
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:55,860
and smoking with What that particular

2952
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:58,279
strain was it was the unanswered

2953
02:06:55,859 --> 02:07:00,899
question of my life I guess

2954
02:06:58,279 --> 02:07:04,259
I love it man that one must really

2955
02:07:00,899 --> 02:07:06,779
riddle you know it resonates constantly

2956
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:09,480
I'm like uh you know of all the things

2957
02:07:06,779 --> 02:07:12,118
that were in Hawaii that I went through

2958
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:14,638
uh trying to grow and trying to find

2959
02:07:12,118 --> 02:07:17,158
that particular I never have found

2960
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:19,560
anything close to it you know

2961
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:22,920
um kind of like roadkill skunk it might

2962
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:25,500
be uh you know that lucid unicorn uh

2963
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:27,800
that exists in my mind

2964
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:30,719
um that may not exist in a plant anymore

2965
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:31,920
and that just kind of uh keeps me going

2966
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,739
on

2967
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:37,679
on the end that what I'm doing isn't all

2968
02:07:34,738 --> 02:07:39,839
wrong and it's not crazy uh preserving

2969
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:42,779
some of these strains because maybe

2970
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:46,860
there's something in uh in my quiver

2971
02:07:42,779 --> 02:07:50,579
that uh another person is gonna find

2972
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:53,519
just as enjoyable as I did that strain

2973
02:07:50,579 --> 02:07:55,819
that I now don't even know what it is

2974
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,820
anymore

2975
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:01,618
yeah certainly certainly so I think that

2976
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:03,599
just about brings us to the end of

2977
02:08:01,618 --> 02:08:05,759
things for this episode were there any

2978
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,139
general comments or shout outs you

2979
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:11,280
wanted to give

2980
02:08:07,139 --> 02:08:12,480
well just if if you're uh if you're

2981
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:14,399
growing

2982
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:16,379
don't don't doubt where you're growing

2983
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:17,579
until you grow it out and see what the

2984
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:19,859
potential is

2985
02:08:17,579 --> 02:08:24,118
uh is something

2986
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:26,098
um isn't what you what you want don't

2987
02:08:24,118 --> 02:08:30,359
spend too much time on it because we all

2988
02:08:26,099 --> 02:08:33,179
only have so much time uh breed breed

2989
02:08:30,359 --> 02:08:36,539
and grow towards what does it for you

2990
02:08:33,179 --> 02:08:39,239
what rings that Bell for you and

2991
02:08:36,539 --> 02:08:40,979
um you know do share your genetics and

2992
02:08:39,238 --> 02:08:42,238
your knowledge with everybody else

2993
02:08:40,979 --> 02:08:44,519
because

2994
02:08:42,238 --> 02:08:46,859
in the future looks like you know the

2995
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:48,780
way we've been going the last four years

2996
02:08:46,859 --> 02:08:51,118
everybody's going to need cannabis a

2997
02:08:48,779 --> 02:08:53,158
whole lot more than than we need it

2998
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:55,618
right now and it's been around for so

2999
02:08:53,158 --> 02:08:59,158
long thousands of years helping and

3000
02:08:55,618 --> 02:09:01,618
aiding uh people that uh the more we

3001
02:08:59,158 --> 02:09:03,319
have and not the less we have as far as

3002
02:09:01,618 --> 02:09:07,139
genetic

3003
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:09,599
capability is going to be important to

3004
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:13,199
everyone I mean if you can if you can

3005
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:15,300
grow your own medicine and be happy

3006
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:18,059
um and remember everybody started out of

3007
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:20,940
pollen chucker there was no expert uh

3008
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:23,460
breeders in my opinion when I started

3009
02:09:20,939 --> 02:09:26,039
out there was only people making seeds

3010
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:28,618
from things they've gotten in in other

3011
02:09:26,039 --> 02:09:31,380
regions of the world and learning their

3012
02:09:28,618 --> 02:09:33,899
chops and putting the work in and

3013
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:37,260
growing and breeding and cross-breeding

3014
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:39,118
until you know I'm sure everybody can

3015
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:42,000
agree that we've gotten a little carried

3016
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:44,158
away with a poly hybrids but if you

3017
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,340
retain uh

3018
02:09:44,158 --> 02:09:49,799
some of the good things by searching for

3019
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:50,819
the recessive traits and the traits that

3020
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,920
you want

3021
02:09:50,819 --> 02:09:55,500
and get rid of rid of the things that

3022
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:58,618
you don't want you can probably create

3023
02:09:55,500 --> 02:10:01,800
some pretty phenomenal poly hybrids

3024
02:09:58,618 --> 02:10:04,399
that'll last the test of time

3025
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:07,739
just just my general opinion

3026
02:10:04,399 --> 02:10:11,158
some very wise words that people looking

3027
02:10:07,738 --> 02:10:13,738
to make their mock lasting and to make

3028
02:10:11,158 --> 02:10:16,319
some cool stuff in the process so once

3029
02:10:13,738 --> 02:10:18,598
again a huge thank you and shout out to
