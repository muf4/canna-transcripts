I do well my friend how you doing this

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,939
morning and I'm doing fine I'm I'm

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,599
sitting on this lovely balcony as it's

88
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,699
Dawning in the UK looking out over blue

89
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:54,359
sky but let's see it

90
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,878
uh things are green and uh

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,819
happy to be here I guess

92
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,439
um kind of uh flattered that somebody

93
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,738
would want to ask me some questions

94
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,639
about my illustrious and and many

95
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,640
faceted life

96
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,139
you nodded on the head many faceted is

97
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,519
to sort of not even do it justice but a

98
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,319
question we love to start off most

99
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,100
interviews with is what have you been

100
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,918
smoking on lately uh

101
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,620
Moroccan hash is kind of what I started

102
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:29,039
with when I first started smoking

103
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,699
cannabis way back in uh

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,500
the Stone Age

105
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:37,500
1975 something like that I think I was

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,660
15 and my brother had some Moroccan hash

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,139
and we rolled it up in a spliff with a

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,540
bit of tobacco and we smoked it and uh

109
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,100
it seems that you kind of revert back

110
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,979
maybe I'm going through a second

111
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,800
childhood because

112
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:56,959
after all this this heavy uh indicas and

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,460
and uh you know soaring high sativas

114
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:04,019
to come to some sort of regular daily

115
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,899
constant and keeper kind of a level head

116
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,939
as much as you can

117
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:13,319
I come down to what I started with which

118
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,959
is a Moroccan hash so yeah uh I actually

119
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,439
I got a little bit I can show you a

120
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,439
little bit

121
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,978
oh beautiful and how does that one

122
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,600
compared to the stuff you have in your

123
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,659
childhood do you think it's similar or

124
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,139
quite different yeah it's it's not too

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,419
strong and it's not too mild we used to

126
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,120
have much milder stuff called slate

127
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:39,359
Moroccan back then that was the cheapest

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,759
stuff and that was harder this is uh

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,220
kind of soft you can just break it off

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,720
and crumble it up like that

131
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,720
very simple

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,080
but uh yeah you know I've been a

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,600
consummate cannabis Stoner user whatever

134
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,478
you want to call me uh most all of my

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,560
life and I find that finding something

136
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,740
that

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,780
is consistent on a daily basis it

138
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,160
doesn't knock me out too high or put me

139
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,279
down too though

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,699
keeps me on a kind of level that I can

141
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,939
cope with is the best for me is when I

142
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,560
mix them up then I have the problem uh

143
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:21,600
particularly a couple of weeks ago I was

144
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,300
over in Amsterdam interviewing a few uh

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,939
quite well-respected breeders and people

146
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,639
in the seed industry over there Soma

147
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,279
being one of them and he knocked me out

148
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,519
with some of his Soma salad bubble hash

149
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,859
so you know you can really overdo it on

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,099
cannabis you know the the amount of THC

151
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,100
you consume uh everybody's got

152
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,300
you know the tolerance levels and uh for

153
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,879
me

154
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,620
um I try to keep them not too high not

155
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,959
too low

156
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,360
but as soon as you you try something

157
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,978
extra strong

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,400
you're gone you know I literally I was

159
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:01,560
out cold for about a minute came around

160
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,839
again

161
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,199
but in that day I tried all these other

162
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,978
varieties too of weed and Nash so kind

163
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,160
of

164
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:14,279
knocks you out eventually it doesn't

165
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,120
matter how how strong you think you are

166
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:22,258
or how much you can combat the THC

167
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,478
everybody has imitations

168
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,759
that's brilliant and I guess as a

169
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,620
follower in general would you say you're

170
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,639
more of like a flower guy or you're more

171
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,639
into your concentrates

172
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,120
that depends you know I'll take what I

173
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,098
can get

174
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,360
you know if there's nothing going you

175
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:45,060
know a lot of the times uh the users

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,939
don't get to choose they just uh they

177
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,339
just take whatever the guy has that has

178
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,918
some you know whether it's a dealer or a

179
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,500
friend or

180
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,418
whoever that passes you some weed or you

181
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,439
grow it yourself

182
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,659
um

183
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,000
that's what you cope with at the time

184
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,340
it's not as if we have the choice of

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,500
selection of some areas of say the

186
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,659
United States to with all their

187
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,959
dispensaries and what have you

188
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:17,160
so generally I don't know I find hashes

189
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:21,060
more compact so it's much easier to um

190
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,240
to deal with weed is generally smellier

191
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,199
and

192
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,418
and uh and more bulky so it depends if

193
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,339
you're traveling or not generally for

194
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:36,478
traveling hash is the best

195
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,820
and uh it's nice to have a bit of both

196
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,820
if you're at home you know to have as

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,700
much Choice as possible

198
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,040
certainly I can appreciate that I would

199
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,959
be interested to hear though what's your

200
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,360
thoughts on the current UK scene you

201
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,619
know these days it feels like by all

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,080
accounts it seems to be really

203
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,759
flourishing and um the law enforcement

204
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,800
is taking a bit more of a relaxed

205
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,759
approach to it how do you feel about the

206
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,759
UK scene at the moment

207
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,679
well I don't know I'm not really with

208
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,580
the In Crowd or if there is an in-ground

209
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:14,879
I live with quite a quiet life these

210
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,920
days after the Mad Shenanigans of the

211
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,220
past decade

212
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,539
um kind of settled down with uh my wife

213
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,519
and two kids

214
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,579
I don't get too involved I go to bed at

215
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,519
nine o'clock at night you know and I'm

216
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,580
up early in the morning like now

217
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,480
so I'm not so sure which way they're

218
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,399
going I'm not really involved with any

219
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,480
organizations I never have been never

220
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:46,679
been a member of any organization as far

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,580
as I can remember no unions

222
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,899
no political parties

223
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,519
[Music]

224
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,080
no

225
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,080
maybe a book club once

226
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,220
so I mean take me back then what was

227
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,778
your childhood like what was the

228
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,600
progression like for you to get into

229
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:10,439
cannabis more seriously

230
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,139
well try and encapsulate it in a in a

231
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,940
short space of time as possible I was

232
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,819
born Down the River from here where I am

233
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,019
in Kingston now in chertsey in a field

234
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:25,019
in a caravan in a rainstorm and I grew

235
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,720
up kind of on the fringes Society I went

236
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,659
to a state sink school after being

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,800
thrown out of a boarding school

238
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:34,079
um

239
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,679
yeah and

240
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,139
they said I was maladjusted they when I

241
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,079
was in my early teens they took me to

242
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,600
for psychological evaluation or whatever

243
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,820
and then they gave me these pills I

244
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,879
think it was how the periodontal or

245
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,700
something like that and it made me go a

246
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,919
bit kind of veggie and a bit Bonkers and

247
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,019
I didn't like it

248
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,819
um yeah sure it calmed me down but it

249
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,980
turned me into a vegetable so I didn't

250
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,500
like that it didn't take them for very

251
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,379
long and about that same time my brother

252
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,019
was experimenting with Moroccan hash and

253
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,639
that seemed to work uh it calmed me down

254
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,060
I don't know when you go through your

255
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,939
teens you you get a big release I think

256
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:22,078
it was testosterone or whatever makes

257
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:25,680
you um you know more prone to explosive

258
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,578
episodes or whatever it is and so they

259
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,578
took that as being some sort of

260
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:36,000
way to say that I was not correct

261
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:39,059
psychologically so it gave me the pills

262
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,440
and it didn't work and I found cannabis

263
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,958
and it did work

264
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,740
so it's helped me

265
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,599
mentally during that period and later on

266
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,500
when I've had injuries and what have you

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,420
and other things I wouldn't say it was a

268
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,000
great painkiller but it kind of takes

269
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,838
your mind off it makes you a bit sillier

270
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,360
so it kind of Cheers you up

271
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,300
you can laugh at yourself easier

272
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,320
it's good to be able to do that most

273
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:13,379
certainly

274
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:16,560
so as far as it being a benefit to me

275
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:19,519
yeah I'd say it has been it's not killed

276
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,199
me it's got me into a lot of trouble

277
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,060
well look I'd be interested to delve

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,160
into all of that but I remember when I

279
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,199
read this uh Guardian article about you

280
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,240
it said at one point you're a roadie for

281
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,620
The Clash was that when you were younger

282
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,039
and sort of before you got heavily

283
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,799
involved in the seed scene

284
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,639
well I grew up kind of 19 years we were

285
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,559
in the 70s and I'm a Londoner so I was

286
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,299
very close to the whole Punk scene when

287
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,879
that came about

288
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:50,879
and uh I used to hang around the back of

289
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,939
the hundred club and other venues at the

290
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,939
Nashville in London various other hubs

291
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,700
where bands were playing and you know

292
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,980
this whole this whole Punk thing seemed

293
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,740
like a new wave it was guys around my

294
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,700
age who were a little bit older who were

295
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,419
um

296
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,220
yeah dressing in Old clothing

297
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,519
were rebelling against society and

298
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,379
during the 70s we had a big depression

299
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,639
then particularly amongst them working

300
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,720
classes

301
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,240
and uh there wasn't much else to do

302
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,480
but go to gigs and jump up and down and

303
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,000
act full you know

304
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,339
we had a lot of fun and some of these

305
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,139
bands I started helping them with their

306
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,100
equipment and they're doing a bit of

307
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:40,620
roadie work it's just really donkey work

308
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,620
pumping uh big Marshall Stacks around

309
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,899
and various other

310
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,919
items for for the public address system

311
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:53,820
they wanted to set up in whatever

312
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:56,219
you know hall or University or Pub all

313
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,200
over the UK so it kind of worked as a

314
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,379
roadie for

315
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,278
a couple of bands the adverts I work for

316
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:08,278
for a while and then I work for uh

317
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:13,200
a couple of gigs with the pistols and

318
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:16,019
then when I went to the states in 1977 I

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,079
moved to the USA and The Clash came over

320
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:22,500
in 1980 and found me in San Francisco

321
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:25,259
over one of their gigs and then they

322
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,419
asked me to work for them on the U.S

323
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,399
tour because I was just about to join

324
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,699
the U.S Marine Corps and they talked me

325
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,100
out of it

326
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,320
so I did it did a few gigs with them

327
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,019
across the states and then I ended up

328
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,079
going down to New Orleans because early

329
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,539
Dorsey who was supporting The Clash on

330
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,838
that tour it invited me down there

331
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:51,599
because he had an auto shop

332
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,360
and they gave me a job spraying cars

333
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,000
which I wasn't very good at that kind of

334
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,278

music industry from a perspective of

346
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:33,000

357
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:05,059
me off the whole thing I I didn't like

358

and uh

374
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,739

00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:33,599
and you'll see me back in 1980

387
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:37,740
is it five or six jumping around in

388
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,319
Caroline park or in some container Port

389
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:45,240
out near the new territories in Hong

390
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:47,879
Kong it was a crazy crazy days

391
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,519
back in Asia but all the time I was

392
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,280
traveling I was always looking for the

393
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:57,298
best hash or the best weed

394
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:59,279
and sometimes it came with seed so I

395
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:01,639
always thought it was a good way

396
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,639
to

397
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,400
get cannabis around the world was to be

398
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,679
able to be at the layer of seed somebody

399
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,720
that could find something that was

400
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,360
different you know somebody was trying

401
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,460
to make something new they might use it

402
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,500
in the mix

403
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,179
that's so fascinating to hear that you

404
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,339
know the whole while you're always

405
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,220
looking for the best harsh and the best

406
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,899
seeds were you collecting seeds that you

407
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,819
would later sell or was it more like

408
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,240
you're collecting the experience that

409
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:36,720
would allow you to later sell the seeds

410
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,660
I think what really opened the door was

411
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,798
the internet with weed base

412
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,779
you know which came up was it was a

413
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,179
cyberb where Growers could communicate

414
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:50,700
breeders from around the world it was

415
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:54,660
just pretty overgrown

416
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:59,519
um guys from that side set up over broke

417
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:03,058
around 2000 I think it was 22 years ago

418
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:06,000
and uh didn't enable people you know

419
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:08,099
with a like mindset to uh communicate

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,798
internationally

421
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:13,619
I'm going to go back inside

422
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,400
bloody shivering out here I don't know

423
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:20,279
it's dropped to about 12 centigrade man

424
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,140
oh wow that is chilly isn't it so I

425
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,480
guess then I would be interested in

426
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,940
asking what was it that stimulated you

427
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,099
to think you know what I'm going to

428
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,140
start selling seeds myself

429
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:35,639
well I

430
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,600
it wasn't until I think 1985.

431
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,440
um

432
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,459
when I got into some trouble over a bit

433
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,279
of hash

434
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,220
I was I had a fiance who was in Holland

435
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,918
and I regularly visit her

436
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,440
and of course I go to a coffee shop

437
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,780
and I'd pick up a piece hash and I'd

438
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,380
bring it back to the UK

439
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,538
with me you know after the visit and I

440
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,940
think it was about the eighth trip

441
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:06,058
this Springer Spaniel

442
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,120
stood in front of me and then sat down

443
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:12,240
and gave me this really stoned look from

444
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,159
this Customs agent at Harwich you know

445
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,919
because I was on the boat from the hook

446
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,980
Van Hollen to Harwich and they ate a

447
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,500
customs check and they found Smash in

448
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,700
the jacket pocket as always

449
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,220
I would carry a bit but not enough to

450
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,759
assume that I was intending to supply

451
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,579
anybody it was just kind of personal so

452
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,980
that ended me up in jail because I

453
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:40,939
refused to pay a fine or do any

454
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,940
community service

455
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:46,440
anyway it was a terrible jail experience

456
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,780
and I thought I've got to do something

457
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,940
about these stupid laws

458
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,279
so what do you do

459
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,179
get a Kalashnikov and a bomb and run

460
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,918
around acting like a terrorist no I

461
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,179
don't think that's going to work you

462
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,580
know

463
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,259
you know you become a Target very easily

464
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:06,119
so

465
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,519
I just thought that cannabis is a

466
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,699
beautiful plant most people have only

467
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,179
heard bad news about it it's been

468
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,940
portrayed as being some sort of evil

469
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,340
um let's get it growing in in thousands

470
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,519
of gardens worldwide

471
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:27,079
hundreds of thousands maybe even

472
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,079
millions of gardens

473
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,678
so how do you do that if you get it

474
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:33,418
growing and then people see the benefit

475
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,419
of the plan

476
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,580
they use it maybe they use they eat the

477
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,340
seeds you know or maybe they use the

478
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:44,519
flax maybe they they uh

479
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:47,158
you know make a medicine out of it maybe

480
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,558
they get high on it it benefits the

481
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,900
society in some way or another but

482
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,119
Society isn't going to know that unless

483
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,900
they see the plant growing or they have

484
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,158
the access and the ability to be able to

485
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,620
grow that plant

486
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,600
so what do you do you have to give

487
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:07,139
people that so you have to have the

488
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:09,599
seeds the ability to distribute them

489
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,360
and you also it helps to have the

490
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,579
education and the know-how and how to

491
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:16,558
cultivate plant

492
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:19,139
as well as you can

493
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,220
so what do you need you need a website

494
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:28,080
to explain that so people can interact

495
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:31,798
so we did that with icmag and uh

496
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,139
the seeds you need a seed site and

497
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:35,700
a lot of our policy well my policy from

498
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,700
the start

499
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,740
was the main idea was to get people

500
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,179
growing wasn't to make lots of money

501
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,240
from people

502
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,179
you know so the impetus was from the

503
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,519
start to give people a good deal on the

504
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:53,780
seeds make sure that they're not crazily

505
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,879
priced if possible unless the Breeders

506
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:58,859
first of all pricing them so high you

507
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,360
know then obviously you've got to make a

508
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,479
cut on top of that

509
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,538
but uh and then giving away

510
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,720
kilos of free seeds along

511
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:11,099
with the orders on condition that people

512
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,100
would share them

513
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:16,918
with others and this is what happened

514
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,798
so for every order that went out it

515
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,720
wasn't just for that person to grow it

516
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,298
was intended for somebody else as well

517
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,380
so instead of one grower you get maybe

518
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:29,400
two

519
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,840
people kept to you know their pledge of

520
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,840
spreading the seeds

521
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:37,440
so it seemed to work and over many years

522
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,360
now I think the Cannabis industry has

523
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,340
grown

524
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,619
exponentially it's it's huge now in

525
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:46,379
comparison to what it was

526
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:48,479
back in the 70s and 80s

527
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,820
when I started out

528
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,319
getting involved with it in one way or

529
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,779
another

530
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,879
that's brilliant and did you ever have

531
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,319
like a conscious thought so to speak

532
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,679
that like

533
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,658
hey this journey I'm on I may not be the

534
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,820
grower to change the world but I could

535
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,740
play another role and help change things

536
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,480
or was it did it never occur to you that

537
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,679
the ripples would spread that wide and

538
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
you just sort of thought you were doing

539
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,940
your own little thing and it wouldn't

540
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,000
cause the effects it did

541
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,298
well yeah I always enjoyed growing I

542
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,579
mean it's a wonderful thing you know I

543
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:26,940
love having plants around me

544
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:30,599
but to do it well and to be a breeder

545
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,460
you've got to really you're kind of tied

546
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,038
to one place

547
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,159
you know generally well

548
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,019
would be you'd have to unless you're one

549
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,120
of these Jet Set breeders who can do

550
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,339
everything over the internet you can

551
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,538
even feed your plants every day you know

552
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:51,259
but no I haven't seen so many successful

553
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:54,298
situations uh with people that try to

554
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:56,879
automate their whole systems generally

555
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:58,679
you have to be in one place all the time

556
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,780
and even if you go on holiday you're

557
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,980
worried sick that when you come back all

558
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,980
your plants are going to be dead

559
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,859
so I know you know the the mentality of

560
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,919
a grower and a breeder

561
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:16,439
so I you know I do grow a bit but but

562
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,659
not really to the extent that you would

563
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,940
need to grow to be a breeder I mean

564
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,020
people like Sam skunkman think you need

565
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:27,000
to grow out

566
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:29,519
ten thousand plants for selections

567
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,460
um to be in any sort of uh respected

568
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,918
considered respected breeder in the

569
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,100
first place and who has the facility to

570
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,720
do that right I think more people do

571
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:43,819
today than they did

572
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:47,159
10 or 20 years ago because of the the uh

573
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:49,619
decriminalization and legalization in

574
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,440
some parts of the world now

575
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:55,259
but you know still most of the world is

576
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,460
is growing uh

577
00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:02,038
in a illegal light to a certain extent

578
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,620
and you have to take this into account

579
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,200
you can't just think that oh it's it's

580
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,058
legal in the United States so you know

581
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,640
you can be really lackadaisical with

582
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:14,579
your own security it's not a good idea

583
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,559
sometimes maybe I am because I've only

584
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:20,538
got three plants so

585
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,538
that's kind of tempting fate but

586
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:26,399
somehow you've got to work you've got to

587
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,080
do something against it but yeah people

588
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,200
are growing more today than ever they

589
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:34,678
did and hopefully I you know I was

590
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,419
instrumental in in aiding that somewhat

591
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,400
in the past

592
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,020
wasn't just me there's there's been a

593
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,700
lot of a lot of other people who've been

594
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,940
Distributing seeds

595
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,679
and have a similar mindset and it's a

596
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,640
way of getting back at the authorities

597
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,038
because now we have seen legislation

598
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,038
um hit home you know in favor of

599
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,440
cannabis legalization

600
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:01,200
uh

601
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,900
you know decriminalization worldwide and

602
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
hopefully that will continue throughout

603
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,640
all the Western Nations and then the

604
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,558
rest of the world

605
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,620
accordingly it's it's a very slow

606
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,538
progression I must say over my whole

607
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:18,479
lifetime

608
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:21,298
and I've seen it go from bad to worse to

609
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,140
better and it's getting better

610
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:26,418
now in the UK now I I really don't think

611
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,759
this

612
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:32,220
concerned as long as you're not causing

613
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,980
a problem with it you know or you're

614
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,100
making a huge business out of it

615
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,900
we've got 250 Stoners knocking on your

616
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:45,719
door within a 24-hour period

617
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,519
I mean on that topic in a sense do you

618
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,798
feel like you really paved the way for

619
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,839
people like say the attitude seed bank

620
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,278
who are now arguably the biggest seed

621
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,199
bank in the world

622
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,019
yeah well

623
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,058
I think in some respects

624
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,579
um I've I've kind of been

625
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,678
the the head of the industry and been

626
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:08,699
the one that's had his head banged

627
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:11,640
against the door a few times uh

628
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:16,380
I kind of feel knocked out or I did it

629
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,940
it was quite a shock in 2013

630
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,220
I was in a

631
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,360
I had a house in Subic in the

632
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,298
Philippines

633
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,058
and then I got told by my sister's

634
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:28,079
brother who was kind of our caretaker of

635
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,178
the house

636
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:34,379
that there was several guys with long

637
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:37,440
guns surrounding the house yeah

638
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,960
long guns I mean rifles you know so I'm

639
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,720
like oh what's the weather what's going

640
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,759
on so we waited for the knock on the

641
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,880
door there was a knock on the door and

642
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,640
they wanted to take me to Manila it was

643
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,039
um the Bureau of immigration

644
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,840
and I I had no clue what this was all

645
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,599
about I've been living in the

646
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,500
Philippines since about

647
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,298
2006 seven

648
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,519
and uh

649
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:06,058
had a family there had children there

650
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,158
had my life there everything

651
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:11,038
and suddenly they wanted to put me in

652
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,720
this uh Detention Jail so they drove me

653
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,278
for a couple of hours into Manila and

654
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,620
dump me in this

655
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:19,500
really awful dump

656
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,579
dumped me in a dump that smelled like a

657
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,259
dump

658
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:24,240
and um

659
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:25,798
yeah there I lived for two and a half

660
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,319
years

661
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,960
um after 10 days of being there they

662
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:34,158
tried to kidnap me and do what's called

663
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,659
a extra judicial rendition

664
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,299
uh by um

665
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,740
trying to force me onto a plane to Los

666
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:44,460
Angeles

667
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,220
from Manila Nino Aquino International

668
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,980
Airport I think it was terminal

669
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,860
terminal one yeah

670
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,319
and of course I lucky enough I was

671
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:59,278
informed what they were attempting to do

672
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,298
by one of the other prisoners there

673
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,880
um

674
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,398
he said that yeah they'll try and do

675
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,980
this to you you need to resist and and

676
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:10,259
you know don't need to get violent but

677
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,659
you need to try and stop them from

678
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:14,700
Shipping you over to the States because

679
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:19,020
it's totally illegal

680
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,120
and can only be done with your consent

681
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:22,500
because being British I'm not an

682
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,959
American subject

683
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,240
so I shouldn't be subjected to American

684
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,899
law

685
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,720
the long arm of the law overseas

686
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:37,199
their Homeland Security that seemed to

687
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,480
operate outside their Homeland

688
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,740
so how did you manage to foil this plan

689
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,839
what happened

690
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,120
oh it was

691
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,658
it was a comedy of

692
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,398
it was just a comedy

693
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:52,919
you say The Comedy of Errors I don't

694
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:57,000
really know but uh they took me there

695
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:59,340
and then before I went there uh I mean I

696
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,859
had back then I had my back problem was

697
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:03,898
a lot worse I've got this

698
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,959
from doing some weight training back in

699
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:10,079
the 90s and overdoing our talks and

700
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,079
muscles and graded some bone and L1 and

701
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,398
L2 vertebrae or something with my back

702
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,579
so um

703
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:20,519
I had this enormous

704
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:21,418
back problem when they put me into this

705
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,000
jail

706
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,799
and so I was taking quite strong

707
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,579
medication for it

708
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:31,500
and so when they were kind of trying to

709
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:35,038
cart me off to

710
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,500
the airport I took a double dose

711
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,538
and then I went to the airport and so I

712
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,700
felt no pain at all and I had the

713
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:43,619
attitude I didn't care and I was very

714
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,259
stoned and I just said to them

715
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,778
you know this is illegal

716
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:51,960
um you can do treat me as a punch bag or

717
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:54,000
whatever you like but uh I'm not going

718
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,860
to put those handcuffs on I put my hands

719
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,599
above my head and then they stood on a

720
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:00,178
chair to try and reach because they're

721
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,119
quite short the guys said

722
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,980
and then I moved along and they couldn't

723
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,959
reach and we had this argument about

724
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,419
them trying to put the cuffs on

725
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,600
but eventually I said look I just want

726
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:16,380
my lawyer and it's obvious to me that

727
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,658
this is not being done right judicially

728
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,778
and I managed to talk them out of it

729
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,700
without too much wrangling or any

730
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,619
wrestling or anything

731
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,700
so it kind of worked out but then they

732
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:33,178
took me back to this Detention Jail uh

733
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:36,659
camp bagong niwa in bicutan

734
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,820
which is kind of like a huge uh police

735
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:42,179
camp

736
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:44,519
2000 plus police surrounding you uh all

737
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,179
living in barracks

738
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,918
so so it's not easy to get out of that

739
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,659
place unless you've got some sort of

740
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,919
SWAT team and a couple of helicopters

741
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:57,960
so I think I read in the guardian

742
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,600
article that you ended up spending like

743
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,640
about two and a half years there or so I

744
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,439
was interested in asking like what was

745
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,360
that experience like how would you

746
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,519
compare it to other jails you'd been in

747
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,019
and as a follow-up did it change your

748
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,879
outlook at all

749
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:15,058
well it's not as if I've done a world

750
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,059
tour of jails you know think about only

751
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:21,839
been in two in my life that was one in

752
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:25,200
Norwich for a month in 1985 in England

753
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:28,019
and uh then the two and a half years in

754
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,058
the Philippines in bickerton but yeah

755
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,980
that was uh that place was something

756
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:34,319
else I mean it wasn't a traditional

757
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,460
Filipino jail because the majority of

758
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,099
the people in there were actually

759
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,200
foreigners it was a foreigners jail

760
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,959
so you have people from all over the

761
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,419
world in there in all different types of

762
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,240
conditions physically and mentally

763
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,740
uh you had a mixture of guys that were

764
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,919
thrown in there for various types of

765
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,659
alleged crimes you know

766
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:01,080
from as small as their girlfriend making

767
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:06,419
a complaint that that he called her a

768
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:08,940
bad name you know to some guys that are

769
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:11,159
involved in you know Kitty Fiddlers and

770
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,940
nonsense and people like that you know

771
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,179
and then murderous between that uh con

772
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,378
artists rapists you name it came through

773
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,519
that place

774
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:25,519
it was uh it was a human criminal

775
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,679
Menagerie

776
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,898
yeah to put it bluntly and I spent most

777
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,878
of my time in my bunk reading every book

778
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:35,039
in English so that I could lay my hands

779
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,440
on that was about it because I didn't

780
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,398
really want to mix and Associate too

781
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,000
much

782
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:44,638
with the other prisoners I kind of kept

783
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,398
away as much as I could

784
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,280
it was kind of it was open in in some

785
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:52,259
respects because the guards weren't

786
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,200
interfering all the time

787
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,839
they pretty much left the prisoners up

788
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,659
to controlling themselves

789
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,358
so the guys just uh

790
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,639
we're checking the gates that you

791
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,079
weren't allowed to go through or you

792
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:10,920
were allowed to go through a different

793
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,078
time they weren't too intrusive uh only

794
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,260
had one guard that tried to be a little

795
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,480
bit aggressive towards me at one time

796
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,700
so it could have been a lot worse

797
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,199
and what was it like in terms of when

798
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:24,960
you finished your sentence what happened

799
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,279
then did you go back and live with your

800
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
family in the Philippines or did you go

801
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,079
straight home to the UK

802
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,480
well I never had a sentence you see

803
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,820
I never went it I I never went to court

804
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,980
was found guilty of anything

805
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,740
all that happened was the United States

806
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,539
put out an indictment in their state of

807
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,098
Maine

808
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:46,940
saying that they wanted me in connection

809
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:51,059
with uh International

810
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:54,000
uh trade in cannabis well it was only

811
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:57,119
the seeds actually you see but in the

812
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,219
United States the seeds are the same as

813
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,680
any part of the plant

814
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:04,139
they can say you know they can say

815
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,719
you're an international traffic uh

816
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:09,659
illegal trafficker in Narcotics even if

817
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:12,419
you are a seed salesman and this is all

818
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:15,118
I was doing was I was buying seeds from

819
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,119
Americans and selling seeds to Americans

820
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,180
and I was doing it from the UK which is

821
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,240
perfectly legal place to do it from

822
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:27,000
because in the UK there there is no laws

823
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,379
against buying and selling of cannabis

824
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,838
seeds

825
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,640
so what happened eventually I mean I

826
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:35,159
didn't want to leave my family over

827
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,960
there I tried to be able to stay in the

828
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,379
Philippines because I thought if I went

829
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,858
back to the UK I would automatically be

830
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,420
uh transported to the United States or

831
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:49,559
that there would be

832
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,559
you know this this uh

833
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,740
extradition hearing uh or there would be

834
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:59,098
a trial and uh so it did happen

835
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:01,979
eventually when I did return there was

836
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:05,280
the United States came after me after I

837
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:10,139
was back for eight months in the UK

838
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,359
and they took me to court and after a

839
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,539
year or so the court said no they can't

840
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:18,239
help me because there's no dual criminal

841
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:20,880
criminality the law is different here in

842
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,838
the UK on seats as it is in the in the

843
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,838
US

844
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:27,358
so they can't extradite me for something

845
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,940
legal in the UK

846
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:33,179
to somewhere where what I've done is

847
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,039
illegal which is in the USA But since I

848
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:36,179
don't live in the USA since I'm not an

849
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,920
American

850
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:41,578
uh

851
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,300
you know it stands in British law that

852
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:48,240
they can only extradite you to another

853
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,519
country if you've broken a similar law

854
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,739
in your own country you know if it's

855
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:55,619
it's within law that

856
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,819
you are operating illegally in some way

857
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,460
or another

858
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,200
which I wasn't yeah in fact I was just

859
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,659
kind of living in the Philippines I

860
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,960
would say semi-retired

861
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:09,539
and you know my breeding project then

862
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,559
was was making more kids and just having

863
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:15,900
a family life and I had I've still got a

864
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,320
few hectares down on the silhou sea

865
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,539
there full of coconut trees and just

866
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,000
trying to live a more basic life of what

867
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:25,858
you call in the mega City Madness of the

868
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,780
rest of the world but then the rest of

869
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:30,838
the world has the long arms of the law

870
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,700
that can reach around and grab hold of

871
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,039
you and screw your life up for the next

872
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:36,659
five or six years and that's what they

873
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,199
did

874
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:42,920
I had a lot of loss of family

875
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,919
life

876
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,659
I miss my kids for many years although

877
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,358
they could come visit me when I was in

878
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,819
jail but then I left the Philippines I

879
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:53,279
finally

880
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,480
[Music]

881
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,800
um

882
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:02,099
they allowed me to come back to the UK

883
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,500
and I think going back there and talking

884
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,359
about other people within the Cannabis

885
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,760
industry

886
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,559
um I was locked up for about two years

887
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,720
in that jail and then the British

888
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,320
Embassy came to see me

889
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:19,078
uh the Consular attache and he came

890
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,140
along with his quite poorly man who was

891
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:25,440
uh who had flown in from Bangkok who was

892
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:27,420
part of the consulate cache group over

893
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,940
in Bangkok

894
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,400
and the first thing he said to me is you

895
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,740
know Howard marks don't you in her sense

896
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,800
yeah so

897
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:40,858
when he winked at me you know did you

898
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,560
know Howard Marx and I thought

899
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:45,659
yes or well that's good what's that got

900
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,299
to do with things and after that guy

901
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:50,578
left over the next six months the

902
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,300
British Embassy couldn't do more to help

903
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:57,300
me they actually got this one guy on my

904
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:00,960
case he was half Filipino half English

905
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:04,200
this young young fella to push my case

906
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,500
forward so that I could finally

907
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,399
[Music]

908
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,880
um

909
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,760
go back to the UK

910
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,760
and to do that I had to drop two cases

911
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,740
in the Supreme Court I had against uh

912
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,380
the Bureau of immigration over there

913
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:21,899
because I wrote cases against them

914
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,640
and they said that they won't they're

915
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,639
not going to let me leave the

916
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,440
Philippines unless I dropped these cases

917
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,379
in the Supreme Court

918
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,599
so that took about six months to do

919
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,660
before finally they dropped the cases

920
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,240
and then they allowed me to deport

921
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:41,098
because had a good case against them but

922
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,779
I would have been there forever waiting

923
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,119
for it to come up in the Supreme Court

924
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,640
so what's the point

925
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,880
they got out of there I'm still on a

926
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,559
blacklist so I can't go back there

927
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,539
unless they clear it with the Philippine

928
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,699
Embassy here in London and with the

929
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:59,099
would they want me back and if I go back

930
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,019
they think I'm some sort of cannabis

931
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,260
Kingpin yeah

932
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:06,838
this is what was said the uh the

933
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,119
Filipino DEA

934
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:13,578
um consider me

935
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,380
to be some sort of Kingpin

936
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:18,359
well I mean you got to admit if you know

937
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,220
how it marks not hard for them to

938
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:22,440
confuse that while we're on the topic

939
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:24,719
did you have any cool or interesting

940
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,679
stories of spending time with Howard at

941
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,019
all

942
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,598
I think I met Howard the first time was

943
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:33,599
I was very young it was out out in Asia

944
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,059
in Hong Kong back in the 80s

945
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,059
um but then he became quite

946
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:40,500
visible on on the whole weed scene with

947
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:42,900
Mr Nice

948
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,119
stuff that came out and the association

949
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,680
with Ben dronkers

950
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,760
and uh

951
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:53,098
of course Shanti Baba or Scott

952
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,300
yeah so I've known all those guys on and

953
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,820
off

954
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,859
for quite a few years we'll kind of

955
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:02,160
revolve into similar circles on the

956
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:05,639
internet within the industry or did and

957
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,858
occasionally we get together and party

958
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:08,699
on the rare occasion that we did it was

959
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,679
uh

960
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:14,039
you can't I can't remember half of it

961
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:17,279
because it was so intense you know

962
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:19,500
that was the way it was uh it was it was

963
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,380
sad because I think Howard went the year

964
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,800
I finally made it back to the UK

965
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,320
and I was not in good shape that's it I

966
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,339
mean the last couple of a year a year

967
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,619
and a half I've really been

968
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:34,380
concentrating on my own health and get

969
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:36,300
back in shape because you know sitting

970
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,320
in a prison in Bangkok

971
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,480
to to getting on for three years isn't

972
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,820
isn't doing your body much

973
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,760
I even tried to work out and slipped in

974
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:51,420
the catch [ __ ] and uh injured myself

975
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,520
so that kind of turned me up

976
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,440
yeah

977
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,139
um occasionally

978
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,818
I might have a chat with one or two and

979
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:01,739
I've been thinking lately it might be

980
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:03,119
more interesting to just go and

981
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,759
interview them

982
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,140
so that's what we've been doing uh

983
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,460
putting together

984
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:13,679
some sort of uh travelogue

985
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,960
a video

986
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,659
Podcast chat thing or whatever you want

987
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,880
to call it going to interview these

988
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:22,139
different breeders in different parts of

989
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,420
the world

990
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:26,940
so it seems like I might be doing more

991
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,039
of that coming along

992
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,500
and I haven't done this type of work in

993
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:34,099
20 years I did I put out a couple of

994
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,079
DVDs I think it was back in

995
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:40,859
2003 2004

996
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,780
one was uh the kiss from the Riff which

997
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,039
is about the hash trade in Morocco and

998
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,339
another one was

999
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,380
with bubble man over in Jamaica

1000
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:52,440
making bubble hash

1001
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:55,140
that must be nearly 20 years ago

1002
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,358
so yeah it's it's kind of an old

1003
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:58,559
profession that I'm trying to pick up

1004
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,019
again and

1005
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,759
and see if I can be an interesting

1006
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:06,539
interviewer basically doing what you're

1007
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:10,260
doing so that that might be interesting

1008
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:14,460
for me I've always admired um

1009
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,740
certain people uh who do that as a job

1010
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,659
and I thought that would be a really

1011
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:22,019
really cool job

1012
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:24,719
to be able to do to be able to travel

1013
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,219
and experience various cultures meet

1014
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,439
different people

1015
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:30,358
and just keep talking about stuff that

1016
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,940
interests people you know the the

1017
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,818
viewers is is entranced by what you're

1018
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,500
saying isn't bored to tears you know

1019
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:42,719
trying to make it interesting

1020
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,159
that's fantastic you you fully answered

1021
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,779
one of the questions I was going to ask

1022
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,338
you which I was gonna say can we expect

1023
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,440
any more of those videos but that's

1024
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:51,960
great to hear and you mentioned bubble

1025
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,420
man I'd love to quickly ask you I feel

1026
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,400
like there's been a notable decline in

1027
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,260
the amount of people who are interested

1028
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,240
in bubble especially in the Advent of

1029
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,579
like BHO and all these other types of

1030
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,159
concentrates how do you think we can

1031
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:07,500
help educate people that like really

1032
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,420
high quality bubble is still some of the

1033
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,500
best concentrate you can get

1034
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,420
all right

1035
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,739
I don't know I mean you've got to kind

1036
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,079
of look at this

1037
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:17,879
not as a cannabis connoisseur you've got

1038
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,619
to pull back and kind of look at it as

1039
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,619
the General Public

1040
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,880
and then make a comparison I mean a lot

1041
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,358
of people do always to the alcohol

1042
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,760
industry and so if you could try to

1043
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,219
compare say bubble to the alcohol

1044
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,440
industry what sort of booze would you

1045
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:37,679
have you'd have very fine expensive

1046
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,380
single malt or something like that

1047
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,480
and out of all the people the alcohol

1048
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:46,260
how many of them actually are really

1049
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,318
into super expensive fine single malts

1050
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:52,619
you know it's a very small percentage so

1051
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:54,838
yeah there's it's interesting bubble you

1052
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:59,640
know for me has always been something

1053
00:45:54,838 --> 00:46:01,980
nice but on an everyday basis I fear

1054
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:05,759
that I would just be knocked out

1055
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:09,500
so I stick to my kind of mild the

1056
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,180
Moroccan hash and it keeps me going

1057
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:15,000
that's brilliant we've had other guests

1058
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:17,279
in the past talk about uh many years ago

1059
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,980
you know say the 90s when concentrates

1060
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,859
weren't as widely distributed as they

1061
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,838
are now people talk fondly about smoking

1062
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:26,338
with Sam the skunk man and he would have

1063
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:29,279
like you know some of the only full

1064
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:30,838
Mount bubble did you ever get access to

1065
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,819
that do you ever have any Recollections

1066
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:34,980
of uh events like that some memorable

1067
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:37,380
half smoking with people

1068
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,579
Sam's always been that way

1069
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,240
you know

1070
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,980
when you when you see him or your first

1071
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,219
meet him or you see him on a regular

1072
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,940
basis he'll always have usually has this

1073
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,779
uh very fine dry Sith that he makes him

1074
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,358
sell

1075
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,579
he's very particular he won't

1076
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:58,500
take anything from anybody else I've

1077
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,700
never seen him smoking anybody else's

1078
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,818
gear

1079
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:05,639
and he uses that he was the first guy

1080
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:09,659
that I came across I don't know how many

1081
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:11,879
years ago it was that told me about CBD

1082
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:13,920
he said now smoke this and you're not

1083
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,420
going to get high off it but you might

1084
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,500
feel a bit better

1085
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,500
I won

1086
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:23,818
it's an interesting concept isn't it so

1087
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,279
it was just like non-alcohol beer this

1088
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:29,279
is stuff is like non-alcohol beer salmon

1089
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:32,579
he's like no no no it's uh it's just

1090
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,500
CBDs in there it's not uh he's got all

1091
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,420
these numbers and names for all these

1092
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,699
different terpenes and God knows what

1093
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,300
you know just blinds Me With Science

1094
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:43,500
sometimes the guy is so knowledgeable

1095
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,240
um

1096
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,420
but yeah he knows what he's talking

1097
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:50,338
about and sure enough another 10 years

1098
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,240
later it's all over the place people

1099
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:54,358
were

1100
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:56,879
it's it's it's a Panacea it's a

1101
00:47:54,358 --> 00:48:00,440
therapeutic thing it's in all sorts it's

1102
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,440
even in shampoo you know

1103
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,420
that's brilliant to hear I mean while

1104
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,220
we're on the topic of Sam who was some

1105
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,960
of the first people once you you know

1106
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,000
you started I see mag you thought let's

1107
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,980
get the seeds out there who are the

1108
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,838
first um breeders whose seeds you were

1109
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,579
Distributing was it like Sam's stuff or

1110
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,099
was it other people

1111
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,519
uh I think

1112
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:26,519
one of the first associations I had was

1113
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:30,858
with Mel from Nirvana seeds

1114
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:34,199
and uh because we share a name

1115
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:36,358
it was kind of interesting I like the

1116
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:39,559
guy he's kind of all over the place he's

1117
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:44,460
not he's very different to say Hank from

1118
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:46,078
Dutch Passion or or Ben dronkers is the

1119
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,280
guy from the streets

1120
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,980
uh interesting guy his mouth so yeah I

1121
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,339
made an association with Mel first and

1122
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:59,519
started uh vending the first breeders I

1123
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:02,880
took on was him with his seats

1124
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:07,318
that must have been I don't know

1125
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,240
uh late 90s I think from Holland yeah

1126
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:12,739
the first time I started doing it and I

1127
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:17,419
put a website up I think it was called

1128
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:17,419
seedsdirect.to based in Tonga

1129
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:23,460
yeah and uh then I had a one-page ad in

1130
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,339
High Times

1131
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,800
and it started snowing through the

1132
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:31,318
mailbox there's so many people were

1133
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,660
ordering it was hard to keep up with the

1134
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:36,420
orders just off the off to get go

1135
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,618
because it turns out that I was one of

1136
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,960
the only

1137
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,660
people in the world I mean there was a

1138
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,460
couple of other

1139
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:47,039
seed Distributors online I think Mark

1140
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,358
Emery was doing it in Canada

1141
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:54,059
and Heaven's stairway in Canada also

1142
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:58,318
a place called Laughing Moon

1143
00:49:54,059 --> 00:50:02,519
uh that that was about it

1144
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:06,599
so I've I've kind of tapped into

1145
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:09,300
a niche market uh that of cannabis seeds

1146
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:12,240
that people were really trying to get

1147
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,640
hold of you know all these new varieties

1148
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:18,598
that were coming out and older ones

1149
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:21,779
that they couldn't get locally and they

1150
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:25,680
could only get internationally

1151
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:27,420
so yeah it started snowing orders and

1152
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:31,679
trying to keep the administration

1153
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:34,920
together and the work the workers

1154
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,818
uh you know to micromanage all that

1155
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,220
stuff

1156
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:41,338
was quite an accomplishment for me to be

1157
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:42,838
able to get hold of you know it took a

1158
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:45,239
while

1159
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:48,779
I don't know maybe it's going to take

1160
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:52,139
forever but I find it much easier

1161
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:56,119
without having employees these days

1162
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:59,699
uh just minimize minimalizing my life

1163
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:02,700
making things smaller instead of bigger

1164
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:05,519
taking less on instead of more on

1165
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:07,558
being a [ __ ]

1166
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,420
that sounds like a good approach given

1167
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,059
the uh you know how busy you've been in

1168
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,980
the past what was it like as the

1169
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,079
business grew you know were you do you

1170
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,119
remember were you just picking up a lot

1171
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,400
of sort of European Dutch breeders and

1172
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,619
and if if so do you remember when

1173
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,480
America First sort of came on the map in

1174
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:26,400
your mind as like hey I could I could

1175
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,019
get a lot of USA breeders too and who

1176
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,200
were the first

1177
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:33,000
yeah well I I looked at it from a global

1178
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,639
perspective because I know that this

1179
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,420
plant grows just about everywhere you

1180
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:37,618
know

1181
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:41,460
um

1182
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:43,440
what it can do has the potential to

1183
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,539
if you give it the right environment of

1184
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,760
course and people were creating

1185
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:50,039
wonderful indoor grow environments

1186
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,119
tropical or otherwise I mean I I live

1187
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:53,159
about

1188
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,140
I think about seven eight miles away

1189
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:57,000
from Kew Gardens

1190
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:58,980
that I could just go there and walk

1191
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,318
around the tropical house and

1192
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,318
imagine it was full of cannabis you know

1193
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,700
so I know that it you can create

1194
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,559
environments like that they're my grow

1195
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:13,139
history I kind of

1196
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,000
a bit rubbed off from my grandfather who

1197
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:18,000
is one of the top guys in The Royal

1198
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,338
Horticultural Society and he used to

1199
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,059
grow wonderful chrysanthemums and breed

1200
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:23,880
them

1201
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:27,059
and win all sorts of trophies and medals

1202
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,280
and plaques for it you see the silver on

1203
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,819
his mantelpiece it was all from

1204
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,220
chrysanthemums

1205
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:37,558
yeah I live in an area where there's a

1206
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:39,598
lot of Gardens and there's a lot of

1207
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,640
stuff growing it's very green area of

1208
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,660
London right near Bushy Park in Richmond

1209
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,759
Park

1210
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:48,480
so it always is a child I was always

1211
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,280
interested in plants and how they grow

1212
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,420
and

1213
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:58,619
then it led to me being thrown in jail

1214
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:01,200
and me wanting to get back at it and uh

1215
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:02,760
so I thought I'd be a seed distributor

1216
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,379
and it was a fun job too you know and

1217
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,960
running around the world looking for

1218
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,059
rare land race varieties or anything

1219
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,199
somebody was making in a different neck

1220
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,780
of the woods

1221
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:15,179
basically you didn't you you try and

1222
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,240
have a look at how this person was

1223
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:21,239
making seeds whether or not they were a

1224
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,919
closet breeder or whether or not they

1225
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:26,159
were doing it properly

1226
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:29,579
so I'd have fun traveling all over the

1227
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,440
world to go and visit these people often

1228
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:35,700
before I bought their seats I want to

1229
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,318
see how they actually made them and God

1230
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:39,838
knows they might just buy them from

1231
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:42,719
someone else and sell them to you

1232
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,480
it might just be a middleman

1233
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,338
I got interested then and all the

1234
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,960
different varieties and seeing how

1235
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:51,480
people would grow them

1236
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,059
in different environments

1237
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,740
and being able to share this knowledge

1238
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,920
because these people obviously they're

1239
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,838
living in a very secure environment they

1240
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,059
don't have many associations with other

1241
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:06,239
people because they're doing something

1242
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:08,460
that needs to be kept secret

1243
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,318
so a lot of them they're only outlet has

1244
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:14,519
been through the internet

1245
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:17,519
and being able to communicate with other

1246
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:19,619
like-minded people anonymously is

1247
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,880
important for that and they've been able

1248
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:23,700
to do that

1249
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,019
now for how many years have we had icmag

1250
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:28,318
going I think

1251
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:33,059
not 18 19 years something like I think

1252
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:34,980
we've been going since 2003 2004.

1253
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:36,240
so they're able to do that through the

1254
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,460
site

1255
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,879
and it's a good way

1256
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,099
for people to mingle

1257
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,780
to uh

1258
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:47,818
make friends

1259
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,160
there's a lot of people a lot of friends

1260
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:52,558
that have been made through the internet

1261
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,838
and a lot of those people who never have

1262
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,700
met each other in real life and perhaps

1263
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:59,179
never will but they've still got a

1264
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:59,179
friend online

1265
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,599
yeah that's a brilliant point you make

1266
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,640
and I guess I would be interested to

1267
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,980
know was there ever a point where you

1268
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:09,598
realized how big I see mag was getting

1269
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,920
and the influence it was having like

1270
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,720
when you're going around checking these

1271
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,519
different breeders could you feel that

1272
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,379
this was getting a lot of momentum or

1273
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:19,139
was it still just sort of relatively

1274
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,640
seeming like it was controlled

1275
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:22,799
uh

1276
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,500
I don't really know

1277
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,460
um like I say I'm not

1278
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:31,980
educated particularly that far

1279
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,599
academically or you know I haven't

1280
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,099
haven't been through a college or

1281
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,559
university

1282
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:43,680
so maybe that's my excuse to say that uh

1283
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,260
yeah I saw things moving forward but I

1284
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:50,699
just wanted to do what I always did

1285
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:54,180
which was travel and meet new breeders

1286
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:57,598
and Growers and either get new seeds

1287
00:55:54,179 --> 00:56:00,299
made or buy seeds that were already made

1288
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:04,039
by these breeders and then bring them

1289
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,539
back and then the whole distribution

1290
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,519
outfit would take care of the

1291
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:10,380
distribution I wouldn't have to do all

1292
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,259
the emails

1293
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:16,680
I wouldn't have to do all the work

1294
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,839
setting up websites anything like that I

1295
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:22,078
just go around the world and meet people

1296
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:24,119
buy seeds trade seeds grow plants

1297
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,460
whatever it takes that's all I was

1298
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:29,519
interested in

1299
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:33,240
um so it was reliable upon

1300
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:36,719
you know a core of people back in the UK

1301
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:39,539
to keep the whole distribution up and of

1302
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:42,480
course when I get into trouble

1303
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:45,058
like I did in 2013

1304
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,740
and the people that were working for me

1305
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:49,619
and with me

1306
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:52,078
got the heebie-jeebies naturally because

1307
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:55,559
they'll think it's like Domino's you

1308
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:58,800
know I'm gonna be next

1309
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:01,500
so obviously uh

1310
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,260
work kind of slacks off or you're not

1311
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,000
there to monitor it you're stuck in some

1312
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:09,540
stinking jail in

1313
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,519
in 40 degrees celsius under a tin roof

1314
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:13,380
in the Philippines

1315
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,780
so

1316
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,579
you're not functioning the best that you

1317
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,839
can either

1318
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:21,059
um

1319
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:24,299
with your brain

1320
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:26,940
while we're on that topic do you think

1321
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,220
that when you read people online who

1322
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,720
maybe you know have some gripe with you

1323
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:32,219
maybe with some seeds they bought or

1324
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,199
whatever do you think that like that

1325
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:35,639
essentially was the circumstances in

1326
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,618
which that happened like maybe it

1327
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:39,179
happened while you're in jail and like

1328
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:42,079
it was out of your control sort of thing

1329
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:44,639
or what's your thoughts on that

1330
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:48,500
ah yeah I mean

1331
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:51,900
the whole mail order seed industry is

1332
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,480
it's it's full of pitfalls and and

1333
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,480
difficulties uh many levels from the

1334
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,039
buyer's perspective and also from the

1335
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,179
seller's perspective

1336
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,779
because

1337
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:06,899
you know for years I went through

1338
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:09,599
working within that industry and

1339
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:13,980
you know with with the way that the male

1340
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,720
is uh having P.O boxes that certain

1341
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,940
postmen figure out

1342
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:22,919
there's there's money going to those

1343
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:25,260
boxes so so orders disappear you send

1344
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,639
orders out and they come back to you six

1345
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,460
months later

1346
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,618
uh after you've resent the order twice

1347
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,199
you know it's it's a

1348
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:38,700
crazy world that whole mail order world

1349
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:42,779
and nothing is perfect nothing works

1350
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:45,239
you know like clockwork it's uh

1351
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,920
yeah we've we had all sorts of problems

1352
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:48,779
and then of course you got Staffing

1353
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,519
problems because you're in a cannabis

1354
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,280
industry most of the people working with

1355
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:55,798
you are stoned anyway and occasionally

1356
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,660
people make big mistakes because this

1357
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,159
don't or they forget things I mean I've

1358
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:03,659
done it myself before

1359
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:06,239
so it's not very accurate sometimes

1360
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:09,000
because of the nature of business I I

1361
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:12,419
guess you could put it that way

1362
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,639
yeah certainly I guess just to you know

1363
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:17,099
put it to rest to anyone out there

1364
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,558
Whoever has had any issues you know sort

1365
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:21,838
of accusing of like any sort of issues

1366
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:23,519
with seeds or like replacing seeds or

1367
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,139
anything are you saying there's

1368
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,818
absolutely no truth to that you know

1369
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:28,920
it's just the the general inherent

1370
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:31,318
issues of the system

1371
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,200
I don't know yet there's all sorts of

1372
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:37,079
this industrial Espionage as well in

1373
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:38,939
there there's other seed companies that

1374
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:43,200
will try and build themselves up by

1375
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:46,500
putting you down uh you get fake uh

1376
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:49,379
customers sometimes who demand that they

1377
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:52,139
ordered and yet they didn't or that they

1378
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,420
didn't receive their order and yet they

1379
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:56,838
did you should have seen back in the

1380
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:00,838
Heyday of it and some of the chargebacks

1381
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:03,659
uh we used to get were horrendous you

1382
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:06,838
know looking at five grand a month or

1383
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:08,519
something people that receive the seeds

1384
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:10,739
or whatever it is that you're sending

1385
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:13,619
them and uh

1386
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:15,479
didn't say that they didn't because you

1387
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:18,119
don't end up with a signature because

1388
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,639
you're sending it through regular posts

1389
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,619
and there's no actual proof that the

1390
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,179
person received it when perhaps they did

1391
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,079
or perhaps they didn't you you never

1392
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:27,298
know

1393
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,960
uh this is the whole thing with the

1394
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:34,259
International Post it's so unpredictable

1395
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,720
it can work nine times out of ten or it

1396
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,160
can only work one time out of the ten it

1397
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,558
depends where you live and what happens

1398
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:43,798
on the way

1399
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,000
yeah certainly certainly so I mean if we

1400
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:46,500
loop back to what we're talking about

1401
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,900
before you're going around to different

1402
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,940
breeders houses sort of trading seeds

1403
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,519
getting a feel for the land well is

1404
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:55,200
there anyone's grow or Bud who like it

1405
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,338
really stood out in your mind is like

1406
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,078
memorable where you were just really

1407
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:00,719
Blown Away

1408
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,318
uh yeah there's a lot of different

1409
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,118
breeders a lot of different characters

1410
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:08,099
and it's difficult to

1411
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:10,798
you know to put them

1412
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:15,000
in a list who you think's better or

1413
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:17,039
worse but um who stands out

1414
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,358
I guess breed of Steve more than

1415
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:24,139
anything a Canadian uh breeder he had a

1416
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,858
company called spice of life

1417
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:28,019
seeds

1418
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:30,779
very interesting guy

1419
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:34,259
very smart

1420
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:37,500
and uh yeah I used to go I used to drive

1421
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:40,079
to Switzerland he he got himself set up

1422
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,179
with a Factory in Switzerland for a

1423
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,579
while and I used to drive out there

1424
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:46,199
and see what he was growing you know he

1425
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:48,240
was really into making this variety

1426
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:53,358
called sweet tooth

1427
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:57,118
and uh several others a lot of them were

1428
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:59,699
canada-based varieties or USA based

1429
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,519
varieties that he be coming to contact

1430
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:04,858
with and made seeds from

1431
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,679
but yeah there was one of the more

1432
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:10,558
interesting readers I'd say

1433
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,480
would be breeder Steve and of course Sam

1434
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,460
Skunk Man as well you could sit there

1435
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,318
and he could ramble on for hours just

1436
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:19,740
interesting stuff if you can understand

1437
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:22,500
it you know because it's quite technical

1438
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:25,739
a lot of the time

1439
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,239
but yeah if if you want to look at

1440
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:30,058
people like him

1441
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:33,298
yeah it's uh somebody that's been

1442
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:36,480
eclipsed by this plant all of their life

1443
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:38,400
and had something to do with it in one

1444
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,760
form or another has made a living out of

1445
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,119
it so is part of the industry

1446
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,500
yeah definitely definitely I mean I was

1447
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,599
also going to say we're lucky enough to

1448
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,358
have um had breeder Steve on the show

1449
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:53,039
he's definitely uh a very smart guy

1450
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,318
interesting character and I remember I

1451
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:58,259
think he actually told her a story about

1452
01:02:55,318 --> 01:03:02,179
being on an Autobahn with you in a fancy

1453
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,180
car or something going very fast

1454
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,079
yeah yeah obviously we have some funny

1455
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,000
experiences sometimes

1456
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:11,400
yeah I used to have this very fast car

1457
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,099
and used to drive it over to Switzerland

1458
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,079
and commute to Amsterdam in it and there

1459
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:18,980
was quite a few Adventures associated

1460
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:22,519
with its travels

1461
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:25,980
suitcases full of seeds and

1462
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:28,858
getting pulled over by the uh

1463
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:31,440
who was it by the Belgian police wasn't

1464
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:33,179
it no just before I went into France

1465
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,400
from Belgium

1466
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:37,739
and then them finding a couple of

1467
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,380
Samsonite suitcases for the the seeds

1468
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:43,139
that I just bought in Amsterdam because

1469
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:46,559
I used to go on a a couple of times a

1470
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:48,779
month I go through all the breeders in

1471
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,760
Amsterdam and just buy a whole bunch of

1472
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,160
seeds and then drive them back to the UK

1473
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,579
rather than risk sending them through

1474
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:55,578
the post

1475
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,980
and of course I'd have to travel through

1476
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:04,500
Belgium and France to get to the channel

1477
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:07,079
port to get to uh

1478
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,599
Calais before I could take the channel

1479
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:12,539
tunnel over to the UK

1480
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,960
and yeah they nabbed me once in Belgium

1481
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:18,539
and it in the diff it ended up with them

1482
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,039
taking all the seeds that I had in the

1483
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:22,798
back of the car

1484
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:25,139
they did same me for I think about four

1485
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,420
hours and just let me go

1486
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:30,118
after searching the car

1487
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:32,099
quite well I think they were looking for

1488
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:35,358
class A drugs they were surprised to

1489
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:35,359
find seeds you know

1490
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:42,780
and the funny thing was as I drove away

1491
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:44,880
I'd before I'd stashed half of spliff in

1492
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:47,220
the sunglasses

1493
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,380
capsule just above your head if you're

1494
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:51,598
driving that car

1495
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,400
and I popped that down and they hadn't

1496
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,318
even looked in there so I had half a

1497
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,780
split was driving away from the Belgium

1498
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:00,599
to Lisa just taking I don't know about

1499
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,760
50 grams worth of seeds off me

1500
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,940
and there's me smoking a spliff thinking

1501
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,980
I'm lucky to get away with that

1502
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,599
and I said to them when they took the

1503
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,179
seeds away what I do they said I'll get

1504
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:15,798
an attorney thinking geez the attorney's

1505
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:15,798
going to cost more than the seeds did

1506
01:05:16,338 --> 01:05:20,818
that's brilliant you know there's

1507
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:21,900
there's all these pitfalls I mean if

1508
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:24,358
you're

1509
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:27,240
if you're a businessman and you're

1510
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:28,980
you're trying to distribute cannabis

1511
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:31,379
seeds around the world it's a lot more

1512
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:37,639
difficult than than if you were into

1513
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:37,640
doing Distributing shoes or plates or

1514
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:43,558
there's a lot more pitfalls particularly

1515
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,179
legally just driving through a country

1516
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:46,500
with something that's legal in the

1517
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:48,480
country you bought it from in the

1518
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,679
country you're going to that's what

1519
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,199
happens

1520
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,879
yeah look that's interesting sounds

1521
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:56,460
sounds stressful did you find it

1522
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:00,000
stressful or is all pretty laid back

1523
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,920
all right I'm quite used to

1524
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,780
you know the Customs organizations

1525
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,139
around the world and the thought of

1526
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:09,839
being detained and all that so you kind

1527
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:12,960
of preempt these things you might do a

1528
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:15,420
trip 10 to 20 times and think oh yeah

1529
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,619
that's fine but you know in the back of

1530
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,500
your mind

1531
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:22,798
that there is a potential that you could

1532
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:25,380
come unstuck but you kind of you work

1533
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:27,538
that into the risk factor

1534
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,740
and you either take the chance or you

1535
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:31,319
don't

1536
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:34,139
and if it happens at least you prepared

1537
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:35,400
yourself psychologically uh for the

1538
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:37,199
event

1539
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,180
that you're kind of like oh yeah I

1540
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,118
thought about this before this this was

1541
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:44,000
going to happen sooner or later so you

1542
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,920
can kind of eat that

1543
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,179
and not get too freaked out about it as

1544
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:53,338
if it's a big surprise

1545
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:55,919
yeah sure sure

1546
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:58,199
I'm always interested to know

1547
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,420
I got I have this like theory in life

1548
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:02,699
where it's like any job you can think of

1549
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,838
like some of the biggest challenges like

1550
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:05,399
it's not the things you would think

1551
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:06,960
about it's other stuff so I want to know

1552
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,298
when when you were doing the seed

1553
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,920
Boutique and I see mag was sort of at

1554
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:12,719
its peak what were some of the

1555
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,400
challenges that like the general public

1556
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:15,659
was probably not even aware of that you

1557
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,858
were dealing with and you're like you

1558
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:18,779
know it's calling causing you

1559
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:20,759
frustration you're like oh people knew

1560
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,140
it would be like make my life so much

1561
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,539
easier like what made the job

1562
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:26,699
challenging

1563
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:29,700
I think it's drama

1564
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:30,779
you know if you let too much drama into

1565
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:33,058
your life

1566
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:36,298
if the people that

1567
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:40,339
you're in regular contact with daily

1568
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:42,719
have ulterior motives if they are

1569
01:07:40,338 --> 01:07:45,480
pretending to be something they're not

1570
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,038
and you were actually fooled by it

1571
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,440
and you've taken people into your

1572
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:54,119
confidence perhaps you shouldn't have

1573
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:56,760
and then it can all fall apart uh

1574
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:58,200
quite quickly if you don't feel that you

1575
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,000
have the security within your own

1576
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,318
business that you thought you did have

1577
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,900
before

1578
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:06,358
and this happened uh

1579
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:08,099
because it's not only the business but

1580
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:11,279
the people that run it they have their

1581
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:13,200
own personal relationships of course and

1582
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,259
uh their interactions with other people

1583
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:19,619
and it's the success of the business is

1584
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:22,920
to a greater degree I think based upon

1585
01:08:19,619 --> 01:08:24,599
them being in harmony than anything else

1586
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,600
because if you don't have the chemistry

1587
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,179
of the people that work for the business

1588
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,880
correct then the business isn't going to

1589
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:35,579
do well it'll pull itself apart

1590
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:39,659
and this started to happen because uh I

1591
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:41,759
broke up with my partner Nikki

1592
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:42,899
and we we had a partnership in the

1593
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,838
business

1594
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:48,059
both of us equal partnership and then

1595
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:50,640
the manager that I had at the time this

1596
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,560
Roger Thomas Clark otherwise known as

1597
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,420
plural of mongoose

1598
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,120
was kind of the manager of the mail

1599
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:01,140
order and they

1600
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:04,318
became an item they became a couple and

1601
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:07,319
they moved in to a house with each other

1602
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,600
and then they tried to take the business

1603
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:12,000
off me to skirt to scare all the people

1604
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,460
that were involved all the other

1605
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,338
employees

1606
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:18,838
uh with me with threats veiled threats

1607
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:22,198
and otherwise

1608
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:25,380
and it became nasty as if you know this

1609
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:29,039
business that I created with Nikki as

1610
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:30,719
hell of course uh suddenly it wasn't the

1611
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,359
beautiful business that I thought it was

1612
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:37,079
that somebody else is becoming bold and

1613
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,380
it turned kind of nasty and

1614
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:43,079
we had to certain events

1615
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:45,000
violence certain events of extreme

1616
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:47,818
emotional distress amongst the people

1617
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,859
involved and

1618
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:52,739
yeah it

1619
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:56,719
it was like a

1620
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:56,718
it turned into a bit of a beast

1621
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:03,359
I didn't enjoy it so much

1622
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,619
is this the uh the context around that

1623
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:10,639
Infamous video of I'll eat your mind

1624
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:10,640
yeah well that was

1625
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:16,019
kind of made as a gag

1626
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,480
um I think if you see in the beginning

1627
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,679
of it

1628
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:22,439
or at the end

1629
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:24,840
I'm saying cut because I asked the guy

1630
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:28,319
to film it and I told them that yeah I'm

1631
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:30,960
going to chastise uh Teflon in front of

1632
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,579
the camera because he was in cahoots

1633
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,399
with the mongoose

1634
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:37,380
and to film it because it might be

1635
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:38,339
interesting people might want to look at

1636
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:41,699
it

1637
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:43,800
so it was kind of I was had my mind set

1638
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:48,000
in The Long Good Friday that there's

1639
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:50,100
some movie some scene in a movie and I

1640
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,939
was very stoned at the time but okay

1641
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,440
let's give a Teflon some grief but not

1642
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:57,658
to the point of chucking him out the

1643
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,119
window I never had that intention

1644
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:01,859
it was just kind of a bit of drama that

1645
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:04,500
we played out

1646
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:07,920
that was all that was

1647
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,979
and then Mongoose okay Mongoose got hold

1648
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,260
of it and then used it thought he he was

1649
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:15,718
using it as something really bad to

1650
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,780
throw at me and put online

1651
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:21,739
so and he entertained a bunch more other

1652
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:21,738
people I suppose

1653
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,179
yeah interesting we had a few listeners

1654
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:29,100
who asked about sort of just your

1655
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,719
general Reflections on having work with

1656
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,360
Mongoose I guess by sort of what you've

1657
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,800
said here you sort of like I don't know

1658
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:35,880
would you say you regret it or it's just

1659
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,179
one of those things where you like

1660
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,140
learned her lesson

1661
01:11:38,179 --> 01:11:42,420
sometimes you've got to look at yourself

1662
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:45,840
in the mirror and say that you've been

1663
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:48,600
naive you know that uh you've let people

1664
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,279
into your life that haven't been

1665
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,780
beneficial to it

1666
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:54,899
you know I haven't even been neutral

1667
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:56,519
that have been bad uh your association

1668
01:11:54,899 --> 01:12:00,359
with those people

1669
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:03,120
has not ended up well put it that way so

1670
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:06,738
yeah you can have regrets that what's

1671
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,738
the point it's in the past now

1672
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:13,759
um as far as whatever Mongoose has done

1673
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,760
I think now he's um

1674
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:20,279
be sitting in a I don't know is it a

1675
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:23,819
nursing home or a jail in New York

1676
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:27,479
still waiting on his sentencing

1677
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:30,479
and he plea bargained down to I think

1678
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:34,139
just being charged with one case

1679
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:36,678
and he's uh he's looking at 240 months I

1680
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,679
think it is

1681
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:42,479
in jail that would be minus whatever is

1682
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:43,920
served

1683
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,079
well

1684
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,319
reading through the papers because as

1685
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,019
the trial goes on or a case goes on in

1686
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:55,559
the USA you can actually follow it and

1687
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:58,020
one of my ex-employees has been

1688
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,100
following the case of the Mongoose at

1689
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:02,659
the moment

1690
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:05,400
and of course he's accused of being

1691
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:08,698
instrumentally involved with the Silk

1692
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:11,819
Road website that would sell

1693
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:13,919
every type of drug imaginable there was

1694
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,719
a few kids that ordered with their mum's

1695
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,119
credit cards and died of heroin

1696
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,260
overdoses or something through that

1697
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:22,198
website

1698
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,659
so he was involved with something that I

1699
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:23,939
would never touch

1700
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:25,399
[Music]

1701
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:29,460
um

1702
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:31,079
and now it's you know he's trying I

1703
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,239
think he's trying to delay his sentence

1704
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:35,880
in as much as he can because

1705
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:39,119
he's had a fall from his bunk in jail

1706
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:42,659
he's uh complaining constantly about not

1707
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:44,219
having a pen and other things and that

1708
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:45,539
only been reading through the case

1709
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,119
lately

1710
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:50,779
what's going on with him

1711
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:52,920
and they're trying to get him sentenced

1712
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:54,658
I don't know

1713
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,239
good

1714
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:59,639
anybody in the prison system you know I

1715
01:13:57,238 --> 01:14:04,339
have a kind of a little

1716
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,340
feeling for because it's no fun

1717
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,380
maybe it's something to do with Karma

1718
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,420
with him

1719
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,920
because I see I've seen him do so many

1720
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:16,800
other people wrong

1721
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,460
maybe it's coming back on him now

1722
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:23,579
we'll find out I think he's sentenced to

1723
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,560
supposed to be some sometime around the

1724
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:28,319
end of September

1725
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:30,659
coming up there you go we'll have to

1726
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,880
follow that one to see what happens

1727
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:35,039
I think at this point you know you've

1728
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,920
been talking about negative associations

1729
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:40,800
everyone is waiting to hear us talk

1730
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,020
about res you know he's a focal and

1731
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,420
polarizing figure in the Cannabis

1732
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,219
community and especially in history what

1733
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:49,440
was your relationship with him like and

1734
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:51,719
reflecting back on it how do you view it

1735
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,399
now and I guess you know whether you

1736
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:55,500
want to answer now or later we'll we'll

1737
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:58,019
go into the the whole incident with

1738
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:00,600
Dutch grown and whatnot

1739
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:02,280
yeah uh res

1740
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,500
well

1741
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:06,899
as you read through you spend hours

1742
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:10,140
looking at a forum site and you read

1743
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:12,719
through it some members stick out more

1744
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:14,820
than others for whatever reasons maybe

1745
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,939
they use language that

1746
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:19,380
is outrageous or maybe they've got some

1747
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:21,238
sort of humor

1748
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:23,039
that you can

1749
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:25,678
you can jive with

1750
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:26,760
uh there's always seemed kind of

1751
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,000
interesting

1752
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:32,460
to me and

1753
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,800
he he had a kind of a following of

1754
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,179
people that either they loved him or

1755
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,820
they hated him

1756
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:40,020
you know he had this he got a reaction

1757
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:41,639
out of people

1758
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:45,739
I think because it was always very

1759
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,739
abusive to everybody maybe that was it

1760
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:53,698
whatever it was he has some sort of

1761
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:55,859
pizzazz you know

1762
01:15:53,698 --> 01:15:58,500
um and uh

1763
01:15:55,859 --> 01:16:00,658
he seemed to know a bit about breeding

1764
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,460
and he was making seeds eventually and

1765
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:04,198
he wanted an outlet for them so I

1766
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,000
suggested hey you know I've got an

1767
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:08,099
outlet why not

1768
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,039
so like any other breeders I started

1769
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:13,380
bending seats that came from him over

1770
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,060
the years

1771
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,400
and

1772
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,620
generally they were quite popular you

1773
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,500
know he had his detractors

1774
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:25,800
and he would voice citrusly attack them

1775
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:28,140
too on the boards of overgrow or icy

1776
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,900
make sometimes I think I had to ban him

1777
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:34,199
I even had the banner is at one point

1778
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:37,439
and for a short period of time

1779
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:39,359
yeah he seemed like before I even met

1780
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,979
him he seemed

1781
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:45,119
quite uh

1782
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:47,218
an open and interesting character

1783
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,300
or maybe it was just a Persona he'd

1784
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:50,760
created

1785
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,760
for use on the internet I wasn't to know

1786
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:57,020
until I met him of course

1787
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,020
and what was that like

1788
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:02,340
when I did meet him

1789
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:05,040
he's a very slender

1790
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,140
um and a Haggard looking dude

1791
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,679
like he'd uh

1792
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:12,960
he'd worn life on his face a few times

1793
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:16,760
and

1794
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:20,460
yeah he he was interesting he was he was

1795
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:23,699
conversationally quite lucid and we

1796
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:25,079
talked a lot about different things

1797
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:28,139
um over the years build up a

1798
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:31,439
relationship as a vendor and him the

1799
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:33,600
producer of various seats and we he

1800
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,939
would allow him to go and build up his

1801
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,820
release or whatever it was and then we'd

1802
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:40,799
do a pre-release on seed Bay and

1803
01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:43,139
get some seeds out there people would

1804
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,260
grow them and then if they turned out

1805
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:48,900
well then others would want to buy more

1806
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:51,659
oh he had this ongoing

1807
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:54,359
kind of business deal with him

1808
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:57,119
he would it was very difficult to pay

1809
01:17:54,359 --> 01:18:00,599
him you know so you could only pay him

1810
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:03,000
in cash and uh

1811
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:05,280
you know you couldn't just send it like

1812
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,439
we with the other breeders or whatever

1813
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,658
it was most of them you could just pay

1814
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,019
them bank to bank or whatever it was

1815
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:15,719
they didn't want to play portrayal uh

1816
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:17,280
yeah and I think one time he was on his

1817
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:20,579
way back and he got caught with some

1818
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:23,279
cash or some seeds got caught he was

1819
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:24,719
sending coming this way and the cops

1820
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:29,099
wrote him in

1821
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:32,760
little did I know about it at the time

1822
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:35,280
um that he he'd already had I think two

1823
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:38,820
strikes he lived down in Florida and

1824
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,319
he'd had a some sort of cocaine uh

1825
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:44,819
charge some

1826
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:46,979
yet some federal charge against him

1827
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:48,840
anyway it was back in the times I think

1828
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:53,238
when there's like three three strikes

1829
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,239
and you're out it's this whole thing so

1830
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:58,560
if he got busted for something else then

1831
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:01,380
they could throw him away for a for a

1832
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,679
very long time in jail

1833
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:08,640
this is what I think led to him turning

1834
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:11,579
informant and grassing up a lot of

1835
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:13,739
people over there like chemdog and

1836
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:15,960
Dutch grown and a bunch of other people

1837
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:18,059
that the police pulled in and then

1838
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,119
squeezed them as they do

1839
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:24,239
and so it goes and I was one of the ones

1840
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:26,460
that got turned over

1841
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:29,639
The Better or For Worse I mean they

1842
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:30,840
probably I heard that they'd gone to

1843
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,500
um

1844
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,420
after they took res down and then turned

1845
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:38,698
him into an informant

1846
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:41,699
he told him about Dutch grown and they'd

1847
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:44,399
gone over there and they'd seen my name

1848
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:46,379
on seed packets what I wanted to know is

1849
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,920
this Gypsy Nevada

1850
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:53,159
and of course they'd handed me over as a

1851
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,199
the UK distributor

1852
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:57,238
and at that time I was out in the

1853
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,979
Philippines I was living there I was

1854
01:19:57,238 --> 01:20:02,218
resting

1855
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:04,399
and so that's where they they I was not

1856
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:07,260
as if I was hiding

1857
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:10,198
uh I was being quite open I didn't think

1858
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,219
I had anything to worry about really but

1859
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:15,539
uh

1860
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:16,800
obviously I I did and it ended up

1861
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:18,539
with me

1862
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,400
being detained

1863
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:23,219
excuse me I've got the burps

1864
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:25,019
no problem you strike me as someone

1865
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:26,819
who's sort of

1866
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,219
um I get the vibe you sort of made your

1867
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:31,619
peace with it all do you still hold him

1868
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:33,658
quiet personally accountable for it all

1869
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:35,819
and as a follow-up like do you have any

1870
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:38,099
thoughts on the fact he's like back and

1871
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:39,479
active on Instagram

1872
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,120
yeah

1873
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:45,299
you know I could be bitter

1874
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:46,460
than I could feed off some sort of hate

1875
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,560
and

1876
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:53,158
uh want to

1877
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:56,820
you know get some sort of Revenge or

1878
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:59,819
whatever it is but I I can't muster up

1879
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:02,939
the energy to bother it just seems like

1880
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:05,819
a not a very productive endeavor

1881
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:07,979
to go after that I'm not really into

1882
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:10,139
tearing people down

1883
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:11,399
if he's come through it all and can

1884
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:14,340
manage to

1885
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,500
keep a living out of life

1886
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:18,480
I think he's got more to worry about the

1887
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,219
people he grasped up in the states than

1888
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,539
me

1889
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:23,539
I'm a long way away

1890
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:29,099
you know we all have to pay for our sins

1891
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,659
at some point I guess

1892
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,940
and uh

1893
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:34,619
you know I always like Ransom I thought

1894
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:36,539
it was a bit of a crazy guy he was

1895
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:38,880
always popping pills too as always on

1896
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:41,880
these Pharmaceuticals whatever it was

1897
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,039
but uh he visited me a couple of times

1898
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,199
when I was in the Philippines and I got

1899
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:50,460
along fairly well with him so I didn't

1900
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:53,579
have you know I didn't hate the guy or I

1901
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:57,060
don't really get into heat anyway so

1902
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:59,579
and okay well I'm I'm gonna say that

1903
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:02,100
this guy has to go to jail indeed do 20

1904
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:05,219
30 years for me

1905
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:08,420
I mean who's going to do that honestly

1906
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:10,920
you're going to go to jail for me

1907
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:13,199
they came after me anyway and then in

1908
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,020
the deaf they couldn't get me

1909
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,000
um I've got a clear Clean Slate now

1910
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:20,219
they've dropped the charges in the court

1911
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,619
in Maine and they've got the proofs

1912
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:24,960
they've got the original uh court

1913
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:28,019
documents saying that there's no charge

1914
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:30,539
against me and it's been dropped

1915
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:33,120
but it really screwed my life up for a

1916
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:36,300
long time cost me an arm and a leg yeah

1917
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:40,158
led to a more simple life which which

1918
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,159
I'm quite enjoying to tell you the truth

1919
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:45,420
that's interesting to hear it's come

1920
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:48,299
full circle I like that I like that did

1921
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:51,239
out of curiosity a lot of people say

1922
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:53,159
that um res did a lot of his work out of

1923
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:55,439
a few tents which people try to

1924
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:57,539
criticize but I always thought isn't

1925
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:59,519
that more like impressive because he's

1926
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:01,619
regarded as having some pretty pretty

1927
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,179
bloody good work have you heard anything

1928
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:05,219
about that did you see anything like

1929
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:07,980
that when you were with him

1930
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:10,140
no actually I never saw anything where

1931
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:11,519
is it ever grown because I've never

1932
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:15,179
really visited

1933
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:19,320
New York much at all since the 1980s I

1934
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:21,840
was in New York in the 80s but no I I

1935
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:24,840
never went to see any of his girls but I

1936
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,480
did know some people that did and they

1937
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:29,880
said they weren't really a large concern

1938
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:30,539
to say the least

1939
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,659
um

1940
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:36,238
but you know it's stayed with breeders

1941
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:38,219
again you know some of very few of them

1942
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:40,799
hardly any of them

1943
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:43,079
do it what's considered the right way by

1944
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,779
growing out for selection

1945
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:48,119
tens of thousands of plants you know at

1946
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:49,920
least a thousand they cannot they only

1947
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:52,439
can do it within the space that they

1948
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,179
have so if they've got a closet they

1949
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:56,219
could still make seeds

1950
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:57,960
like you can still make children in a

1951
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:00,319
council house and you can make them in a

1952
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:04,279
mansion you know

1953
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:06,658
yeah a fair point a fair point

1954
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:08,939
interestingly you were one of the first

1955
01:24:06,658 --> 01:24:11,279
people to pick up bog what was your

1956
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:14,099
friendship with bog like

1957
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:17,759
a book was always entertaining wasn't he

1958
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:21,000
in a kind of risque body brought it on

1959
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:24,119
kinky way the way he would describe how

1960
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:28,380
he would play with his female plants or

1961
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:30,238
whatever it was I just like this is this

1962
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:33,420
broad sense of humor because I know that

1963
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:35,819
humor is a good way to teach people you

1964
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:38,699
if once people are laughing they're more

1965
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:43,259
likely to hang on every word you say

1966
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:46,019
so book had the uh kind of skill

1967
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:48,780
to write down stuff that would make you

1968
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:51,179
laugh and wince and kind of cringe or

1969
01:24:48,779 --> 01:24:53,639
whatever it was it was an interesting

1970
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:56,579
character just in the way he wrote

1971
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:58,320
so good afternoon that way and then of

1972
01:24:56,579 --> 01:25:00,300
course I said to him at one point I used

1973
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:01,738
to send him three seeds because he would

1974
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,679
always grow them out

1975
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:07,439
and make some glowing reports sometimes

1976
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:10,079
and I said why don't you make seeds from

1977
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,178
the seeds I send you so he decided to

1978
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,279
become a breeder and that's how he

1979
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:17,340
started boxes and

1980
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:20,340
the rest is history well he's not with

1981
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:24,060
us anymore I think he died last year or

1982
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:25,980
the year before not too long ago and I

1983
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,719
hope he's resting in peace

1984
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:29,119
and he's got plenty of bulk bubble with

1985
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,800
him

1986
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:34,079
certainly Victor he came over to

1987
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:37,739
Amsterdam a couple of times as well

1988
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:42,000
he used to be a paramedic so he'd have

1989
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:44,399
quite quite a bit of life experience I'd

1990
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,679
say anybody who works in that profession

1991
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:50,219
would do

1992
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:52,739
um and he did some things with me like

1993
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:55,619
we drove through the German order barns

1994
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:58,019
at speed it's in a fast jaguar and I let

1995
01:25:55,619 --> 01:26:00,420
him drive and then I drove we went over

1996
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:01,800
the mountains and yeah it was It was

1997
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,940
kind of idyllic he had a good laugh

1998
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,159
together

1999
01:26:02,939 --> 01:26:07,138
it's a good character sounds brilliant

2000
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:09,000
and that's what it's about personalities

2001
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:11,819
and characters you know that's what I

2002
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,500
enjoy most uh getting around to meet

2003
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:15,299
these people and of course the the

2004
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,039
lovely plants that they're involved with

2005
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:20,880
generally as well

2006
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:23,399
that's an interest too but uh I've been

2007
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,159
able to travel and meet people

2008
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:29,399
why not you can always stay at home and

2009
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:33,299
grow but that's the options you have

2010
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:37,019
generally I choose to be on the road

2011
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:40,020
but if you're raising your own kids at

2012
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:41,639
home with your missus you don't want to

2013
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,040
be absent too often

2014
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:48,060
so at this stage in my life I'm spending

2015
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:50,698
more time around the house I suppose

2016
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:52,500
yeah certainly and uh yeah I didn't

2017
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:55,859
mention before you know rest in peace

2018
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:58,079
bog another character who have to give a

2019
01:26:55,859 --> 01:27:01,679
rest in peace to who you have a history

2020
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:04,139
with sub cool who passed about a year

2021
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,819
before bog did what was your

2022
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,039
relationship with sub cool like I mean

2023
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:10,679
there's obviously that notable story him

2024
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:12,420
on the forums when you got arrested how

2025
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:13,760
do you reflect on the relationship you

2026
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,920
guys had

2027
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:19,860
subcool is another guy that in was out

2028
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,260
of the early overgrow days they give us

2029
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:24,179
some weed base even before that what was

2030
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:26,460
that variety he was connected with

2031
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:29,699
Jack's cleaner that was it

2032
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,319
was all into the Jack's cleaner thing

2033
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:33,839
and uh

2034
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:36,238
I got to know him a bit online and then

2035
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,500
I think at one point he got into quite a

2036
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,259
bit of trouble

2037
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:42,899
and I said uh to him well why don't you

2038
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:45,360
come over to Europe you know maybe if it

2039
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:47,339
works out if you're the right person for

2040
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:49,099
it I can give you some work

2041
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:51,779
and uh

2042
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:53,039
I'll let you stay in a place there when

2043
01:27:51,779 --> 01:27:56,399
you come over

2044
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:59,039
so he did eventually he came over and at

2045
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,379
that time it was around about

2046
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:03,060
it was the first Cannabis Cup that I had

2047
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:06,000
a stall in

2048
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:08,760
and I was advertised in the stash boxes

2049
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,560
and of course the seed company

2050
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:14,699
and

2051
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,659
I kind of got him to help out is that

2052
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:17,759
um

2053
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:19,198
trying to set it up

2054
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,500
and

2055
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:25,279
after you've been over for a short while

2056
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:28,738
he brought another friend of his over

2057
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:32,158
blunt blunt I think his name was

2058
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:33,959
I don't know his his real name that he

2059
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:35,519
called him blunt

2060
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,279
and

2061
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:41,040
he also asked if he could stay at this

2062
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:43,319
place I I was renting this house at 43

2063
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:45,359
zadike

2064
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:48,359
um it used to be owned by Morris de

2065
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:51,359
hernand who is a famous hash Smuggler

2066
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:53,099
and it was a crazy place with a lot of

2067
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:56,519
different bedrooms and different levels

2068
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:58,920
and what have you and at that time I was

2069
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:01,020
given because I was riding the weed

2070
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:04,079
World magazine they gave me this big

2071
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,480
plastic bucket full of uh various types

2072
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:09,380
of hash and weed I think there's 30 odd

2073
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:12,479
types of weed and maybe the same again

2074
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:14,819
different types of hash and sub coolant

2075
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:18,119
blunt sat down with me and we were

2076
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:20,158
trying to judge and so I was giving them

2077
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:22,079
a smoke of one variety and something

2078
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:25,099
else

2079
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:28,380
and these guys were always talking about

2080
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:31,760
harder drugs as well they were always

2081
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:33,600
talking about and

2082
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,380
Pharmaceuticals

2083
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,280
um

2084
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:38,279
yeah

2085
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:41,119
I forget the names of them

2086
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:45,000
pretty strong opiates or

2087
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:47,579
synthetic opiates that they were into

2088
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,679
like Percocets or something

2089
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:53,279
yeah

2090
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:56,158
is it vicod Vicodin yeah Vicodin yep

2091
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:58,019
that's a strong one I could then and

2092
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,179
some others

2093
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,940
um I I can't recollect there's nothing

2094
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:05,460
I've really been into

2095
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:06,658
those sort of things of serious pain

2096
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,639
relief

2097
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:11,779
and these guys didn't look like they

2098
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,779
were in serious pain

2099
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:18,539
anyway uh suffice to say that after I

2100
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,399
think a few varieties I tried and I just

2101
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:23,579
it's knocking me out so I had to go to

2102
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:25,500
bed and I woke up the next morning and

2103
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:29,359
soccer was running around saying there

2104
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,359
was his friend had died during the night

2105
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:35,039
what the hell

2106
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:37,800
is going on

2107
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:39,719
okay so sure enough

2108
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,880
this blunt guy

2109
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:43,380
had passed on in the night for whatever

2110
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:46,380
reason I mean

2111
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:49,460
I'm not sure but you know I could I

2112
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,460
could have my guesses

2113
01:30:51,859 --> 01:30:57,179
so this was the the notable incident

2114
01:30:54,899 --> 01:31:01,019
with uh Danny Boy

2115
01:30:57,179 --> 01:31:03,658
oh Danny that was his name yet Danny Boy

2116
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:07,199
oh blunties to call maybe that was his

2117
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:10,879
own name on online name was blunt

2118
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:14,039
but uh I mean in the house at the time

2119
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,239
we were starting from my company in the

2120
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:17,819
UK

2121
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:20,339
and it was about three different ladies

2122
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:23,519
and they're all freaking out

2123
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:26,300
and it's not every day you wake up

2124
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,639
and there's a big guy in the house

2125
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:31,739
and you don't even know the guy

2126
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:33,600
you know so I don't know if you've seen

2127
01:31:31,738 --> 01:31:36,539
some of their movies

2128
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,600
where what's the name of that movie I

2129
01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:41,519
saw once where they had a party and then

2130
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,500
they woke up the next morning there's a

2131
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,699
dead guy in the house it was just like

2132
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,619
that

2133
01:31:44,698 --> 01:31:49,319
and it kind of freaked everybody out

2134
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:50,819
knocked him off whack a bit

2135
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:53,819
and uh

2136
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:55,920
sub cool was just really losing it

2137
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:58,738
and I was trying to help him out and

2138
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:02,760
calm him down and realized that he was

2139
01:31:58,738 --> 01:32:04,759
agitating the women as well uh the

2140
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:08,940
ladies there who are very emotionally

2141
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:13,079
upset so I thought

2142
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:15,960
best if if we get in the hotel so we go

2143
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:17,698
so I've called 400 bucks and said I

2144
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,439
didn't go get a hotel because we can't

2145
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:21,539
deal with this right now you know we're

2146
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:23,158
busy as a company trying to do this

2147
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:26,039
Cannabis Cup Thing

2148
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:28,559
and this emotionally is upset in the

2149
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:31,560
whole house so it's better if you if you

2150
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:34,920
get a hotel and

2151
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:37,679
he was uh you know I'm not there as a

2152
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:39,658
psychologist because his buddy died you

2153
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:42,060
know for me it was it was I was trying

2154
01:32:39,658 --> 01:32:46,138
to deal with a the whole business thing

2155
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:48,179
is of keeping the store open the

2156
01:32:46,139 --> 01:32:49,679
Cannabis Cup and doing what we intended

2157
01:32:48,179 --> 01:32:50,399
to do while we were over there from

2158
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,779
England

2159
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:55,019
[Music]

2160
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:58,920
uh yeah it was it was difficult let's

2161
01:32:55,020 --> 01:33:01,560
put it that way maybe I was a bit brash

2162
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,239
maybe he was a bit too emotive about it

2163
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,300
I don't know how long he'd known the guy

2164
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:08,039
but it was as if he'd lost a brother it

2165
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,980
wasn't good

2166
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:13,380
yeah I think you know reflecting back on

2167
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:16,500
the chat I had with sub I think he did

2168
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:18,060
largely view Danny as a brother

2169
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,979
um that's interesting to hear your

2170
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:22,260
perspective yeah because I think when he

2171
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:23,939
said it he sort of viewed it as being

2172
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:26,340
kicked out of the house but of course

2173
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:27,479
you know we didn't really know about the

2174
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:29,100
effect he was having on the other

2175
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:30,479
housemates which is obviously a

2176
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:33,420
consideration

2177
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,919
yeah so to me morale was important and

2178
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:38,158
we were trying to do something there

2179
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:41,039
that we worked out months before

2180
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:42,899
and to get it done you know we couldn't

2181
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,119
be mourning this guy and be walking

2182
01:33:42,899 --> 01:33:46,619
around moping because this guy died in

2183
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,819
the house we didn't even know the guy

2184
01:33:46,619 --> 01:33:50,340
anyway

2185
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:52,380
so it was kind of removed it was sad but

2186
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:54,840
it was kind of removed for the fact that

2187
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:56,279
this guy was nothing to any of us it was

2188
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,239
just somebody that showed up the day

2189
01:33:56,279 --> 01:33:59,420
before

2190
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:01,678
literally

2191
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:05,279
some of the girls didn't even know that

2192
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:08,399
he was in the house in the first place

2193
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:10,439
certainly a very unforeseen event for

2194
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:12,238
sure how did and then how did that all

2195
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:14,399
pan out after that the event finished

2196
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,559
and you just ended up going home did you

2197
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:18,599
have any like follow-up investigation or

2198
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,179
they just accepted it as an accident

2199
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:24,179
well it was me also a bit concerned

2200
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:27,719
because I had this huge cachet of

2201
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:30,060
samples for the Cannabis Cup inside

2202
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:32,100
the house and I don't know what the

2203
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:33,840
other people there were what type of

2204
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:36,840
recreational drugs they might have had

2205
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,699
for their own use so no idea

2206
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:40,920
um and there was quite a compliment of

2207
01:34:38,698 --> 01:34:42,539
people in the house itself

2208
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,719
so

2209
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:46,859
yeah there was a concern for that but it

2210
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:49,679
turned out that there was no

2211
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:51,658
investigation or anything like that and

2212
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:55,260
they said that he had some sort of heart

2213
01:34:51,658 --> 01:34:58,979
attack uh something to do with his heart

2214
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:02,699
and that was all I ever heard about it

2215
01:34:58,979 --> 01:35:06,718
and then the next thing I do is sub call

2216
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:10,079
a bad mouth in me saying that I'd acted

2217
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:14,880
in a bad way or whatever I don't know

2218
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:17,340
uh basically telling some lies as well

2219
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,260
maybe he felt hard done by by my

2220
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,480
reaction to the whole thing

2221
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:25,139
it's sad but that's the way it is

2222
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:26,939
sometimes [ __ ] happens and maybe you

2223
01:35:25,139 --> 01:35:30,960
don't act the coolest on the block with

2224
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:33,479
it the way life goes

2225
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,880
yeah look certainly sounds like a very

2226
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:37,138
complex situation I imagine that there

2227
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:40,020
would have been a lot of competing

2228
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:42,060
interests at mind I mean you know

2229
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:44,520
obviously a rest in peace Danny Boy and

2230
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:46,739
sub and bog while we're on that topic

2231
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,900
you know I guess around that time we're

2232
01:35:46,738 --> 01:35:51,658
sort of around the time when we had the

2233
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:54,059
original incarnation of Brothers Grimm

2234
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:56,460
and I feel like you don't really hear

2235
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:58,860
much about Sly Mr Soul's still around

2236
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:01,020
and doing his thing but do you have any

2237
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:03,000
Recollections about slide or did you

2238
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:05,460
ever deal with The Brothers Grimm

2239
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,179
yeah I was I think I was this the second

2240
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:12,480
vendor ever to offer their seeds for

2241
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:14,699
sale after having stairway Richard

2242
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:15,539
Calrissian

2243
01:36:14,698 --> 01:36:18,359
um

2244
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:20,698
he was their initial vendor and then

2245
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:24,658
they wanted somebody in Europe

2246
01:36:20,698 --> 01:36:25,738
so I think it must have been 2001 or

2247
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:29,939
something

2248
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:32,459
21 years ago I became a vendor of

2249
01:36:29,939 --> 01:36:34,439
Brothers Grim seats they were very

2250
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:38,039
interesting in fact they're very

2251
01:36:34,439 --> 01:36:41,819
interesting to a lot of Dutch breeders

2252
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:45,600
um who taken them since then they made

2253
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:49,639
their own varieties or crosses

2254
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:53,159
female seeds and various others

2255
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:55,020
taken Cindy 99 and various other

2256
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:59,698
varieties that brother scrimmer put out

2257
01:36:55,020 --> 01:37:03,139
and created new hybrids with them

2258
01:36:59,698 --> 01:37:05,219
so yeah it became with me you know again

2259
01:37:03,139 --> 01:37:07,619
transatlantic not just going one way

2260
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:11,279
sending seeds to the states it became

2261
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:16,460
receiving seeds from USA breeders and

2262
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:16,460
then showing them to European breeders

2263
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:19,619
uh

2264
01:37:19,738 --> 01:37:24,718
that's interesting and did you ever have

2265
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:26,698
any specific Communications with Sly and

2266
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,020
I guess the reason why I ask is I've

2267
01:37:26,698 --> 01:37:30,419
heard some people describe Brothers

2268
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:32,340
grimmer's Soul was you know really good

2269
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:34,139
at the marketing and Sly I was doing

2270
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:37,319
more of the breeding did you have any

2271
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:39,539
info on that or not really

2272
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:42,539
um I never met Sly but I did meet Mr

2273
01:37:39,539 --> 01:37:45,658
Soul he came over to the UK you know

2274
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:49,500
maybe 20 years ago nearly

2275
01:37:45,658 --> 01:37:51,299
and uh I gave him a road over with me to

2276
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,939
Belgium

2277
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:56,760
in the car because I was doing my

2278
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:59,759
regular commute to the Amsterdam shop

2279
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:01,980
and he came with me on one occasion he

2280
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,199
seemed like a nice fella

2281
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:06,178
I can't remember the actual conversation

2282
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:10,919
at the time

2283
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:14,399
that uh yeah I I did ask him at the time

2284
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:17,639
if it's okay to make f2s or whatever you

2285
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:19,920
call it out of uh Cindy 99 because we

2286
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:22,199
had so many people asking for stock and

2287
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,819
we didn't have any more Brothers Grim

2288
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:26,279
stock and it didn't look like he was

2289
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:28,380
going to have any because I think he was

2290
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:29,939
working in the engineering field and he

2291
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:33,619
had a job in Europe

2292
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:36,359
and so he couldn't concentrate on

2293
01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:38,460
growing back in the States like he had

2294
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:40,859
done before

2295
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,079
with the sly

2296
01:38:40,859 --> 01:38:45,238
um I've since learned that sires passed

2297
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:46,639
away in recent years

2298
01:38:45,238 --> 01:38:49,979
so

2299
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:53,219
Mr soul is the only representative now

2300
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:55,979
I've got brother scrim out there

2301
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:58,679
and good luck to him he seemed like a a

2302
01:38:55,979 --> 01:39:00,779
nice chat I didn't really know him for

2303
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:03,480
that long you know it was just a car

2304
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:05,158
Journey more than anything this is the

2305
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:07,678
thing with the internet you you might

2306
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:10,439
know people for years online

2307
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:13,079
but uh when they sit next year in a car

2308
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:14,698
and you're on a four or five hour

2309
01:39:13,079 --> 01:39:17,399
Journey or whatever it is you get to

2310
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:20,339
know them much better that way I prefer

2311
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:22,319
the personal meeting with people that's

2312
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:24,060
why I've always made an effort to get

2313
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:25,139
around the world to meet various

2314
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,420
breeders

2315
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:28,859
different times not just to buy stock

2316
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:32,279
just to see

2317
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:35,219
see how they make their seeds you know

2318
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:37,380
yeah brilliant brilliant something I

2319
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:40,279
wanted to ask you a little bit unrelated

2320
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,600
I heard that you were friends with

2321
01:39:40,279 --> 01:39:44,759
kangativa and when you got out of jail a

2322
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:46,800
few years ago he went to the UK is that

2323
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:48,119
true can you give us an update on him if

2324
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,699
you know anything

2325
01:39:48,119 --> 01:39:52,679
who is kangativa

2326
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:54,599
I guess that answers the question you're

2327
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:56,039
not sure no he's the um the Australian

2328
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:58,440
grower who's like associated with

2329
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:59,760
mullumbimby Madness

2330
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:02,039
um he was working with Neville on the

2331
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,639
Grail Haze a little bit he's

2332
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:07,319
yeah known a few horses over the years

2333
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:09,719
I think they don't go by their online

2334
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:12,319
names so I might have known him as

2335
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:12,319
somebody else

2336
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:16,859
yeah there you go maybe maybe I'm just

2337
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:19,079
trying to think of how else you might

2338
01:40:16,859 --> 01:40:22,019
know him do you remember Wally duck at

2339
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:25,920
all or not ringing any bells uh yeah

2340
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:28,560
yeah Wally duck or Donald Mallard as we

2341
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:31,500
know him yeah that's the one

2342
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:34,920
yeah he's a mate that I see yeah from

2343
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:38,340
back from the early overgrow days again

2344
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,380
um and obviously a bush grower

2345
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:41,340
I think he's up in Queensland or

2346
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,119
somewhere

2347
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:47,340
up there in the table mountains

2348
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:49,139
yeah yeah he's a good mate he's out and

2349
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:50,400
dealing with all the wildlife and this

2350
01:40:49,139 --> 01:40:52,679
that and the other and it was quite

2351
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:55,559
descriptive and then we got chatting and

2352
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:58,560
of course we shared seeds and he'd send

2353
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:00,179
some seeds over uh that they got over

2354
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,880
there and I would send her some more

2355
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:05,699
from over here over there

2356
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,440
and he would grow them out and make more

2357
01:41:05,698 --> 01:41:08,939
seeds and then send them back this is

2358
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:10,519
what happened with many breeders around

2359
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:13,079
the world

2360
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:15,300
you share the seeds with them and they

2361
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:18,300
want to share what seeds they make with

2362
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:20,639
you if you could sell them or if you

2363
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:23,039
could give them away at least they're

2364
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:24,500
being distributed and plants growing

2365
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:27,779
from them

2366
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:29,880
so that was their mindset which is mine

2367
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:31,500
too if you've got seeds that are just

2368
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:33,600
going to waste away

2369
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:36,479
they just give them away they try and

2370
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:39,179
get somebody to grow them

2371
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:42,359
definitely definitely definitely

2372
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:45,179
I I wanted to ask you who in your mind

2373
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:46,859
is like one of the unsung heroes of the

2374
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:48,480
scene be it a breeder or just a

2375
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:50,039
Community member who you think like just

2376
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:51,539
doesn't really get as much attention as

2377
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:53,579
maybe they Merit

2378
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:55,380
I think there's a lot of up and coming

2379
01:41:53,579 --> 01:41:58,319
breeders

2380
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:00,960
that

2381
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:03,899
will come to the fore in the future as

2382
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,420
the old school sort of die away

2383
01:42:03,899 --> 01:42:08,219
and we we can see that happening already

2384
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:13,199
Within

2385
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:15,899
the Cannabis subculture or industry or

2386
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,238
what you might call it that's been in

2387
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:22,698
prohibition mostly over

2388
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:22,698
the last 80 or 90 years

2389
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:26,399
you know there's some have come to

2390
01:42:24,658 --> 01:42:29,158
prominence and

2391
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:31,920
others not but I think there's a whole

2392
01:42:29,158 --> 01:42:33,719
new batch of people making seeds now

2393
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,039
there's there's new breeders up and

2394
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:37,980
coming

2395
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:39,359
um I could throw some names around but I

2396
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:41,638
don't think

2397
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:44,460
that's really the point because these

2398
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:48,600
these guys are the product of what we've

2399
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:51,618
created in the online communities

2400
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,619
many times

2401
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:58,679
you've got people that have grown up

2402
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:01,199
were in the early teenage years with the

2403
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:02,219
overgrow and then they come on to say I

2404
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,019
see mag

2405
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:06,539
and they've become readers in their own

2406
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:08,880
right and now they're

2407
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:11,100
got their own Instagram accounts and

2408
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,359
this and the other their own legitimacy

2409
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:15,780
companies

2410
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:18,920
and it's it's kind of helping spawn the

2411
01:43:15,779 --> 01:43:22,019
industry has always been

2412
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:24,359
uh one of the things I feel

2413
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:26,630
most proud of if there's anything to be

2414
01:43:24,359 --> 01:43:26,939
proud of within this industry

2415
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:28,940
[Music]

2416
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:28,939
um

2417
01:43:28,979 --> 01:43:33,899
helping others and having something

2418
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:36,419
there where they can communicate with

2419
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:38,579
like-minded people

2420
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,899
whether it's on a social level or a

2421
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:44,579
business level

2422
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:47,099
or a matter of interest in the plant

2423
01:43:44,579 --> 01:43:48,960
it seems to work

2424
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,360
you can even go in there and have a chat

2425
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,800
you can go in there now I don't know the

2426
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:55,439
latest software

2427
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,900
and now we've upgraded um

2428
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:59,299
from the old V bulletin software to the

2429
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:03,179
new stuff

2430
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:06,420
it's a much better site to navigate

2431
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:07,739
I find it interesting but we don't get

2432
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:11,279
the um

2433
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:12,178
we don't get the traffic that we used to

2434
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:14,759
get

2435
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:17,340
because there's so many options now out

2436
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:19,920
there people seem to like

2437
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:22,139
Instagram and Facebook

2438
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:24,420
I'll try to keep the site going as long

2439
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:27,900
as I can

2440
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:30,779
seems to pay the bills at the moment

2441
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:31,738
yeah people talk like they're very fond

2442
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:35,219
about

2443
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:37,259
um the forums but Instagram still seems

2444
01:44:35,219 --> 01:44:39,300
to dominate in terms of the numbers do

2445
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:41,760
you think that there there might be some

2446
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:44,639
sort of paradigm shift because Instagram

2447
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:47,460
seems to be increasingly Banning

2448
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:49,199
cannabis accounts it's hard to advertise

2449
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:51,420
do you think there might come a time

2450
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:55,439
where the forums rise back up and become

2451
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:59,460
like the main point of communication

2452
01:44:55,439 --> 01:45:00,359
uh I don't know I I don't go to these

2453
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:03,420
sites

2454
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:06,198
uh there are people called Gypsy Nirvana

2455
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:09,560
on these sites but they're all

2456
01:45:06,198 --> 01:45:13,019
doppelgangers or fakes or whatever

2457
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:14,699
somebody's even coined gypsynavana.com I

2458
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:16,560
thought I had control of that domain but

2459
01:45:14,698 --> 01:45:18,118
I must have lost it through non-payment

2460
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,800
of something or other

2461
01:45:18,118 --> 01:45:21,719
and um

2462
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:24,179
so there's somebody out there with with

2463
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:27,420
the domain name in my name selling seeds

2464
01:45:24,179 --> 01:45:29,158
that's got nothing to do with me so the

2465
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:32,940
internet can be good and it can also be

2466
01:45:29,158 --> 01:45:35,279
a bloody crazy place when people Nick

2467
01:45:32,939 --> 01:45:37,460
your identity and go around making money

2468
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:39,960
with it

2469
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:41,039
yes certainly and you just answered one

2470
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,380
of the questions I was going to ask

2471
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:45,539
which is that yeah the current website

2472
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,340
looks pretty unanimously like they're

2473
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:50,840
scamming people but I had a suspicion

2474
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:50,840
that you weren't involved in it

2475
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,920
well I guess it's kind of flattering in

2476
01:45:53,698 --> 01:45:58,279
a in a kind of perverse way isn't it

2477
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:02,460
when you think of it

2478
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:04,800
yeah certainly certainly we had um some

2479
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:06,840
interesting fans a bit of questions I I

2480
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,179
would love to know the answer someone

2481
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:12,420
wanted to know the backstory behind

2482
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:13,859
getting the genetics of the citrile or

2483
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:15,779
the Bubblicious do you remember either

2484
01:46:13,859 --> 01:46:19,979
of those two specifically

2485
01:46:15,779 --> 01:46:22,439
oh geez I'm only running a 486 kilobyte

2486
01:46:19,979 --> 01:46:23,638
hard drive in this brain you know so

2487
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:27,118
I've got to pull up that information

2488
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:29,340
somehow I've got to go back to the 1980s

2489
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:31,198
there's one of these weird modems I use

2490
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:34,159
to connect and it makes all these odd

2491
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:36,779
noises these clicks

2492
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:39,658
so it was citrail

2493
01:46:36,779 --> 01:46:42,420
yeah and

2494
01:46:39,658 --> 01:46:43,618
Bubblicious Bubblicious

2495
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:47,399
hmm

2496
01:46:43,618 --> 01:46:49,439
wasn't Bubblicious something that

2497
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:51,539
now put out

2498
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:55,439
yeah I think I think they were both from

2499
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:59,340
Nirvana yeah as a form of bubble gum

2500
01:46:55,439 --> 01:47:02,339
yeah because the the Dutch breeders uh

2501
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:05,940
or seed makers we're all into knocking

2502
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:09,239
each other off big time you know

2503
01:47:05,939 --> 01:47:11,279
I think Mao had this uh particularly

2504
01:47:09,238 --> 01:47:13,500
potent

2505
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:16,259
um skunk mail

2506
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:20,520
that he got from Sam

2507
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:22,679
and took most all of the popular clones

2508
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:25,560
or anything that won a title or a

2509
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:29,460
Cannabis Cup or whatever and pollinated

2510
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:31,139
them with this particularly uh strong

2511
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:35,579
resinous male

2512
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:37,199
and seem to produce seeds that in many

2513
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:41,039
cases were even better than the

2514
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:43,198
originals as far as uh potency or even

2515
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:47,460
yield was concerned

2516
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:49,618
so just by making these hybrids

2517
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:52,859
you know shaking around the pollen from

2518
01:47:49,618 --> 01:47:54,719
this this very good male enabled him to

2519
01:47:52,859 --> 01:47:56,460
start a whole Seed Company

2520
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:58,980
out of it

2521
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:01,618
a lot of the Dutch breeders worked it

2522
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:04,559
that way you know and I mean I've I've

2523
01:48:01,618 --> 01:48:09,118
heard in the past there's ongoing

2524
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:12,000
court cases and and uh

2525
01:48:09,118 --> 01:48:14,639
all sorts of consternation between

2526
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,179
various companies using the names of

2527
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:20,520
seeds of somebody else that's created

2528
01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:22,380
them like Simon from Syria seeds and the

2529
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:24,659
AK-47

2530
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:27,118
Mel started selling something that was

2531
01:48:24,658 --> 01:48:29,819
called AK-47 as well

2532
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:33,238
and of course Simon didn't like it so

2533
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:36,059
they brought a court case or they get

2534
01:48:33,238 --> 01:48:38,579
involved in it it almost gets Criminal

2535
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:41,159
uh almost to the point of violence

2536
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:43,139
amongst these people

2537
01:48:41,158 --> 01:48:46,019
um

2538
01:48:43,139 --> 01:48:48,000
and eventually I think Mao changed it to

2539
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:54,659
ak-48

2540
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:57,000
yeah so it started selling it as ak-48

2541
01:48:54,658 --> 01:49:00,899
so yeah amongst a lot of these Dutch

2542
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:03,658
breeders uh or seed makers

2543
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:07,679
um it's not that they all produce their

2544
01:49:03,658 --> 01:49:10,379
own special varieties there's

2545
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:13,560
some very good varieties that go around

2546
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:18,020
and they make hybrids uh off of all of

2547
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:20,880
them to a lesser or greater extent

2548
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:22,860
brilliant brilliant and another question

2549
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,359
we got asked by a listener is do you

2550
01:49:22,859 --> 01:49:28,139
specifically have any recollection

2551
01:49:24,359 --> 01:49:29,519
around when Nirvana did their remakes of

2552
01:49:28,139 --> 01:49:31,319
some of the classics like the northern

2553
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,900
lights and the white widow were like two

2554
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:37,198
notable ones yeah

2555
01:49:33,899 --> 01:49:38,638
well I know I know Mel he he would go

2556
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:41,039
for

2557
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:44,159
um what is the correct genetic material

2558
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:47,158
to create something

2559
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:49,138
um he started out with Bernard at

2560
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:52,618
positronics

2561
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:56,039
so he knows the value of producing

2562
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:59,219
something that the public will like

2563
01:49:56,039 --> 01:50:00,238
the growing public will like and I'm

2564
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:01,920
sure he would have put together

2565
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:03,599
something that

2566
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,420
was popular

2567
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:09,659
you know there's been a few

2568
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:13,500
I think in the past there's been a few

2569
01:50:09,658 --> 01:50:17,039
releases of seeds that have not

2570
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:19,260
come up to expectations uh

2571
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:22,198
because they haven't been tested or

2572
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:24,780
whatever but I think Mao always tried to

2573
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:26,759
get tested and looked at me as a good

2574
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:28,500
outlet for testing when I I got the

2575
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:31,800
website together

2576
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:33,118
so we would do you know test grows if I

2577
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:36,119
would get a batch of seeds something

2578
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:37,920
coming up new I put them out to Growers

2579
01:50:36,118 --> 01:50:39,299
on the website they grow them out we'll

2580
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,719
be able to see them

2581
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:45,840
in live action uh you know how they

2582
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:48,840
would grow out they put pictures up and

2583
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,520
then other people would buy on that

2584
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:53,100
whether or not they'd be all different

2585
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:55,460
types of phenotypes and some stunted and

2586
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:58,320
there's some mutant plants

2587
01:50:55,460 --> 01:51:00,420
then people wouldn't be so keen on

2588
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:02,039
buying them would they

2589
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:04,859
okay

2590
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:06,238
that's interesting I mean one of the

2591
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:07,500
questions we got asked by a few

2592
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:09,718
different people was like a lot of

2593
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:12,000
people in general have this sort of fond

2594
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:14,399
memory of some of the African lines you

2595
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:17,158
sold and I guess I'm wondering who did

2596
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:19,198
those come from and uh do you have any

2597
01:51:17,158 --> 01:51:21,000
seed stock in general laying around or

2598
01:51:19,198 --> 01:51:21,719
it's all sort of gone throughout the

2599
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,340
years

2600
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:26,158
yeah

2601
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:28,500
most most theater's gone because I've

2602
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:31,259
moved around a lot I've been in places

2603
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:34,560
that I didn't plan on being for for a

2604
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:38,460
long amount of time and uh I haven't

2605
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:41,820
been able to concentrate on securing and

2606
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:44,880
keeping the seed stock that I've had in

2607
01:51:41,819 --> 01:51:48,238
good repair so to speak

2608
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:51,118
like when I was away in in the

2609
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:55,019
Philippines in jail uh

2610
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:57,920
my seed stock wasn't kept refrigerated

2611
01:51:55,020 --> 01:52:00,420
and it it was just left in an office

2612
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:02,219
with employees that were kind of

2613
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:03,960
lackluster and a bit worried about

2614
01:52:02,219 --> 01:52:06,118
themselves getting in trouble for

2615
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:07,380
operating this business

2616
01:52:06,118 --> 01:52:10,500
so

2617
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:12,359
obviously germination ratios dropped off

2618
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:15,899
and

2619
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:20,039
yeah uh eventually

2620
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:23,339
you know I came back and I had you know

2621
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:25,198
loads and loads of seed stuff but the

2622
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:27,300
majority of it wasn't worth or it

2623
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:32,219
couldn't really be sold as anything

2624
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:35,760
other than badly germinating seeds so

2625
01:52:32,219 --> 01:52:37,800
yeah I lost a whole fortune in in the

2626
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:42,300
stock that I'd accumulated over many

2627
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:45,119
years because of my incarceration

2628
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:47,159
yeah wow that's uh that's a bummer to

2629
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:49,139
hear I I can only imagine all the

2630
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:52,198
beautiful things that would have been

2631
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:54,179
there otherwise one of the listeners

2632
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:56,460
wanted to know they asked a little bit

2633
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:58,319
about if you could tell it I'm actually

2634
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:00,118
not 100 familiar with this so it's like

2635
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:02,219
maybe you know about it maybe you don't

2636
01:53:00,118 --> 01:53:03,960
they said can he tell us a little bit

2637
01:53:02,219 --> 01:53:05,760
about the haze drama I think maybe

2638
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:07,500
they're talking about the amazing Haze

2639
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,920
you gave out is there some sort of story

2640
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:13,260
behind that or not really

2641
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,480
now there's been so many Hayes hybrids

2642
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:17,460
and

2643
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:19,799
hazes over the years that I've come into

2644
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:22,560
contact with

2645
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:25,020
um I can't even remember half of them to

2646
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,100
tell you the truth because Hayes seems

2647
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:30,360
to have got

2648
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:33,840
into so many different uh cultivars and

2649
01:53:30,359 --> 01:53:35,339
and crosses and hybrids whatever you

2650
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:39,179
want to call them

2651
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:42,420
that it's difficult to quantify uh

2652
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:45,658
what do you think of when I say Haze

2653
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:47,579
well I know the roots of it supposedly

2654
01:53:45,658 --> 01:53:50,099
it was something that came from the

2655
01:53:47,579 --> 01:53:53,158
Hayes Brothers it was mostly made out of

2656
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:55,139
a Colombian of some sort some South

2657
01:53:53,158 --> 01:53:56,399
American origin

2658
01:53:55,139 --> 01:53:59,940
and

2659
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:02,879
it was passed on to Sam Sam brought it

2660
01:53:59,939 --> 01:54:06,138
over to Europe and grew it out

2661
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,699
and it didn't always grow true

2662
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:10,800
apparently it's got a lot of different

2663
01:54:08,698 --> 01:54:12,839
Thanos and you have to search for the

2664
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,960
good one and

2665
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:17,819
you know it's a bit variable I've heard

2666
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:20,100
people say that occasionally it had

2667
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:21,960
intersex traits so

2668
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:24,000
maybe you know it depends on how

2669
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:27,000
somebody grows something out

2670
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:30,060
as well that can affect all of that so

2671
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,319
it's difficult to work out exactly

2672
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:36,840
what the haze is or what it was it's

2673
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:38,698
kind of in folklore now almost and

2674
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:41,900
there's people in contention about it

2675
01:54:38,698 --> 01:54:45,539
and will forever argue about it you know

2676
01:54:41,899 --> 01:54:47,759
about Neville's Haze and about Sam and

2677
01:54:45,539 --> 01:54:50,100
we've had ongoing discussions

2678
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:53,940
that go through hundreds and hundreds of

2679
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:56,539
pages on I see mag about the mysterious

2680
01:54:53,939 --> 01:54:56,539
Haze

2681
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,279
that's interesting yeah it um it's still

2682
01:55:00,179 --> 01:55:04,920
just so much discussion around it that's

2683
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:06,420
interesting to hear it's the effect of

2684
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,440
the plant I think that more than

2685
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:11,279
anything

2686
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:14,759
is uh most cannabis people smoke I think

2687
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:17,639
these days or consume and be

2688
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:20,159
you know however they take cannabis most

2689
01:55:17,639 --> 01:55:23,100
of it is more of uh something that

2690
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:24,899
relaxes you that makes you lower in

2691
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:27,780
Consciousness perhaps

2692
01:55:24,899 --> 01:55:30,359
whereas the haze has kind of the

2693
01:55:27,779 --> 01:55:34,079
opposite effect and it is very

2694
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:36,779
extreme I think to most cannabis users

2695
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:39,000
because the majority never even tried it

2696
01:55:36,779 --> 01:55:40,800
so that's the interest you know it's

2697
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,679
kind of uh

2698
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:47,060
what was that it's like the absence of

2699
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:47,060
can of cannabis

2700
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:52,859
that's a good way to put it I like it

2701
01:55:50,039 --> 01:55:55,738
there's an Allure about it for sure well

2702
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:57,420
if you could only pick one strain to

2703
01:55:55,738 --> 01:55:58,859
smoke for the rest of your life what

2704
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:01,739
strain would you pick

2705
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:04,259
oh well whatever I say people will

2706
01:56:01,738 --> 01:56:07,678
disagree with me because they prefer

2707
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:08,940
their own but as far as hazes are

2708
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,100
concerned

2709
01:56:08,939 --> 01:56:11,939
um sometimes I think it's a it's a

2710
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,460
little bit

2711
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:19,618
too much on the edge I wouldn't pick a

2712
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:24,060
haze but I'd pick something that was

2713
01:56:19,618 --> 01:56:25,380
a nice hybrid like Cinderella 99 that

2714
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,440
would suit me

2715
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:29,880
something that's fast grows indoors very

2716
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:32,579
fruity

2717
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:35,639
wonderful kind of dank kind of

2718
01:56:32,579 --> 01:56:39,600
fruitiness pineapple papaya fruitiness

2719
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:40,859
that Cinderella 99 has it's almost

2720
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:44,760
um

2721
01:56:40,859 --> 01:56:47,759
ah it's almost like a candy

2722
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:51,000
I remember the first time I ever tried

2723
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:52,340
any uh sent one of those old film cases

2724
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,198
for

2725
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:56,699
by Mr soul I think it was

2726
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:59,399
and uh

2727
01:56:56,698 --> 01:57:01,219
yeah ever since then I've been a Cindy

2728
01:56:59,399 --> 01:57:04,138
freak

2729
01:57:01,219 --> 01:57:06,300
that does me I could survive on

2730
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:08,539
incinerator at 99 for the rest of my

2731
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,539
days

2732
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:14,698
yeah it's brilliant isn't it really

2733
01:57:11,819 --> 01:57:16,618
functional lovely stuff so I got another

2734
01:57:14,698 --> 01:57:18,299
question sort of similar to the last one

2735
01:57:16,618 --> 01:57:20,519
and this one was submitted by one of our

2736
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:22,500
listeners they wanted to know if you had

2737
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:24,480
to start growing today and you had to

2738
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:26,760
buy seeds off one of the Breeders that

2739
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:28,500
currently is around what seeds would you

2740
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:29,520
buy if you could only get one pack oh

2741
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:33,179
geez

2742
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:35,699
God that's a tricky one isn't it

2743
01:57:33,179 --> 01:57:38,099
because there's so much variety and

2744
01:57:35,698 --> 01:57:40,859
there's so much good out there it's like

2745
01:57:38,099 --> 01:57:43,679
uh say a kid that really likes chocolate

2746
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:45,719
and you say all right what have all

2747
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:48,480
these chocolate bars do you like

2748
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:49,618
well they're all chocolate

2749
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:52,559
yeah

2750
01:57:49,618 --> 01:57:53,399
oh that's a that's a hard one very hard

2751
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,199
one

2752
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:57,839
uh

2753
01:57:55,198 --> 01:57:59,698
first of all I'd I'd look at the

2754
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:03,239
Breeders that

2755
01:57:59,698 --> 01:58:06,539
are kind of admire and would stand

2756
01:58:03,238 --> 01:58:08,158
behind their product

2757
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:10,099
um and they are not just something

2758
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:13,138
that's made

2759
01:58:10,099 --> 01:58:15,960
conveniently from another breed of seeds

2760
01:58:13,139 --> 01:58:17,940
and relabeled and called something else

2761
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:19,560
and look to be growing something that

2762
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:23,698
was

2763
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:26,039
Maybe original maybe getting nostalgic

2764
01:58:23,698 --> 01:58:28,738
looking back growing one of the

2765
01:58:26,039 --> 01:58:31,139
Mainstays of uh that's the current

2766
01:58:28,738 --> 01:58:34,439
industry maybe just grown out of skunk

2767
01:58:31,139 --> 01:58:35,760
one or growing out in Northern Lights

2768
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:36,960
or

2769
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:41,340
something

2770
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:43,198
kind of not too fancy doesn't have a a

2771
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,420
name that incorporates all sorts of

2772
01:58:43,198 --> 01:58:47,759
weird gizmos

2773
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:51,000
that's brilliant another question we got

2774
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:53,400
was um what was your recollection of Tom

2775
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,560
Hill and his lines you saw them for a

2776
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:58,219
while do you have any fond memories any

2777
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:02,460
specific memories

2778
01:58:58,219 --> 01:59:05,520
the roller coaster of a person really uh

2779
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:08,639
great guy but then I mean there's a lot

2780
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:12,000
of people wouldn't say that uh

2781
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:14,099
yeah it's kind of a a bit of an enigma

2782
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,800
and then tends to come on my site

2783
01:59:14,099 --> 01:59:18,719
sometimes in one mood and then gets

2784
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:21,000
along with most people then comes on in

2785
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:23,158
another mood and pisses off a load of

2786
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:26,158
people and ends up get getting the

2787
01:59:23,158 --> 01:59:28,439
moderators to ban him or he gets himself

2788
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:29,759
banned through breaking the terms of use

2789
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:31,319
of willing

2790
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:35,219
but

2791
01:59:31,319 --> 01:59:37,019
yeah I don't know many years ago I got a

2792
01:59:35,219 --> 01:59:39,719
package in the mail and it was all these

2793
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:41,520
seeds from somebody called Tom Hill and

2794
01:59:39,719 --> 01:59:43,560
I didn't know where they're coming from

2795
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:46,080
particularly and then he kind of hooked

2796
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:47,820
up with me on the website and said yeah

2797
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:49,019
I sent all these seeds over and you can

2798
01:59:47,819 --> 01:59:51,779
just give them away or sell them

2799
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:54,179
whatever you want you know so we sold

2800
01:59:51,779 --> 01:59:57,300
some we gave some away and

2801
01:59:54,179 --> 02:00:00,599
and people seem to like them and then he

2802
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:02,579
became more vocal on the forums and

2803
02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:04,679
I don't know a lot of people liked his

2804
02:00:02,579 --> 02:00:07,800
style but

2805
02:00:04,679 --> 02:00:09,359
yeah he used to I think his his thing

2806
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:13,860
was rum and coke

2807
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:16,859
and maybe when people drink a lot uh

2808
02:00:13,859 --> 02:00:18,299
they tend to get a bit sloppy online and

2809
02:00:16,859 --> 02:00:21,238
yeah

2810
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:24,060
he was uh kind of

2811
02:00:21,238 --> 02:00:26,759
informative interesting but at the same

2812
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:28,260
time insulted to a lot of people and put

2813
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:31,199
it across in

2814
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:33,500
he didn't he didn't coat it with any

2815
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:33,500
sugar

2816
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:40,920
straight to the point that that's uh

2817
02:00:37,859 --> 02:00:43,618
kind of people like that if if somebody

2818
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:47,699
comes across sometimes a bit crude

2819
02:00:43,618 --> 02:00:50,579
and makes their point with passion

2820
02:00:47,698 --> 02:00:52,319
so Tom was very passionate like that and

2821
02:00:50,579 --> 02:00:54,238
I think I met him

2822
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:56,698
invited him to come out to the

2823
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:59,459
Philippines years ago and he came out

2824
02:00:56,698 --> 02:01:02,158
we went out and had a couple of nights

2825
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:03,539
out on the town together for absolutely

2826
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,420
Blotto

2827
02:01:03,539 --> 02:01:09,118
had some good times seemed like a nice

2828
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:11,579
guy really interesting

2829
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:13,079
I think he grows up in the mountains so

2830
02:01:11,579 --> 02:01:16,158
he's been he's kind of like a mountain

2831
02:01:13,079 --> 02:01:16,158
man you know

2832
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:22,440
foothills of the Rockies or something

2833
02:01:18,899 --> 02:01:24,359
we've got a few stories together and um

2834
02:01:22,439 --> 02:01:26,819
yeah interesting chat now there again

2835
02:01:24,359 --> 02:01:29,219
it's about personalities you see

2836
02:01:26,819 --> 02:01:33,019
you've got some wild men of cannabis and

2837
02:01:29,219 --> 02:01:33,020
I guess Tom is one of them

2838
02:01:33,079 --> 02:01:39,059
I love it I love it I wanted to ask were

2839
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:41,460
there any particular standout Cannabis

2840
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:43,739
Cup experiences I'm sure you've been to

2841
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:46,020
a number of them anything kooky or wild

2842
02:01:43,738 --> 02:01:48,959
that we haven't spoke about

2843
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:50,580
yeah there was one year I think it was

2844
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,539
the second year I had anything to do

2845
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:56,039
with him

2846
02:01:51,539 --> 02:02:00,000
and maybe the last uh was uh

2847
02:01:56,039 --> 02:02:02,460
I wanted to enter Cinderella 99 in the

2848
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,579
Cannabis Cup so this was a big deal for

2849
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:07,980
me the first time I ever made an injury

2850
02:02:05,579 --> 02:02:09,599
I cleared it I think we missed the solar

2851
02:02:07,979 --> 02:02:11,759
system we went into

2852
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,440
this into the Cannabis Cup where you

2853
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:15,659
please yes no problem

2854
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:18,960
so

2855
02:02:15,658 --> 02:02:21,299
we were waiting

2856
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:23,939
for the authorization and they needed to

2857
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:28,920
come and pick weed up and the guy came

2858
02:02:23,939 --> 02:02:31,678
over from the Cannabis Cup and you know

2859
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:33,899
in a roundabout way they told me that if

2860
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:36,750
I wanted it to place I would have to pay

2861
02:02:33,899 --> 02:02:38,279
a certain amount of money so

2862
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:41,340
[Music]

2863
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:46,198
I thought that was kind of corrupt and

2864
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:48,659
that led on to us wanting to you know

2865
02:02:46,198 --> 02:02:50,279
every year do the The Growers and

2866
02:02:48,658 --> 02:02:54,059
Breeders Cup we wanted to do our own

2867
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:55,679
kind of mini Cannabis Cup just amongst

2868
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:59,460
the Growers and the breeders of the

2869
02:02:55,679 --> 02:03:01,319
plant so we started this 420 grows and

2870
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:05,779
Breeders Cup so

2871
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:05,779
the 20th of April every year

2872
02:03:05,939 --> 02:03:11,039
um

2873
02:03:06,899 --> 02:03:14,759
we put a show on some years

2874
02:03:11,039 --> 02:03:17,460
we employed a tribute band so we had an

2875
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:20,520
AC DC tribute band one year and big

2876
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:22,319
venue and I used to Fork out a lot of a

2877
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:23,880
lot of dough to try and get this thing

2878
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:25,559
happening

2879
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:28,020
but I'm not very

2880
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:29,580
very together with organization and

2881
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:31,800
stuff like that

2882
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:33,658
so some years it didn't really work out

2883
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:35,820
but there was still a lot of entries and

2884
02:03:33,658 --> 02:03:37,439
a lot of people showed up for it

2885
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:40,819
so

2886
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:44,819
it just financially was a bit of a dream

2887
02:03:40,819 --> 02:03:47,819
eventually it just became

2888
02:03:44,819 --> 02:03:49,439
um maybe 50 or 60 Growers and breeders

2889
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:51,960
would show up and then they judge each

2890
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:54,479
other's weed that was the last time I

2891
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:57,539
think we had it just pre-covered

2892
02:03:54,479 --> 02:04:00,419
we haven't had one since

2893
02:03:57,539 --> 02:04:01,738
there are plans to put one on for next

2894
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:05,279
year

2895
02:04:01,738 --> 02:04:07,500
and yeah we started it in a way

2896
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:08,759
because I thought the Cannabis Cup was

2897
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:10,439
corrupt

2898
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:11,760
and we thought it might be more

2899
02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:14,039
interesting

2900
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:16,980
particularly the The Growers and the

2901
02:04:14,039 --> 02:04:18,479
Breeders on on International canographic

2902
02:04:16,979 --> 02:04:20,759
to

2903
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:22,259
have some sort of event every year where

2904
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:23,159
they could get together and meet each

2905
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:25,679
other

2906
02:04:23,158 --> 02:04:28,500
and I think we've done it in Amsterdam

2907
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:30,840
mostly and for a couple of years we did

2908
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:32,819
it in Barcelona

2909
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:36,420
so hopefully we can get it on for next

2910
02:04:32,819 --> 02:04:38,279
year again and I can go along

2911
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:40,340
and pass out on all the different

2912
02:04:38,279 --> 02:04:43,139
varieties

2913
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:45,000
I love it I've got to ask and follow up

2914
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:46,940
which Canada's Cup was that the one you

2915
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:50,399
want to send to the Cindy in

2916
02:04:46,939 --> 02:04:52,799
oh geez High Times yeah

2917
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:55,979
ah

2918
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:58,500
there you go there you go we had one of

2919
02:04:55,979 --> 02:05:01,618
our listeners ask about the Gypsy

2920
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:03,539
Nirvana collection of seeds can you tell

2921
02:05:01,618 --> 02:05:07,979
us anything about that

2922
02:05:03,539 --> 02:05:09,840
well yeah ever since the get-go

2923
02:05:07,979 --> 02:05:12,479
um I've had

2924
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:15,900
some favorite varieties that I would put

2925
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:17,879
into my collection yeah I either they'd

2926
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:19,559
be rare land race stuff that I'd found

2927
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:21,960
on my travels

2928
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:24,599
or they'd be from different breeders

2929
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:26,639
that had certain seed lots that I

2930
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:29,039
thought were particularly good and so

2931
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:32,520
I'd put them in the collection

2932
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:34,079
so there's been several varieties that

2933
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:37,619
have gone through the collection over

2934
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:40,500
the years and I don't think I have any

2935
02:05:37,618 --> 02:05:44,039
of them left in this unless there's uh

2936
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:47,099
ones that are still up on seed Bay or

2937
02:05:44,039 --> 02:05:50,719
seed Boutique and they would more likely

2938
02:05:47,099 --> 02:05:53,279
be newer seeds because I've told them

2939
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:55,319
we don't want to try and sell the older

2940
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:57,179
seats anymore because they're just not

2941
02:05:55,319 --> 02:06:02,158
good

2942
02:05:57,179 --> 02:06:02,158
the older varieties obviously stock

2943
02:06:02,179 --> 02:06:07,739
Runs Out

2944
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:11,400
so we don't have them all the time and

2945
02:06:07,738 --> 02:06:13,738
so we have to introduce new varieties

2946
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:16,439
occasionally I'm looking around for

2947
02:06:13,738 --> 02:06:18,658
something good to put into the Gypsy

2948
02:06:16,439 --> 02:06:20,759
Nirvana collection

2949
02:06:18,658 --> 02:06:23,960
and currently

2950
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:23,960
I can't think of anything

2951
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:30,840
that's interesting great someone wanted

2952
02:06:28,618 --> 02:06:33,359
to know specifically did you know

2953
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:36,239
anything about the G13 in Cross or is

2954
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:37,319
that like a bit too specific

2955
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:40,259
um

2956
02:06:37,319 --> 02:06:42,719
I know this G13 plant it was supposedly

2957
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:46,380
from some American government

2958
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:50,099
institution in in Mississippi you know

2959
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:51,480
this folklore going on about it

2960
02:06:50,099 --> 02:06:54,840
and

2961
02:06:51,479 --> 02:06:57,718
what has been presumed to be the G13 or

2962
02:06:54,840 --> 02:07:00,539
whatever I think Ben did most with it

2963
02:06:57,719 --> 02:07:01,739
initially I think he crossed it with the

2964
02:07:00,539 --> 02:07:05,698
hash plant

2965
02:07:01,738 --> 02:07:09,658
the G13 hash plant it's ncc's

2966
02:07:05,698 --> 02:07:11,819
yeah very famous nowadays isn't it yeah

2967
02:07:09,658 --> 02:07:15,118
and that became

2968
02:07:11,819 --> 02:07:16,079
known as the Mr Nice wasn't it Mr Nice

2969
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:18,299
cross

2970
02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:20,880
after Howard monarchs

2971
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:23,760
G13 background how would be an

2972
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:28,099
instrumental in me getting released

2973
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:33,179
from uh Philippine authorities

2974
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:36,239
in the Philippines back in 2016.

2975
02:07:33,179 --> 02:07:39,420
Howard was an Oxford Don and he met many

2976
02:07:36,238 --> 02:07:43,738
people who are now heads of government

2977
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:46,920
and Industry today yeah he probably sold

2978
02:07:43,738 --> 02:07:48,118
them hash back in the 70s or the 60s or

2979
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:51,420
whatever

2980
02:07:48,118 --> 02:07:54,839
and he pulled some strings with the

2981
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:57,118
British Diplomatic Corps to get send one

2982
02:07:54,840 --> 02:08:00,239
of the top dogs to meet me in the

2983
02:07:57,118 --> 02:08:01,738
Philippines and then after he met me the

2984
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,899
British Embassy couldn't do enough to

2985
02:08:01,738 --> 02:08:05,939
help me get out of there

2986
02:08:03,899 --> 02:08:08,039
so

2987
02:08:05,939 --> 02:08:09,598
I got out the year Howard died and I

2988
02:08:08,039 --> 02:08:12,179
didn't get a chance to actually go and

2989
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:14,039
thank him but I think he talked to the

2990
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:16,500
right person or pulled some strings to

2991
02:08:14,039 --> 02:08:19,139
get me out of that that hell hole in the

2992
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:20,880
Philippines that ex Marcos era death

2993
02:08:19,139 --> 02:08:23,699
camp that I was

2994
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:26,219
in sconed within and couldn't find a way

2995
02:08:23,698 --> 02:08:27,839
out of for two and a half years so bless

2996
02:08:26,219 --> 02:08:30,420
Howard Marx

2997
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:33,119
bless Howard marks having a brilliant

2998
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:36,658
effect I think that just about brings us

2999
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:39,598
to our quick fire questions so I wanted

3000
02:08:36,658 --> 02:08:43,399
to ask you first one what are you most

3001
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:43,400
proud of out of your career thus far

3002
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:52,260
I'm a proud father uh I'm proud to draw

3003
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:54,480
seven kids into this world I've been

3004
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:55,920
able to support them

3005
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:59,479
um

3006
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,480
I guess that's breeding

3007
02:08:59,779 --> 02:09:05,340
well as far as cannabis is concerned I'm

3008
02:09:02,819 --> 02:09:07,799
I'm glad that I've introduced a lot of

3009
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:10,619
people to it and it's helped them in

3010
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,840
many ways maybe there's one or two that

3011
02:09:10,618 --> 02:09:14,460
have fallen by the wayside but

3012
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:16,440
I don't know it's the same with anything

3013
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:19,859
you do in life there's always a risk

3014
02:09:16,439 --> 02:09:22,799
concerned with it and it's up to you

3015
02:09:19,859 --> 02:09:24,658
to quantify that risk and whether or not

3016
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:27,779
to take it or not

3017
02:09:24,658 --> 02:09:29,939
and I've taken a few risks that weren't

3018
02:09:27,779 --> 02:09:31,380
really in my favor and become a Cropper

3019
02:09:29,939 --> 02:09:34,979
in the past

3020
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:38,579
but if you don't keep going forward and

3021
02:09:34,979 --> 02:09:40,738
pushing for what you believe is right

3022
02:09:38,579 --> 02:09:43,679
if you're looking for change or if

3023
02:09:40,738 --> 02:09:46,079
you're looking for a living

3024
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:49,380
the Cannabis industry has offered me all

3025
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:52,639
that over the years I don't regret

3026
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:55,800
anything I've done really

3027
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:58,099
you almost got me there I was about to

3028
02:09:55,800 --> 02:10:00,480
ask that so I will phrase it differently

3029
02:09:58,099 --> 02:10:01,739
although you don't regret anything is

3030
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:03,718
there anything you wish you could have

3031
02:10:01,738 --> 02:10:08,218
done differently

3032
02:10:03,719 --> 02:10:11,579
uh yeah well there was this guy is this

3033
02:10:08,219 --> 02:10:13,139
online entity called John Lee pettitmore

3034
02:10:11,579 --> 02:10:17,519
jlp

3035
02:10:13,139 --> 02:10:19,859
and we had this plan to aerially bombard

3036
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:21,139
various parts of the globe with cannabis

3037
02:10:19,859 --> 02:10:25,079
seeds

3038
02:10:21,139 --> 02:10:27,599
with balloons you know and we were very

3039
02:10:25,079 --> 02:10:30,599
into working out the whole science and

3040
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:32,579
you know the weather and this that and

3041
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:35,159
the other how we could like invade

3042
02:10:32,579 --> 02:10:37,079
various nations with plants that would

3043
02:10:35,158 --> 02:10:40,439
grow from the get-go in the right season

3044
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:42,899
at the right time you see and just force

3045
02:10:40,439 --> 02:10:45,598
cannabis on the rest of the world

3046
02:10:42,899 --> 02:10:47,638
bit of a pipe dream I must say but yeah

3047
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:50,400
I'm kind of sad that we didn't explore

3048
02:10:47,639 --> 02:10:52,880
that a little bit more

3049
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:57,299
that's brilliant that's brilliant okay

3050
02:10:52,880 --> 02:11:00,599
so next one is what is the single best

3051
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:02,279
flower you've ever had

3052
02:11:00,599 --> 02:11:06,239
um

3053
02:11:02,279 --> 02:11:09,539
it might have been the most recent one

3054
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:10,979
that I experienced over in Amsterdam a

3055
02:11:09,539 --> 02:11:14,819
couple of weeks ago

3056
02:11:10,979 --> 02:11:18,598
Simon from serious seeds offered me a

3057
02:11:14,819 --> 02:11:21,299
very beautiful Mimosa but it's this

3058
02:11:18,599 --> 02:11:23,520
variety that he has called mimosa

3059
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:24,440
which was an offering and a gift and of

3060
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:29,520
course

3061
02:11:24,439 --> 02:11:33,000
it looked beautiful and it was cured

3062
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:34,679
properly and it smoked like a dream and

3063
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:40,079
that was the same day that I'd passed

3064
02:11:34,679 --> 02:11:43,618
out on Soma's bubble hash Soma salad

3065
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:45,899
so I have some weird dreams of that day

3066
02:11:43,618 --> 02:11:49,259
being in and out of Consciousness

3067
02:11:45,899 --> 02:11:53,339
whether or not the Mimosa contributed to

3068
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:56,280
it or not and can't really say I'm not

3069
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:58,860
that okay with my own blood chemistry

3070
02:11:56,279 --> 02:12:00,840
perhaps

3071
02:11:58,859 --> 02:12:02,579
that's brilliant sounds like a fun time

3072
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:05,400
either way but on the other end of the

3073
02:12:02,579 --> 02:12:07,500
spectrum what's some bud wear everyone

3074
02:12:05,399 --> 02:12:09,059
around you is hyping it up you're really

3075
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:11,399
looking forward to trying it and then

3076
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:13,880
when you finally did you're just like oh

3077
02:12:11,399 --> 02:12:17,759
is that it

3078
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:20,279
I don't know because all various

3079
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:22,560
varieties of cannabis have some sort of

3080
02:12:20,279 --> 02:12:26,340
attribute merely by being cannabis

3081
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:28,619
itself you know it's something

3082
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:33,480
um and whether or not it's got one

3083
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:37,019
percent THC or it's got 35 THC on it

3084
02:12:33,479 --> 02:12:40,019
seems to be a common denominator whereby

3085
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:44,159
people will judge how good or bad it is

3086
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:46,980
but not from my experience you know I've

3087
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:50,039
got just as high in some respects or

3088
02:12:46,979 --> 02:12:53,339
even higher on cannabis that has a lower

3089
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:55,859
THC level than I have done on stuff

3090
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:59,699
that's not neither six you know and is

3091
02:12:55,859 --> 02:13:02,578
it really all about becoming comatose no

3092
02:12:59,698 --> 02:13:05,399
no you want to try and Plateau out

3093
02:13:02,578 --> 02:13:08,460
before you become comatose and enjoy a

3094
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:12,059
high you don't want to just pass out

3095
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:15,359
or do you you know some people's some

3096
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:19,320
people's lives are so Grim that just

3097
02:13:15,359 --> 02:13:20,519
being under a chemical Koch is a relief

3098
02:13:19,319 --> 02:13:22,799
so

3099
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:24,300
I guess it's horses for courses as my

3100
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:27,480
mother would say

3101
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:29,820
depends what your what works with you in

3102
02:13:27,479 --> 02:13:32,399
your own metabolism and what particular

3103
02:13:29,819 --> 02:13:34,618
time you take it and what company you

3104
02:13:32,399 --> 02:13:36,719
take it with

3105
02:13:34,618 --> 02:13:39,238
that's it right Different Strokes for

3106
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:40,800
different folks so we're on a boat and

3107
02:13:39,238 --> 02:13:43,019
I'm going to drop you off on a desert

3108
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,639
island you can take three strains with

3109
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:46,079
you for the rest of time what three

3110
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:47,880
would you take

3111
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:49,738
first of all the island would have to

3112
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:52,618
have a good water source and the soil

3113
02:13:49,738 --> 02:13:56,698
would have to be decent uh surprisingly

3114
02:13:52,618 --> 02:13:59,399
it's got everything got lots of coconuts

3115
02:13:56,698 --> 02:14:02,158
yeah oh yeah yeah lots of fan leaves

3116
02:13:59,399 --> 02:14:04,679
that shade you and take the basic

3117
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:09,479
building blocks of what we've mostly got

3118
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:13,739
today I'd take a very good Haze

3119
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:16,979
I'd take uh a really good skunk one and

3120
02:14:13,738 --> 02:14:19,979
uh maybe a Northern Lights five and you

3121
02:14:16,979 --> 02:14:22,198
can make a lot of things from that

3122
02:14:19,979 --> 02:14:25,138
I'll come back in 10 years and you've

3123
02:14:22,198 --> 02:14:26,879
rebuilt cookies from scratch

3124
02:14:25,139 --> 02:14:29,639
you know

3125
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:30,719
okay so this I thought is it's a

3126
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:33,300
different one to what we normally ask

3127
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:35,340
people and uh I wanted you to I wanted

3128
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:38,340
to hear your perspective on it looking

3129
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:40,199
back what do you think were some of the

3130
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:42,480
best seeds you ever had available

3131
02:14:40,198 --> 02:14:45,960
commercially

3132
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:49,698
yeah I've I've I've got I had an

3133
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:53,039
interest in giving away uh

3134
02:14:49,698 --> 02:14:55,138
certain varieties of seeds in the past

3135
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:57,599
because I thought that the one that you

3136
02:14:55,139 --> 02:14:59,219
give away are the most important ones

3137
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:01,500
because they're more than likely the

3138
02:14:59,219 --> 02:15:04,319
first seed somebody might grow

3139
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:07,520
so you've got to start it with a bang

3140
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:07,519
I remember

3141
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:14,639
I had this seed lot made once called

3142
02:15:10,078 --> 02:15:17,158
because who who's your Daddy yeah

3143
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:20,039
and basically what I did I think it took

3144
02:15:17,158 --> 02:15:23,399
a whole bunch of power plant

3145
02:15:20,039 --> 02:15:26,819
and the Clones you know top commercial

3146
02:15:23,399 --> 02:15:28,500
clone at the time in Holland and I I

3147
02:15:26,819 --> 02:15:32,219
situated a whole bunch of different

3148
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:34,319
males around the room that matured and

3149
02:15:32,219 --> 02:15:37,139
spread their pollen all over these

3150
02:15:34,319 --> 02:15:38,460
different Power Plant clones

3151
02:15:37,139 --> 02:15:40,800
and

3152
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:42,658
yeah it would call it who's your daddy

3153
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:45,179
because we didn't know who the daddy was

3154
02:15:42,658 --> 02:15:47,460
but we knew it was power plant

3155
02:15:45,179 --> 02:15:49,139
and it made a whole bunch of seeds a

3156
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:51,239
couple of kilos of seeds out of that I

3157
02:15:49,139 --> 02:15:53,340
think and just gave them away for eons

3158
02:15:51,238 --> 02:15:55,799
and just about everybody that grew them

3159
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:58,260
out was happy that they got a wonderful

3160
02:15:55,800 --> 02:16:00,539
plant that you know flowered fairly fast

3161
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:04,800
it was a good yield and had nice

3162
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:06,719
terpenes to it so yeah those are some of

3163
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:09,659
the more fun things that we've done in

3164
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:12,359
the past giving away batches of seeds

3165
02:16:09,658 --> 02:16:13,799
that I know are great and you could

3166
02:16:12,359 --> 02:16:16,198
probably sell them for a lot of money

3167
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:18,420
but knowing they're the first seeds a

3168
02:16:16,198 --> 02:16:20,638
lot of people will grow and to make sure

3169
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:23,420
that they grow something that they would

3170
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:23,420
really enjoy

3171
02:16:23,698 --> 02:16:27,899
that's brilliant I love it not the

3172
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:31,319
answer I was expecting but the answer we

3173
02:16:27,899 --> 02:16:33,058
deserved so final question we asked

3174
02:16:31,319 --> 02:16:35,039
people if I could give you a time

3175
02:16:33,058 --> 02:16:38,039
machine and you could go back anywhere

3176
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:40,500
any point in history presumably to get

3177
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:41,880
either clones or seeds where are you

3178
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:43,620
going to go and what are you going to

3179
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:47,518
collect

3180
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:50,399
oh goodness graciously I feel like um

3181
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:53,280
Philly is fog Around the World in 80

3182
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:57,858
Days who's going to be my past part two

3183
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:57,859
now and do the collecting

3184
02:17:00,898 --> 02:17:05,459
if I was to go back in history

3185
02:17:03,739 --> 02:17:07,138
[Music]

3186
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:08,098
well you know

3187
02:17:07,138 --> 02:17:11,398
um

3188
02:17:08,099 --> 02:17:12,978
the enormous Indian hemp trade that

3189
02:17:11,398 --> 02:17:15,478
there was

3190
02:17:12,978 --> 02:17:16,340
amongst I think it was the East India

3191
02:17:15,478 --> 02:17:18,898
Company

3192
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:21,359
particularly in the UK and throughout

3193
02:17:18,898 --> 02:17:25,039
the world India

3194
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:30,359
was one of the Prime Growers of of

3195
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:34,320
cannabis going back to the 17 1800s

3196
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:35,519
and to be able to go back to a time like

3197
02:17:34,319 --> 02:17:39,058
that

3198
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:42,840
and peruse through thousands of plants

3199
02:17:39,058 --> 02:17:45,659
in the fields and make selections and be

3200
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:46,859
able to bring genetic material from that

3201
02:17:45,659 --> 02:17:49,679
stop

3202
02:17:46,859 --> 02:17:52,739
back into the present

3203
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:54,290
yeah it could be a kind of Time Tunnel

3204
02:17:52,739 --> 02:17:57,488
episode at the very least

3205
02:17:54,290 --> 02:17:57,489
[Music]

3206
02:17:58,138 --> 02:18:02,279
that would be incredible a brilliant

3207
02:18:00,359 --> 02:18:04,859
pool to select from and a great answer

3208
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:06,659
in general so I think that just about

3209
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:08,579
brings us to the end of it for this one

3210
02:18:06,659 --> 02:18:09,718
are there any comments or shout outs

3211
02:18:08,579 --> 02:18:12,659

3212
