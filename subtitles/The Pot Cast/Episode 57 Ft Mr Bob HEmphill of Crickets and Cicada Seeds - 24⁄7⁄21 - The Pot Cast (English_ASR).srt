thanks for having me I'm really excited

79
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,419
to talk with you it's been a while and

80
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,818
it's always a good time

81
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:39,979
hell yeah the first thing I want to know

82
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,979
what have you been smoking on recently

83
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,419
um today I've been smoking on the HP 13

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,400
Lazy Dog cross mostly a little bit of

85
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,458
The Brood X too

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,620
oh nice some of the new releases

87
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,539
yeah yeah for sure

88
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,420
um really happy with the way they turned

89
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:00,120
out those two are really a killer

90
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,639
and what sort of high do they have is it

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,680
like a more sort of functional one or

92
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,238
like more sedating

93
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,640
so

94
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,920
for me it's functional I like to smoke

95
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,279
them during the day but they can be a

96
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,918
bit overwhelmingly potent even for me

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,540
you know both of those have a little bit

98
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,139
of sativa in there

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,780
um The Brood X is probably like 1 8 Y

100
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,439
and sativa through the Scentsy star and

101
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,659
um

102
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,279
you know me and you were talking last

103
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,000
time we talked we were talking about the

104
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,859
HP 13 and I had mentioned that I'd

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,918
always heard that it was just a land

106
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,680
race hash plan hash plant number 13.

107
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,978
well I made that comment recently on

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,240
Instagram and somebody sent me a DM I

109
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,219
don't know if they want to be put on the

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,400
spot here but so I won't throw their

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,320
name out but they uh mentioned that they

112
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:58,079
had heard a story that the HP 13

113
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:01,740
originated in Arizona

114
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:04,319
um and the mother was a a tie that was

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,360
called Victoria and they they needed a

116
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,459
indicator

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,139
the flowering time it was a bunch of

118
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:14,698
Brotherhood guys

119
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,680
um that had met in Oaxaca and I guess in

120
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,960
this story I heard was on an Indian

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,660
reservation in

122
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,239
Arizona they bred a whole bunch of

123
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,419
indicas on the Victoria tie clone and

124
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,360
that's the source of the HP 13 seats I

125
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,279
don't know if that's accurate or not

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,860
when I heard it I really like took it

127
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,978
with a grain of salt but

128
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,500
after I uh grew out a bunch of the HP 13

129
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,659
crosses I saw a few of them that did

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,620
have the uh

131
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,439
the flower structure of Thai where they

132
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,300
foxtel up into

133
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:56,219
a point and um it really made me uh

134
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,978
you know kind of think that that story

135
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,080
might be true because you know people

136
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:05,639
tell stories and plants tell the truth

137
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,099
I like that statement that's a good one

138
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,079
I'll have to remember that I mean the HP

139
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,639
13 is really interesting because for a

140
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,339
long time there's been you know all

141
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,160
these various rumors about it and one

142
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,758
that I find comes up regularly is that

143
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,740
it's somehow tied into either Skelly or

144
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,900
the chem dog or just through you know

145
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,079
some sort of common linkage to the chem

146
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,579
dog basically would you say that given

147
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,859
what you've just mentioned that you

148
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:36,779
don't think that's the case

149
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:40,319
well I had the HP 13 back in the day and

150
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:44,099
um that was I think I ended up dropping

151
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,020
her in 2006 because of uh I couldn't get

152
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,080
the PM off of her

153
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,060
and I got the copy again about a year

154
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,139
and a half ago and it's the same copy

155
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,899
it's

156
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,180
um I got it from Lion tree and um you

157
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,439
got it from a friend in Maui

158
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,000
no

159
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:05,759
the copy I'd gotten 15 years ago was

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,699
from another friend that had gotten it

161
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,759
from Maui and they were the same cut and

162
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,080
you know when I remember back from 2005

163
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,460
you know

164
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,918
um I've actually you know I've learned a

165
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:20,879
lot in the last 15 years so

166
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:25,019
it might be related to the same family

167
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,219
of hash plants that um the puck is from

168
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,459
and the

169
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,800
um Pacific Northwest but um it just

170
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,918
might be you know the same type of uh

171
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,598
terpene profile and you know the leaf

172
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:40,258
structures are pretty similar but the

173
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:43,019
the HP 13 has a much bigger inner node

174
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,819
stretch than the puck or the Pacific

175
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,198
Northwest

176
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,539
so

177
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,259
I would think maybe that

178
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:54,000
that Afghani family from the Pacific

179
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,120
Northwest and the

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,759
HP 13 might be you know similar

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,860
family and from Afghanistan

182
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,900
but I don't think there's any direct

183
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,560
lineage I think that

184
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:11,519
HP 13 probably um predates the

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,598
chem 91 by quite some time and

186
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,879
HP 13 has such a unique terpene profile

187
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,719
I've never really encountered it in any

188
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,439
other

189
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,720
cannabis and it really throws that in

190
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,839
its crosses like spread

191
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,459
um a four-way Sour Diesel great white

192
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:36,899
shark cross to it in 2005 and

193
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:40,500
um does HB 13 Terps uh really dominate

194
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:43,740
stuff and um you know I see that again

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,879
this this cross and the lazy dog male is

196
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:51,000
uh really throws a certain qualities

197
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,220
um strongly so it was able to

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,220
impart some really good qualities into

199
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,080
the HP 13 were you get the bigger bud

200
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,379
structure and you get

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,278
really strong strong potent weed and

202
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:04,500
then

203
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,860
the HP 13 added some of those really

204
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,379
cool chirpings in there and they're just

205
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,778
so unique and you know you can't miss

206
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,639
them I really doubt that it's actually

207
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,958
part of

208
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,199
um camera

209
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,879
the park like directly

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,339
related

211
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,740
yeah okay what a what a good run down

212
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,980
there I think the other thing I'd heard

213
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,039
about the HP 13 was that it might

214
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,080
somehow be tied into the Maui dog which

215
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,958
is another one which you know often gets

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,700
sort of linked into all the chem stuff

217
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,679
what's your thoughts on the HP 13 and

218
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,259
the Maui dog is it the same in that

219
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,819
maybe there's a similar bit of afghanika

220
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,100
there but they're probably not related

221
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,040
or where do you see those two in

222
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,560
relation to each other so I actually got

223
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,199
the Maui dog came along with the HP 13

224
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,419
for the ride and um

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,820
there's a few different

226
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:03,000
Maui dogs in Maui

227
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,740
um there's the Maui skunk dog uh there's

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,179
the West Side Maui dog and then there's

229
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,580
this one so there's at least two or

230
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:14,879
three of them and um

231
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,100
this one is uh chem 91 backseat most

232
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,740
likely an S1

233
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,620
you know not so dog said it probably

234
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,019
came from his grow or the person that

235
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,360
held down the 91 and brought it out from

236
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,240
the East Coast one of their close

237
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,580
friends and it was taken over and

238
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,039
um popped in Maui and that that that

239
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,800
that really uh you know that's it when

240
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,980
you grow the plant you know it's a chem

241
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:44,458
91 S1 there's no Hawaiian sativa or any

242
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,800
skunk in there anything like that which

243
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:50,699
would be the other Maui dogs like not so

244
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:54,359
dog had a Maui dog he bred with a mass

245
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,660
super skunk and uh chem 91 and that's

246
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,459
not it this is just a a backseat you

247
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,799
know it's you know one of those strands

248
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,419
like headband or something else where

249
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,359
there's several different strains that

250
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,399
go by the same name so that causes a

251
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,899
mass confusion

252
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,720
but um

253
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,778
I bred The Lazy Dog mail to the

254
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,180
Maui dog and I also brought him back to

255
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,700
the chem 91 that made a chem 91 back

256
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:24,000
cross and I grew the back cross out and

257
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:27,899
I grew the Maui dog out and um so so

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,320
similar and um the Maui dog is such a

259
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,360
good ass one that really

260
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,640
amplifies the those good chem 91

261
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,879
qualities that it actually probably

262
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,539
turned out better than the back cross so

263
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,299
um

264
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:46,259
got me thinking and I'm like well if it

265
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,479
is a S1 that would make the Maui dog go

266
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,240
back to the chem 91 two times and then

267
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,879
the lazy dog goes back to it once so

268
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,060
that would make it go back to the chem

269
00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:00,720
91 three times in a very close you know

270
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:04,259
two three generation pedigree and um

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,759
where the back crosses only twice so you

272
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,639
know that kind of makes sense that it

273
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,740
would be more true to type because it's

274
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,600
um pretty forwards instead of breeding

275
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,000
backwards because the Maui dog really

276
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,019
like I said amplifies some of the best

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,419
qualities of the chem91 can produce

278
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,919
wow that's really interesting and it

279
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,319
sort of brings us to another question

280
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,500
that I wanted to ask you about

281
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,540
have you had any success or further

282
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,120
developments in terms of sort of trying

283
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,578
to reinvigorate the chem or do you think

284
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,740
like what you just said that it's maybe

285
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,838
better just to use the Maui dog going

286
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,639
forward given it's you know arguably

287
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,040
better

288
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,600
well you know as far as working a pure

289
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,860
chem line I'm going to leave that to

290
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,259
Lucky Dog and Top Dog I'm more you know

291
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,139
just bringing for a certain type of uh

292
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,899
plant that I remember in the 90s and um

293
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,299
I thought adding the chem 91 to the NL

294
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,339
hash plant you know not necessarily

295
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,620
breeding for pedigree but more breeding

296
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,980
for a certain type of plant

297
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,078
um and that's the reason I hit it to the

298
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,420
Scentsy star next

299
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,759
um just breeding for a certain type of

300
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:18,539
plant and you know I believe the Scentsy

301
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:21,659
star and the chem 991 both go back to NL

302
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:25,379
so it's you know um in my opinion the

303
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:27,659
best NL around you know um even though

304
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,419
it's not the purest it's just kind of

305
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:33,419
like the best examples of what I

306
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:36,240
remember of good NL wheat from the mid

307
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:38,578
to early 90s and you know that's what I

308
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,820
was just trying to um lock in those

309
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:44,338
genes um up from those old Cuts you know

310
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,278
the Scentsy stars from the mid 90s too

311
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,139
and I believe Scentsy star's mother was

312
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,620
garlic bud and

313
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:55,139
the father was in a Hawaiian and um you

314
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,159
know I think garlic bud is probably part

315
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:02,579
of 1091 too maybe garlic bud

316
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,919
hash plant skunk type of thing would

317
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:05,759
give you something very similar to chem

318
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,559
dog

319
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,039
yeah that's a really interesting

320
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,659
hypothesis there because I've been sort

321
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,879
of debating the question in my mind

322
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,100
about whether we ever will find out the

323
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,220
real story behind cam dog it seems like

324
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,139
most of the origins have been chased as

325
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,940
far as you can take them and it's still

326
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,039
not really yielding the answer but

327
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,480
something that I wonder which you just

328
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,179
brought up is

329
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,339
like what are the genetics in the chem

330
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,199
dog in your mind that give it that

331
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,760
stretch because a lot of people and I

332
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,519
think we've discussed this ourselves

333
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,159
just when we were hanging out that you

334
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,799
know the the similarities between Skelly

335
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,539
or even the pnw are very present you

336
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,639
know there's a similar flavor profile

337
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:49,379
and effect but the thing about the chem

338
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,480
dog that always tripped me up was how

339
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,458
stretchy it is compared to a lot of the

340
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,560
plants that often get said you know this

341
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,259
is maybe apparent this is maybe a parent

342
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,939
do you think that maybe in the the

343
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,679
combination you just mentioned with the

344
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,959
garlic Bud the hash plant and the skunk

345
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,419
that maybe it's the skunk that brings

346
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,219
that stretch or do you think it's some

347
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,799
weird combination which just brought it

348
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,560
out when it wasn't expected

349
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,740
yeah um you know

350
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,838
I'm not an expert on skunk but um you

351
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,379
know I think skunks got quite a bit of

352
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:25,139
Colombian and you know um a few others

353
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,519
sativas mixed with the uh

354
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,600
Afghani

355
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,320
so

356
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
um

357
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,680
chem 91 definitely besides the stretch

358
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,119
it has the um the way the flowers

359
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,458
um

360
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,339
will just keep getting wider and wider

361
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,739
in the center of the butt is right you

362
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,959
know at eight and a half weeks but if

363
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,039
you're looking at the outside the um

364
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:52,198
it'll keep going until 77 days

365
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,500
um you know certain people notice that

366
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,319
it's actually a test hiring has better

367
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,659
terpenes at about eight and a half weeks

368
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,920
um you know compared to like 10 or 11

369
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:06,000
weeks

370
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,639
so um the way that that just keeps uh

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,379
putting out and

372
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,019
going around the butt is definitely

373
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:16,740
sativa qualities

374
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:19,320
almost uh reminds me of haze crosses

375
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,759
that I've seen like n.l Hayes crosses

376
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,399
can kind of do that same thing

377
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,259
yeah that's so interesting because I

378
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,299
remember I was talking to skunk VA about

379
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,939
it and he said something to the effect

380
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:36,599
of he goes every now and again I wonder

381
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,160
is chemdog even a real Indica he goes

382
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
sometimes I think there's sativa in

383
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,159
there he goes it's almost like kind of

384
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,159
like what you mentioned with the lazy

385
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,319
dog crosses like it's just so potent

386
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,419
that sometimes it tricks you into

387
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,579
thinking it's a real heavy Indica but

388
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:53,219
maybe it's not as heavy as we give it

389
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,838
credit for it's just so potent that it

390
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,360
sort of knocks you down a bit and you're

391
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,160
like ah super Indica

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,600
um do you think of it like that have you

393
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,519
ever thought that maybe there's some

394
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,860
sativa in the cam

395
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,338
I I would say almost a hundred percent

396
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,379
uh maybe 25 and it just you know carries

397
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:13,078
those few qualities

398
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,120
I wish we knew more about the history of

399
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,500
cannabis you know um people have always

400
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,979
been Trading

401
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,199
Silk Road and the hippie Trail all went

402
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,058
through there and people are always uh

403
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,939
taking seeds and spreading them around

404
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,078
and really don't know much about

405
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,140
um

406
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,539
history in Asia but I'm sure there was a

407
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,160
lot of uh people moving from Southeast

408
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:39,599
Asia and Afghanistan back and forth and

409
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,980
people take cannabis with them that's

410
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,859
what they do

411
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,679
I wish we had a a better

412
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:49,379
um view of everything like most land

413
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:53,059
races have been ruined at this point and

414
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:56,940
we only have glimpses here and there of

415
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:58,918
what there was and um is left in some

416
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,460
places

417
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,580
yeah sadly that is the truth isn't it

418
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,620
I'm gonna jump back to the Silk Road you

419
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,599
just mentioned a minute ago but before I

420
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,119
get there I just want to quickly ask

421
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,339
do you think we'll ever find the true

422
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,918
Roadkill skunk and if you were going to

423
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,659
try to find the roadkill skunk where

424
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,720
would you look what genetics would it be

425
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,900
in pure skunk Afghani or some sort of

426
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,900
mix

427
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:29,960
um always looking for something like

428
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,960
that and um

429
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,038
I don't have it in my Arsenal I bred

430
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:38,460
with the four-way so many different

431
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:42,660
times I brought it to great white shark

432
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,220
and 98 I brought it to AK-47

433
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,558
Reddit

434
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,240
um and bread chemdog from South Fork

435
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:54,359
seeds serious which was a mix of 707

436
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,919
seed banks uh 707 chem dog and star dog

437
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,659
from JJ

438
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,520
brought it to

439
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,640
nl1

440
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:06,119
and it never really

441
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,799
passed along those uh skunk qualities it

442
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,739
passed along a lot of other nice

443
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,819
qualities but you know

444
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,460
um

445
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:16,200
I hope it's not a something that's lost

446
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,298
and it's just going to be mythical from

447
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,360
here on out hopefully someone has it in

448
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,619
their gene pool and they'll share it

449
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,259
with the community

450
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,418
yeah I mean as someone who's never been

451
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,720
able to try it I would certainly love to

452
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,759
see if it meets the hype or uh if it's

453
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,240
sort of one of those just fabled strains

454
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,038
from years ago but let's go back and uh

455
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,440
State the obvious you know it's pretty

456
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,839
exciting times for you and hannibalt

457
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,279
recently because since we last spoke a

458
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,579
number of years ago

459
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,558
uh you've been able to sort of part ways

460
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,720
from Coastal and launch your own brand

461
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,119
crickets and cicada which has been met

462
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,279
with a lot of success and even more

463
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,139
recently the the momentum behind your

464
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,839
work has just been going off the chain

465
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,580
have you been since we last spoke and

466
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,779
how's the new company and what have you

467
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:05,779
been keeping yourself busy with

468
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,980
it's been a wild ride since we last

469
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,798
talked um some lots of good times and

470
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,319
some rough times and

471
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,879
um you know I've just been focusing

472
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,119
mostly on

473
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,880
working my lines that I like and

474
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,579
hannibalt likes the most and

475
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,380
about a year ago I you know came out of

476
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,298
you know like a little bit of uh

477
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:34,020
depression Funk and I just really went

478
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:34,859
full full blast on on the company

479
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,960
um

480
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,519
I had a good friend passed away and you

481
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,720
know kind of put me in a fall for a few

482
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,918
years and a couple other raw things but

483
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,240
um

484
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:52,020
the support from the community has been

485
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,960
tremendous and it's really heartfelt and

486
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,480
appreciated and even if you're just you

487
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,620
know liking or commenting on Instagram

488
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,740
it's it's appreciated and

489
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:07,439
um really cool to see people uh

490
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,259
interested in these old genetics and not

491
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,600
just the same old

492
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:14,940
um cookie fam stuff and

493
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,339
supporting us so we can continue to work

494
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,320
these lines further and hopefully uh

495
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:21,839
bring out some really cool stuff into

496
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,298
the gene pool that hasn't been there in

497
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,639
seed form for quite a few years

498
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,558
yeah what a what a great insight into

499
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,820
what you've been doing recently and I I

500
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,678
think I speak for everyone when I say

501
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,359
we're glad to hear you're back kicking

502
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,980
things in full swing

503
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,418
just in a few questions ago you

504
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,759
mentioned the Silk Road and it brought

505
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,500
up to mind that you released a strain

506
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:44,038
called The Silk Road which was the

507
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Lebanese hash plant crossed by the pnw

508
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,419
hash plant no one how did that go for

509
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,940
you did it sort of bring some of the

510
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:54,000
traits you were looking to create to the

511
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,700
Forefront and will you possibly be

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,700
working any more strains like that

513
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,880
so there's some really cool stuff to be

514
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:06,120
found in that across the red Lebanese

515
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,700
hash plant as you know is amazing smell

516
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,379
super potent

517
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,019
um the fact that she's land race though

518
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:16,140
she throws stuff all over the place so

519
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:18,418
it's not my most consistent strain which

520
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,020
you know in my opinion that's a good

521
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,820
Factor but there's you know quite a few

522
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:25,740
different females of the hash plant that

523
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:29,819
can pop out and then

524
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:33,298
the NL hash plant side so it's a really

525
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:35,639
cool mix and if you you know F2 those

526
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:39,900
there's going to be some crazy stuff uh

527
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,759
popping out I have the red lab in the

528
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,580
reading room right now with the puck

529
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,538
back cross and I'm excited to grow those

530
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:51,119
ones out really excited about that one

531
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:53,339
yeah wow hash Planet Lover's wet dream

532
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,019
right there having both parents come

533
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,599
from either side with that sort of

534
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,700
genetic lineage I guess the thing that I

535
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,240
would be wondering is having been lucky

536
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,100
enough to see the Lebanese hash plant in

537
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,440
your garden I've seen that it's it's

538
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:09,538
quite stretchy I mean you know compared

539
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,360
to say like the pnw hash planet or the

540
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,579
Skelly hash plant it's got a lot of you

541
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,219
know vigorous side branching really

542
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:18,720
admirable traits and then you know on

543
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,819
the other side of the parental lineage

544
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,279
we've got the traditional hash plant you

545
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,439
know that totem pole Kush

546
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,899
do you expect people to find maybe a

547
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,820
happy medium when these two meet and

548
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,440
cross paths or do you think you'll get

549
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,079
some that are like mum some that are

550
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,419
like Dad and in your mind is the ideal

551
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,980
Fino the one in the middle or is it just

552
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,360
taking one or two traits from either

553
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,179
side

554
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:45,298
so you know with that

555
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:49,019
F1 hybrid there I'm sure I'm expecting

556
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:50,940
to see you know 30 leading towards the

557
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,759
the mother of the hash plant side 30

558
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,700
leaning towards the puck that cross and

559
00:23:53,759 --> 00:24:00,000
then you know the other 30 percent in

560
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,519
the blend you know f1s are you know if

561
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,440
you're into hunting seeds and finding

562
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:05,879
cool stuff man they're really cool

563
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,340
because

564
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,380
there's gonna be quite a mix in there

565
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:14,038
and

566
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:17,220
the red lab as you know has some amazing

567
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:20,400
Terps you know turpsy roll

568
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,640
um amazingness and like you said the the

569
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,400
branching and the way she can stack she

570
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,259
gets a really big Cola

571
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,740
so she can add a lot of really nice

572
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:34,319
qualities to the Max and um I'm excited

573
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,599
to grow that one out and uh

574
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,639
I put every houseplant I had in there I

575
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,199
put the

576
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,980
Nepalese hash plant Pacific Northwest

577
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,220
hash plant put the puck in there

578
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,880
through the bx2

579
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,519
um

580
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,760
and a bunch of Northern Lights clones

581
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,798
so I'm excited about that one

582
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,960
that's awesome and there's a whole bunch

583
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,700
of avenues I want to delve into with you

584
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,779
off that one but before we move on I

585
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,179
just want to quickly ask because I've

586
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,980
had a number of people ask me this would

587
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,259
you be able to give us a quick rundown

588
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,140
on what you know of the back story

589
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:13,319
behind the red Lebanese hash plant

590
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,259
came from bamboo he got it from a

591
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:19,500
relative of Tim Blakes I heard it was

592
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:23,579
Howard marks stock

593
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,740
so I don't know much besides that

594
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:28,619
yeah well I mean you don't really hear

595
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,298
about Howard marks you know the for

596
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,339
people listening the original Mr Nice

597
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:34,200
you don't really hear a lot about his

598
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,959
personal seed stock but it makes sense

599
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,740
that there would have been some right

600
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,538
that guy was a serious smuggle Smuggler

601
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,740
um he did a lot of smuggling in the U.S

602
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,519
and

603
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,058
I'm sure he uh spread genetics you know

604
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,319
um

605
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:52,379
really

606
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,720
big good dealers uh especially back then

607
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,580
that was before my time even because I

608
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,759
know in my time in the 90s especially

609
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,980
the dealers would you know get the good

610
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,480
cuts into the Growers hands a lot of the

611
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,778
time so that they could get that weight

612
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,819
you know so um I'm sure in Howard's time

613
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:11,819
it was even more important for that type

614
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:14,639
of thing to happen yeah wow it makes me

615
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:16,939
think like that's that's the seed stock

616
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,880
I want to go get my hands on somehow but

617
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,759
anyway we'll move on I uh I wanted to

618
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,380
fill people in because I had I'd noticed

619
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,538
that the name of the new company

620
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,980
crickets and cicada it's a cool name and

621
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:30,419
I'd actually heard that from a lot of

622
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,640
different people they thought it was

623
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,140
like unique and like very different to

624
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,720
the sort of names you hear on the market

625
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,820
nowadays and I know that you used to

626
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,759
have a dog called cicada a beautiful

627
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,399
girl had the pleasure of meeting once

628
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,440
and I'm wondering slash guessing was

629
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,700
that the inspiration for the name of the

630
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,200
brand and if you might be able to give

631
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,538
us a bit of a rundown on where the name

632
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,460
comes from

633
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:57,599
yeah um

634
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:02,159
I had a cat named Cricket too and um

635
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:04,139
the the name is from uh terrapin

636
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,020
um

637
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,799
crickets and cicada sing

638
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:14,038
is uh the line in the Terrapin and I

639
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:17,879
just put it uh crickets and cicada seeds

640
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,558
um just keep it keep the family names in

641
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,900
there and then you know Terrapin Station

642
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,480
is one of my favorite songs of all time

643
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,059
and Grateful Dead has been such a huge

644
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,278
inspiration in my life

645
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:31,259
yeah that's awesome and I'll I'm gonna

646
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,819
get to some Grateful Dead questions in a

647
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,740
little bit but I just wanted to quickly

648
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,558
follow up one of our listeners had

649
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,200
requested to ask you if you had any tips

650
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:43,019
on treating dogs with cannabis for

651
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,819
example what you might use the sort of

652
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,379
dosages I know that you've had a little

653
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:48,720
bit of experience with this do you have

654
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,799
any recommendations

655
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,000
yeah it starts slowly and uh work your

656
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,859
way up

657
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,380
and um

658
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:00,298
you know if you can work with a lab you

659
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,299
know get your uh

660
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:06,240
coconut oil tested to see how strong it

661
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:08,819
is you know per weight and then you can

662
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,759
know how much you're dosing and

663
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:15,658
work your way up and um

664
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:18,778
it does amazing things with old or

665
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:22,080
injured animals but like I said it's

666
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:23,579
very important to start slow and work

667
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,500
your way up because that can get pretty

668
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,298
[ __ ] up and where they where they

669
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,220
can't walk and they're just kind of like

670
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,558
[ __ ] up if you don't

671
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,079
do that you know I've lived in Humboldt

672
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,058
County since 97 and I've heard of a lot

673
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,778
of and seen a lot of people's dogs get

674
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:40,678
into

675
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:43,200
compost piles full of Pounds full of

676
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,840
buttered out ganja and they just get in

677
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,860
there and Munch it and animals can

678
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,459
become

679
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:52,379
quite [ __ ] up so make sure they don't

680
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,600
have access to large amounts like that

681
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,700
because if they like it they'll eat it

682
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,199
you know especially if it's in butter

683
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,120
coconut oil

684
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,080
that's just an important tip right there

685
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:06,599
though because but I highly recommend it

686
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,418
cook it in a crock pot use a candy

687
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,759
thermometer so you don't get it too hot

688
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,820
strain it through a cheese cloth and

689
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:18,419
coconut oil cats lead it dogs will eat

690
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:21,000
it and I've seen it extend years on the

691
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:24,020
animals lives and in the quality of uh

692
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,519
that the life of older animals is

693
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:28,798
dramatically increased they're not in

694
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,679
pain walking around and they can sleep

695
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,778
through the night

696
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,538
it's just amazing

697
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:40,798
that's so awesome to hear and just to

698
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:43,019
clarify would you recommend just THC or

699
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,000
a mixture THC CBD because we see a lot

700
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,099
of CBD Brands emerging that are trying

701
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,140
to cater specifically for animals and

702
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,298
then finally would you recommend them

703
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,080
having a dose every day or like how

704
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:57,599
frequently I recommend one-to-one CBD to

705
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:01,019
THC and um

706
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,418
you really want High uh terpene strains

707
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,980
it really matters in the healing effect

708
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,480
and

709
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,419
um you don't have to have a one-to-one

710
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,460
string and you can have

711
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:14,940
THC strain in the CBD strain and just

712
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,100
mix them 50 50 in there and then um CBD

713
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,179
is crucial and the THC is crucial I

714
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:21,418
think they got to be in there together

715
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:24,059
to work really I'm sure CBD by itself

716
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:27,299
would be good in THC by itself would

717
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:29,519
definitely be good but if you uh can mix

718
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,500
them both it's far superior

719
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,139
awesome stuff

720
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,579
so just to throw back to the Grateful

721
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,520
Dead you mentioned another one of our

722
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:41,240
guests wanted to know what's your

723
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:45,418
favorite Grateful Dead show of all time

724
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:48,899
or do you have like a specific tour that

725
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:53,220
you like more than one specific show

726
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:55,678
so as far as uh tips and stuff I love 77

727
00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:00,600
um that's one of my favorite years I

728
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:03,240
gotta see them live myself in 93 and 94

729
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,178
and 95 unfortunately I didn't graduate

730
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:10,640
high school in 90 until 94 so

731
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:15,419
I got to see Jerry about 30 to 50 times

732
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,520
and every single time I saw him was the

733
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,679
most amazing thing you felt like he was

734
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,960
talking directly to you

735
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,059
it's hard you know to get tickets back

736
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,000
then it was really a struggle everybody

737
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:28,440
wanted to get in so when you finally did

738
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,380
get in and

739
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,960
you know he played you know A Touch of

740
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:37,080
Gray or something you really felt it

741
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,899
you've I I don't know he you know some

742
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,519
musicians are just amazing and that's

743
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,619
you know the only way he can be

744
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,179
described is amazing I think everyone in

745
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,719
the audience felt like he was talking

746
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:51,538
directly to them personally and uh the

747
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,880
songs were telling the stories of

748
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:55,919
everybody's lives all inner one together

749
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,020
very thankful I got to experience that

750
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,720
in my lifetime

751
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:03,119
what an awesome recount that's killer

752
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,640
that's killer what's your thoughts on

753
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,879
people naming their strains after

754
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,380
Grateful Dead songs and I just guess I

755
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,179
wonder like

756
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,220
when there's these really well-known

757
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,899
song names and then you get a strain and

758
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,240
like maybe it's not a good strain like

759
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:20,479
does that is that like a bummer like I

760
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
don't know

761
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:27,119
I think every uh Grateful Dead song name

762
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,880
is already taken up in strand form uh me

763
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,819
and P Bud Mike were actually uh texting

764
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,520
today about this laughing and joking

765
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,960
I think it's a cool tribute to the band

766
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,058
um hopefully people don't start getting

767
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,798
sued

768
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:43,319
that's it right that's it in the age of

769
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,778
being sued I mean brings up a great

770
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:47,939
Point yeah I love chatting with you

771
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:51,298
because you're like me you often just

772
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:53,038
lurk around on social media and so like

773
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,898
you know maybe you're not commenting on

774
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,480
every post but I can Bank on you having

775
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:59,398
seen the post so my question is what's

776
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,740
your thoughts on terpogs and getting

777
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,139
sued by Skittles do you think it was

778
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,859
sort of had it coming or where do you

779
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,299
sit

780
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:08,339
you know

781
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,980
um I think it was definitely

782
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,558
not gonna be a hard decision for uh the

783
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,640
judge to decide if it was a infringement

784
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,119
or not

785
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,679
um so that being said they probably you

786
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,898
know didn't think of that when they

787
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,360
started their brand and their Brand's

788
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:26,819
amazing and you know it's an unfortunate

789
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,519
situation to be honest with the way I

790
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:31,439
see it especially uh since the you know

791
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,359
the owner of that candy company starting

792
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,820
to get into the marijuana business it's

793
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,259
just like don't support that guy you

794
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,240
know [ __ ] that guy that's what you know

795
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,298
that's all I got to say about that one

796
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,099
yeah that is suspicious timing isn't it

797
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,200
I think the thing about the Skittles

798
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:49,459
situation which makes me interested in

799
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,460
it all is like sort of two aspects a

800
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,038
there was the matte rise incident of I

801
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,798
believe 2015 where he got a cease and

802
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,298
desist from Nintendo after I'm sure you

803
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,179
remember back in the day every oil

804
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:05,879
company had like a Mario or a Bowser or

805
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,878
a peach or something on their labeling

806
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,639
and like Nintendo was the big thing to

807
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,918
sort of take characters from anyway he

808
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,599
got he was the first one I believe to

809
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,158
receive some sort of legal notification

810
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,200
about the use of another company's

811
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,419
trademark so I think it's interesting

812
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,519
that there's already like a precedent

813
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,559
um and I think that that came about

814
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,000
before they found Skittles so that's

815
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,398
interesting but I think the more

816
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,980
interesting part about the story is the

817
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,019
way they're reacting to it and it seems

818
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,240
like rather than sort of copping it

819
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:38,579
sweet and being like yep look we're

820
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,858
gonna have to Rebrand somehow you know a

821
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:43,500
lot of the posts seem to be like you

822
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:47,699
know we made Skittles everyone uses the

823
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,858
Z in Skittles and like it's just sort of

824
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,299
like not the approach I was expecting

825
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,398
them to take

826
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,080
have you thought about that at all and

827
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:56,759
what's your thoughts on them when

828
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,019
they're sort of trying to lash out and

829
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,000
say to everyone well you know everyone

830
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,099
uses Skittles in their spelling we

831
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,139
started this trend blah blah blah like

832
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,740
is that gonna go anywhere yeah what's

833
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:10,500
your thoughts you know it's uh it's it's

834
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,000
uh I wouldn't be acting like them that's

835
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,760
for damn sure

836
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,619
um but you know I hope I don't get a

837
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,180
citizen's assist for uh crickets and

838
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,760
cicadas at some point

839
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:23,399
it'll be a below not just to the company

840
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,260
but you know

841
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,639
The Grateful Dead you know that the band

842
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,200
that used to let everyone tape their

843
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,299
shows for free that they could spread

844
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,139
the music for free you know

845
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:37,220
yeah okay good answer good answer

846
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:40,319
so I've been interested to ask you

847
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:42,239
you're a passionate organic grower like

848
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,519
myself like many people we've had on the

849
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,379
show I like that you're always pretty up

850
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,719
to date with the newest trends and the

851
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,760
going ons of the organic world is there

852
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,858
anything new you've started doing in

853
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,980
your garden in regards to Growing or

854
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,539
maybe amendments or inputs that are sort

855
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,579
of new compared to the last time we

856
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:03,179
spoke

857
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:06,060
um I've implemented the vitamixer into

858
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:09,779
my uh game and it's been

859
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:12,480
really cool so I bought for the last 10

860
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,400
or 15 years when I have extra male

861
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,059
plants I always feed them

862
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,820
to the the crop when I call them out I

863
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:23,639
used to put them in an extraction bag

864
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,720
and and soak them in water overnight

865
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,598
when I

866
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,480
brewed my dragonfly Earth medicine

867
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,400
and I would uh rub the bag to help

868
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,400
extract

869
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
but um about a year and a half ago I

870
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,760
started

871
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,500
cutting them up and sticking them in the

872
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,380
vitamixer and

873
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,960
just uh blending it to juice and then

874
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,960
adding that onto my water and they're

875
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:55,320
responding even better to that

876
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:59,039
also uh do nettle and um horsetail

877
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:01,800
and they're loving that and uh aloe vera

878
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:05,099
just put aloe vera leaves in there and

879
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,320
some water and uh grind it up and then

880
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,599
add that to my uh

881
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,280
you know I'm watering with a trash can

882
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,780
right now with the sub pump on the

883
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,500
bottom that circulates the water around

884
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,780
to keep it all mixed up nice and um you

885
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,480
know I wouldn't recommend doing that

886
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,000
every feeding but a few times per trip

887
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,539
uh with those uh ingredients I just

888
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,940
named have been really helpful to my uh

889
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,579
old regiment which is mostly uh

890
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,700
earthworm castings and compost

891
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,980
nice and are you at the end of a cycle

892
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:39,899
are you pulling the soil out and mixing

893
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,400
it up and mixing new amendments in or

894
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,500
are you sort of that more traditional

895
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,320
node to where you just top dress a few

896
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,800
things and Chuck the new plant in

897
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,900
got to work with the lab and send it and

898
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,740
um and whatever the lab says and it's

899
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,599
done I'll do it if it doesn't need any

900
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:59,399
major adjustments I'll leave it in the

901
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,440
pot two or three times you know

902
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,639
sometimes I'll I'll need to get them all

903
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,179
out and

904
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:10,858
flush them and add certain ingredients

905
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:14,639
wow to get everything proper ratios or

906
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:17,400
get calmag ratios proper and whatever

907
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,440
you know like you you can shoot from the

908
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,720
hip and just throw on you know a handful

909
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,119
of this a handful on that and you know

910
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:26,578
you can kind of get good at doing that

911
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,380
but you'll never be as good as sending

912
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,820
it to a lab and working with a lab and

913
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,940
having them tell you what you need to

914
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,579
add to your soil

915
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,980
yeah certainly I think that what you

916
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,019
said is just so true isn't it like you

917
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,420
with time you can get good at having an

918
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,980
idea of what you need but the true sort

919
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,900
of clear picture in the situation is

920
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,940
doing a lab test and adjusting and

921
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,920
there's so many different ways you can

922
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,500
do that I mean in Australia obviously

923
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,599
lab tests aren't utilized very often for

924
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,219
almost anything like I mean so so you

925
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,900
can get tested for sure but like I'm in

926
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:00,358
cannabinoids and stuff like that like

927
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,680
you just can't get it tested but what's

928
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,319
interesting is

929
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,940
I've um I've spoken to people about the

930
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,300
way they do their soil tests and there's

931
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,099
a lot of diversity some people say

932
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,440
they've got 10 pots like they might

933
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,180
order 10 tests but that's going to be

934
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,039
quite expensive after a while if you're

935
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:19,440
doing it regularly and then I spoke to

936
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,139
someone else and they said oh no like

937
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,019
I'll just test one pot every so often

938
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:27,118
that I think is like a sort of Benchmark

939
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:30,659
and then someone else told me a cool

940
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,539
idea where they say they get a little

941
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:36,960
sample from each part

942
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:38,940
and mix it together and send that in and

943
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,440
then if it's pretty good they just leave

944
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,119
it but if something needs to be changed

945
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,338
they'll then pull all the root balls out

946
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,400
like all the soil out mix it all

947
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:49,440
together fix it and put it back together

948
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,240
long story short I know I know that just

949
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,460
took a long time to explain the question

950
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:55,199
is how do you get your soil tested do

951
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,980
you just test one of them or what do you

952
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,919
do

953
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,420
yeah a little bit from a bunch of

954
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,000
different parts

955
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,338
um and mix it all together

956
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,739
and I think that'll give you the best

957
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:11,519
picture so you know obviously some

958
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,679
strands are going to pull certain

959
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,420
nutrients out of there harder or certain

960
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,059
plants are getting bigger and they're

961
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,579
going to use the nutrients more than the

962
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:23,699
smaller plants you know even of the same

963
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,560
variety but um you know you just can't

964
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,299
send out a million samples to the lab

965
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,519
you know you just got to kind of mix a

966
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,300
little bit of everything together and

967
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,338
then

968
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,920
Shuffle it up and then send that to the

969
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:38,219
lab would be my best advice to anybody

970
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,380
out there sure and the final little bit

971
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:43,500
on Organics for the moment is

972
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:46,260
do you try to have your soil full of

973
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,699
nutrients and ready for the coming cycle

974
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,640
such that you're really just sort of

975
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:52,259
watering only with the occasional tea or

976
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,239
do you like the idea of sort of

977
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,520
periodically top dressing and always

978
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,819
having things in a state of breaking

979
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:03,659
down and releasing nutrients

980
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,579
I like um a really rich soil but not so

981
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:09,000
rich that you only give it water I like

982
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:11,160
to feed it tears and top dress and hit

983
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,739
the plants with certain you know food

984
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,920
regiments at certain times to to get the

985
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:20,279
results that I like out of them so you

986
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:24,119
know as a lately I like uh popping my

987
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,619
seeds and uh Royal Gold Kings mix and

988
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,320
four inch pots

989
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,960
and then I I mix them I let them go in

990
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,338
that for about three or four weeks uh

991
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,338
straight water or maybe the last few

992
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:37,320
feedings I'll mix in some calmac and

993
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:39,960
then I'll uh move them up to a two

994
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,160
gallon and my custom soil

995
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,740
my custom soil is too hot for seedlings

996
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:49,379
um there it's just uh it's too much but

997
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:52,858
even with that I still like to top dress

998
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,740
and feed them with teas because I use uh

999
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:57,598
smaller pots three to five gallons and I

1000
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:00,719
really uh put them as close to the

1001
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,760
lights as possible and you know they eat

1002
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,399
the food up that way really hard and

1003
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,640
fast so that's just the method that it's

1004
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,280
worked for me best uh over the years so

1005
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:14,159
what a good Rundown we'll have to

1006
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,440
implement that next cycle ourselves one

1007
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,239
of the biggest sort of pieces of

1008
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,760
feedback I received about our first

1009
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,159
episode was how grateful people were

1010
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,619
about the depth of detail you went into

1011
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,899
with your IPM regimen and I think people

1012
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,099
have been able to successfully use that

1013
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,500
themselves

1014
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:33,420
I guess it makes me wonder you know are

1015
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,239
you still the IPM King he's still

1016
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,858
kicking ass each cut you get yeah I mean

1017
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,899
you gotta um

1018
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:41,338
be on your IPM game if you're going to

1019
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,300
keep these mothers around that's for

1020
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:48,299
sure you know I suffer his King still

1021
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,960
um I'm also doing a

1022
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:58,880
um another mix with uh I use an ounce or

1023
00:42:51,960 --> 00:43:03,179
two per gallon of uh alcohol the um 99.9

1024
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,420
mix that with uh plant therapy

1025
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:09,299
an ounce or two per gallon an ounce of

1026
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,480
Dr Bronner soap per gallon some

1027
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,760
essential oils and uh you know maybe a

1028
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,699
quarter ounce per gallon

1029
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,099
and Alternate your essential oils and no

1030
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:23,159
one's been treating me real nice lately

1031
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:25,200
knocks out a bunch of stuff and um

1032
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,480
doesn't really bother the plants too

1033
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,980
much the only thing in there that really

1034
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,440
bothers the plants would be the

1035
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,420
essential oils just make sure it's not

1036
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,159
too hot when you're spraying and you

1037
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,680
don't want to be doing it you know above

1038
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,940
90 degrees and you want the lights to be

1039
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:40,500
off

1040
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,838
um you don't want the fans blowing on

1041
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,659
the plants too hard either for until

1042
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:49,739
they dry out for a few hours but uh

1043
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:52,799
between that and the micronized sulfur

1044
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:55,139
you're pretty golden

1045
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,180
awesome what a nice little rundown of

1046
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:00,358
the the volumes and ingredients right

1047
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:02,879
there I noticed that neem oil was

1048
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,219
missing off the list have you decided to

1049
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,539
take a step away from neem oil

1050
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:09,480
you know

1051
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:11,519
um I'm getting the results with this mix

1052
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,800
that I just mentioned the only thing

1053
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,139
that I don't like is the you know plant

1054
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,318
therapy is a little bit expensive you

1055
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:22,440
know um I use it as a part as extra

1056
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:25,318
alcohol and extra soap really an ex

1057
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,200
extra essential oils really uh makes it

1058
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:30,599
really potent you know I spray with a

1059
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:33,179
paint sprayer you know if you spray that

1060
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,640
every day for uh

1061
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:39,299
12 days you're going to get rid of any

1062
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:42,299
problem you have and you know if you

1063
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,859
then clean the plants off for a week and

1064
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,060
then alternate with sulfur you're

1065
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:47,639
definitely not going to have any

1066
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:51,259
problems I like to do that treatment

1067
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:54,900
once a year you know switching between

1068
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,660
But You Gotta Give a week in between you

1069
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,139
know spray the plants off with the Yucca

1070
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:02,639
and aloe and coconut with the paint

1071
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:05,338
sprayer just water

1072
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:08,818
you don't want that sulfur to react with

1073
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:11,400
the oils and get a bad burn

1074
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:14,338
oh ouch yeah that would I can imagine

1075
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,039
the plants being very unhappy with that

1076
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,838
a question I commonly get asked which is

1077
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,539
a tough one to answer so I'm interested

1078
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:22,799
to hear your perspective is what should

1079
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:25,079
someone do if they're growing

1080
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,818
organically and want to adhere to you

1081
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,400
know proper organic practices so not

1082
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:33,300
using pesticides things like that what

1083
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:37,318
should they do if like in week four of

1084
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,900
flower they notice like a Mite problem

1085
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,159
I guess the question sort of revolves

1086
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,260
around

1087
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:45,118
should they spray something should they

1088
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,000
not spray something are they better

1089
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,740
options how do you go about battling a

1090
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,739
weak four flower infestation

1091
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:56,639
week four infestation is

1092
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,659
a rough one

1093
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,279
you know ideally you want to be

1094
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:04,559
inspecting your garden really thoroughly

1095
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,380
in this first few weeks and not having

1096
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,619
an infestation at week four so you would

1097
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,960
notice earlier at that stage you know

1098
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:15,599
it's uh you know your personal Med so

1099
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,720
it's going to be your personal choice I

1100
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,619
know uh plant therapy advertises that

1101
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,719
you can spray their product to the day

1102
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,400
of harvest you know I I obviously

1103
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,259
wouldn't want to do that personally but

1104
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,119
if I had um

1105
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,300
um week four I think I would probably

1106
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:35,640
attack them with the plant therapy the

1107
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,260
alcohol and the Dr Bronner soap with

1108
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,699
some essential oils

1109
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,040
um spray them

1110
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:44,279
three or four days in a row with that

1111
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,920
and um that would probably be relatively

1112
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,700
uh clean a month later

1113
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,159
yeah okay so you sort of the opinion and

1114
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:54,779
I think I agree with this that you're

1115
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,019
just sort of trying to just get through

1116
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,540
till the end of harvest as best you can

1117
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:02,639
yeah yeah for sure I think if you hit

1118
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,259
them you know you're you know four weeks

1119
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,420
in if you hit them with that mixture I

1120
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,920
told you four days in a row you you'd

1121
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,480
put a hurting on them

1122
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,818
um if you went as far as 10 days in a

1123
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,740
row you'd kill any uh spider mites or

1124
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:16,259
micro mites with that

1125
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:19,799
um the two ounces per gallon of alcohol

1126
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,000
just dries out their eggs and they're

1127
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,960
they're not going to make it through

1128
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,380
that

1129
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,780
yeah great tip there a great tip

1130
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,160
so before we got into the IPM you made

1131
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,720
the comment you know you gotta you got

1132
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,179
to stay on top of the bugs if you're

1133
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,219
gonna have the library like you do and

1134
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:37,019
so I'm wondering are there any new

1135
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:39,419
additions to the library that you're

1136
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:40,920
particularly happy or excited to have

1137
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,079
been able to pick up

1138
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,180
you know I'm still excited about that HP

1139
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:48,420
13 and that's the one I had mentioned

1140
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:51,299
last time that I had wanted the most and

1141
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:55,318
um with the way it crossed the lazy dog

1142
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,720
I'm very thankful that I was able to get

1143
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,960
reunited and um

1144
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,299
very excited to see her crossed with the

1145
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,858
[ __ ] back cross so that should be really

1146
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,599
cool too

1147
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:08,460
um you know I got so many Cuts it's

1148
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,099
really hard for me to think of them all

1149
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,780
you know I get into the uh my other room

1150
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,000
and I'm like oh look at this one this

1151
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,500

1152
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,539
one behind it I'm like oh yeah this

1153
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,239
one's [ __ ] badass you know like when

1154
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:23,460
I'm showing someone around oh this one's

1155
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:27,179
even [ __ ] better over here you know

1156
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:30,358
uh the nl2 cut that Bodhi passed me that

1157
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:32,399
he got from Jim Ortega you know to have

1158
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:35,338
something like that in the library

1159
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,579
amazing I'm really excited to see that

1160
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:42,900
clone get crossed to the puck that cross

1161
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:44,818
um Kevin Jordy just told me to come down

1162
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,700
um pick up a clone he wanted to see it

1163
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:50,219
and the puck back cross it was uh

1164
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:53,159
Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] from uh Dutch

1165
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:55,439
blooms he said that's a really killer uh

1166
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,199
Pine plant so I'm excited about that one

1167
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,800
that one's in the puck back cross too

1168
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,799
um

1169
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,940
my friend Gabe shared with me this

1170
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,039
killer

1171
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,880
NL clone

1172
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,279
um

1173
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,780
his friend has been holding on to it for

1174
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,660
20 years

1175
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,960
his friend got it uh

1176
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:18,118
in the late 90s in Humboldt County

1177
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,800
um it was an old clone at that point

1178
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,400
he got it as

1179
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:27,119
NL I first got samples of it a few years

1180
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:30,240
ago a thermal cup I showed it to AK beam

1181
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:33,838
Brands and AKA being Brands and I both

1182
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:37,019
thought it had uh the nl5 in there and

1183
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:40,019
then um I saw Kevin jordany post about

1184
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:43,259
that Olean now clone recently about a

1185
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:46,739
month ago and he thought it was in l52

1186
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,839
so it's most likely nl5 but it's

1187
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:51,419
um when he made his post he was talking

1188
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:53,400
about how we really improved cannabis in

1189
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,099
you know the last 20 or 30 years because

1190
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,579
this clone is of such high quality has

1191
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:01,440
such a amazing uh you know Crystal

1192
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:04,680
covered that's in reality we haven't

1193
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,920
really done much to improve cannabis in

1194
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:11,098
the last 20 or 30 years and I'm

1195
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,019
basically uh trying to get all these uh

1196
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,838
awesome clones I have in a seed form

1197
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,300
have the building blocks out there so

1198
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,759
some people in the future can improve

1199
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,079
cannabis I feel like these are the old

1200
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,260
building blocks are going to be

1201
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,539
essential to it at some point when we

1202
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:30,420
realize that the cookie wave is not the

1203
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:32,940
ultimate cannabis plant and um I'm just

1204
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,680
hoping I can uh you know add some Gene

1205
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,659
pools that some breeders will be able to

1206
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:38,899
take stuff to the next level with that

1207
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:42,539
would be awesome

1208
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,460
really nice answer there I mean so many

1209
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,800
Avenues to go off the first one I just

1210
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,960
want to quickly ask you that NO2 boat he

1211
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,200
gave you is that does that one have like

1212
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,900
sort of thinnish leaves this is the more

1213
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:58,439
Indica one he had two of them passed

1214
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:01,139
from Jim Ortega to him and this is the

1215
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,440
more Indica one but he knows what I like

1216
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:06,598
so okay yeah last time I was at his

1217
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,619
place I think I tried the thinner Leaf

1218
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:12,119
one

1219
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:15,300
um and he didn't like warn me it just it

1220
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,980
sat me down on my ass so hard and I was

1221
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,220
just like what the [ __ ] was that and

1222
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,858
he's like oh I see an L2 yeah it's some

1223
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:26,818
[ __ ] uh it's good weed uh I had a

1224
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:29,940
friend of mine uh Kanza got it uh lab

1225
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:31,259
tested and it has a real strong Pine

1226
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,338
lemon

1227
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:38,280
and then it's that old school

1228
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:42,358
you know pie not that serpentaline Pine

1229
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:46,800
it's that you know pine tree pine yeah

1230
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:49,078
okay I mean yeah so many places we can

1231
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,220
go from I guess just kind of building on

1232
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,380
where you said you know you want to

1233
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:54,899
build some lines that maybe people in

1234
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,519
the future can use to improve things

1235
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,800
tell us a bit about some of the more

1236
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:00,420
recent males you're working with I mean

1237
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,480
you've mentioned the lazy dog a few

1238
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:06,960
times now what sort of traits and

1239
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,579
flavors can people expect that male to

1240
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,579
bring to crosses

1241
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,579
gas

1242
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,420
um not your normal gas it's a more hash

1243
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,838
planty Northern Lights

1244
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,900
um Indica gas it's uh something I'm

1245
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:28,139
really happy with and I'm really proud

1246
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:31,858
of especially the way it uh nicked with

1247
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:34,980
the the Scentsy star Across The Brood X

1248
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,358
um you know we were uh starting to

1249
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,760
search through that

1250
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:41,098
um smoke smoke test in them and we're

1251
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,559
like holy [ __ ] we had about eight of

1252
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:46,260
them and we're like wow none of these

1253
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:50,819
are calls they're all [ __ ] amazing

1254
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:55,079
and then we open jar 13 and holy [ __ ]

1255
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:56,940
[ __ ] this weed is is loud and as potent

1256
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,980
as anything I've ever seen in my entire

1257
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,679
life and I'm like wow I think this

1258
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:04,079
thing's so good uh that you know it's

1259
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,699
gonna be easy to call some of those

1260
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,579
um we're just going to keep about four

1261
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:11,639
of them to have a second look at

1262
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:14,220
um one of them being a a garlic butt

1263
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:17,039
leaner which was uh my favorite plant

1264
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:19,618
the whole time through and uh it's kind

1265
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:22,558
of like the Scentsy star mother was a

1266
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:25,140
garlic butter leaner most of the Scentsy

1267
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,500
start Cuts lean towards the Hawaiian NL

1268
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:32,699
side and on the Scentsy star is a rare

1269
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:36,480
one and um yeah she produced mostly uh

1270
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:39,118
and a Hawaiian side and which is amazing

1271
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,818
because it it clicked really really well

1272
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,858
with the lazy dog but I popped a whole

1273
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:45,539
bunch more brood X seeds already and I'm

1274
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:48,239
looking through them you know I'm

1275
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:50,639
curious to see how rare that garlic Bud

1276
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:53,159
Fino is in there because I only saw it

1277
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,618
once in about 20 seeds

1278
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:58,440
I mean you've got me wondering now what

1279
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:01,740
was garlic Bud like was it the same kind

1280
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,079
of garlic as what we see in GMO or like

1281
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:06,358
was it just like an Indica GMO or what

1282
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,039
what are your Recollections of it

1283
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:12,960
so

1284
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:15,480
when Ben dunkers came in after you know

1285
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,780
Neville got in trouble they changed the

1286
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:21,838
name to Shiva Shantae and um it's the

1287
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:25,140
same strain and Shiva Shante it's just

1288
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:27,900
it's a like one I don't know if I talked

1289
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:30,779
about in the podcast but if one of the

1290
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,760
strains I grew in 96 was a Shiva Shantae

1291
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,260
clone my friend gave me and God damn it

1292
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,240
if I go back in time and get that

1293
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,880
[ __ ] clone it would be a game changer

1294
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,858
man this thing was you know had been

1295
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,500
around for a few years already at that

1296
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:46,558
point in 96 so you know it's probably

1297
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:49,139
you know like the original drop you know

1298
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,859
um when they changed their name but it

1299
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:55,019
was super high quality it's uh not too

1300
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:57,019
much of that family around left around

1301
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:59,579
unfortunately

1302
00:54:57,019 --> 00:55:01,619
interesting I mean do you feel like

1303
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:03,480
maybe one of the reasons why you don't

1304
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:05,880
see those strains around so much anymore

1305
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,338
is because some of those prolific older

1306
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,579
ones that you mentioned were so heavily

1307
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:14,400
adopted by the Amsterdam seen in those

1308
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:17,460
early years and all the seed companies

1309
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,019
were just putting out bad versions of

1310
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,699
those strains such that they just got

1311
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:22,559
lost or do you think they just don't

1312
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:25,159
stand up to more modern strains and they

1313
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,160
got let go

1314
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:30,659
man it's really hard keeping clones

1315
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:33,239
around for all you know years and years

1316
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:36,000
and years at a time and

1317
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:38,159
um no one can do it by themselves it

1318
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,920
takes a group of people and a lot of

1319
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:44,219
stuff that have have been lost in busts

1320
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:47,220
and stuff and you know it just it takes

1321
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:49,439
an insane amount of uh almost like

1322
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,899
crazy commitment to keep stuff alive for

1323
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,280
as long as I have it's you know I want

1324
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,740
to go [ __ ]

1325
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,300
crazy cat hoarder that just you know

1326
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:59,299
takes everything in and keeps it forever

1327
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:05,219
yeah okay well at least we know that you

1328
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,139
know any packs we get down the line will

1329
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:08,519
still be using the real mothers if they

1330
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:11,639
come from you

1331
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:14,699
another question we got asked a lot by

1332
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:18,118
the fans and I was wondering myself is

1333
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:20,279
what's new about the NL mail you've

1334
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,140
picked this time you've written that

1335
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,119
you've selected a new mail from The

1336
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:25,920
Original Seed stock have you been able

1337
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,140
to find out what the differences are

1338
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,818
between this new one compared to the

1339
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:32,460
last one you used

1340
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:35,279
now I think we uh might be confused

1341
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,019
there because I actually tried to pop

1342
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,839
about a

1343
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:41,219
40 or 50 of the nl1 seed stocks about a

1344
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,699
month ago and none of them went

1345
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:46,558
unfortunately I'm gonna go talk to kegu

1346
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:48,598
about that one here soon

1347
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,800
um hopefully he can get some of his to

1348
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:55,760
go this Lazy Dog male is you know the

1349
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,740
grandson of that original Northern one

1350
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,420
Northern Lights one male but I picked

1351
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:03,358
and used for the original Northern

1352
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:06,180
Lights crosses and um when I picked the

1353
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:10,078
NL hash plants I picked out of over just

1354
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:13,318
over 100 seeds I sprouted I picked 15

1355
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,839
females that I really liked and I kept

1356
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:18,058
them in small pots

1357
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,279
um for over a year to see if any of them

1358
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,280
would pre-flower and any of them that

1359
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:26,040
did pre-flower I called because that was

1360
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,920
the biggest problem with the nl1 male is

1361
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:31,019
he would go into pre-flower himself and

1362
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,139
I heard a lot of people say I found a

1363
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,239
keeper cut but it in veg under 18 hours

1364
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:37,739
of light it would just pre-flower and it

1365
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,419
would just you know kind of Edge like

1366
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:42,058
[ __ ] so it wasn't really worth keeping

1367
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:44,579
around at that point so I really knew if

1368
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:46,319
I was going to work that line I I needed

1369
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:50,220
to get rid of that trait then and there

1370
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:52,380
and I'm very proud of the fact that uh I

1371
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:55,379
was able to get rid of that you know

1372
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,420
um to eliminate a trait like that out of

1373
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,660
uh the gene pool

1374
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:03,539
um is something I'm really proud of um

1375
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:06,299
hopefully I can take that success and

1376
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:08,940
you know completely uh wipe out

1377
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,980
hermaphrodite traits but you know that's

1378
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,818
going to take a few generations of work

1379
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:19,318
so I ended up using three NL hash plants

1380
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:21,179
when I made those crosses and um two of

1381
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:24,599
them were hash plant leaners and one of

1382
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:27,179
them one is a nl1 leaner The Lazy Dog

1383
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,400
male I picked I kept him around for a

1384
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:31,558
year before I used them to tortured them

1385
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,500
in a small pot never showed signs of

1386
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,900
pre-flower he's almost identical and

1387
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,239
structure and when I look back in

1388
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:42,358
pictures of the nl1

1389
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:45,899
to him he's they're almost identical he

1390
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:48,779
just doesn't pre-flower so I'm really

1391
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,900
you know pleased with that and pleased

1392
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:54,240
with him and um you know like I said you

1393
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:57,358
know I kind of see uh you know like The

1394
00:58:54,239 --> 00:59:00,539
Brood X is like the really good NL from

1395
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:03,239
the 90s the Disco crossed the NL hash

1396
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:05,880
plant by the headband was also a very

1397
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:08,039
similar to the good Northern Lights from

1398
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,579
the 90s you know the pedigree is not 100

1399
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:13,619
pure but it's the same type of plant so

1400
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:16,380
I feel like that's more important than

1401
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:18,838
just having a pure NL gene pool it's

1402
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,539
more the type of plant that you're

1403
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:23,880
getting in seed form and producing

1404
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:26,460
yeah what a great answer and you're 100

1405
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,780
correct I made a mistake there but you

1406
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,099
answered another question which was

1407
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,559
basically I was going to ask about the

1408
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:34,920
NL so you just did it but the question I

1409
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:38,040
was meant to ask you is the new M10 male

1410
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,380
not NL derp sorry

1411
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,019
um yeah you pop some seeds recently and

1412
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,940
you've got a new M10 male can you give

1413
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:47,699
us the rundown on him

1414
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:49,858
okay so that M10

1415
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:53,639
um it was an open pollination

1416
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:56,699
there was 30 to 50 males used the only

1417
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:58,679
thing I called from the line was a few

1418
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:00,358
true hermaphrodites

1419
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:03,539
um I got those out of the gene pools so

1420
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:06,298
it wasn't a a pure open pollination

1421
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:08,219
just was uh main goal was preserving the

1422
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:10,980
M10 line and

1423
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:14,098
um just like original without crosses uh

1424
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,079
I this is the second open pollination it

1425
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:20,099
was five years later so I like to get to

1426
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,680
see it's every uh five years or so

1427
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:26,760
um those nl1 seats that didn't pop those

1428
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:30,058
were uh 10 years old so you know I swear

1429
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,380
I haven't tried to really lose a lot of

1430
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,440
vigor

1431
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:36,480
and um from the first open pollination

1432
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,838
and Crosses I had done with the antenna

1433
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,699
I had a idea of what it can produce and

1434
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,980
I threw a lot of clones in this time

1435
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:46,858
that I thought would uh Nick really well

1436
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,760
and we're really happy with the results

1437
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:51,358
um

1438
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,059
them tenant by itself is um

1439
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,739
a sweeter

1440
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:58,440
Afghani I feel like uh from my

1441
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:01,078
experience with Afghani lines there's

1442
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,880
either there's two forms there's the

1443
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,839
acrid

1444
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:10,559
um earthy skunky

1445
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:14,099
afghanis and then there's this sweet

1446
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:18,839
um Berry purple

1447
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:21,119
um grape afghanis and um Ben 10 leans

1448
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:23,818
more towards the sweet side

1449
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,798
so you know I thought that would click

1450
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:29,159
well and um with some of these other

1451
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:31,440
afghanists and it it did I'm really

1452
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:33,960
happy with the way the uh Grand Daddy

1453
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,400
turned out and the bubblegan

1454
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,039
um there's some really really cool

1455
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,720
Keepers to be found in that you know you

1456
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:42,480
don't see afghanis like that much

1457
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:45,000
anymore in seed form I'm really proud to

1458
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,559
be burning those uh to the market you

1459
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,719
know if I was a seed buyer that's the

1460
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,540
type of [ __ ] I would be scooping up you

1461
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:54,779
know and really cool weed tastes great

1462
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:58,199
super relaxing there's some real

1463
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:00,780
winnings to be found in the bubble Ganon

1464
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:03,719
and again Daddy both you know and you

1465
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:06,000
know there's uh some really cool stuff

1466
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:09,659
for people to work lines from there's

1467
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,639
going to be uh I would predict a lot of

1468
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:14,159
uh breeders like millifying cool [ __ ] to

1469
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:15,960
work off you know all the different M10

1470
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,058
crosses I did

1471
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,059
um it's great places to start breeding

1472
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:23,640
projects and work away from

1473
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:26,880
in different directions

1474
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:28,798
yeah wow what a great answer I mean I

1475
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,559
love that you referenced again Daddy

1476
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,818
because there was a few things I noticed

1477
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,079
about it first of all as you mentioned

1478
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:36,119
it's got a nice little crew of

1479
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,160
supporters on social media and with all

1480
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,318
the you know really nice photos you've

1481
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,779
been posting of it just beautiful it's

1482
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,639
not hard to understand why but one of

1483
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,260
the big things that stood out to me was

1484
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,900
that first of all it's the first

1485
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,240
granddaddy purple cross in quite a while

1486
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,639
that's got a bit of momentum behind it

1487
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:55,078
and then the other thing it made me

1488
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:57,118
wonder about is why do you think the

1489
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:59,339
Granddaddy Purple gets overlooked so

1490
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,400
often I often hear people talk about it

1491
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:04,139
like it's a crap version of Urkel

1492
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,160
whereas I always just thought it was

1493
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:07,440
sort of different

1494
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:09,480
what are your thoughts about granddaddy

1495
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,639
purple and do you plan to work the Grand

1496
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,740
Daddy lion forward at all or do you

1497
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:16,019
think it's just nice as an F1

1498
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:19,199
so there's quite a few questions there

1499
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:21,900
so I believe the granddaddy is a miracle

1500
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:25,199
cross from Chris rest in peace I'd

1501
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,760
always heard uh it was Salmon Creek big

1502
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,558
bud by Urkel

1503
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,420
um when I'm seeing these Oracle crosses

1504
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,180
especially by the M10 I'm seeing nothing

1505
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,280
but broadleaf Afghani in there that's

1506
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:37,980
what the plants are telling me I've

1507
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,660
always really really loved the

1508
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,579
Granddaddy Purple

1509
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:42,779
um I I like it more than the Urkel the

1510
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,099
Urkel might be a little bit more

1511
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,819
flavorful

1512
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:47,460
um

1513
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:49,798
the Granddaddy's got more potency in my

1514
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:53,579
opinion you know when I'm cracking open

1515
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:56,400
these uh granddaddy jars and sampling

1516
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:59,940
them to look for Keepers it just brings

1517
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,599
me back to 2002. you know it's like it's

1518
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:05,639
the early 2000s when Humboldt you had to

1519
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,480
have purple or you couldn't sell your

1520
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:11,159
bags that craze hit you know these are

1521
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,019
the type of weed that would have done

1522
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:14,159
really well in that market in that time

1523
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:17,400
place

1524
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:19,618
um it's a throwback like I said there's

1525
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,559
going to be really cool building blocks

1526
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:24,780
to be found in there for breeders

1527
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,540
um I think cookies definitely goes back

1528
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,660
to Urkel if not granddaddy you know look

1529
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:33,239
what dungeon Paul has done with the all

1530
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:36,239
that work they did off of Ken's cut with

1531
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:38,879
uh Ken back in the day it's a really

1532
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,679
cool gene pool especially when you uh

1533
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,700
were to take something like that and add

1534
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:46,318
it with the OG's or cookies or something

1535
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:50,118
there's going to be some really cool

1536
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,119
stuff that's going to come out of there

1537
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,780
yeah that's that's an awesome answer and

1538
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:59,699
and I too like granddaddy a lot I think

1539
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,339
it um caused a bit of a bad rep

1540
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:04,500
sometimes not sure why we're talking

1541
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:08,279
about the M10 though I wanted to quickly

1542
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:10,318
ask you I had heard some rumors that UFO

1543
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,798
which was an old release from Coastal

1544
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:16,798
seeds Romulan by no was in fact the line

1545
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,318
that alien genetics used to find a male

1546
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,780
that they called Peach had you heard

1547
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:24,798
this and did the UFO line give Peach

1548
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:26,400
phenotypes that you're aware of

1549
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,460
so

1550
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,818
um the nl1 mail definitely threw Peach

1551
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:34,858
he threw that with the nl5 female

1552
01:05:32,818 --> 01:05:37,739
hybridum two he brought through that to

1553
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:39,838
with quite a few different females I've

1554
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:42,239
definitely heard that story you know

1555
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,099
it's awesome when people use my gear

1556
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:48,139
it's especially awesome when they don't

1557
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:48,140
change the name and give me credit

1558
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:53,460
there you go diplomatic I love it so

1559
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,140
when you hear something like that where

1560
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,699
someone's doing really well with one of

1561
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:58,379
those lines does it ever make you think

1562
01:05:56,699 --> 01:06:00,419
oh maybe I should dig through that line

1563
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,338
a bit more there's like obviously really

1564
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,338
good stuff in there

1565
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:07,500
like I said earlier

1566
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:09,000
one of my main goals is not to be the

1567
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,539
best reader

1568
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,760
um one of my main goals is to provide uh

1569
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:18,000
really good chain pulls for the best

1570
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:21,960
breeders and with every breeding I do

1571
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,880
that's uh a large

1572
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,240
um

1573
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:29,460
factor in my head is

1574
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:33,239
what the females we choose because we

1575
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:35,940
have a ridiculous amount of females and

1576
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,399
you can see uh when I

1577
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:40,858
do my breathings I don't just throw them

1578
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,260
all in there I throw certain types that

1579
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:46,259
we're hoping to get certain results and

1580
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:50,220
you know one of my main results is

1581
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:53,339
potency and um to be able to retain that

1582
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:55,980
potency and Seed form so that makes

1583
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:58,858
really good breeding stock I like to

1584
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:01,318
breed as pure as possible if it's not

1585
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:03,779
already in the strain that's being

1586
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:07,558
crossed too it's the same type generally

1587
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:10,740
so it's uh reading for certain types uh

1588
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:14,220
families and just to help preserve those

1589
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:17,159
qualities and Gene pools rather than

1590
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:21,239
making crosses like you know I did with

1591
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:25,078
the M10 Malawi gold and M10 Ethiopian

1592
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:28,500
banana and uh Ethiopian Panama Red I am

1593
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:31,740
10. the goal in those breedances to open

1594
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,838
everything up and get craziness but

1595
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:36,000
most of the time when I'm breeding like

1596
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:39,179
them 10 to the black dominant orthos

1597
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,818
afghanis because there are similar types

1598
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:45,058
and I feel like they'll neck well and

1599
01:07:41,818 --> 01:07:47,338
preserve their qualities I wish I had

1600
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:49,380
100 different facilities and I was just

1601
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:52,139
driving around to them all day long and

1602
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:54,660
doing different breeding projects I have

1603
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:56,759
so much work that I want to do in my

1604
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:58,618
head I'll never be able to accomplish it

1605
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,140
in my lifetime

1606
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:02,760
you know I don't I don't cross it

1607
01:08:01,139 --> 01:08:04,139
together if I don't think it's going to

1608
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,319
provide

1609
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:09,659
something cool to work off of

1610
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:13,440
you know and

1611
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:14,818
so I have so much [ __ ] oh you know I'll

1612
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,399
never be able to get back to it

1613
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:19,560
especially with uh me trying to preserve

1614
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:21,599
land race and um

1615
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,520
like I said I want to you know do an

1616
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,560
open polish and I like to get back to it

1617
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,560
every five years so

1618
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:32,100
it's difficult aside uh what projects

1619
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,859
are most important and um which ones I'm

1620
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:38,338
gonna get to next because I got like 10

1621
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:41,039
of them in my head at least and

1622
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:43,679
so much old work that you there's just

1623
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:46,679
amazing [ __ ] that you know can be worked

1624
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,500
out of them it's just hard to leave them

1625
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:52,798
there and never go back to them

1626
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,899
yeah good answer good answer

1627
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,359
I mean you just sort of referenced it

1628
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:59,579
yourself would you ever consider wanting

1629
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,400
to work with bigger facilities or

1630
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:04,559
organizations in order to be able to you

1631
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,838
know do more projects or do you like the

1632
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,819
sort of In-House mum and pop feel of the

1633
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:11,939
way you do things

1634
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:14,819
I love the in-house mom and pop feel of

1635
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:17,698
the way uh Hannibal and I do things

1636
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:20,460
um she's the end my yang and um she's

1637
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:23,219
sees something that I don't see and she

1638
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,079
sees things differently and

1639
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:28,020
um her commitment to keep these clones

1640
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:31,019
is at times you know it's the reason the

1641
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:34,980
collection's still here so I love that

1642
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:38,160
aspect of it just uh working with us but

1643
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:40,619
um you know I would really love to see

1644
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:42,719
huge selections and

1645
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:45,198
um I can't do that by myself you know

1646
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:48,960
especially if I'm gonna work different

1647
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:51,419
projects you know teaming up would be

1648
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,219
able to to get more stuff done and more

1649
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:55,020
stuff out to the people which would be

1650
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:58,079
really cool

1651
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:00,840
um but it's it's a tough one and I most

1652
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:04,260
likely you know I always say no to

1653
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,579
offers but the right one came along I

1654
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:08,520
might

1655
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:10,019
consider it because you know you really

1656
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,780
want to be looking through hundreds of

1657
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:15,660
plants at a time and for a mom and a pop

1658
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:19,439
to do that it's almost impossible you

1659
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:22,380
know um we have 15 to 20 females off all

1660
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:24,719
the different types we just tested and

1661
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,579
you know I got a few friends helping but

1662
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,640
you know it's up to

1663
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:31,079
Anna and I had a smoke testimon

1664
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,900
um because we got to know what's going

1665
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:36,059
on there and um it's a difficult job man

1666
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:38,698
even you know you know I'm a tough

1667
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,500
[ __ ] smoker too I wake up I [ __ ]

1668
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:43,259
go for the bar before I go for the

1669
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:46,679
toothbrush though even with as hard as I

1670
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:49,560
smoke it's uh it's tough to test that

1671
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,658
much uh weed and you know

1672
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:55,260
um that keep that many clones alive when

1673
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:57,899
we funeral hunt it's it's it's really it

1674
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:59,520
it puts us to the limits you know

1675
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:03,599
especially with the

1676
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:05,880
all the responsibilities we have so

1677
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,760
yeah it would it would be no minor

1678
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,340
undertaking that's for sure

1679
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:13,340
so here's here's the hypothetical okay

1680
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,440
cookies comes to you and they're like

1681
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:18,960
Bob we've got these huge facilities for

1682
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:20,339
you can you can do you can have a little

1683
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,658
bit of Freedom we're going to be running

1684
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:28,079
like cookies cross M10 stuff like that

1685
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:32,158
do you do it can you change the image

1686
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:33,840
no I can't and um honestly you know I I

1687
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:35,939
definitely if it's not my way it's

1688
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,460
definitely the highway type of thing you

1689
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:40,559
know I'm like I said I have years and

1690
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,480
years work and

1691
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,580
um the amount of different directions I

1692
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,559
can take you know and the amount of

1693
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:48,779
sativa work I could get into and do

1694
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,940
would just be years worth of work in

1695
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:53,519
with me you know saying that problem

1696
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:55,859
about having a smoke test I'm Gonna Keep

1697
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,840
with the afghanis uh just for that

1698
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:00,000
reason because that's uh what I want to

1699
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,640
smoke but um for I wish I could get into

1700
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,100
playing with the sativas more just for

1701
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,960
the preservation aspect because I have

1702
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,840
some really good sativas

1703
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,579
to my Arsenal but

1704
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,100
it's interesting you bring that up

1705
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:16,738
because I know that there's some really

1706
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:19,199
nice ones in there I actually wanted to

1707
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:21,419
ask you because I've given some of these

1708
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:24,119
seeds to some friends of mine who are

1709
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:27,658
going to grow them out you gave me a

1710
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:29,519
cross called The Shire cross Haze and I

1711
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:31,799
remember you telling me about the Shire

1712
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,380
and then I kind of forgot the story I

1713
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,239
just remember like New York guys long

1714
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,159
flowering or something

1715
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,559
um have you ever been able to grow out

1716
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:43,379
those seeds and what was the story

1717
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,020
around the Shire again

1718
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:49,739
I haven't grown those seeds out

1719
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:52,320
um the male was the A5 Haze Thai bread

1720
01:12:49,738 --> 01:12:55,919
by Karma that Bodhi selected that was

1721
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:57,299
the father of the band Haze that was the

1722
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,800
mail I used

1723
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,579
um for that

1724
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:04,140
um

1725
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:06,000
Shire is super silver Sour Diesel

1726
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,239
by uh

1727
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,960
the rat res dog

1728
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:11,639
um

1729
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,119
selected

1730
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:17,820
in Upstate New York and highly coveted

1731
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:21,599
up there that's all they want to smoke

1732
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:23,460
um she goes 100 days 120 days really

1733
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,719
really high quality

1734
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:31,500
smoke I thought it would pair well

1735
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:35,039
with A5 Haze tie on

1736
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:37,260
just gave that one away often to anyone

1737
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:39,539
that's into sativists that's around I'll

1738
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:41,340
pass that one out and um had a friend

1739
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:43,198
grow it in Jamaica and he said it was

1740
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:46,640
really good but besides that I don't

1741
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:49,979
think anyone's finished it and that male

1742
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,600
produces gold so that female with being

1743
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:53,879
such high quality there's going to be

1744
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,340
some amazing stuff in there hopefully

1745
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,199
your friends find it

1746
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:00,239
wow that's cool maybe might even bring

1747
01:13:58,198 --> 01:14:03,779
the flower time down a little bit

1748
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:06,359
yeah that male is uh surprisingly fast

1749
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:07,920
um I've seen him I've crossed into a lot

1750
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:10,439
of things that I've seen out the results

1751
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,658
from a lot of the others and that that

1752
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:15,238
male produces gold

1753
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:17,698
interesting well I mean if we just loop

1754
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:19,919
back to the the silly cookies question I

1755
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:21,899
gave you a moment ago partly where I

1756
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,239
brought it up is because I really like

1757
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:27,599
the offering you guys have done with

1758
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:31,439
pastry chef I love the name cool name

1759
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:34,020
um being biscotti across the M10 what

1760
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:36,479
does the biscotti bring to the table in

1761
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,940
your mind compared to say just another

1762
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:41,639
cookie cut do you think it's sort of

1763
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:43,619
your preferred one or is it just one

1764
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,060
that you're you know willing to put up

1765
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:46,859
with because it's slightly better than

1766
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:50,940
the others

1767
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:53,039
so I keep Cuts Like That around to past

1768
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:55,379
uh friends of mine I just give them to

1769
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:57,960
them for free so they can pay their

1770
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:01,020
bills production Cuts that's how we did

1771
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,880
it in the 90s we didn't sell Cuts we

1772
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,280
gave them to friends that were good

1773
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,079
friends that would do stuff for you if

1774
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:08,880
you were you know you needed someone to

1775
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:10,559
have your back that's the type of person

1776
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,359
would have your back so you you give

1777
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,820
them you pass those cones to those

1778
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:16,979
people so you know they can have a

1779
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:18,960
better life you know and um that's how

1780
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,698
we did it back then and that's the

1781
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,140
reason I got that one around that's the

1782
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:24,119
reason I got the London pound cake

1783
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,440
around and

1784
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,300
um that's the reason I have the sunset

1785
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,819
sherbet around I still give them to good

1786
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:32,159
friends and I got friends cropping them

1787
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:34,799
and they're extremely high quality

1788
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:38,099
they're uh what the market on the west

1789
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,739
coast wants right now from

1790
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:44,039
their breedings the cookie fan those are

1791
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:46,319
some of my favorite ones some of uh

1792
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:49,198
really high quality you know Sunset

1793
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:51,539
sherbet's super high quality uh

1794
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:54,899
the lemon pound cake is super high

1795
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:57,000
quality and biscotti super high quality

1796
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:59,460
um it's not what I want to smoke it's

1797
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,100
not the high I really like but you

1798
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:04,260
really can't deny the quality you know I

1799
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:06,780
wouldn't cross them to the lazy dog or

1800
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:09,960
you know any of my other worked lines

1801
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:12,719
but when it comes to a land race Afghani

1802
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,939
line that uh can add some really cool

1803
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,439
sweet terpenes I thought it would be

1804
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:20,158
very interesting and I thought it would

1805
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:21,960
teach me a lot so and uh that's the

1806
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:24,359
reason we did it we grew out some of the

1807
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,480
the sky across ourselves

1808
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:30,420
super high quality

1809
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:33,059
we found one that tastes like pineapple

1810
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:36,420
pie it's [ __ ] crazy I've never even

1811
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:39,060
had pineapple pie and this this this one

1812
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,760
tastes just like [ __ ] pineapple pie

1813
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:44,940
um really sweet not like the pineapple

1814
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:48,600
you would get in a sativa it's a really

1815
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:50,879
unique Indica pastry pineapple another

1816
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,239
interesting note on the M10 biscotti

1817
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,640
crosses is they all went 10 weeks the

1818
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:59,639
M10 didn't shorten the flower time down

1819
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,039
one bit whereas um I grew the Malawi

1820
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,420
gold M10 and the Malawi gold will go 100

1821
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:05,779
days

1822
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,239
um those females were ready between

1823
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:10,619
eight and ten weeks

1824
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:13,198
dramatically shorten the flower time on

1825
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:15,059
them but didn't shorten the flowering

1826
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:17,719
time down on the lemon pound cake or

1827
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:20,100
Sunset Sherbert either

1828
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:22,739
wow interesting I guess there's just

1829
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:24,300
something about the way those two sort

1830
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:27,419
of click together

1831
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:29,400
in a similar sort of note I also wanted

1832
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,960
to ask you about the dinosaur cookies

1833
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:32,879
because that was another strain that had

1834
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,819
gotten a nice little bit of a tension

1835
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:38,039
behind it in some recent drops how did

1836
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:39,658
that one turn out in your opinion and I

1837
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:42,300
guess more broadly speaking do you have

1838
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:44,779
any plans to do any new crosses with the

1839
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:46,440
TK M10 male

1840
01:17:44,779 --> 01:17:49,259
so

1841
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:51,779
um the dinosaur cookies uh you know I

1842
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:55,199
was using the tkm10 mail and I

1843
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:56,698
you know wanted to learn you you were

1844
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,279
you came by and you saw all those

1845
01:17:56,698 --> 01:18:03,779
samples and you were like holy [ __ ] this

1846
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:05,759
is uh the most cookie uh f1s I've ever

1847
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:07,079
seen you know like the cookie Pinos are

1848
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,340
popping out you I think you got to look

1849
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:13,619
through like

1850
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:15,179
15 or 17 jars and with uh you know you

1851
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:18,059
urging me on as one of the main reasons

1852
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:21,060
uh we released that one

1853
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:24,000
um it was super super high quality

1854
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,800
but you know it's not any direction that

1855
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:31,380
I'm gonna be working

1856
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:34,560
um we did cross that TK M10 to the 92 OG

1857
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:37,500
and I will be working that line further

1858
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,260
those are some really really nice OG

1859
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,100
phenotypes in seed form right there and

1860
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,020
um

1861
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:45,900
when I get the time I'm going to work

1862
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:48,540
that even further into

1863
01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:51,420
the OG Direction

1864
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:53,880
um more of the earthy

1865
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,279
um side of the family is my perfect

1866
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:59,659
preferred side the you know like the

1867
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:02,880
headband or the TK

1868
01:18:59,658 --> 01:19:04,079
wow interesting stuff that's cool to

1869
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,199
hear that you're going to work that one

1870
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:10,800
forward a few episodes back we actually

1871
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:12,539
had green body on and he spoke about a

1872
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,400
particular Purple Kush cutting he got

1873
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:16,920
from you and he's just in love with it

1874
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,319
he said it's the best thing ever and

1875
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:21,539
many of the listeners on patreon were

1876
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,099
very interested in about hearing a

1877
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:25,340
little bit more about this purple kush

1878
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:28,679
if you could sort of describe it to us

1879
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:30,659
and where does it come from I think we

1880
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:33,960
always hear people say oh you know it

1881
01:19:30,658 --> 01:19:36,420
came from somewhere in Oregon but do you

1882
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:39,658
know any more about it than that

1883
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:41,760
so the the common purple Hindu Kush cut

1884
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:44,759
that you're thinking about from Oregon

1885
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,619
is the the Jaeger cut and this is a

1886
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,320
different cut than that

1887
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:55,140
um this one's

1888
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:55,738
grapey Citrus nag Champa just Funk and

1889
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,520
um

1890
01:19:55,738 --> 01:20:02,519
it's the one that I bred to the

1891
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:04,739
kabulkush and then I uh took a mail off

1892
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:08,520
of that and I brought it to the Urkel

1893
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:11,339
and um that's our release uh light of

1894
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:14,280
Venus Urkel by purple Hindu Kush Kabul

1895
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:19,380
Kush I also crossed that purple Hindu

1896
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:22,920
Kush to the M10 and um Labyrinth uh

1897
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:25,020
tested those out for us and um they're

1898
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,060
gonna scoop all those up those are gonna

1899
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,679
be killer so

1900
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,840
um I'm definitely gonna grow some of

1901
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:33,840
those out myself when I get to it

1902
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,640
um we only made like 100 packs to them

1903
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,159
so I think uh since they helped test

1904
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:42,000
them they're gonna scoop them all up but

1905
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:44,399
um I have worked that line quite a bit I

1906
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,119
have the purple-handed Kush back cross

1907
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:50,279
I'm gonna be picking a male out of the

1908
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,819
purple Hindu Kush back cross taking it

1909
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:56,819
to F2 and at this that time I'll also

1910
01:20:53,819 --> 01:21:00,139
cross it to all my uh purple Afghani

1911
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:03,599
clones that I like uh like the Urkel

1912
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,980
Granddaddy Purple Afghani stuff like

1913
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,100
that

1914
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:10,439
can people expect you to be restocking

1915
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:12,840
any of these lines I know historically

1916
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:15,000
you've you've moved forward quite fast

1917
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,340
if someone misses out on a pack of light

1918
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,679
of Venus will there be a chance to grab

1919
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,079
more or only the real powerhouses will

1920
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:26,158
get restocked

1921
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:28,559
the line of Venus was a stepping stone

1922
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,599
you know so you're going to want to grab

1923
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,199
that um it's been going incredibly fast

1924
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:37,560
but we do have more drops coming

1925
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:39,839
with all the seed banks we uh stock with

1926
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:42,120
hopefully everyone will get a chance to

1927
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,219
get some we have an amazing keeper out

1928
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:47,579
of that uh

1929
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:50,039
she's just tastes so amazing and has

1930
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:52,619
such a nice relaxing High

1931
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:54,658
so one of our good friends we gave

1932
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:56,819
sample to and she was like holy [ __ ]

1933
01:21:54,658 --> 01:21:59,399
name this after me it's my favorite weed

1934
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:01,619
I've ever smoked and um of course

1935
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:05,219
another Seed Company already has a

1936
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:06,960
strain named at with her name and um you

1937
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:09,300
know it took us a few months to come up

1938
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,300
with another name but Darcy came up with

1939
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,820
the light of Venus and that's uh from a

1940
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,940
lion and Terror Penance right before uh

1941
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:21,420
crickets and cicada sing

1942
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:23,879
ah nice so that won't get restocked but

1943
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,920
we will be working with the purple Hindu

1944
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,739
Kush back cross which will bring more

1945
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,679
purple Hindu Kush to the table in The

1946
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:33,539
Offspring and it will be crossed back to

1947
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,119
the Oracle so it'll be very similar

1948
01:22:33,539 --> 01:22:39,238
it'll just have more purple Hindu Kush

1949
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,039
the overkill won't get restocked

1950
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:42,658
um Overkill is one I'm really really

1951
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:46,140
proud of too

1952
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:49,559
um that was a stepping stone across you

1953
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:52,320
know I used this I use three males they

1954
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,360
were and L1 across the Pacific Northwest

1955
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:56,639
hash plant and then I crossed that to

1956
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:59,039
the puck three males out of that for the

1957
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:01,500
back cross to the puck and I cross that

1958
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:04,800
to the black domino and

1959
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:07,800
um release that and that won't get

1960
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:11,460
restocked if you're an Afghani level or

1961
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:14,100
especially if you love the um Gene pools

1962
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,840
that Neville put together

1963
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:19,140
um especially if you're into the acrid

1964
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,760
earthy type musty basement

1965
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:23,460
um with a little bit of lemon type thing

1966
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,219
you want to scoop that one up it's it's

1967
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:29,520
killer um you look at a three generation

1968
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:32,039
pedigree you know on that thing in the

1969
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,280
top side you get the puck Pacific

1970
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:38,779
Northwest hash plant and nl1 from my

1971
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:42,500
side and then the black domino you get

1972
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:45,238
Afghani number one M10 Northern Lights

1973
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:47,039
Ortega and hash plant the Pacific

1974
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:49,559
Northwest hash plant

1975
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:53,100
um through Neville and there's some

1976
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:54,239
serious serious killer stuff in there

1977
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:57,659
um

1978
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:58,859
we look through like 15 seats and they

1979
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,779
were so good we popped a whole bunch

1980
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:01,920
more already and you know they're going

1981
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:03,658
to be sold out we're just looking

1982
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,579
through them for ourselves and for for

1983
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:08,759
future braiding stock

1984
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:11,158
um it's just another one that really

1985
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:13,679
clicked well and we're really proud of

1986
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:16,139
and you know it makes me really excited

1987
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,840
about the puck back cross because it's

1988
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:21,420
the same males that were used

1989
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:23,640
yeah nice what a comprehensive rundown

1990
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:26,760
I'm I want to ask you about the overkill

1991
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,840
and the kill in a bit but before we do I

1992
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,000
just want to quickly bring it up because

1993
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,440
I forgot to mention one of our listeners

1994
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,920
had asked if

1995
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:37,319
you saw any relationship between your

1996
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,760
special purple Hindu Kush and Jaeger

1997
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:41,158
because apparently they had heard a

1998
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,380
story that that was one of the parents

1999
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:44,939
of Jaeger

2000
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:48,840
so

2001
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:52,799
um I don't know anything about that

2002
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:55,199
um I got no knowledge on that I do

2003
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,420
the story on the purple Hindu Kush I

2004
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,879
heard it was uh

2005
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:03,239
an old woman used to defend it in the

2006
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,800
215 days out in Shasta it's just

2007
01:25:03,238 --> 01:25:06,839
Landry's

2008
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,719
Hindu Kush

2009
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,619
um it's not Hindu Kush crossed by purple

2010
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:13,260
um

2011
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:14,939
when I back crossed it I I've already

2012
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,880
grown out a bunch of the bad crossed

2013
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:20,099
females they're nothing in there but uh

2014
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,500
Afghani

2015
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:24,780
um so the story I heard the plants

2016
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:27,179
telling me the exact same thing there's

2017
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:28,259
some really really cool things that

2018
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:30,840
comes out

2019
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:33,539
of that plant lion tree grew some of the

2020
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,900
back cross out this year full season it

2021
01:25:33,539 --> 01:25:39,719
came out amazing one of them had this

2022
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:43,979
candied grape smell and then behind it

2023
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:46,439
it had this funky Oriental noodle smell

2024
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:48,658
that's the first time I had noticed that

2025
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:50,579
and I grew some of the purple-handed

2026
01:25:48,658 --> 01:25:52,979
Kush back crossout and we found some

2027
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:55,500
really cool candy grape ones

2028
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:58,738
um found one that when you open the jar

2029
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:00,960
the jar stinks like peanuts uh you can

2030
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:03,718
get that peanut butter smell from race

2031
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,279
Afghani sometimes when you

2032
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:08,520
smoke it

2033
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:11,460
you only taste candy delicious great

2034
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:14,580
jelly and you know I call that one the

2035
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:16,619
peanut butter and jelly cut and um I

2036
01:26:14,579 --> 01:26:19,260
have it in in Cut form I haven't gotten

2037
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:22,979
a chance to flour that one out again to

2038
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:24,900
see how if those qualities are still

2039
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:27,419
there in Clone form because sometimes

2040
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:28,799
seeds are better than clones for some

2041
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,539
strange reason

2042
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,340
um but I'm excited to get a second look

2043
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:35,340
at that one again

2044
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:36,719
yeah nice another question I should have

2045
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,880
asked you a little bit earlier on when

2046
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,460
we were talking about older strains and

2047
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,400
restocking them will you ever consider

2048
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,619
remaking any of those Coastal strains

2049
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,939
that you made in the past like

2050
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:49,619
specifically one of our listeners wanted

2051
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:52,198
to know about the Puna butter I know

2052
01:26:49,619 --> 01:26:54,359
that wasn't exactly your project but um

2053
01:26:52,198 --> 01:26:56,638
is there any chance of any of those

2054
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:57,719
strains being redone or like filial

2055
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,719
bread

2056
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:03,239
I will never redo any of the ones that

2057
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:07,079
bamboo or KQ did uh the peanut butter

2058
01:27:03,238 --> 01:27:10,198
crosses was uh bamboo it's work

2059
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:13,139
um I tried to reduce some of the nl1

2060
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:15,119
like I said I I tried to pop up a bunch

2061
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:17,579
of seeds and none of them popped I still

2062
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,679
have some more I'm gonna you know uh try

2063
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:21,359
a few different methods I'm gonna talk

2064
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:24,960
to kagyu about it

2065
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:26,698
I would uh really like to visit nl1

2066
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,020
crosses again

2067
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:31,019
um there's a few

2068
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:34,560
things I would like to add in there to

2069
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:36,239
see uh some cool uh results I have a

2070
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,580
bunch of other different really cool

2071
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:39,718
Northern Lights Cuts now that I'd like

2072
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:42,300
to um

2073
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:45,119
add to that breeding

2074
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:47,460
um but um you know like I said there was

2075
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:49,559
that pre-flower problem where the males

2076
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:52,800
that I tried to keep alive from that

2077
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:54,239
I've had that problem with other lines I

2078
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,480
had that problem with the British

2079
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,399
Columbia seed club uh release the body

2080
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:01,559
released a couple of those males with

2081
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:03,539
pre-flower so

2082
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,639
um maybe it was meant to be that those

2083
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:08,399
seeds didn't pop I might be able to get

2084
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:11,639
back in and rework that line

2085
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:14,939
um unfortunately classic seeds does not

2086
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:18,539
want that line released pure so it's

2087
01:28:14,939 --> 01:28:20,059
kind of a shame but if it goes you know

2088
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:22,800
it

2089
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:26,159
goes with the kg one

2090
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,900
and classic so there we go the real

2091
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:30,179
holders to that line without them I

2092
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:32,279
wouldn't have had access to it

2093
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:35,039
and I really appreciate

2094
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:36,899
the access to it and

2095
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,519
um everything cake you

2096
01:28:36,899 --> 01:28:39,779
taught me

2097
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:43,500
um about

2098
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:47,158
open pollinations and preservation and

2099
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:49,880
Gene pools and Bam is really really

2100
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:53,339
smart you know he taught me a lot about

2101
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:56,340
bottlenecking and the genetic aspects of

2102
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:58,800
it so it was a shame that you know

2103
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:02,520
Coastal had to go our separate ways but

2104
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,920
uh I'm still focusing on doing the same

2105
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,860
thing I was doing there and getting

2106
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:11,399
these uh classic indicas in the seed

2107
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:15,119
form and recreate what I remember in the

2108
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:17,460
90s uh as good NL crosses good NL hash

2109
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:18,359
plant crosses and stuff like that has

2110
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,980
been

2111
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:23,639
lost

2112
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:26,339
yeah admirable go admirable Go I mean

2113
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:29,520
just to quickly clarify out of those

2114
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:31,860
prior no one crosses you did which one

2115
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,260
was your personal favorite I see there's

2116
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:35,158
still a huge amount of demand for Park

2117
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:38,820
yeah

2118
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:41,819
[ __ ] yes [ __ ] man that one's killer I

2119
01:29:38,819 --> 01:29:44,039
have 10 to 15 maybe 20 packs of those

2120
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:45,599
I'm just sitting on and I'm like I said

2121
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:48,300
I have so much

2122
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:51,360
work I've done over the years and

2123
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:53,820
so many directions I could go man I just

2124
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,920
I need different spots you know because

2125
01:29:53,819 --> 01:29:58,259
you can't just contaminate pollen in

2126
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,239
because it's just all useless then so I

2127
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:03,060
can only do it one project at a time and

2128
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:06,000
it it's a lot of time and

2129
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:06,900
hard work to actually test stuff out you

2130
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,939
know

2131
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:11,158
um that's where uh

2132
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:12,899
all the learning comes from you know I

2133
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:16,439
don't know how these breeders do it they

2134
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:18,599
uh just sell untested seeds man uh

2135
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:21,839
growing it out is the funnest part in

2136
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:24,539
learning from the crosses is the most

2137
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,639
rewarding part so if anyone out there is

2138
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:29,219
uh wanting to know how to become a good

2139
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,960
breeder you need to grow you need to

2140
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:33,260
grow your crosses and you need to grow

2141
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,939
as many different types of plants as

2142
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:37,320
possible you need to know which you like

2143
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:41,039
and you need to know what you're looking

2144
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:44,219
for growing your crosses out and as

2145
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,380
large a quantities as uh you can it's

2146
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:49,079
going to teach you what's there and what

2147
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:50,100
you have and I will teach you about the

2148
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:53,760
gene pool

2149
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:55,800
yeah some wise words there on the topic

2150
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,420
of a slightly different NL I noticed

2151
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,600
that in the pterodactyl cross you

2152
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:02,819
release it's nl2 by five is this

2153
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,920
something you made is it different stock

2154
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:07,198
and what sort of traits does this mail

2155
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:09,679
bring to the table

2156
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:12,059
that mail was another open pollination

2157
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,500
that line is

2158
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,360
amazing

2159
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:18,719
amazing line

2160
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:22,198
um I was doing an open pollination with

2161
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:25,920
F2 seed stock when I made that cross and

2162
01:31:22,198 --> 01:31:28,500
um they have two seeds were made by

2163
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:31,859
canorado the F1 seeds were made by Jim

2164
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:34,198
Ortega so it's Jim Ortega's seed stock

2165
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:35,399
you know I love I'm really happy with

2166
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:39,238
that line

2167
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:41,698
um I need to you know talk to Bodie

2168
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:43,379
about it because I don't talk to Jim

2169
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:46,019
Ortega myself and I don't want to step

2170
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:48,779
on anybody's toes

2171
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:50,580
but I would definitely um love to take

2172
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:55,079
that one to F4 and share that one with

2173
01:31:50,579 --> 01:31:57,779
the public when I um made the f3s I put

2174
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:59,880
in the nl2 Clone and um that was Jim

2175
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:02,399
Ortega stock and we just gave those away

2176
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:05,219
as freebies because it didn't seem right

2177
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:07,738
you know he's the the caretaker of that

2178
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:09,600
line for so long and then I just get a

2179
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:11,638
couple pieces and for me to be the

2180
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,320
person that cash in that's just not the

2181
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:15,719
way I like to do things I like to stand

2182
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:18,539
my own lane with that being said I am

2183
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:23,100
gonna ask uh Bodie if he can ask Jim if

2184
01:32:18,539 --> 01:32:24,840
mine's if I release that nf4 and it

2185
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,020
needs to be out there in the public it's

2186
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:30,719
one of the best uh NL lines there is

2187
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:32,940
that's killer and that's so exciting to

2188
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,679
hear I guess the reason why I'm asking

2189
01:32:32,939 --> 01:32:37,019
you about all these various Northern

2190
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:38,819
Lights varieties and the crosses you've

2191
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,920
done is because I'm just sort of trying

2192
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:42,539
to get a feel for all the different ones

2193
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,020
and what they bring

2194
01:32:42,539 --> 01:32:48,899
which one to you is the best if you

2195
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:50,699
could only pick one and what is maybe a

2196
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:52,319
unique trait about each one of them

2197
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:54,539
versus the others if we just think about

2198
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:58,439
the three ones we've spoken about be it

2199
01:32:54,539 --> 01:33:01,679
the nl5 the nl1 and the two by five

2200
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:04,799
great question the best line is either

2201
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:08,639
the nl1 or the 2x5 I would love to get

2202
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:12,960
into those together those are the two NL

2203
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:14,159
lines in seed form that um remind me of

2204
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,980
uh

2205
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:20,279
the 90s NLS um

2206
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:22,678
I'm spacing out the guys Seed Company

2207
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:24,479
um they used to be Lighthouse seeds and

2208
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:26,819
then they split up they have some really

2209
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:30,000
nice and now they cross their uh five by

2210
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:33,599
two and those guys have a really nice no

2211
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,139
a sea lion and uh sucks I'm spacing out

2212
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,139
um

2213
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:40,319
their their new name but uh they split

2214
01:33:37,139 --> 01:33:42,480
up and um most of that aligns on on the

2215
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:45,658
market these days don't remind me of NL

2216
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:48,839
at all from the 90s and those ones that

2217
01:33:45,658 --> 01:33:52,500
I just mentioned have little bits and

2218
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:57,060
pieces of the quality NLS in them but

2219
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:59,698
it's not the whole picture and um that's

2220
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:03,539
why I said when something like that The

2221
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:05,279
Brood X you know almost reminds me of a

2222
01:34:03,539 --> 01:34:08,219
really high quality Northern Lights when

2223
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:12,059
the 90s better than these pure inbred

2224
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:13,859
Lines Just because uh everything in that

2225
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:17,219
I believe goes back to Northern Lights

2226
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:19,579
and definos you know just are are coming

2227
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:23,039
through right they express themselves

2228
01:34:19,579 --> 01:34:26,100
there's a few NLS I haven't got to check

2229
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:28,560
out I haven't got to check out deep Elms

2230
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:30,659
um I gotta look through AK Bean Brands

2231
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,000
nl5 by one

2232
01:34:30,658 --> 01:34:34,799
um that wasn't exactly what I was

2233
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,760
looking for but I have a really nice

2234
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:41,820
keeper cut of AK Bean brains nl1 and um

2235
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:44,699
she seems like what I remember and um

2236
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:48,198
she seems really nice summer similar

2237
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:52,019
type plant structure to the puck so yeah

2238
01:34:48,198 --> 01:34:53,759
killer Killa oh dude I'm down to take a

2239
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:56,520
ball hand and get some water for sure

2240
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:59,159
hey how you doing

2241
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:01,679
I'll just spill my chop Bowl God damn it

2242
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:04,079
I just took too long it's Overkill now

2243
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:07,500
I'm gonna do a grand daddy

2244
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:12,658
oh yeah what's the overkill taste like

2245
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:15,000
acrity earthy musty really nice Afghani

2246
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:17,219
so I've been um

2247
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,420
ever since I had it I've really missed

2248
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:24,658
that train wreck BX with the tie I had

2249
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:27,840
rollers at your place it was so nice

2250
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:30,299
yeah that was the A5 Haze Thai nail

2251
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,079
the one that uh Karma brought the body

2252
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:38,699
selected uh so good

2253
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:41,340
I'm sure the amount uh produced [ __ ]

2254
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:44,460
fire I brought him to this purple Congo

2255
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:46,500
land race cut and um this guy Grissom

2256
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,158
around here in Humble

2257
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:50,520
um

2258
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:53,519
and it was [ __ ] amazing that male

2259
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:56,880
just produced well with everything

2260
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:59,340
that's why I said uh those uh shy or

2261
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:02,400
super silver haze super silver Sour

2262
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,380
Diesel crossed by a simple Silver Haze

2263
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:06,839
by that now should just have some

2264
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,779
phenomenal stuff in the gene pool

2265
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:12,300
do you ever plan to work with the train

2266
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:14,158
wreck line or the train wreck BX any

2267
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:16,760
further or is more just like a one-off

2268
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:21,059
to get it in seed

2269
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:23,820
so you know it's hard to um communicate

2270
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:26,940
with the seed Market and the stuff over

2271
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:29,460
uh Instagram and stuff you know I wish I

2272
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:31,079
could just sell on my seats directly and

2273
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:33,359
talk to the people when they bought them

2274
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:35,760
you know and tell them about what's in

2275
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,500
there directly you know I think a lot of

2276
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,039
the seed buyers want everything to be

2277
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:43,439
perfectly worked and they have zero uh

2278
01:36:40,039 --> 01:36:45,000
hermaphrodites and be perfect seeds you

2279
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:48,178
know just like you would get with tomato

2280
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,960
seeds unfortunately cannabis hasn't been

2281
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:54,420
worked as much and I don't even know um

2282
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,060
even with it being worked as hard if you

2283
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:59,639
know you can eliminate hermaphrodite

2284
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:01,080
traits from certain lines completely

2285
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:03,119
because you get them in so many

2286
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:05,579
different environments and people feed

2287
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:08,579
differently and put Plants too close

2288
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:10,260
together put lights too close to plants

2289
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:13,198
there's a lot of different things that

2290
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:15,900
are trigger hermaphrodites uh that

2291
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:17,638
wouldn't even happen normally you know

2292
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:19,319
like all the chem clones will

2293
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:21,239
hermaphrodite if you do the wrong things

2294
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:23,279
to them but if you treat them right they

2295
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:24,359
won't hermaphrodite

2296
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:26,158
um

2297
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:27,779
you don't want to have them too root

2298
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:29,460
bound you don't want to have them too

2299
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:31,679
close to the lights you don't want to

2300
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:33,899
have them too crammed together

2301
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:37,880
those are things that will cause the

2302
01:37:33,899 --> 01:37:41,219
actual chem cuts the 91 and the D to

2303
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:44,639
hermaphrodite so of course it's going to

2304
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:48,658
cause their seeds to do the same thing

2305
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:52,020
so you know I would really like to get

2306
01:37:48,658 --> 01:37:54,719
that Trainwreck that cross out to the

2307
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:56,280
public but am I going to be able to get

2308
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:59,179
it

2309
01:37:56,279 --> 01:37:59,179
um stable enough

2310
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,800
I don't know

2311
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:03,420
um

2312
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:07,320
I've talked to

2313
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:08,880
um Shabba the person who has uh the most

2314
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:10,679
experienced back crossing different

2315
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,840
clones

2316
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:15,300
and he said he had tried to do the train

2317
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:19,079
wreck a few times and that always it was

2318
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:22,260
just hermaphrod diet Mass you know

2319
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:24,380
so what I'm looking with now

2320
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:26,880
um there's about 25 percent

2321
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:30,060
hermaphrodites in the train wreck that

2322
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:33,719
cross one I had mentioned in my last

2323
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:34,679
podcast I'm not the biggest fan of train

2324
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:36,840
wreck

2325
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:39,119
um you know it's the type of terpenes

2326
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,699
that can kind of get played out if you

2327
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:43,920
smoke it for a long period of time

2328
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:45,899
that being said some of the stuff that I

2329
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:50,219
found in the back crosses was really

2330
01:38:45,899 --> 01:38:52,979
phenomenal and um just really uh cool

2331
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:54,600
you know like some more garlic

2332
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:57,839
Expressions

2333
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,600
um some more leather Expressions brought

2334
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,920
to the typical train wreck uh trip

2335
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,260
paneling

2336
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,819
uh Pine-Sol

2337
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:09,960
cleaner

2338
01:39:05,819 --> 01:39:11,939
uh Lemon Pledge type of smell

2339
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:13,260
you know kind of stuck like I had

2340
01:39:11,939 --> 01:39:15,359
mentioned earlier I have so many

2341
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:18,119
projects I don't know how much time I

2342
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:20,279
can devote to that project and get it

2343
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:22,859
stable enough to where I feel

2344
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:25,380
comfortable releasing it to the public

2345
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:28,139
and um

2346
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:30,000
you know I thought about releasing the

2347
01:39:28,139 --> 01:39:32,159
bx1 because I'll I don't know if I'm

2348
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:36,119
ever going to be next to it or uh get

2349
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:37,439
that to it F3 F4 stabilize it you know

2350
01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:40,198
and I could release it and there's

2351
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:43,259
amazing females to be found in there and

2352
01:39:40,198 --> 01:39:44,819
even more amazing breeding stock

2353
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,280
um to be found in you know the

2354
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:49,619
possibilities to take it to F3 and F4

2355
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:52,259
and stabilize it and look at large

2356
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:54,179
numbers and you know only read with the

2357
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:56,880
stable ones the potential to bring

2358
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:59,219
amazing lines is in there so you know

2359
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,679
it's it's a tough spot to be in but as

2360
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:03,179
of right now it's it's it's it's shelved

2361
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,219
and it's just kind of sitting on the

2362
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:06,139
shelf and I don't know what I'm gonna do

2363
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:08,460
with it

2364
01:40:06,139 --> 01:40:10,800
interesting interesting maybe it'll pop

2365
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,139
its head back out when you get a chance

2366
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,539
to delve into some of that more sativa

2367
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:17,100
work but I wanted to loop back quickly

2368
01:40:15,539 --> 01:40:18,479
to a strain you mentioned earlier I

2369
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,520
should have asked you that should be the

2370
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:23,099
theme of this interview just missing my

2371
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:26,100
opportunities but the London pound cake

2372
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,480
is an interesting strain for a few

2373
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:30,179
reasons because it's being used by

2374
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:32,579
Cookie fam but it hasn't made quite the

2375
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:35,399
same impact as many of the other cookie

2376
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:37,920
Cuts have what's your impressions of it

2377
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:42,059
and do you think it breeds well

2378
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:44,460
I think they've just done a better job

2379
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:47,159
um not letting that one get out

2380
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:49,619
unfortunately uh I think uh [ __ ]

2381
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:50,698
doesn't like his stuff getting out and

2382
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:53,279
you know

2383
01:40:50,698 --> 01:40:56,099
um his stuff constantly gets out and

2384
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:58,559
it's uh I can't imagine being how

2385
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:00,300
painful that's got to be especially when

2386
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,820
you don't want it out there because it's

2387
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:05,940
amazing [ __ ] that being said this one

2388
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:10,019
came from growing with passion he got it

2389
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:12,719
from [ __ ] him and dala did a breeding

2390
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:16,440
with um that serious male from South

2391
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:19,500
Fork seeds uh it's uh shabad's 707 chem

2392
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:21,059
dog bred stardog I took a mail off of

2393
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:24,000
that I brought that to chemd and I

2394
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:26,460
passed them some seeds and they bred

2395
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,939
that the wedding cake and burner named

2396
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:33,779
The Strain medin and um I got that

2397
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:36,059
London pound cake back as a thank you I

2398
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:38,639
am not exactly sure what number it is it

2399
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:42,360
was one of the keepers I really like it

2400
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:45,118
it produces uh Mega weight

2401
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:47,158
um I pass it to a friend's mine up here

2402
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:49,019
in Humboldt that our production Growers

2403
01:41:47,158 --> 01:41:51,299
and they're getting up to three pounds

2404
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,460
of light with it the [ __ ] um will go

2405
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:56,639
purple if you give it any kind of cold

2406
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:58,198
it's super chirpy it's uh it's really

2407
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,880
good I definitely wouldn't have run with

2408
01:41:58,198 --> 01:42:01,319
it if I didn't think it was really good

2409
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,260
and it could bring some really cool

2410
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:06,420
stuff to the table I know it's a sunset

2411
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:08,460
sherbet cross so I'm not exactly sure

2412
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:11,219
what it was crossed to I really like the

2413
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:14,340
sunset sherbet besides the original

2414
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:16,319
cookies Cuts uh the sunset Sherbert is

2415
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:19,860
my favorite thing that that crew has

2416
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:22,380
done and then behind the sunset sherbet

2417
01:42:19,859 --> 01:42:24,779
in my personal uh picks would be uh

2418
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:29,279
probably London pound cake and biscotti

2419
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:31,920
and not really a fan of the gelatos but

2420
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:34,679
I think the London pound cake is pretty

2421
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:37,560
cool and as far as a cut for production

2422
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:39,420
for work right now it's it's a it's a

2423
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:42,000
really Killer cut to have

2424
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:44,340
what a great answer it makes me want to

2425
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,840
quickly ask you are there any other cuts

2426
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,460
that are really hot in the scene at the

2427
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:51,179
moment you know sort of ones in that

2428
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:54,000
hype category that you're kind of fond

2429
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:55,679
of like for example you know maybe maybe

2430
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,198
like you know you really like Mac or

2431
01:42:55,679 --> 01:43:00,060
whatever I love Mac people say weird

2432
01:42:58,198 --> 01:43:01,618
stuff about it I think it's great is

2433
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:03,179
there any current hype cuts that you're

2434
01:43:01,618 --> 01:43:07,319
particularly fond of

2435
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:10,319
no I really recognize and uh respect

2436
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:12,719
everyone's uh marketing abilities with

2437
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:14,099
that kind of thing but uh most of the

2438
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,679
stuff that's really getting a lot of

2439
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:18,119
play right now I don't like all the

2440
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:21,239
cookie stuff down from the cookies

2441
01:43:18,118 --> 01:43:23,698
Sunset Sherbert jot up Scotty crosses it

2442
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:25,319
all has a certain type of high I really

2443
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:27,539
don't like it

2444
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:30,420
um I love the weed when you're just

2445
01:43:27,539 --> 01:43:32,219
judging quality weed tastes great smokes

2446
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:34,199
great gets you high as [ __ ] especially

2447
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:36,539
if you don't have anything else or you

2448
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:38,879
haven't had anything else it's really

2449
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:41,340
nice weed but when you have the options

2450
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:44,400
of some of the classic highs that I have

2451
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,380
in my Arsenal on the hive from that

2452
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:47,579
stuff is just a little bit flat in my

2453
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:50,340
opinion

2454
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:51,658
yeah no fair point fair point I always

2455
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:53,579
find it interesting to find the

2456
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:55,379
different types of highs that people

2457
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:58,260
like

2458
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:59,699
um another sort of comparison I was

2459
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:01,079
hoping to get from you is I think you've

2460
01:43:59,698 --> 01:44:03,299
probably got more experience with

2461
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:04,738
different types of afghanis than anyone

2462
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:07,139
and a few of our listeners were

2463
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:09,718
interested in hearing if you could tell

2464
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:12,118
us sort of what the different type of

2465
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,039
afghanis you've come across are in terms

2466
01:44:12,118 --> 01:44:15,960
of like your Broad Leaf and your thin

2467
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:17,100
leaf and the effects like do you just

2468
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,859
think that

2469
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:22,139
most afghanis are either like a body

2470
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:24,179
high or a head high

2471
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:27,300
or do you think there's a lot more

2472
01:44:24,179 --> 01:44:29,158
diversity within it and and I guess kind

2473
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,380
of maybe another way to summarize it is

2474
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:33,179
what do you think when someone says oh

2475
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:35,940
you know an Indica is an Indica do you

2476
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:37,260
feel like nah that's not really true or

2477
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:39,359
where do you sit on that with the

2478
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:40,560
afghanis

2479
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:43,259
man

2480
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,280
I definitely don't think an Indica is an

2481
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:47,639
indica

2482
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:50,219
there's definitely different effects of

2483
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:52,380
indicas I like the stuff from the Hindu

2484
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:55,679
Kush mountain ranges from the Highland

2485
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:59,340
those are my favorites I've noticed two

2486
01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:02,460
major types the the sweeter Berry

2487
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:05,400
afghanis grapes berries and then the

2488
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:08,340
more acrid uh earthy musty basement

2489
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:11,399
types uh you know some families are

2490
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:14,039
combinations of the two they have both

2491
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:16,920
in the gene pool or some plants carry

2492
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:19,139
both qualities but as you get closer to

2493
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:21,719
Pakistan you're you're going to get more

2494
01:45:19,139 --> 01:45:23,760
Terps in in the weed

2495
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:26,760
um Pakistani wheat is a little more

2496
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:30,060
chirpy a little more branchy as you get

2497
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:32,579
more Southern in Afghanistan you get out

2498
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:35,280
of the Hindu Kush mountain range are

2499
01:45:32,579 --> 01:45:36,960
plants that have longer internode

2500
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:39,599
spacings

2501
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,739
um more sativa influence in the gene

2502
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,780
pool

2503
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:45,599
I wish I had more

2504
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:48,599
Landorus afghanis to learn from you know

2505
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:51,600
those are my best uh teaching tools that

2506
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:54,000
the land race Packy lines all the land

2507
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:56,639
race paculines I've encountered have

2508
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,880
been through Bodhi I've increased the

2509
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:02,699
Vintage Pakistani from Bodhi twice

2510
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:04,500
um I have his peshwar [ __ ] I bought

2511
01:46:02,698 --> 01:46:05,939
seven packs of that probably more packs

2512
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:08,100
than anyone else I'm

2513
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:10,379
need to get into those here really soon

2514
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,420
you know there

2515
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:14,520
there's no better teachers than the

2516
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:17,699
plants and I just try to grow as many

2517
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:21,239
different land race lines as possible I

2518
01:46:17,698 --> 01:46:23,158
wish I could uh release them all

2519
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:27,118
unfortunately

2520
01:46:23,158 --> 01:46:29,339
um people are kind of uh protective over

2521
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:31,799
them and I understand it's kind of like

2522
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:33,600
I had mentioned about Jim Ortega stock

2523
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:36,420
he has all that awesome and now that

2524
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,280
he's never really profited off of and it

2525
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:41,399
didn't really seem fair for me to sell

2526
01:46:38,279 --> 01:46:43,380
the the nl2 by NL 2x5 from him so I just

2527
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:45,420
gave it away for free because I just

2528
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:46,800
acquired it it's kind of like that with

2529
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:51,359
land race

2530
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:52,560
um as I do several increases with them I

2531
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,500
feel

2532
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,380
like I'm more entitled to share them

2533
01:46:55,500 --> 01:47:00,420
with the public but when I just uh get

2534
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,699
something right away and just want to

2535
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:04,500
cash it out it just it just doesn't seem

2536
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:07,379
right I have a lot of respect for this

2537
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:10,618
plant I you know I've turned down lots

2538
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:15,300
of money for clones 10gs before I've

2539
01:47:10,618 --> 01:47:18,719
never sell clones ever so I just uh

2540
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:21,600
we're just guardians of this plant and I

2541
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:24,300
just try to do uh do right by her and

2542
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:28,139
she does right by me and

2543
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:29,760
it's such a a teaching plant that you

2544
01:47:28,139 --> 01:47:32,279
know one of the lessons that's taught me

2545
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,860
is not to be greedy and show respect

2546
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:38,519
everything has its time so

2547
01:47:34,859 --> 01:47:39,960
nice nice uh a good sort of Mantra to

2548
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:43,619
strive to

2549
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:46,739
speaking about time what's your thoughts

2550
01:47:43,618 --> 01:47:49,559
on some of the indicates we saw in the

2551
01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:51,779
90s that would largely be described as

2552
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:53,880
sort of like creeper indicas you know

2553
01:47:51,779 --> 01:47:55,920
where they had like a really slow onset

2554
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,739
and then they would just hit you super

2555
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:01,980
hard it seems like that sort of strain

2556
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:04,500
isn't really around anymore do you think

2557
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:07,019
that we've lost them over time or that

2558
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:09,899
it was just more of a reflection of like

2559
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:12,000
the availability of good quality bud and

2560
01:48:09,899 --> 01:48:14,579
people just being reminiscent about

2561
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,100
those sorts of high quality weed when it

2562
01:48:14,579 --> 01:48:20,039
didn't come around very often

2563
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:22,500
well to notice that effect you got to be

2564
01:48:20,039 --> 01:48:24,420
sober when you smoke that creeper weed

2565
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:26,639
and then you gotta smoke no other weed

2566
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:29,579
for a while until that creeper effect

2567
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:31,920
creeps up on you to be honest I do have

2568
01:48:29,579 --> 01:48:34,139
some crosses that do have that aspect

2569
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:36,658
some of the M10 is kind of like a

2570
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:39,118
creeper Afghani that purple Hindu Kush

2571
01:48:36,658 --> 01:48:41,460
will creep up on you um the purple Hindu

2572
01:48:39,118 --> 01:48:43,319
Kush crosses will creep up on you but

2573
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:46,319
like I said you got to be sober when you

2574
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:48,118
smoke them and then you gotta smoke them

2575
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:50,759
and just not smoke anything for a while

2576
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:52,519
to kind of like have notice that effect

2577
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,719
if you're just like an emerald cup

2578
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:55,860
situation where you're there smoking

2579
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:57,779
tons of different weed and you're high

2580
01:48:55,859 --> 01:49:00,599
as [ __ ] already you're not even going to

2581
01:48:57,779 --> 01:49:03,118
notice uh something like that you know

2582
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:05,280
yeah that's a very valid point isn't it

2583
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:06,000
you gotta it's about set and setting as

2584
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:07,738
well

2585
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,020
hmm

2586
01:49:07,738 --> 01:49:11,939
yeah definitely very important you

2587
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:13,560
notice that creeper effect a lot of

2588
01:49:11,939 --> 01:49:16,819
times when you smoke some weed and then

2589
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,820
you go into a store

2590
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:21,960
there you go there you go

2591
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:24,359
another question we got was are you able

2592
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:27,480
to describe the differences between your

2593
01:49:24,359 --> 01:49:29,880
two different black domino cuts the 95

2594
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:34,559
versus the healing Harvest one

2595
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:35,219
okay so the 95 is more

2596
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,080
um

2597
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:42,239
that accurate earthy

2598
01:49:39,079 --> 01:49:45,840
musty basement

2599
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:49,678
um almost Bubba Kush funky sometimes uh

2600
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:52,800
type of thing and then the uh healing

2601
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:56,539
Harvest has more of

2602
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:59,460
more Terps just it's really hard to

2603
01:49:56,539 --> 01:50:02,039
describe the smell it's almost like a

2604
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:06,000
tupperware plastic smell with like

2605
01:50:02,039 --> 01:50:08,698
garlic behind it so I had read on um Mr

2606
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,819
Nice forms where Neville said at some

2607
01:50:08,698 --> 01:50:14,158
point he switched out the recipe for the

2608
01:50:11,819 --> 01:50:16,738
black domino he switched out the Afghani

2609
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:20,039
one the M10 and he switched in garlic

2610
01:50:16,738 --> 01:50:22,799
bud in its place so I wonder if the um

2611
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:25,139
healing Harvest is uh at through

2612
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:27,179
Switched At The Garlic Bud because it

2613
01:50:25,139 --> 01:50:29,219
kind of has that garlic thing going on

2614
01:50:27,179 --> 01:50:32,158
the garlic butter would have brought a

2615
01:50:29,219 --> 01:50:34,260
little bit more sativa to the um gene

2616
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:37,339
pool the original Black Diamond was

2617
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:40,320
pretty much 100 into copying hash plant

2618
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:42,000
Ortega Northern Lights and Afghani

2619
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:45,359
number one M10

2620
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,060
he uh mentioned that he didn't like the

2621
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:51,299
Afghani number one I wonder if that's

2622
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:54,119
just because it came from Sam you know

2623
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:56,880
because when you look back in history if

2624
01:50:54,118 --> 01:51:00,118
you look back at the Afghan E1 M10 it's

2625
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:04,859
probably behind more uh strains

2626
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:08,939
than any other uh land race Afghani you

2627
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:12,599
know JJ used it and his work it's in the

2628
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:14,579
quiet electric it's in snow Lotus

2629
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:16,380
Blockhead

2630
01:51:14,579 --> 01:51:19,439
um I can't think of them all right now

2631
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:22,199
but it it the amount of strains that uh

2632
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:23,939
go back to Afghani number one is uh

2633
01:51:22,198 --> 01:51:26,399
truly impressive

2634
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:28,979
yeah I mean I've only ever really tried

2635
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:31,198
one sample that was given to me as

2636
01:51:28,979 --> 01:51:33,658
Afghani number one and it was some

2637
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:35,460
really really nice stuff

2638
01:51:33,658 --> 01:51:36,960
I mean speaking of cuts where there's

2639
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:38,939
different ones of it out there and

2640
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,260
talking about the differences there was

2641
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:42,419
some interest around the different

2642
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:44,760
headband Cuts can you give us a rundown

2643
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:47,699
on your headband and is it the same one

2644
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:49,679
that other people use or is your one

2645
01:51:47,698 --> 01:51:52,500
unique

2646
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:56,639
so I can't say what what the other

2647
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:58,979
people use but um I do know that my cut

2648
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,539
has been passed around a lot I passed it

2649
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:01,259
to Duke Diamond

2650
01:52:00,539 --> 01:52:06,658
um

2651
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:10,320
not so dog has it you know it's really

2652
01:52:06,658 --> 01:52:12,319
um good cut it's renamed OG had to get

2653
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:15,719
renamed the person that renamed it

2654
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:17,939
reminded them of uh weasel's headband so

2655
01:52:15,719 --> 01:52:20,760
that's the reason he used the name

2656
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:25,439
um had that same had been kind of effect

2657
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:28,320
on your head so there's that headband

2658
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:32,039
um not so dog calls it the 56 day

2659
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:34,439
headband he also has uh Olympus headband

2660
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:36,899
and that's pretty similar but um

2661
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:40,319
different I like mine much better

2662
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:42,658
there's also the LA Kush Headband The

2663
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:45,840
Not So dog holds that one's more like

2664
01:52:42,658 --> 01:52:47,460
sour diesel mantle prop brought that one

2665
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,400
up from LA

2666
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:53,639
that one's [ __ ] amazing and then

2667
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:56,039
there's a 707 Headband that DNA released

2668
01:52:53,639 --> 01:52:59,039
and there's some really good keeperfinos

2669
01:52:56,039 --> 01:53:01,079
in that too that I've seen so weasel's

2670
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:03,658
original headband which I don't think is

2671
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:05,698
alive anymore so there's a ton of

2672
01:53:03,658 --> 01:53:09,420
different headbands and it's really

2673
01:53:05,698 --> 01:53:11,158
confusing topic and that's about all I

2674
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:13,020
know about that one

2675
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:15,000
no that's a great rundown I think that's

2676
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:18,360
what we were sort of hoping to touch on

2677
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:21,719
and likewise in a recent episode we

2678
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:23,759
spoke with Mean Gene about Big Sir holy

2679
01:53:21,719 --> 01:53:25,859
weed and what was interesting was he

2680
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,020
kind of mentioned that he got some seeds

2681
01:53:25,859 --> 01:53:30,179
which might be one of the parent lines

2682
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:32,040
that made the Big Sir holy weed it's

2683
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:33,840
sort of a longer story I won't go into

2684
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:36,600
it all but it relates to this strain

2685
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:39,060
called Dolores did you ever get the back

2686
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:41,760
story from kagyu on the Big Sur holy

2687
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:44,340
weed or just from anyone even like what

2688
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:47,100
have you heard about its Origins and the

2689
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,020
stuff you worked with under Coast or was

2690
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:51,119
that from kagi's collection or how were

2691
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:55,199
those seeds acquired

2692
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:57,118
so uh KQ got his big sir holy weed from

2693
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:59,939
a surfer guy

2694
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:01,859
that's what he told me and um keg he's

2695
01:53:59,939 --> 01:54:04,198
an old timer you know he's getting close

2696
01:54:01,859 --> 01:54:06,238
to 80 at this point and uh he's the

2697
01:54:04,198 --> 01:54:08,939
oldest dude I know that smokes weed

2698
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:11,099
still and grows and he's like the OG of

2699
01:54:08,939 --> 01:54:13,379
OG's I've never you know met him anyone

2700
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:16,920
even close so he's been around Santa

2701
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:19,139
Cruz's whole life you know and seen the

2702
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:20,819
evolution of cannabis since you know

2703
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:25,020
when the Brotherhood was bringing in

2704
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:27,738
stuff so his perspectives are just like

2705
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:31,500
so valuable to him

2706
01:54:27,738 --> 01:54:34,198
the Mexican blocks that built the the

2707
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:37,579
Big Sur holy from what I know it's uh

2708
01:54:34,198 --> 01:54:41,158
Afghani Mexican cross

2709
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:46,019
Zacatecas purple Zacatecas

2710
01:54:41,158 --> 01:54:47,819
I think Dolores is a town near there

2711
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:51,060
um they're Two Towns two right in the

2712
01:54:47,819 --> 01:54:54,599
same region that's uh all I know about

2713
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:57,719
that I do know his Pixar holy line is

2714
01:54:54,600 --> 01:55:00,060
super high quality I don't have any of

2715
01:54:57,719 --> 01:55:02,340
that seed stock you know it's super high

2716
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:05,880
quality stuff I wish I did at one point

2717
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:09,139
I had a keeper cut to grow it out in

2718
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:12,779
Colorado some samples got the atom done

2719
01:55:09,139 --> 01:55:16,800
and it reminded him of the same fixer

2720
01:55:12,779 --> 01:55:17,939
hole holy that was in Sage it's really

2721
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,779
good weed

2722
01:55:17,939 --> 01:55:24,359
really interesting gene pool and he just

2723
01:55:21,779 --> 01:55:26,460
told me he got it from some Surfer and

2724
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:29,099
he had had it for quite some time and

2725
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:30,658
then done a few and seed increases on it

2726
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:32,880
that's all I know about that he'd have

2727
01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:35,698
to elaborate further

2728
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,319
yeah nice a good little background on

2729
01:55:35,698 --> 01:55:39,599
that one I think it's one way I will

2730
01:55:37,319 --> 01:55:41,639
always sort of be trying to figure out

2731
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:45,480
the exact truth around it

2732
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:47,400
you were talking about the LA pure cush

2733
01:55:45,479 --> 01:55:50,698
headband and a few other strangers just

2734
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:54,738
shortly ago which of the pure kush Cuts

2735
01:55:50,698 --> 01:55:58,559
is the best for hash in your opinion

2736
01:55:54,738 --> 01:56:01,439
I'm not really a hashmaker so

2737
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:03,600
I like to learn from the plant and um

2738
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:06,000
honestly I think I the last few years

2739
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:08,280
I've been wanting to to make cash more

2740
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,560
than ever just to learn about the

2741
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:13,259
different types of galaxies and the way

2742
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,840
they make cash and the different strains

2743
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:18,300
I have to so I couldn't relate their

2744
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,699
qualities to hashmakers

2745
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:23,940
because I'm not really a hashmaker so I

2746
01:56:20,698 --> 01:56:26,519
I really don't have any uh knowledge or

2747
01:56:23,939 --> 01:56:29,099
any uh field I've never made hash really

2748
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:30,719
I've made Keef a few times but that was

2749
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:33,060
in the 90s

2750
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,939
yeah no fair enough fans a fair enough

2751
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:37,020
answer one of our listeners did want to

2752
01:56:35,939 --> 01:56:39,658
ask

2753
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:41,639
what you know about the history of your

2754
01:56:39,658 --> 01:56:43,679
master cush cutting and what's it like

2755
01:56:41,639 --> 01:56:45,719
as a cultivar I think this is an

2756
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,819
interesting question because a lot of

2757
01:56:45,719 --> 01:56:49,679
people enjoy Master Kush but it seldomly

2758
01:56:47,819 --> 01:56:52,559
tests very high so it's one of those

2759
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:54,300
older ones that is truly old school in

2760
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,580
that it's good weed but the numbers

2761
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:58,860
don't reflect it what do you know about

2762
01:56:56,579 --> 01:57:02,340
the back story on it

2763
01:56:58,859 --> 01:57:05,939
so I've had it since

2764
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:09,900
um probably around 2010 maybe a few

2765
01:57:05,939 --> 01:57:11,698
years longer than that I got it from a

2766
01:57:09,899 --> 01:57:14,339
friend that really knows good weed and

2767
01:57:11,698 --> 01:57:17,539
he knows a lot of people he's a a glass

2768
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:21,480
uh seller he sells you know a class

2769
01:57:17,539 --> 01:57:23,939
artwork and um travels around a lot he

2770
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:27,238
brought it up from New Mexico I had

2771
01:57:23,939 --> 01:57:30,479
heard it came from Florida to New Mexico

2772
01:57:27,238 --> 01:57:34,198
um she's really really special she has

2773
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:35,638
uh one of the most relaxing calming

2774
01:57:34,198 --> 01:57:39,118
buzzes

2775
01:57:35,639 --> 01:57:40,859
um perfect for like watching a movie and

2776
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:43,859
just sitting there and relaxing you're

2777
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:46,679
gonna just soak right into the the plot

2778
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:49,559
and think about nothing else

2779
01:57:46,679 --> 01:57:52,679
um I'm definitely gonna get to a project

2780
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:55,260
a Master Kush project I'm gonna search

2781
01:57:52,679 --> 01:57:57,359
through a few different crosses I made

2782
01:57:55,260 --> 01:58:00,780
with that Master Kush across the bull

2783
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:03,539
Kush and um few others and I Mean Gene

2784
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:06,238
actually gave me some deep chunk Master

2785
01:58:03,539 --> 01:58:07,800
Kush seeds let me look through those and

2786
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:10,559
find the best line that I think

2787
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:14,699
amplifies the math Master Kush qualities

2788
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:18,060
and and bring that one to seed form is a

2789
01:58:14,698 --> 01:58:20,759
a goal and I also have the SoCal master

2790
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:22,199
I want to work into that project and

2791
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,800
just got

2792
01:58:22,198 --> 01:58:28,678
um old Master Kush from Eugene Oregon

2793
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:31,619
and really excited to work that project

2794
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:33,179
wow no no shortage of projects on the

2795
01:58:31,618 --> 01:58:34,859
horizon is there I love it you're

2796
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:37,760
keeping yourself busy

2797
01:58:34,859 --> 01:58:40,559
when you're doing one of these projects

2798
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:42,420
do you pop a certain number of seeds or

2799
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,460
is it like I just pop all the seeds of

2800
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:46,500
that line I have what's your number of

2801
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:47,698
seeds you like to pop to search through

2802
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:49,920
things

2803
01:58:47,698 --> 01:58:53,698
40 or 50

2804
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,658
um minimum I like that ideally uh do

2805
01:58:53,698 --> 01:58:55,738
more

2806
01:58:54,658 --> 01:58:58,679
but

2807
01:58:55,738 --> 01:59:00,598
um I I hear people on Instagram a lot

2808
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:03,179
say you know I got a pack so I can get

2809
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:04,980
them out you know 12 seeds is not you

2810
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:06,599
need at least twice three times four

2811
01:59:04,979 --> 01:59:08,819
times that many you know really look

2812
01:59:06,599 --> 01:59:11,819
through the population and you need to

2813
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:14,219
be familiar with the gene pool and uh

2814
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:16,618
what you're looking for really helps

2815
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:19,079
um somebody had just mentioned to me on

2816
01:59:16,618 --> 01:59:22,319
Instagram that they got the Urkel cut

2817
01:59:19,079 --> 01:59:25,079
and it's down for me and um they wanted

2818
01:59:22,319 --> 01:59:28,139
to buy a pack of light of Venus to make

2819
01:59:25,079 --> 01:59:31,139
a bat cross and I was like well

2820
01:59:28,139 --> 01:59:33,599
don't buy one pack by four grow that

2821
01:59:31,139 --> 01:59:35,279
Oracle clone out three or four times so

2822
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,480
you get familiar with it know what

2823
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:39,539
you're dealing with what you're looking

2824
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:41,459
for and then pop those four packs and

2825
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:43,319
then you'll know what you're looking for

2826
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:44,279
in a male to bring to the table for your

2827
01:59:43,319 --> 01:59:46,920
back cross

2828
01:59:44,279 --> 01:59:50,399
you know the bigger your selections the

2829
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:52,800
better your end results and I look at it

2830
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:54,598
this way if you're not finding Keepers

2831
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,420
and the females there's not going to be

2832
01:59:54,599 --> 01:59:58,980
Keepers in the males and it's as simple

2833
01:59:57,420 --> 02:00:01,500
as that

2834
01:59:58,979 --> 02:00:03,718
so I mean it begs the question have you

2835
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:05,880
got any new tips for us about how to

2836
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:08,158
select a mail do you think it differs

2837
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:10,199
from strain to strain or are there any

2838
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:11,879
gold and characteristics where if you

2839
02:00:10,198 --> 02:00:13,439
see that thing on any strain you're like

2840
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:16,739
yup I want it

2841
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:19,618
I think it uh differs from Stranded

2842
02:00:16,738 --> 02:00:21,779
strain and what type of qualities you

2843
02:00:19,618 --> 02:00:24,118
want that male to bring to the table

2844
02:00:21,779 --> 02:00:26,039
okay I was going to say on the topic of

2845
02:00:24,118 --> 02:00:28,319
popping seeds which we just spoke about

2846
02:00:26,039 --> 02:00:30,539
are there any new lines you're thinking

2847
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:31,799
about going through or any new seed

2848
02:00:30,539 --> 02:00:34,439
stock you've been given that you're

2849
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,940
excited to pop next

2850
02:00:34,439 --> 02:00:39,238
wow

2851
02:00:35,939 --> 02:00:42,839
um you know right now I'm going through

2852
02:00:39,238 --> 02:00:43,439
Overkill black muddy river

2853
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:45,779
um

2854
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:49,019
and both the black dominoes cross to the

2855
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:51,840
M10 you know testing the M10 black

2856
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:54,780
dominance for release and then also

2857
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:58,199
running all those different crosses had

2858
02:00:54,779 --> 02:01:01,618
to head to see which is the best one to

2859
02:00:58,198 --> 02:01:03,598
um further a black dominant project so

2860
02:01:01,618 --> 02:01:07,380
those seats are going now but I'm really

2861
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:09,960
excited about that I'm also growing OG

2862
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:12,139
Kush Lazy Dog

2863
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:17,279
um headband Lazy Dog

2864
02:01:12,139 --> 02:01:21,659
Ethiopian banana M10 Malawi M10 Panama

2865
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:23,759
Red M10 and um more prude X popped a

2866
02:01:21,658 --> 02:01:26,519
bunch more brutex because that shit's

2867
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:29,039
just ridiculous and like couldn't be

2868
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:31,380
happier with that and I popped a bunch

2869
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:32,939
of lazy dogs I want to look through more

2870
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:36,179
of those

2871
02:01:32,939 --> 02:01:38,178
um before I take the line F2 and F3 I

2872
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:41,219
don't want to miss anything

2873
02:01:38,179 --> 02:01:44,158
wow there's some some nice projects in

2874
02:01:41,219 --> 02:01:46,020
the mix there I noticed that I feel like

2875
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:47,879
there's a distinct lack of banana

2876
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:49,860
crosses in the market and you just

2877
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:52,079
mentioned one do you plan to do any

2878
02:01:49,859 --> 02:01:54,238
further work with the banana lines and

2879
02:01:52,079 --> 02:01:56,099
I'm guessing you just use the banana OG

2880
02:01:54,238 --> 02:01:59,279
as the base

2881
02:01:56,099 --> 02:02:02,279
no that's the Ethiopian Highland uh

2882
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:04,880
banana cut body selected and she is

2883
02:02:02,279 --> 02:02:07,859
amazing two to one CBD

2884
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:10,500
what's the Highlight do you still feel

2885
02:02:07,859 --> 02:02:12,000
the psychoactive side or the CBD is just

2886
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:15,118
too high

2887
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,840
no you definitely uh get High

2888
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:18,118
um

2889
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,639
I'm not as familiar with that one as the

2890
02:02:18,118 --> 02:02:23,759
Panama Red but you know the Panama Red

2891
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:27,118
cut I used is the two to one the

2892
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:29,039
grandmother to the coastal seeds uh CBD

2893
02:02:27,118 --> 02:02:32,698
release that I did

2894
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:34,380
so that that cut is two to one CBD and

2895
02:02:32,698 --> 02:02:38,039
she definitely gets you high and she'll

2896
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:43,219
get you [ __ ] up and she can produce

2897
02:02:38,039 --> 02:02:46,979
everything cannabinoid wise uh thcv cbgs

2898
02:02:43,219 --> 02:02:48,480
CBD THC it's going to be cool to get

2899
02:02:46,979 --> 02:02:49,919
that one out there because I've seen

2900
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:51,658
some of the testers grow that already

2901
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,460
and it looked phenomenal I had to grab

2902
02:02:51,658 --> 02:02:54,960
that one myself before I released it to

2903
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:57,179
see how good it was

2904
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,099
that's awesome and when like what sort

2905
02:02:57,179 --> 02:03:01,560
of plants would you expect when you're

2906
02:02:59,099 --> 02:03:06,599
Crossing it with such a strong indica

2907
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:08,159
man they really look like M10 I'm

2908
02:03:06,599 --> 02:03:11,400
shocked and

2909
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:14,698
I had grown the Malawi um and Malawi

2910
02:03:11,399 --> 02:03:16,618
gold m10s out already and added

2911
02:03:14,698 --> 02:03:19,439
shortened the flowering time down

2912
02:03:16,618 --> 02:03:21,839
dramatically you know almost 50 percent

2913
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:24,359
so I'm assuming it's going to do the

2914
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,760
same thing especially with how

2915
02:03:24,359 --> 02:03:29,579
Indica looking the first few sets of

2916
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:32,219
leaves are with the Panama Red and um

2917
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:35,579
testers that finished it said it it

2918
02:03:32,219 --> 02:03:38,880
didn't go 10 weeks so really excited

2919
02:03:35,579 --> 02:03:41,698
about that one hell yeah and do you do

2920
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:44,039
you see the banana flavor translating

2921
02:03:41,698 --> 02:03:46,618
through it all or is it dominated by the

2922
02:03:44,039 --> 02:03:49,439
uh the Indica as well

2923
02:03:46,618 --> 02:03:51,719
well I haven't um grown those ones out

2924
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:54,658
there's a few testers that got those in

2925
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:57,179
flower now but the Ethiopian bananas um

2926
02:03:54,658 --> 02:03:58,138
have not biome 10 haven't been finished

2927
02:03:57,179 --> 02:04:00,000
yet

2928
02:03:58,139 --> 02:04:01,679
okay yeah because I think I remember

2929
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,539
Bodhi saying that it was like a

2930
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:05,880
different sort of banana flavor to the

2931
02:04:03,539 --> 02:04:08,579
banana row G is that correct

2932
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,039
yeah yeah it is but it's very banana

2933
02:04:08,579 --> 02:04:13,559
it's on

2934
02:04:10,039 --> 02:04:16,198
mistakable and um just really loud

2935
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:17,340
especially for a land race cut she's

2936
02:04:16,198 --> 02:04:19,019
special

2937
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:21,239
yeah wow that'll be that'll be

2938
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:23,699
interesting to see how it turns out you

2939
02:04:21,238 --> 02:04:25,198
mentioned the overkill as one of the

2940
02:04:23,698 --> 02:04:27,299
lines you're thinking about popping more

2941
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:30,000
seeds off and it made me remember back

2942
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:31,679
to our first chat where you referenced a

2943
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,460
strain from your youth you were looking

2944
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:37,560
to recreate called The Kill and I was

2945
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:39,840
wondering if you had made any further

2946
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:41,940
progress in attempting to recreate it

2947
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:44,099
and is that something you're still sort

2948
02:04:41,939 --> 02:04:45,658
of working towards long term or have you

2949
02:04:44,099 --> 02:04:48,000
sort of decided on pursuing other

2950
02:04:45,658 --> 02:04:50,879
projects

2951
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,439
when I uh think of high grade cannabis

2952
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,960
that I'm trying to get in the seed form

2953
02:04:52,439 --> 02:04:58,319
with these NL lines that's definitely

2954
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:59,760
like what I'm aiming for and um that

2955
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:01,139
quality

2956
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,860
um obviously I don't have any of that

2957
02:05:01,139 --> 02:05:07,859
seed stock or um I have similar related

2958
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:11,039
plants but uh I'm trying to work with

2959
02:05:07,859 --> 02:05:14,639
what I have to recreate that quality as

2960
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:17,819
best as I can and I'm very happy with

2961
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:21,060
the direction I'm headed and what we

2962
02:05:17,819 --> 02:05:25,019
have achieved so far with that

2963
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:27,000
where is it up to I remember is it the

2964
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:29,159
case that you've you've put it together

2965
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,439
and you're working through it now or are

2966
02:05:29,158 --> 02:05:33,719
you looking to sort of recombine some

2967
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:37,500
extra things into the picture

2968
02:05:33,719 --> 02:05:40,679
so I I've recreated the craft it was

2969
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:45,840
very good and very close but not as good

2970
02:05:40,679 --> 02:05:49,380
I did Airborne G13 which is nl2 by G13

2971
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:52,679
to my NL hash plant mouse that creates

2972
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:55,859
the the pedigree for the kill it was an

2973
02:05:52,679 --> 02:05:59,219
L hash plant nlg 13. those are really

2974
02:05:55,859 --> 02:06:02,939
phenomenal really nice plants but as far

2975
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:05,760
as me achieving that goal I'm not done I

2976
02:06:02,939 --> 02:06:10,319
I think I need to keep working these

2977
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:13,560
lines a little bit further and just

2978
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:18,738
follow what the plants tell me but I

2979
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:22,800
think if I uh I have an Airborne

2980
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:25,559
those two uh Gene pools and cross those

2981
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:27,539
with something like The Brood X I might

2982
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:30,300
be pretty darn close

2983
02:06:27,539 --> 02:06:32,099
yeah well okay that's that's exciting

2984
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:35,400
because that's what just like one cross

2985
02:06:32,099 --> 02:06:37,380
away possibly and then a female hunt

2986
02:06:35,399 --> 02:06:39,598
yeah everything we've been dropping

2987
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,760
along these lines I'm really really

2988
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:45,659
happy with and really proud of to begin

2989
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:48,119
it out there into the gene pool so uh if

2990
02:06:45,658 --> 02:06:50,819
I can recreate something as good as

2991
02:06:48,118 --> 02:06:53,158
something I remember in my youth is that

2992
02:06:50,819 --> 02:06:55,799
even possible you know I'm not quite

2993
02:06:53,158 --> 02:06:59,339
sure because I think it the way we

2994
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:01,139
remember things uh everything uh from a

2995
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:03,659
certain point in time is kind of special

2996
02:07:01,139 --> 02:07:05,880
a lot of people remember uh you know or

2997
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:07,859
never get over talking about their high

2998
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:10,199
school years I have certain friends that

2999
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:12,000
every single time I talk to them they

3000
02:07:10,198 --> 02:07:14,399
want to talk about the high school years

3001
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,439
and stuff you know the Golden Age was

3002
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:19,079
that weed that good

3003
02:07:16,439 --> 02:07:21,299
or was it I just wasn't used to weed

3004
02:07:19,079 --> 02:07:23,939
that good and that was a special time in

3005
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:25,679
my life it's something I'm never going

3006
02:07:23,939 --> 02:07:28,738
to be quite sure on

3007
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:32,099
yeah it's interesting I think that

3008
02:07:28,738 --> 02:07:34,738
tolerance definitely plays some part in

3009
02:07:32,099 --> 02:07:37,560
it all having taken a few tolerance

3010
02:07:34,738 --> 02:07:40,319
breaks over the past year or so

3011
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:43,020
when I come back it's a different sort

3012
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:45,359
of high like you you can get to this

3013
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:48,060
point where you just you can't like you

3014
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:50,039
you you're almost like useless like you

3015
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:51,659
just debilitated it's interesting but

3016
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:53,880
the tolerance comes back reasonably

3017
02:07:51,658 --> 02:07:56,279
quickly I've found but I think you can

3018
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:57,900
probably make something better but

3019
02:07:56,279 --> 02:07:59,579
I don't know I feel like when I'm

3020
02:07:57,899 --> 02:08:02,279
smoking good weed after a tolerance

3021
02:07:59,579 --> 02:08:04,139
break it's hard to tell it's super good

3022
02:08:02,279 --> 02:08:06,238
because it's just like any weed would

3023
02:08:04,139 --> 02:08:09,359
get me super high

3024
02:08:06,238 --> 02:08:11,879
yeah and back then in the 90s we were

3025
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:14,158
smoking a lot of Swag and you know

3026
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:16,139
sometimes the the kill would come around

3027
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:19,618
and when we were smoking Mexican

3028
02:08:16,139 --> 02:08:21,359
brickweed that was a year old you know

3029
02:08:19,618 --> 02:08:22,460
yeah I mean God it would make a

3030
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:25,559
difference then

3031
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:28,380
yeah I mean like if I could take some of

3032
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:31,139
this uh killer funeral brood X I found

3033
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:33,420
and I took back that you know to the 90s

3034
02:08:31,139 --> 02:08:35,579
you know I think it would be just as

3035
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:37,859
good it just might be you know how I

3036
02:08:35,579 --> 02:08:39,779
remember stuff from my youth and not

3037
02:08:37,859 --> 02:08:40,738
having that high quality of weed back

3038
02:08:39,779 --> 02:08:44,399
then

3039
02:08:40,738 --> 02:08:46,678
yeah okay interesting well I mean it

3040
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:49,319
raises the idea you know you've got that

3041
02:08:46,679 --> 02:08:52,739
female of The Brood X would you ever

3042
02:08:49,319 --> 02:08:55,079
consider doing feminized seeds and like

3043
02:08:52,738 --> 02:08:56,698
just using that female of The Brood X

3044
02:08:55,079 --> 02:08:58,260
you've already found that is what you

3045
02:08:56,698 --> 02:08:59,939
want and just crossing stuff to the

3046
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:01,860
female and as a general question would

3047
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:02,819
crickets and cicada ever do feminized

3048
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:06,000
seeds

3049
02:09:02,819 --> 02:09:08,579
so um that funeral is really good and if

3050
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,158
I you know have stuff like that I might

3051
02:09:08,579 --> 02:09:15,000
do it you know especially if people want

3052
02:09:11,158 --> 02:09:17,000
feminized seeds from a line of mine I

3053
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,579
just don't have much desire to go around

3054
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:22,380
feminizing uh you know Elite clones you

3055
02:09:20,579 --> 02:09:24,359
know maybe if it's something we've

3056
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:26,520
isolated after you know several

3057
02:09:24,359 --> 02:09:28,618
generations of our own work that would

3058
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:31,920
make more sense to me but

3059
02:09:28,618 --> 02:09:34,799
yeah interesting I think that there's a

3060
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:36,960
lot of people who are so interested in

3061
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,960
all of the elite clones you've got in

3062
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:41,579
your library that they sort of are

3063
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:44,279
begging the question you know would you

3064
02:09:41,579 --> 02:09:46,618
ever do s1s of the red Lebanese hash

3065
02:09:44,279 --> 02:09:48,840
plan of these really rare cuts the

3066
02:09:46,618 --> 02:09:51,179
purple Hindu Kush

3067
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:54,119
um or is that less interesting to you

3068
02:09:51,179 --> 02:09:57,539
than doing our crosses with them

3069
02:09:54,118 --> 02:09:59,698
it's uh definitely less interesting uh

3070
02:09:57,539 --> 02:10:02,519
the most interesting is to try to get

3071
02:09:59,698 --> 02:10:05,939
those clones in the seed form using his

3072
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:08,639
uh pure Afghani crosses that are similar

3073
02:10:05,939 --> 02:10:11,098
as possible and uh did bring them to the

3074
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:14,039
market in seed form that's the most

3075
02:10:11,099 --> 02:10:16,199
exciting to me I definitely see value in

3076
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:18,840
S1 in them and getting that out to the

3077
02:10:16,198 --> 02:10:21,658
public I just I it's not what I'm gonna

3078
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:24,239
devote my time to right now

3079
02:10:21,658 --> 02:10:26,158
yeah understandable well there you go at

3080
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:28,198
least I mean at least it's a it's

3081
02:10:26,158 --> 02:10:30,179
possibility on the horizon if you ever

3082
02:10:28,198 --> 02:10:32,579
wanted to pursue it further

3083
02:10:30,179 --> 02:10:35,520
I wanted to quickly ask you about one of

3084
02:10:32,579 --> 02:10:37,198
your new strains kind bud cool name it's

3085
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:39,060
kind of surprising it hasn't been taken

3086
02:10:37,198 --> 02:10:41,399
thus far but it's generated a lot of

3087
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:43,320
interest particularly I think because of

3088
02:10:41,399 --> 02:10:47,399
the Maui dog as one of the parents but

3089
02:10:43,319 --> 02:10:49,738
also the photos been looking killer what

3090
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:52,019
is the flavors and traits people can

3091
02:10:49,738 --> 02:10:53,759
expect from the kind bud and the sort of

3092
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:57,300
effect

3093
02:10:53,760 --> 02:11:00,000
man that stuff is really really good

3094
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:02,099
and it's got a really really awesome

3095
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,020
high it's got that's the reason we went

3096
02:11:02,099 --> 02:11:06,960
with kind but it's Gotta really just

3097
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:11,099
makes you feel uh happy it's got that

3098
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:14,279
old school 90s weed Vibe the Maui dog is

3099
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:16,340
uh chem 91 back seat most likely an S1

3100
02:11:14,279 --> 02:11:19,500
really nice

3101
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:22,260
campfinos in there it's a it's a good

3102
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:24,599
one man it you know it's something that

3103
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:27,000
I'd be happy smoking on all day long

3104
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:29,819
every day that's uh one of Hannibal's

3105
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,679
favorites lately she's been smoking that

3106
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:33,359
a lot we didn't see any plants that

3107
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:36,920
weren't really really good they were all

3108
02:11:33,359 --> 02:11:40,460
really really good there a little bit

3109
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:42,840
picky and early veg not the strongest

3110
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,939
plants that probably comes back to it

3111
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:48,119
going back to chem 91 possibly three

3112
02:11:44,939 --> 02:11:49,799
times in two generations it really uh as

3113
02:11:48,118 --> 02:11:52,920
they get bigger they get stronger and

3114
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:55,139
really uh turns into high quality weed

3115
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:59,279
and if you flour them out right because

3116
02:11:55,139 --> 02:12:02,579
about 65 days maybe a little longer a

3117
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:06,118
little shorter depending upon the female

3118
02:12:02,579 --> 02:12:08,279
awesome stuff do you favor the shorter

3119
02:12:06,118 --> 02:12:12,000
flowering fingers the longer ones or do

3120
02:12:08,279 --> 02:12:13,618
you think it's sort of independently a

3121
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
variable of the keeper if you know it

3122
02:12:13,618 --> 02:12:16,500
could be a longer it could be a short

3123
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:19,560
there's another trait you sort of look

3124
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:21,840
for as the one you decided is the keeper

3125
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:25,020
man there's some really killer stuff in

3126
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:27,000
there I haven't really looked through as

3127
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:28,619
large of a population that's I would

3128
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,960
like and at some point I will be looking

3129
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:32,880
through more of those because they're of

3130
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:35,760
such high quality I think the best

3131
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:36,719
females in that are just really a lot

3132
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:40,260
like

3133
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:41,760
can lead you know like the 91 chem not

3134
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:44,579
the chemd they're they're turning out

3135
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:47,219
like the 91 and um if you get a pack of

3136
02:12:44,579 --> 02:12:48,979
that definitely keep Cuts that's what I

3137
02:12:47,219 --> 02:12:53,158
would say about that one

3138
02:12:48,979 --> 02:12:55,618
nice so something a few people had asked

3139
02:12:53,158 --> 02:12:57,839
me to get in this episode was do you

3140
02:12:55,618 --> 02:12:59,639
have any plans to do any collaborations

3141
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,639
in the future

3142
02:12:59,639 --> 02:13:04,980
no plans in the immediate future

3143
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:07,440
too much on the cards already

3144
02:13:04,979 --> 02:13:08,339
I'm pretty busy and I like to Stand My

3145
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:11,098
Own Lane

3146
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:13,679
yeah okay so we're not gonna see the uh

3147
02:13:11,099 --> 02:13:15,539
crickets and cicada cookies collab

3148
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:18,179
oh I don't think me and Jake are gonna

3149
02:13:15,539 --> 02:13:21,060
have a collab anytime soon Duke and I

3150
02:13:18,179 --> 02:13:23,039
have talked about it in the past I uh

3151
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:25,260
jokingly said let's hit the floor away

3152
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:28,380
with your skunk mail and hit the

3153
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:31,380
Virginia Beach Afghani with the M10 oh

3154
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:33,859
yeah and he said we'd start way too many

3155
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:36,420
seat bombs with that one

3156
02:13:33,859 --> 02:13:39,238
I've always heard the rumor that the

3157
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:41,699
Virginia Beach Afghani is um tan Afghani

3158
02:13:39,238 --> 02:13:43,678
one I think it is I've had similar

3159
02:13:41,698 --> 02:13:46,138
Afghani one that reminded me of the

3160
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:49,319
Virginia Beach one yeah they remind me

3161
02:13:46,139 --> 02:13:52,020
of each other too so interesting stuff

3162
02:13:49,319 --> 02:13:53,759
okay and then last question I wanted to

3163
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:57,239
ask you before we get into the final

3164
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:59,699
five is are there any Old World cuts or

3165
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:01,259
land races that you've got your eye on

3166
02:13:59,698 --> 02:14:04,019
you haven't been able to get yet but

3167
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:08,280
you'd love to get into your collection

3168
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:11,040
uh just more uh afghanian [ __ ] lines you

3169
02:14:08,279 --> 02:14:13,738
know I prefer uh Old Stock that's been

3170
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:16,139
sitting in somebody's film canister or

3171
02:14:13,738 --> 02:14:17,218
see a drawer that seems to be the best

3172
02:14:16,139 --> 02:14:19,500
ones

3173
02:14:17,219 --> 02:14:21,179
um they're hard to come up with I have a

3174
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:23,039
couple hundred seeds I got from a friend

3175
02:14:21,179 --> 02:14:25,679
here in Hubble County that he got from a

3176
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:28,139
friend that's uh best Afghani lines that

3177
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:30,239
this guy had ever seen and honestly I'm

3178
02:14:28,139 --> 02:14:32,819
scared to get into them because if they

3179
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:35,399
don't crack it's done if anybody knows

3180
02:14:32,819 --> 02:14:36,479
anything about tissue culturing seeds

3181
02:14:35,399 --> 02:14:40,019
hit me up

3182
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:42,779
well yes please anyone who's got some

3183
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:46,260
info on tissue culture please reach out

3184
02:14:42,779 --> 02:14:48,479
that'd be incredible all right on to the

3185
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:50,760
final quickfire questions here's

3186
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:55,259
hopefully some new ones since we last

3187
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:57,060
spoke what's been the I wouldn't say the

3188
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:59,340
best but what's been some weed you've

3189
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:01,500
had in the last couple years that really

3190
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:02,940
blew you away with how good it was maybe

3191
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:04,800
you weren't expecting it to be

3192
02:15:02,939 --> 02:15:07,559
particularly good but just really hit

3193
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:09,659
the spot for you the Scentsy star cut

3194
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:10,920
that I used for The Brood X I got it

3195
02:15:09,658 --> 02:15:13,819
from JJ

3196
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:15,719
um he said I'd like it and he was right

3197
02:15:13,819 --> 02:15:19,078
and she's

3198
02:15:15,719 --> 02:15:21,658
super high quality and she passed those

3199
02:15:19,078 --> 02:15:24,059
qualities onto the brood X I'm extremely

3200
02:15:21,658 --> 02:15:26,519
happy with that I actually grew a bunch

3201
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:28,739
of the Scentsy star out with the brood X

3202
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:31,020
and I barely even touched the Scentsy

3203
02:15:28,738 --> 02:15:33,598
star The Brood X is so good

3204
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:35,219
some nice stuff I think I was lucky

3205
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:38,219
enough to try some of that when I was

3206
02:15:35,219 --> 02:15:40,439
with you and really nice stuff indeed so

3207
02:15:38,219 --> 02:15:42,899
on the other end of the spectrum what's

3208
02:15:40,439 --> 02:15:46,078
some weed that was really hyped up to

3209
02:15:42,899 --> 02:15:48,420
you by some friends or someone and

3210
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:50,578
eventually you try it and you were just

3211
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:53,578
like a bit disappointed

3212
02:15:50,578 --> 02:15:55,559
uh gelato was pretty hyped up but that

3213
02:15:53,578 --> 02:15:58,439
was a few years ago but I you know that

3214
02:15:55,560 --> 02:16:02,099
stuff never lived up to the hype to me

3215
02:15:58,439 --> 02:16:04,198
um that's about it that I can think of

3216
02:16:02,099 --> 02:16:06,779
good stuff for all the weed you must try

3217
02:16:04,198 --> 02:16:08,819
I guess that's not a bad list there so

3218
02:16:06,779 --> 02:16:10,979
all right if I'm gonna drop you off on a

3219
02:16:08,819 --> 02:16:12,960
deserted island and you can grow three

3220
02:16:10,979 --> 02:16:15,779
strains for the rest of your life which

3221
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:18,060
three are you gonna take with you are we

3222
02:16:15,779 --> 02:16:21,000
talking clones or we cannot take three

3223
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:23,099
of my seed lines yeah you could take uh

3224
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,920
three of your seedlines if you prefer or

3225
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:27,719
you can take clone I would take Lazy Dog

3226
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:30,239
and brood X

3227
02:16:27,719 --> 02:16:32,340
and Overkill

3228
02:16:30,238 --> 02:16:33,959
well you just think you'd be able to mix

3229
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:35,579
and match enough with those to get

3230
02:16:33,959 --> 02:16:38,098
everything you wanted

3231
02:16:35,579 --> 02:16:39,898
yeah I'll be able to bring everything I

3232
02:16:38,099 --> 02:16:42,898
wanted out of the gene pools the camera

3233
02:16:39,898 --> 02:16:45,959
Northern Lights that hash plant they're

3234
02:16:42,898 --> 02:16:47,638
all extremely potent the lazy dogs have

3235
02:16:45,959 --> 02:16:49,858
grown a bunch more of them now and I'm

3236
02:16:47,638 --> 02:16:52,199
planning on taking that line at F3 and

3237
02:16:49,859 --> 02:16:55,620
it's just really good smoke and The

3238
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:57,359
Brood X came out exceptional it just uh

3239
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:59,519
I'm really stoked with the way it's

3240
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:02,760
smoking out and it's super potent and

3241
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:04,620
the hardest part is finding one that you

3242
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:06,898
know is not a keeper

3243
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:11,099
yeah always a good challenge that one

3244
02:17:06,898 --> 02:17:13,319
when deciding what what yeah can't cave

3245
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:15,359
because there's too many good ones so on

3246
02:17:13,319 --> 02:17:17,039
the other end of the spectrum you're

3247
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:18,659
gonna drop someone off to this desert

3248
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:20,399
island too you're not particularly fond

3249
02:17:18,659 --> 02:17:22,200
of and you're going to leave them with

3250
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:23,939
three strains what three are you gonna

3251
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:25,700
leave them with

3252
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:29,340
[Laughter]

3253
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:32,579
oh man that's just ruthless

3254
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:34,799
we're gonna give them the gelato 33 and

3255
02:17:32,579 --> 02:17:35,459
the 41 and

3256
02:17:34,799 --> 02:17:38,459
um

3257
02:17:35,459 --> 02:17:42,239
uh what else are we gonna give them

3258
02:17:38,459 --> 02:17:45,239
runs for the same thing love it

3259
02:17:42,239 --> 02:17:45,239
exactly

3260
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:48,739
have fun with that gene pool

3261
02:17:48,978 --> 02:17:54,179
hey it made me think did you see that

3262
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,799
post from shabinski the other day where

3263
02:17:54,179 --> 02:17:59,460
he's like these are the original gelato

3264
02:17:55,799 --> 02:18:01,199
seeds no I didn't see that one he posted

3265
02:17:59,459 --> 02:18:04,500
a photo where there must have been like

3266
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:06,719
at least two 300 seeds in there I reckon

3267
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:08,459
and I was thinking there's no way those

3268
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:11,339
are the original seeds you would have

3269
02:18:08,459 --> 02:18:13,438
popped them already man yeah I don't

3270
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:16,079
know anything about that crew I just uh

3271
02:18:13,439 --> 02:18:18,540
have a lot of respect for uh how they

3272
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:20,280
marketed those strands and the way they

3273
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:22,260
changed the game with them that's that's

3274
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:24,780
what I gotta say about that one there

3275
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:26,219
you go all right well on to our last

3276
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:29,340
question

3277
02:18:26,218 --> 02:18:31,678
what's one aspect or thing about the

3278
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:33,898
industry or the community however you

3279
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:36,000
want to phrase it that you would change

3280
02:18:33,898 --> 02:18:37,799
if possible that you think would make a

3281
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,898
big difference

3282
02:18:37,799 --> 02:18:43,978
I would change legalization I would

3283
02:18:39,898 --> 02:18:47,279
change it to more legalization not just

3284
02:18:43,978 --> 02:18:49,858
corporate ramped up cannabis

3285
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:52,979
I think it should be free for everyone

3286
02:18:49,859 --> 02:18:56,399
to grow in every state as many plants as

3287
02:18:52,978 --> 02:18:58,019
they want to to give it away to anyone

3288
02:18:56,398 --> 02:19:00,358
to sell to anyone

3289
02:18:58,019 --> 02:19:01,559
that's what legal things should be you

3290
02:19:00,359 --> 02:19:03,899
know there's all this talk on Instagram

3291
02:19:01,558 --> 02:19:06,000
lately of all these big brands that want

3292
02:19:03,898 --> 02:19:07,699
to get rid of Home growth and these

3293
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:11,459
states that are becoming legal man

3294
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:14,519
that's exactly the thing that I would

3295
02:19:11,459 --> 02:19:19,138
get rid of in the industry hard to call

3296
02:19:14,519 --> 02:19:22,319
to Camp's community at this point

3297
02:19:19,138 --> 02:19:25,319
nice what an awesome sentiment

3298
02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:27,478

3299
02:19:25,319 --> 02:19:29,279
