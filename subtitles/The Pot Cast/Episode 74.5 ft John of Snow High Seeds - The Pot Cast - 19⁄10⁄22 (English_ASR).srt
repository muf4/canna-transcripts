so without further Ado let's get into it

100
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,939
[Music]

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,120
so you just referenced the uh the OG and

102
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,739
the Skywalker the I've heard rumors of a

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,599
few different Skywalkers going around

104
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,280
I've heard one that it's like just a

105
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,539
straight OG but I've heard that there's

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,239
another one that goes around that's

107
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,219
actually like the original one crossed

108
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,199
to Bubba or something like that and and

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,720
that's also called Skywalker and it's

110
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,160
very good do you know the one you're

111
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,080
fond of is that like the very

112
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,460
straightforward OG one or does it seem a

113
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,219
little different to you

114
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,478
well when when I was growing these and

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,479
breeding these this was like the height

116
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,339
of the doji Kush crazes you know

117
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,959
um as far as the medical clubs having

118
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,939
them so there's like the height of the

119
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,779
medical club scene

120
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:41,939
um

121
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,918
I have you know I got them before they

122
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,600
were like super popularized the

123
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,579
Skywalker also a lot of people thought

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,320
there was one done by like Barney's Farm

125
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,839
or something which is like blueberry and

126
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,579
something mazaro and blueberry that's

127
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:59,519
not Skywalker OG Skywalker it was just

128
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:01,079
meant as you know A high-flying og you

129
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,758
know that's why I was called Skywalker

130
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,339
not because it was part of like some

131
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,240
Dutch hybrid

132
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:11,339
um Skywalker and some of the ogs

133
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,319
um they're different than each other so

134
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,198
there's like the the triangle push out

135
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:19,439
of Florida there's uh OG Kush out of uh

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,600
Southern California there is the Tahoe

137
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,660
um they all look different so what what

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,220
is happened is these are all familiar

139
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,020
these are all strains that are very

140
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,479
familiar to each other because the

141
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,219
genetics are very similar but they are

142
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,019
definitely different they grow

143
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,639
differently they look differently and

144
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,519
they smoke differently but they have

145
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,139
similar character you know

146
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,538
characteristics

147
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,060
so a lot of the what people call OG

148
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,180
cushes are different lines that are

149
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,360
similar you know they are

150
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,360
Afghani Pakistani in lines with maybe uh

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,479
some tie-in involved in there it's hard

152
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,340
to say exactly but the Skywalker grows

153
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,478
and looks differently than the Tahoe

154
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:05,099
Tahoe looks similar to uh like pure kush

155
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,500
um

156
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,320
the San Fernando Valley looks similar to

157
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,639
Bubba but they're they're different

158
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,099
um

159
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,300
Master Kush looks similar to San

160
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,259
Fernando Valley and uh G13

161
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,060
um

162
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,520
but you know there's there's different

163
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,478
varieties that are very similar to each

164
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,579
other but they're definitely different

165
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,219
and the problem is a lot of stuff that

166
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,959
was popularized was from bag seed so a

167
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,600
lot of people got bag seed and they grew

168
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,519
those out as the strain and then that

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,660
was what most people got their hands on

170
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,339
and even with you know um bag seed the

171
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,539
plants will look different you know than

172
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,138
the mother you'll have different

173
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,759
variations or it came from a impromptu

174
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,879
fertilization of different lines that

175
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,220
were growing you know they it harmed on

176
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,959
another you know clone that they had and

177
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,259
then he has some like multi-poly hybrid

178
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,779
of a you know a cush variety

179
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,520
um so the the problem is there was no

180
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,198
real breeding done with a lot of these

181
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,839
varieties so you know it's hard to say

182
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,280
what it was what it was like that's why

183
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,379
I breed with certain

184
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,138
land race and heirloom lines so I create

185
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,240
lines that I know the you know the

186
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,460
pedigree otherwise a lot of people are

187
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,000
arguing like oh no that's my clone that

188
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,439
was my work it's all hearsay but

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,660
um you know and I don't want to fight

190
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,160
with people there's no point to it so if

191
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,000
you want to create something created

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,280
from original you know lines

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,079
um but you know there's there's it's

194
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,538
just at this point there's been so much

195
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,879
mix that they call

196
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,800
um you know OG Kush but OG Kush is

197
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,259
actually several different varieties

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,939
that have the same effects and same

199
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,280
looks and tastes

200
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,860
yeah that's a good point

201
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,258
I guess I'm wondering you know can we

202
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,300
expect to see you then work with any of

203
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,038
the other more sort of modern strands I

204
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,319
know you've done a cross with cookies

205
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,598
before but I haven't seen any runs or

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,460
gelato do you think you'll incorporate

207
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,839
more of the popular stuff or just stick

208
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,839
to the more old school

209
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,978
um I I could do the other lines where

210
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:13,379
I've always had like Girl Scout cookies

211
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:15,538
we we grew the first uh cutting

212
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,800
available at the time I call it panty

213
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,519
dropper

214
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,340
um

215
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,198
I didn't release the seeds much some

216
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,598
people got some packs but there's the uh

217
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,280
the panty dropper and the panty dropper

218
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,259
special edition

219
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,359
um

220
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,519
so uh yeah there it's Girl Scout cookies

221
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,278
with the uh

222
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,278
the two males that created the the true

223
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:41,099
gangster cush uh that's that's the panty

224
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,918
dropper and the special edition is uh

225
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,740
the panty dropper with the Hell's Angel

226
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,838
um line which is doji Kush with the true

227
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,799
gangster cush light

228
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,779
um

229
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,519
and those need to be Revisited and kind

230
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,458
of worked out because the instability of

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,959
the Girl Scout cookies was it was uh you

232
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:01,799
know

233
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,539
um driven poison in OG Kush with the

234
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,338
Cherry Pie and there was some backseat

235
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,519
issues you know it was created from

236
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:10,980
hermaphroa it did A reproduction and so

237
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,860
instead unstable to begin with then

238
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,139
that's not kind of great for you know

239
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,820
creating lines from

240
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,080
um you need a stabilized line and then

241
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,740
release it

242
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,440
um

243
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,419
if I'm going to use a cutting I'm going

244
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,500
to grow it out and then see if it's

245
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:27,419
worth

246
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,419
you know the trouble like the Pink

247
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:32,879
Panther was kind of a

248
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,500
unstable line but trying to breed with

249
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,600
it to stabilize it some for the

250
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,019
qualities that it had was worth the time

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,080
because it uh produced some medicinal

252
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:45,480
um get smokable flowers you know the

253
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,800
flowers turn purple and red and had a

254
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,278
beautiful

255
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,559
um grape liqueur uh smell and taste so

256
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,600
it's like a grape oat ji Kush but it

257
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,579
grew better and yielded better but it

258
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,278
also has some CBD to it so it had some

259
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,180
medicinal qualities that were similar to

260
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,059
um

261
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:05,519
the anti-seizure CBD strain called

262
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:08,399
Charlotte's Web it had the same ratio of

263
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,320
like three to one CBD so it was

264
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,299
medicinal at the same time

265
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,360
um

266
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:17,699
yeah so yeah there may be some uh in the

267
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,039
future some of the modern stuff but why

268
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,300
everybody else is doing that you don't

269
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,919
need another person doing it unless

270
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:23,759
there's going to be

271
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,799
um

272
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,080
you know an increase to the line I'm

273
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,059
going to improve it in some way like

274
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,440
with uh the East Coast Sour Diesel there

275
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,679
were so many sour diesels on the west

276
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,839
coast that there were [ __ ] to grow they

277
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,239
weren't worth growing because they

278
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,680
didn't have the Full Flavor Of The Sour

279
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,100
Diesel you know they didn't have the the

280
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,439
sourness the the smell the taste Aroma

281
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,899
but they were Sour Diesel ish and that

282
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,860
was what was going around as clones for

283
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:55,320
sour diesel so it wasn't worth growing

284
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,480
it yielded well but you know it didn't

285
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,278
it wasn't Sour Diesel like it should be

286
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,420
the East Coast Sarah diesel clone was

287
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,000
tired

288
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,919
um it didn't yield well or root well

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,159
um but had the smell flavors of the

290
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:11,039
great perfect high so basically I wanted

291
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,419
to work with something Fresh So I self

292
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,078
did

293
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:16,019
um

294
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,639
and then I created a couple females from

295
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,740
that picked the best one the first

296
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,360
generation with the Neville's Hayes

297
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,980
purple time male

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,360
um you know they're 50 50 sometimes

299
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,459
they're they're there's some good

300
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,680
females and some of them are kind of you

301
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,879
know not so good so I had to pick the

302
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,319
best

303
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,078
um plants from that first generation

304
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,959
into the f2s and f2s is what I released

305
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,179
as the West Coast Purple Diesel so you

306
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,619
get those you know qualities the East

307
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,379
Coast are these are what those good

308
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,078
traits of smell the sourness uh that

309
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:49,379
fantastic high resin production Aroma

310
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,479
but with good rooting big plants big

311
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,759
buds it's everything you'd want from

312
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,220
what was supposed to be Sour Diesel but

313
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,980
without the problems not to say that

314
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,778
recessives won't pop up but you're going

315
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,100
to have a more stable line which will

316
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,860
give you all the characteristics that

317
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,060
you love from Sarah diesel and that

318
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,860
would be the only reason to kind of

319
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,379
revisit some of these lines that are

320
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,800
popping with people

321
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:16,500
yeah interesting are you in General open

322
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,539
to like s-wining old clones and just

323
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,019
sort of trying to revitalize them like

324
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,599
that I know that CSI no okay yeah good

325
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,480
tell us more no no I I don't I don't

326
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,100
like uh selfie anything because it

327
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,440
if you're gonna sell something it should

328
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,079
be true breeding because if it's not

329
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,240
you're going to be inviting problems if

330
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,699
you're selfing or you know feminizing

331
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,680
plants that aren't stable when you grow

332
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,019
them out you can have all kinds of

333
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,819
issues they're not going to be exact

334
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,339
replicas they're going to be all over

335
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,240
the place and that's the issue

336
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,680
um

337
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,139
you know if you're going to do that

338
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,578
might as well just make you know regular

339
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,560
seeds

340
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:58,458
um because you're gonna invite

341
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,500
instability and um

342
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:03,299
intersects traits into a plant which is

343
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,039
unstable to begin with and then you're

344
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,659
going to be having people that aren't

345
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,120
expert Growers

346
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,439
um that are stressing out the plants

347
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,578
creating more plants from the the

348
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,920
intersex traits that are gonna

349
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:16,739
invariably pop up from these unstable

350
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,659
plants and it's just a mess that I don't

351
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,459
care to get into unless I'm trying to

352
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,659
save a plant

353
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,239
um you know if there's only like one

354
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,458
plant then there's ways of you know

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,440
selfing them going to those lines

356
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,078
finding the males and females from the

357
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,519
selfing process and then slowly breeding

358
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,699
towards something that is stable from

359
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,360
that you know uh selfie of that line

360
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,100
that's you know lost or uh extinct you

361
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,339
know if there's only one plant left and

362
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,420
I'll come into that problem where I had

363
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,399
only

364
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,500
um you know a few plants and then those

365
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,179
plants that were with it that were the

366
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,179
same line died I only have one plant

367
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,799
left and then I had to breed uh similar

368
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,659
plants like the Acapulco Gold Line I

369
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,179
bred which was two different Acapulco

370
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:03,120
gold mines but I could have self them

371
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,739
and then you know hopes for males to

372
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,419
breed with the females to eventually

373
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,759
make them more stable ions so in that in

374
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,039
those cases I am uh I think selfing it

375
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,799
has this place and then for tired lines

376
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,539
uh like there was uh a string called

377
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,419
Afghanistan it was grown for like 30

378
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,099
years from Kansas

379
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,139
um you know when you breed with that

380
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,759
line you make seed

381
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,579
um the seeds don't last as long because

382
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,740
they're from a tired old clone

383
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:30,838
um and the viability of those seeds is

384
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,120
even shorter so

385
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,920
um you know creating an S1 of that and

386
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,600
then breeding would might be the the way

387
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,299
to do it but creating you know growing

388
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,159
from that old clone uh these clones are

389
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,620
just replicas you know copies of copies

390
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,198
of copies you take a copier and take a

391
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,278
picture it gets blurrier blurrier uh

392
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,819
same thing happens with these clothes

393
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,198
they're just not the same as it once was

394
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,180
um and they need to be refreshed once in

395
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,698
a while they need to grow from a new

396
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:59,939
seed and be refreshed otherwise they're

397
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:02,939
just very tired old seeds or old seed

398
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,100
lines and there's issues to them

399
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,639
yeah that's a great point and we've had

400
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,740
guests in the past say that one way just

401
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,839
speculated that um you might be able to

402
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,698
sort of revitalize these plants is to

403
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,100
let them veg Under the Sun if they're

404
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,379
indoor plants at all I guess given your

405
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,720
library with so many old school clones

406
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,578
what do you do to maintain those old

407
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,959
mothers and is there any special tips

408
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:26,958
like the sunlight one you have

409
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,179
um well it depends on where you live so

410
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,338
if you're

411
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,659
um you know far enough South you can

412
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,880
actually grow plants all year round

413
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:37,740
Outdoors

414
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,600
um depending on your environment or with

415
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,278
the help of a greenhouse to extend your

416
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,740
growing season you just need to use a

417
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,620
little nitrogen to kind of put them back

418
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,320
into veg chemically and then

419
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:54,299
um leaving enough growth on them to

420
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:56,699
you know maintain growth until the um

421
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,319
the sun is into a place where it starts

422
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:59,039
vegging again

423
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,220
um

424
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,539
so you I've had plants growing Outdoors

425
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,000
uh one of them is chocolate time I've

426
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,958
ran for three years Outdoors but I've

427
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
had

428
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,638
uh what was it I had another one that

429
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,860
went for seven years

430
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,180
um and just kept growing It Outdoors

431
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,560
um you know to see how long I can grow

432
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,159
it

433
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,899
um

434
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,219
and that happens like in Nepal you get

435
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,500
these plants that have been growing for

436
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,839
decades and they get to be you know

437
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,419
three four stories above the house you

438
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,160
know in Nepal and these huge plants and

439
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,039
that doesn't just happen over like one

440
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,899
year it happens over you know years and

441
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,159
years of it growing

442
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,139
um

443
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,899
but

444
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,220
as far as maintaining the plants uh it's

445
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,759
hard to keep a library of all these

446
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,459
different plants so um I think that you

447
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,620
should make a line that is

448
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,719
um strong with males and females so you

449
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,980
can preserve the line of seeds and then

450
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,199
that way you don't have to keep clones

451
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,240
of it you can keep the special plants

452
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,559
but it's really difficult to keep a

453
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,659
library of you know all these different

454
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,859
plants it's just too much stress and if

455
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,678
you have health conditions like myself

456
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,419
it's almost impossible to do because you

457
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,419
might have days or weeks where you're

458
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,759
not able to tend to the plants so you

459
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,439
know things happen you know as far as

460
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,660
dust plants and you don't have anybody

461
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,540
attend to them so

462
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,839
um the other thing is is micro micro

463
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:23,938
propagation doing like in vitro tissue

464
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,558
culture more people should try to get

465
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,600
into that where they can maintain things

466
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,480
with uh you know a little plantlet a

467
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,279
little stem and maintain plants that way

468
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,259
and I think that that'd be a good way

469
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,079
moving forward for people to have large

470
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,538
collections in a smaller place

471
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,220
um you know to be able to maintain those

472
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:44,160
things you know

473
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,679
um seed oil seeds will be able to be

474
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,779
um germinated a lot easier with those

475
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,019
type of methods as well so you know

476
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:54,839
trying to get lost seeds seed lines that

477
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:58,220
aren't able to germ any other way is to

478
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,220
you know propagate them that way

479
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:03,599
wow that sounds like some cool stuff I

480
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,860
know a lot of people have been chasing

481
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,319
the um

482
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:10,019
what is it the artificial embryo sort of

483
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:13,019
for well and truly sort of dead seeds

484
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,480
but in your personal Library what are

485
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:17,099
the oldest seeds you have and what are

486
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,640
some that you're sort of keen to look

487
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:23,339
into that get you excited

488
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,500
oh man I have seeds that are back from

489
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,279
the 60s

490
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,720
um

491
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,399
60s 70s 80s 90s

492
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,120
I have a bunch from different periods of

493
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,019
time

494
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,538
um

495
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:38,279
yeah I have old Acapulco Golds I have

496
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:40,140
old Panama Reds

497
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,899
um you know those and I've got a bunch

498
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,780
of other old Mexicans that are just

499
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,220
you know who knows how old they are uh

500
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,019
but

501
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,019
um they need special

502
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:54,240
um you know propagation methods

503
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,918
um yeah there's a lot more and it's not

504
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,259
telling you everything but there's a lot

505
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,200
of cool stuff that would be great to

506
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,298
revive and um you know I'm working on

507
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,700
methods to try to

508
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:08,099
um revive those old lines so that we

509
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,100
could all enjoy them again but basically

510
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,480
they're extinct to this point until the

511
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,959
method is

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,319
made better to attempt to bring those

513
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,298
back so the processor it's it's a work

514
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,859
in progress at the moment but I've been

515
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:25,079
able to work on Old seeds I've been able

516
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,159
to germinate you know 30 30 plus old

517
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,298
seeds

518
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,700
um so that's

519
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,379
you know that's not an easy thing 10

520
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,058
year old 20 year old see it's not a

521
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,400
problem that's kind of

522
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:38,160
you know typical

523
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,780
wow that's really impressive I think a

524
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,720
lot of people are finding it's

525
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,819
definitely becoming more challenging to

526
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,259
to pop seeds that are getting older do

527
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,720
you have any tips for people who are

528
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,400
trying to pop some old seeds there's

529
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,140
another method too the seeds that were

530
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,960
created from organic methods meaning

531
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,580
they were like sun grown seem to last a

532
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,259
lot longer than seeds that were

533
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,720
chemically made like with chemicals

534
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,000
indoors a lot of people find viability

535
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,100
of like seeds that were created indoors

536
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,579
usually like chemicals but only lasts a

537
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,579
couple of years

538
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,179
um you know with sun-grown seeds you can

539
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,558
grow them six to ten years no issues and

540
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,179
if they've been stored well they can

541
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,038
even grow them you know keep them for

542
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,460
longer periods of time

543
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,099
um for germinating seeds for old seeds

544
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,840
um

545
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:27,719
it's sterile methods

546
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,519
um same thing as like the scarification

547
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,079
um you can use there's lots of different

548
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,339
methods some of them might work some of

549
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,798
them might not but the only thing that

550
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:38,038
kind of pushes things past now dormancy

551
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,500
is um gerbilic acids but the problem

552
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,599
with gerbilic acids is uh that if you

553
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,279
use too little it does nothing if you

554
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,779
use too much you end up killing the

555
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,460
seeds

556
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,839
um and if you find the right amount

557
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,400
you're still dealing with like

558
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:55,859
elongation like long you know

559
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Sprouts in issues that way which you

560
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,359
know if you got an old CD that's no big

561
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,900
issue but it's hard to find the right

562
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,699
ratio to germinate seeds that way but if

563
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,140
you only got a couple seeds you could

564
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,360
end up killing the seeds so it's almost

565
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,020
not worth it but I'd say

566
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,759
um

567
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,099
softening the seeds with like a

568
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,480
disinfectant like hydrogen peroxide 50

569
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,159
50.

570
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,339
um and then pulling off the seed coat

571
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,860
after uh two to three days uh taking the

572
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,959
embryo and then doing in vitro would

573
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,000
probably be the best method after you've

574
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,919
um you know disinfected it

575
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,500
um and then you need a certain augers

576
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,860
and hormones to be able to uh

577
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,119
you know germinate those seeds in auger

578
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,619
solution like you would for tissue

579
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,979
culture

580
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:45,119
yeah wow brilliant very high tech answer

581
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,620
I love it I love it so in general this

582
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,819
is a bit of a curveball one but I

583
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,158
thought you'd have a probably a good

584
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,439
take on it what's like the most wildly

585
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,480
unexpected results you got from popping

586
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,900
like a land race or like an heirloom

587
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,599
sort of line just really left the field

588
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,340
hmm

589
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,579
I found I've popped seeds that had like

590
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:07,259
double embryos like it was uh two plants

591
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:10,279
in one seed

592
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,279
that was kind of cool

593
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:12,678
um

594
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,658
you know like getting two different uh

595
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,678
germination Sprouts out of one embryo

596
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,120
seed

597
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,700
um you know

598
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,219
um oh yeah usually one is weaker than

599
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,960
the other you know but uh

600
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,000
it'd be interesting to see how those

601
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,980
would turn out you know from beginning

602
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,019
to end if you know one was more potent

603
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,659
if one had certain traits or if one was

604
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,960
more female and the other one's male

605
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:44,340
I've had like a loud strain which

606
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,340
um it topped itself and then on one side

607
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:50,339
of the plant which is what had one one

608
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:52,980
root but it basically went up and

609
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:55,379
snapped in half and then one side

610
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,000
was all female with female flowers and

611
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,799
then the other side was male so it was

612
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,140
like a monacus plant

613
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,779
on one plant

614
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,880
so it was you know one sex on the other

615
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,678
it wasn't an intersex but it was male

616
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,020
and female on the same plant you know

617
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,720
self-pollinating itself so I found that

618
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:16,319
to be cool yeah wow that's that's really

619
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,000
neat but as far as germination processes

620
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,399
um you know I don't know there's nothing

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,159
real special about germination it's

622
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,380
you know

623
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,539
uh I like to pull them off and you know

624
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,000
I use like a pinching motion to kind of

625
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:32,759
pinch off the the films

626
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,200
um off the uh the embryos so once you

627
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,819
pull off the seed shell there's a

628
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,620
there's a film which you can kind of

629
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:39,599
pinch off

630
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,339
um and then you know it basically comes

631
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,259
out you know you have the little Sprout

632
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,359
like a little embryo Sprout I'd say

633
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,099
don't be scared of that a lot of more

634
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,019
people should be popping their seeds and

635
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,980
removing the seed shells because you can

636
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:54,298
get a higher percentage to um germinate

637
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,919
once you've

638
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:58,679
um you know removed the shell the

639
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,240
problem is it's kind of a you know it

640
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,059
sometimes you end up squishing them or

641
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,819
destroying them but if you don't if you

642
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:07,259
wait too long more than like three days

643
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:10,259
the embryo will become too soft anyway

644
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:12,000
and it'll just you know mold or squish

645
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,798
very easily so you got to do it within

646
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,480
the two to three day period there's a

647
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:19,440
small window which you can actually move

648
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:23,460
them and you know they'll hold together

649
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,759
um but sewing those in a sterilized uh

650
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,679
soil will improve germination

651
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,839
um so you you'll get maybe you know a

652
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,820
few more plants and sometimes you get

653
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,519
all your plants germinating if you

654
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,859
didn't you'd only get a few sometimes

655
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,599
um so I'd say people should practice on

656
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,359
seeds

657
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,980
um that aren't as valuable to them and

658
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,839
you know practice removing the seed

659
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,298
shell and then removing the film and

660
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,759
then sewing those seeds I think that's

661
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:52,259
something that people should do

662
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,519
um for all their seeds after a few days

663
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,279
otherwise they're going to rot in the

664
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,099
soil or dry up

665
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,839
um yeah and I think digging up the seeds

666
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:03,599
if so if you sow the seeds directly in

667
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,359
soil you should also dig them up after

668
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,759
uh two to three days and do the same

669
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,740
clean them off remove the seed shell

670
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:14,279
remove the film and then sew them back

671
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,200
into the same spot they were or in fresh

672
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,798
soils because sometimes if they're the

673
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,538
soil is too moist uh that you'll need to

674
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,940
um

675
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,500
um you know provide another sterilized

676
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,580
soil the other thing is providing little

677
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:32,519
fans over uh the uh germinating places

678
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:35,339
so if you have uh seeds in like a

679
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,200
starter tray or in beer cups you should

680
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,000
have a little fan providing circulation

681
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,220
over them so it kind of dries them out

682
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,558
otherwise the heat from the the lights

683
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,940
or the sun and the the moisture in the

684
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,740
soil will cause molding which will cause

685
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,840
a damp off which will kill the plants or

686
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,819
the seeds and seedlings so having a

687
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,418
little a good air circulation is very

688
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:56,158
important for germinating seeds a lot of

689
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,380
people don't do that and then their

690
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,679
seeds die and then they you know blame

691
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,659
the breeder

692
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,400
yeah definitely look I agree that people

693
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:08,400
need to learn to become their own little

694
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,900
seed surgeons I lock yourself save the

695
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,640
number of seeds that probably wouldn't

696
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,980
have made it otherwise but I mean while

697
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,600
we're on the topic of saving plants I

698
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,058
wanted to know what's the oldest plant

699
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,740
you've managed to save and hang on to do

700
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:21,599
you have like a super like 30 year old

701
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,640
cutting what do you got

702
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,538
no I don't

703
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,460
um

704
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:29,339
I've had old cuttings given to me by

705
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,558
other people but I typically like to

706
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,500
preserve a line in seed form because

707
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,339
it's easier to store and travel with

708
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,679
um

709
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:39,899
because it's just too much energy to

710
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,419
maintain clones for years and years and

711
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,500
years uh there should be a reason you

712
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,538
know unless it's something special that

713
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,058
you want to keep around

714
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:50,400
um majority of stuff I like to to

715
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:52,798
preserve in seed form just because uh

716
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,860
you know if something happens you've got

717
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,418
to back up that way uh otherwise you've

718
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,339
got to spread those clones out to

719
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,840
friends if you don't give out your your

720
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,558
clones to friends then you lose that

721
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,959
line

722
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:07,980
uh just like I lost the chocolate pie um

723
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,319
during my my aunt's passing of cancer

724
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,120
um if I had been able to pass it out to

725
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,579
people I would have been able to

726
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:17,158
possibly get that back so sharing is

727
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:19,619
actually a good way of keeping the

728
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,080
genetics and even be able to get it back

729
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,239
at some point

730
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,519
yeah certainly I've learned that myself

731
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,700
in the past unless you shared out there

732
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,200
you risk losing it so some Sage advice

733
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,700
there and while we're on the topic one

734
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,980
of the fan submitted questions we got

735
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,140
said please ask snow hi to talk about

736
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,000
doubles chocolate Thai and the Golden

737
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,559
Dragon

738
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,778
Golden Dragon

739
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,839
I don't know any about any Golden Dragon

740
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:48,679
uh oh uh gold dragon my strain I guess

741
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,678
yeah

742
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
the the dro Dro is is my friend's

743
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:57,199
um name backwards

744
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,659
so it's his name backwards

745
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,240
yeah yeah Howard yep yeah Howard so uh

746
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,460
Howard is you want my uh my wedding uh

747
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,259
he's a good friend of mine so Howard the

748
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,600
these came from chocolate tie these came

749
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,740
from chocolate tie sticks

750
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,259
um

751
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,980
so what people don't realize is it

752
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,538
chocolate type was named by the sellers

753
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,980
so here it looks like you know what

754
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,379
people have is chocolate Thai he's got

755
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,120
the uh I still have some of that uh

756
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,100
chocolate's High stick left too I need

757
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,739
to pull it out and smoke it

758
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,899
um but it's got a Musky Aroma tastes

759
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,460
like tobacco and chocolate

760
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,740
um it's got a euphoric effect a body

761
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,298
effect but it also has the Thai soaring

762
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,120
effects so it's

763
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,740
um kind of like a punto Colombian Punta

764
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,558
Rojo but it's like the Thai equivalent

765
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,000
you know it's got the the body effects

766
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,700
so

767
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,339
I had theorized that the chocolate tie

768
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,679
has was a lowland variety

769
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,019
um because it's got like um Indica

770
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,480
characteristics but it's not an Indica

771
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,819
um so it's got a chunky larger flowering

772
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,440
uh bigger buds

773
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,899
um

774
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,538
it's got the characteristics of you know

775
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,278
muskiness uh like a purple tie there's

776
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,839
also purple typhenos in it but it's not

777
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,220
as common

778
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,339
um

779
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,000
so uh that chocolate tie was from

780
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:20,099
chocolate Thai sticks and um it should

781
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,500
be grown out in

782
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,839
um larger selections done on it but it's

783
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,398
been a conservation of a chocolate Thai

784
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,619
stick wine

785
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,558
um and it is a great and super potent

786
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,939
line it may not look like much growing

787
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,220
that's the problem a lot of people have

788
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,640
is like they expect this narrow Leaf

789
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,740
Highland tie looking plant and it

790
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,899
doesn't grow like that and especially

791
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,960
when it's in veg

792
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:48,178
um because with a lot of sativas and

793
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,058
tropicals and equatorial plants

794
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,220
um the leaves are solar panels they in

795
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:56,220
veg they are trying to produce stem and

796
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,220
growing the plant structure so when it

797
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,899
flowers and starts to flower the solar

798
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,360
panels the leaves will go from like

799
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:06,119
seven to five to three to two to one

800
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,079
well three to one typically not two to

801
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,819
one but

802
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,220
um basically the the C the the leaves

803
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:13,619
will narrow so they'll get narrow and

804
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,980
they'll be less leaves and production

805
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:19,199
will go to producing cannabinoids resins

806
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,860
um turpins that type of thing and less

807
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,580
growth of the flowers and stem is done

808
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:28,678
in that period of of growth so people

809
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:30,240
don't realize that when they see these

810
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,820
plants in veg they'll have broader

811
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,159
leaves because the plant is creating you

812
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:38,220
know its roots and structure you know

813
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,980
it's not it's not yet producing the

814
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,819
flowers so as it flowers then they thin

815
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,798
out

816
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:45,178
um some of them are naturally thinner

817
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:46,558
than others some varieties like the

818
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,640
Highland varieties will have thinner

819
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,678
leaves but there's so many different

820
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,299
varieties of leaves

821
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,980
um you know some of them are super long

822
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:56,639
like um

823
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,839
like a eucalyptus or a weeping willow

824
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,179
um you know or long banana leaves

825
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,619
they'll be thick and long or they'll be

826
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,019
really thin and long

827
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,359
um but people have this thing in their

828
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,879
mind that these Thai varieties are very

829
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,398
narrowly thin

830
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,260
um and not there is some like that but

831
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:15,839
they're not all like that and they come

832
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,740
in different sizes and shapes

833
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,379
um

834
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,359
so that that is a chocolate tie line

835
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,760
derived from seeds from imported

836
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,979
chocolate High sticks that's the dro

837
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:29,099
chocolate tie and it's very potent it's

838
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,599
got a euphoric high it's colorful it's a

839
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,058
day brightener

840
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,379
um your shittiest day will be happy

841
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,879
um you'll you'll feel a lot better it's

842
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,399
colorful it can be really intense at

843
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,960
first but they kind of it lightens up a

844
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,719
little bit but it is a wonderful high

845
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,538
it's very resinous it's got a sickly

846
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,399
sweet smell and taste to it it's divine

847
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:49,220
but it doesn't look like much

848
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,500
um when you're growing it it looks like

849
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,720
it's not impressive not at first but as

850
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,159
it further goes into flower uh it

851
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,200
becomes more impressive as it goes but

852
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,120
when you're first growing it um and even

853
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,679
a veg and mid-width your flower it's

854
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,599
just not

855
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,980
it's just not an impressive plant like a

856
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,298
lot of lions you know a lot of lines you

857
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,759
go like oh I know that's going to be

858
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,079
great but

859
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,778
um not all plants are like that you know

860
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,839
you can't judge a book by its cover

861
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:18,000
um and that is a very impressive line

862
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:21,599
unfortunately a lot of people you know

863
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,398
uh think oh it it's not a Pure Line but

864
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,839
um in Thailand there's hybridization

865
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:26,939
done there's

866
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,579
growth there's there's Low Land

867
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,580
varieties there's Highland varieties

868
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:34,500
um you know there is a bottlenecking of

869
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:36,898
varieties there's so many things that go

870
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,058
on with plants that some of this has

871
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:40,379
been done in the past and people look at

872
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,720
it and go oh there's some Modern

873
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,340
characteristics to it

874
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,600
um especially if grown indoors so if you

875
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,000
see

876
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,639
um a plant grown indoors it may look

877
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,380
you know kind of like a modern plant but

878
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,778
if you took that same plant Put It

879
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,179
Outdoors the environment the Sun the

880
00:32:54,778 --> 00:33:00,240
wind everything will make it look more

881
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,820
like it should you'll see these you know

882
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,940
very tall upright High looking plants

883
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:06,658
that are kind of you know bamboo like

884
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,140
um

885
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,880
or you know uh Japanese maple looking

886
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,519
you know the the different structures

887
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,440
Outdoors really brings out what a plant

888
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,579
should look like indoors it's a

889
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,019
controlled environment you're only

890
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,119
getting one aspect of what that plant

891
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:23,159
really could be unfortunately and then

892
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,018
people are flowering out these plants

893
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,539
with different light sources if you're

894
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:31,440
using LEDs plants end up being more

895
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:34,079
chunky shorter and they they Branch out

896
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,259
differently if you're using fluorescence

897
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,658
they kind of um you know will Branch out

898
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,419
look you know pretty good they just

899
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,580
won't be as dense using a metal halide

900
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:47,820
and they get very resinous and good

901
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:51,898
plants so using HPS they get very uh you

902
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:53,038
know squat and branchy um you just it

903
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:56,579
just depends on the light source you're

904
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,109
using for the looks of these plants not

905
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,139
only that

906
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,918
[Music]

907
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,500
um

908
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,080
indoor versus outdoor

909
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,579
um you know it all matters uh and that

910
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,319
the length of time a lot of people are

911
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:08,940
using too much light to grow their

912
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,039
plants they think oh more light the

913
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,139
better that's not necessarily true these

914
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,539
plants are like humans there's circadian

915
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,760
rhythms they need you know the darkness

916
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,500
and the light they need sleep they need

917
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,419
to have the restorative sleep where they

918
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,398
produce any of these

919
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,898
um precursors to create cannabinoids or

920
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:26,759
you know these things that protect

921
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,500
themselves from you know pests or

922
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,540
whatever it might be

923
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,179
um they're they're created when they

924
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:34,858
sleep so they need a a dark period so

925
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,838
you can't use like 24 hours of light and

926
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:37,440
think they're gonna be okay

927
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:39,599
um

928
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,940
you know resting the plants will

929
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,139
actually be improving on the plants so

930
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,878
you have to have the right ratio you

931
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,378
can't have too much Darkness you can't

932
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,460
have too much light

933
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,500
um you have to have something right in

934
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,220
the middle so that's why

935
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,800
um

936
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,959
I've developed ratios of light and

937
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,599
darkness so 10 and a half hours of light

938
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,519
and 13 half hours the darkness is kind

939
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,920
of like the sweet spot for most all

940
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,940
varieties around the world so if you

941
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,920
want something to work for everything

942
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,940
that ratio will work for flowering for

943
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,380
everything

944
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,700
and especially if you're doing it from

945
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,800
seed if you're starting off that way

946
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:15,118
even better

947
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,400
um they're veg to seed uh anyway if I I

948
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,260
can give people breakdowns uh I've

949
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,838
written uh documentation for anybody

950
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,240
that's wanting this uh if they want to

951
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:27,119
um contact me by email

952
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,699
that's incredible I'm gonna have to look

953
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,200
more into it myself I would like to ask

954
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:33,059
so sort of based on what you were saying

955
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,299
there what's your thoughts on orders

956
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:37,739
given they don't get uh much Darkness do

957
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
you think they'll ever be able to get to

958
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:43,019
a point where they're comparable because

959
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,579
people espouse that as the aspiration do

960
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,739
you think it is possible for

961
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,900
autoflowering cannabis to be like say as

962
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:50,098
good

963
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,260
yeah

964
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,420
um

965
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,520
autoflowering uh

966
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,960
yeah and you know there it's just a

967
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,519
hybrid they're using something that

968
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,858
flowers or it's an early flowering

969
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,139
hybrid Autoflower is kind of a Mis

970
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:06,119
misnomer you don't want to use a lot of

971
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:08,519
stuff that's hemp variety autoflowers

972
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,680
they're basically using stuff that's uh

973
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:12,239
flowering early so photosensitive

974
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,319
varieties

975
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,299
um so you can take anything that's

976
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,680
photosensitive and make it grow well as

977
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,920
long as they're you know using good

978
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:23,098
breeding practices it just depends

979
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,139
sure uh so what one of the common

980
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,480
questions we got from a lot of different

981
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,920
listeners in fact was they were

982
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,900
wondering if they could get some advice

983
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,280
because a lot of people want to try to

984
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,200
grow some of these like really wild

985
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,400
stuff but I but they're indoors and

986
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,259
they're like how do I do it you know

987
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,200
like I want to do it I just don't know

988
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,820
if it's possible do you have any tips

989
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,519
absolutely so one of the problems is

990
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,280
that a lot of these like books and stuff

991
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:50,699
that people buy is oh uh you take a

992
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,560
plant and you basically veg it for a few

993
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:54,779
days and then you flour it right away

994
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,699
that way they're shorter the problem is

995
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,800
that's not good because you don't have

996
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:01,019
enough roots that can deal with stress

997
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,579
and if you want to grow something you

998
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:05,099
need to veg the plant long enough to

999
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:08,460
grow roots so grow when you're growing a

1000
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:11,220
plant grow The Roots train the plants so

1001
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,679
by doing that making you know more main

1002
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:16,019
stems like topping it forcing the

1003
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,460
oxygens to create more Roots if you can

1004
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:20,039
kind of put some focus on the roots

1005
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,720
first by doing that and then repotting

1006
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,059
them you know pull off the bottom of the

1007
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,679
pot look at the roots use beer cups at

1008
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,599
first that are clear so you can see the

1009
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,639
root development

1010
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,220
um you know examine the roots kind of

1011
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:36,059
make sure that the soil isn't overly

1012
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:38,399
moist and wet use a moisture meter you

1013
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:40,019
know check the plant you know check the

1014
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,980
the container several different places

1015
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,480
make sure that it's you know dry enough

1016
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,039
to actually water because a lot of

1017
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,320
people over water and then there's no

1018
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,659
root development it stunts the plants

1019
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,400
and it pisses the plants off where the

1020
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:56,639
Herm on you

1021
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,338
um and mold and then die so the problem

1022
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,618
is root development grow those roots

1023
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:03,779
first and then flower them out and then

1024
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,400
if you have the right ratio you can save

1025
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,220
several weeks on these long flowering

1026
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,559
varieties so if you're doing what a lot

1027
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,559
of these magazines magazines and books

1028
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,500
will tell you the flour 12 off you may

1029
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,559
never ever finish your plant or it will

1030
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,659
take forever to finish because that

1031
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:24,900
light regimen doesn't

1032
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:26,578
isn't uh in nature it's not something

1033
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,320
that happens on Earth

1034
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,940
you know there's no 12 hours of light

1035
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,140
and 12 hours of Darkness anywhere on the

1036
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,079
planet

1037
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:36,659
so why would you do that in an indoor

1038
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,099
grow it doesn't make any sense

1039
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:40,019
um

1040
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:42,359
so basically you have to have the right

1041
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,858
ratio so if you use

1042
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,858
um you know the right amount of Darkness

1043
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:49,440
you can flower plants faster and and sex

1044
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,880
them faster so if you're vegan plants

1045
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,960
and then growing The Roots You can sex

1046
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,940
them

1047
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,858
and then revert it back to your veg

1048
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,260
period so you can sex your plants know

1049
00:38:55,858 --> 00:39:01,078
which males females you have then you

1050
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,740
can either clone the ones that you like

1051
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,599
um

1052
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,519
or grow those plants into the plants

1053
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,619
that you want to a certain size or you

1054
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,960
kill the plants that you don't want in

1055
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,059
the pot more seeds if you need more of a

1056
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,139
certain type or more numbers or males of

1057
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:16,619
a certain type

1058
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:19,078
that's a killer killer overview I'm

1059
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,480
really Keen I was gonna say I noticed um

1060
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,519
the Australian epic Haze it sounds

1061
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,440
incredible do you do anything different

1062
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,539
when you have those Ultra long flowering

1063
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,280
types or again same thing just expect it

1064
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,858
to end up a little bigger

1065
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,540
majority of the plants will finish in 14

1066
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:35,159
to 16 weeks even some of the longer

1067
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,679
flowering varieties will finish in 16

1068
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:39,960
weeks which is not so bad there will be

1069
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,059
longer flowering varieties that will

1070
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,119
take longer you can always take things

1071
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:47,759
earlier but patience

1072
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,579
um you know why grow something for eight

1073
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,040
or nine weeks that will finish better in

1074
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:55,859
in 14 weeks

1075
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,519
um why take something earlier

1076
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:01,739
if if the quality is not there

1077
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:04,079
you'll find that something like a

1078
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,299
Colombian that grows you know for 20 to

1079
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,880
26 weeks in a greenhouse you know

1080
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,280
finishes in March or April Outdoors

1081
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,180
being like it takes a whole year of

1082
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,220
growth and then flowering to finish it

1083
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:19,739
will finish indoors faster because

1084
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,659
you're able to manipulate the lights

1085
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:24,479
um but if you're using a greenhouse

1086
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:27,539
those last few months the colors will

1087
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,400
come out the the Reds the oranges the

1088
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:31,139
purples all this that beauty in the line

1089
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,740
will actually present themselves the

1090
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:36,420
resins that take long weeks to grow will

1091
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:40,439
will be um

1092
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,659
more present so you get these uh Turpin

1093
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,539
and cannabinoid profiles that are just

1094
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:47,219
amazing psychedelic and very Great

1095
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,980
Expressions of cannabis you know very

1096
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:51,358
delectable connoisseur

1097
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,159
but if you harvest it too early you

1098
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,598
won't get those expressions the other

1099
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,659
issue is you need to know the variety

1100
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,940
some varieties will finish faster than

1101
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:01,199
others and if you wait too long then

1102
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,200
it's

1103
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,059
um oxidized and you'll have more of an

1104
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,460
inferior product like some Mexicans will

1105
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:11,400
finish Fast

1106
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,079
um you know once they have the peak THC

1107
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,940
content you know the trichomes are fully

1108
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,740
developed you should harvest the

1109
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,900
Mexicans because a lot of times if you

1110
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,838
wait too long then it starts to oxidize

1111
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,380
and then they kind of get dried out and

1112
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:28,078
you know loses its quality so you just

1113
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,640
need to know the variety and if you have

1114
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,579
the right variety then you need a

1115
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,098
harvest earlier at Peaks concentration

1116
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,200
or you you wait the time it needs to

1117
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,059
finish to to get the best qualities out

1118
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,559
of it you just it just depends on what

1119
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,380
time you're you're willing to put into

1120
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,299
it and then grow the variety that you're

1121
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,280
willing to put in that time you know if

1122
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,700
you're not willing to put in 20 24 weeks

1123
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,019
don't get a pure Colombian

1124
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:53,639
um you know some Colombians will finish

1125
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:55,619
faster

1126
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:57,358
um but majority won't you know these

1127
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,740
equatorial lines are at the equator

1128
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,078
they're not as photosensitive as

1129
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:02,459
something that is uh grown in the Hindu

1130
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,200
Kush

1131
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,480
um but Mexico is kind of something

1132
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,519
that's more northernly higher latitude

1133
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,039
and will finish faster but it's also

1134
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,679
longer flowering but you know may finish

1135
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,079
in

1136
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:18,440
October versus December January February

1137
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,440
March

1138
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:23,338
yeah that certainly makes sense you know

1139
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:25,199
picking according to what you're willing

1140
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:27,960
to do as well as all these little

1141
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,059
amazing tidbits of info there

1142
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,699
I guess I would love to quickly ask you

1143
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:35,699
though do you feel like you have to put

1144
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:38,039
any consideration into what we might

1145
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:40,618
broadly call the commercial viability of

1146
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,539
your strains because as you said you

1147
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,880
know people need to go into this sort of

1148
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,800
knowing what they're getting into does

1149
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,720
that ever hold you back or do you feel

1150
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,280
like you just make what you want and you

1151
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,000
know Let it go

1152
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,400
well I don't pick strands that are uh

1153
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,900
fast flowering I'm not picking strains

1154
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,539
to finish Fast though there will be

1155
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,579
strains that will finish faster

1156
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:05,279
um I'm picking for quality and potency

1157
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,200
above all else so those those are my my

1158
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,480
criteria so if a person's coming with to

1159
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,739
mean that they want a seven or eight or

1160
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,539
nine week strain

1161
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,419
I'm going to have

1162
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,338
some things I could show them but

1163
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,980
they're going to be limited if their

1164
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:22,380
constraints are time frame because the

1165
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,059
best qualities take a little bit longer

1166
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,680
and if you're constrained to like

1167
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,139
needing to harvest something in eight to

1168
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,179
nine weeks then you need to probably

1169
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:32,279
look somewhere else because

1170
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:34,019
you know I'm not choosing things to

1171
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,900
finish Fast I'm choosing for quality of

1172
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,759
potency and those take a little time

1173
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,858
typically you're not to say that you

1174
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,000
can't find those faster phenotypes and

1175
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:45,679
there are varieties that will finish

1176
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,539
faster just the majority of the quality

1177
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,239
phenotypes take longer that's just the

1178
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:52,440
nature of things

1179
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,779
certainly certainly

1180
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,818
so if someone were to take a look at

1181
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,980
sort of your overall back catalog of

1182
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:01,318
work to me it seems obvious that there's

1183
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,960
a more of a predominance of sativas than

1184
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,960
indicas is this a reflection of just

1185
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,240
your personal sort of preferences in

1186
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,659
regards to flavor effect things like

1187
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,818
that or is it more a case of like just

1188
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:16,379
the stock you're working with and you

1189
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:19,079
know other factors

1190
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,460
well the majority of them is tables

1191
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,619
because there's more sativos tropical

1192
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,260
equatorials than there is indicas it's

1193
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,599
just that's the world there's just more

1194
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,760
of that than there are these other kind

1195
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,400
uh

1196
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,599
and the reason why I'm working for

1197
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,940
certain varieties is I'm trying to

1198
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,619
preserve varieties that may be lost so

1199
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,159
I'm putting more emphasis on Mexicans

1200
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,579
Hawaiians Colombians that the seed stock

1201
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,078
is in short supply it takes a long time

1202
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,818
to grow these lines and they're almost

1203
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,240
lost so I'm trying to save these lines

1204
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,619
so my my focus may not be on exactly

1205
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,379
what I want to grow

1206
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,760
but I'm trying to preserve it for the

1207
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,559
future

1208
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,780
um so that's where my focus is at

1209
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,159
otherwise I'd I'd be growing a lot of

1210
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,480
these faster flowering varieties and

1211
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,920
pumping them out and trying to make a

1212
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,219
lot of money

1213
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,960
um which would be nice but I'm trying to

1214
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:11,098
preserve these lines that take longer

1215
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,659
because

1216
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,660
if I don't they're gonna be lost

1217
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,240
um and unfortunately because they take

1218
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,039
longer um

1219
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,479
instead of popping out something that I

1220
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,338
can grow within a short period of time

1221
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,858
and you know make a thousand couple

1222
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:27,599
thousand seeds hundreds of thousand

1223
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:29,940
seeds you know in a quick period of time

1224
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,640
I'm taking you know years to grow

1225
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,780
something that may not produce very much

1226
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,159
um

1227
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,740
and that's where people don't understand

1228
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:39,000
is is that you're unfamiliar with how

1229
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:40,799
long and how much work it takes to

1230
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,300
create these lines

1231
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,280
um that there's a lot of time involved

1232
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,660
not just the flowering you know the

1233
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,040
selection process the growing the

1234
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,940
vegging

1235
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,219
um

1236
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,858
and uh you're just not making as much

1237
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:55,919
seed and takes a lot longer to grow so

1238
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:57,838
you know things take longer they they

1239
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,980
cost more because it takes a lot more to

1240
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,199
produce them

1241
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,699
certainly that makes sense and we're all

1242
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,739
very lucky to have someone like you

1243
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,299
ensuring the preservation of these lines

1244
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,519
I

1245
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,019
um I have to admit I sort of engineered

1246
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,358
that question well because I wanted to

1247
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:15,300
get to this next one which was that one

1248
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,578
of uh one of our guests uh they said

1249
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,440
look you hear a lot about Afghan indicas

1250
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,760
and maybe you know a bit of Pakistani he

1251
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,800
said but you really don't hear too much

1252
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,740
about indica's in the rest of the world

1253
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,960
and occasionally you know Chinese little

1254
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:30,239
blip on the map the Yuan

1255
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,039
um what's your experience with indica's

1256
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,439
outside of the conventional Afghan

1257
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,119
Pakistan what's your thoughts unsung

1258
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,079
heroes anything we should keep our eye

1259
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,900
out for

1260
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,339
oh Lebanese should be iodized some of

1261
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:45,000
the best

1262
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:48,179
um Lebanon has one of the oldest

1263
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,159
cannabis cultures there was a um a

1264
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:52,919
temple there to

1265
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:56,098
um the the Mysteries you know for like

1266
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:59,338
wine production in the ancient past

1267
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:02,220
um but wine in the past was used as a

1268
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:03,779
vehicle for preserving

1269
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,179
um not only the alcohol but other

1270
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,400
medicinal plants like cannabis so they

1271
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:13,379
were able to take their canvas plants

1272
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:17,160
and preserve them in wine and um

1273
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:20,220
in that area they were able to grow

1274
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,598
um cannabis and preserve them in the

1275
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:24,000
wine and then in the winter they would

1276
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,380
able to have their cannabis along with

1277
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,940
their wines because they weren't

1278
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,780
drinking water they were drinking wine

1279
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:32,280
because it wasn't safe to drink water ah

1280
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,119
that yeah that makes sense that's a good

1281
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,760
point

1282
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,920
so and in Lebanon they have an ancient

1283
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,420
cannabis history or um you know that

1284
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,480
goes back once so there are varieties

1285
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,000
were selected for Generations in the

1286
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,539
Levant which was like The Phoenician

1287
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,119
um stronghold of that area so basically

1288
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:53,460
that area is um you know they had the

1289
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,160
ziggurats the Sumerians there's ancient

1290
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,019
cannabis culture the area which is uh

1291
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,420
the bulk region of Afghanistan was the

1292
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:02,880
zohustrian area which isn't too far so

1293
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:06,119
those Pro film pilgrimages from other

1294
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,440
areas like Lebanon Syria which had hash

1295
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,780
plants

1296
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,519
um Egypt it also it had hash plants

1297
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,240
indicas

1298
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,599
um

1299
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,939
you know parts of uh cashmere

1300
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,940
um different parts of Pakistan they all

1301
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,800
had these Indica varieties Iran has the

1302
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,800
ancient Persian history they had

1303
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,160
something similar to Soma India had the

1304
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,539
Soma which was uh cannabis but the

1305
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,159
Persians the ancient Persians and the

1306
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:35,880
austrians had

1307
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:39,118
um the heoma which is basically you know

1308
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,599
the same thing and they had their Vedic

1309
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,240
um type books as well uh indicating you

1310
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:48,240
know this ancient cannabis

1311
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:51,239
um you know Sacrament beautiful stuff

1312
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,578
yeah so unsung indicas around the world

1313
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:58,019
there are indicas in different places

1314
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:59,640
like Mexico has hash plants Colombia has

1315
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:02,159
hash plants

1316
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,879
um different places around the world so

1317
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,920
um it just depends China has some the

1318
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,960
Yunnan Province

1319
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,858
um there's a there's a lot of

1320
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,858
variability not only do to

1321
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:19,219
um its placement but it's it's

1322
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:23,159
um altitude it's the lowland variety

1323
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:25,379
some of them were able to um look a

1324
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,539
certain way and some of them as they

1325
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,099
went up higher in elevation they would

1326
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,719
look you know

1327
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,640
um differently so lowland varieties

1328
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,858
tended to be more broad-leafed because

1329
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,000
they're trying to capture more light

1330
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:38,880
um and then the Highland ones were

1331
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,199
actually more elongated and stretchy uh

1332
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,940
because they were getting a lot more

1333
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:43,559
like they had to deal with like high

1334
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,838
winds so they had to be able to be a bit

1335
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,099
more bendable on different things

1336
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,679
um

1337
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:52,980
it all depends you know your environment

1338
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,779
plays a role on how the plants

1339
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,300
acclimatize change

1340
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,640
um you know some of these indicas may be

1341
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,460
um

1342
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:06,598
tolerant and resistant to humidity that

1343
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,519
is from a cold dry environment or a cold

1344
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,480
humid environment or hot humid

1345
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:12,300
environment

1346
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,639
so when people say oh this line is

1347
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,920
um you know resistant to humid

1348
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,199
environment you know is it a hot humid

1349
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,019
or cold humid because if you grow the

1350
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,699
wrong thing it'll mold real easy and you

1351
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,800
won't be able to grow certain varieties

1352
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:28,519
you know on the coast for instance that

1353
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,560
grew in Hawaii in California

1354
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:33,599
it just depends so these different

1355
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,059
things of climatization matter and they

1356
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,859
affect the qualities of these turpins

1357
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:40,139
and the way they evolved

1358
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:41,338
I uh I don't know how we're gonna get

1359
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:44,098
there so I'm just gonna have to really

1360
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:46,679
bluntly put it out there what's uh the

1361
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,420
Old School Big Bud like was it ever good

1362
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:50,219
like objectively or was it just big

1363
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,159
yielding oh yeah

1364
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:55,980
uh it was big quality wise it was old

1365
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,659
school Mexican uh Afghani is what I

1366
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,780
figure it is

1367
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:03,420
um the the Mexicans were large the early

1368
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:05,220
well the stuff even up into the 80s were

1369
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,200
large plants

1370
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:09,719
um you know some of them would have the

1371
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:13,558
clothes desero which were

1372
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:15,959
um tales of the the fox so Fox Tales so

1373
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:19,680
everybody's colas get it's the name from

1374
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,358
the Mexican word for colas de Zorro uh

1375
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,219
the foxtails but they're only saying the

1376
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,078
Tails portion the Mexican word for it

1377
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:27,539
Spanish word for it

1378
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,640
um but they used to a majority of the

1379
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:31,259
Mexicans produced you know big bread

1380
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:32,759
loaf looking Spears so you have these

1381
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,119
big spear looking plants that were like

1382
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,040
candelabra style or upright or these big

1383
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,400
Christmas trees you know like giant

1384
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:44,579
Pines uh that were 20 30 feet tall

1385
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,858
um so uh the big bud was uh Crossing of

1386
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:50,640
some of these larger yielding Mexicans

1387
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:52,578
with uh some of the um early Afghani

1388
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,318
stuff that was coming along

1389
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,760
ah okay okay and how come you think it

1390
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:58,679
died out

1391
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,720
I'm sure some people are still growing

1392
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,000
it I had it for a little while I lost it

1393
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,399
but as anything

1394
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,338
um if somebody's usually has it

1395
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,160
yeah just hiding out I mean look on the

1396
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:13,920
topic of someone usually has it there's

1397
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:16,558
a huge push within the community to find

1398
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,338
the roadkill skunk you think someone has

1399
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,040
it

1400
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:22,500
oh yeah I have some seeds that are old

1401
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,058
school skunk but uh they're old so I'm

1402
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,260
trying to germinate those bring them

1403
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,140
back

1404
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,540
um I had roadkill skunk back in the day

1405
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:34,739
last time I had it

1406
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,818
um offered to me was back in the 90s 97

1407
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:38,879
um you know it was on the border of

1408
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:40,800
Canada and Washington State uh that

1409
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,300
stuff stunk so bad it was super hashy

1410
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,140
the joints just kept putting themselves

1411
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,880
out and it stunk like you know you ran

1412
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:51,179
over a couple skunks I mean the juices

1413
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,358
like that really nasty [ __ ] skunk and

1414
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:57,058
yeah you really stoned it was credible

1415
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:58,980
weed uh the stuff that people know is

1416
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:01,859
like skunk number one is it's different

1417
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,639
it's different something different

1418
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:04,440
um

1419
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:08,159
is similar

1420
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,139
um but it's not the same thing what I

1421
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,739
think the the old skunks were were

1422
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:16,679
Mexican Afghani hybrids or

1423
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:20,338
um you know Mexican Durban or something

1424
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:23,519
like that but there was skunks before

1425
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:24,960
uh the the label skunk number one was

1426
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,599
available

1427
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,699
oh and I'm working on uh I've got some

1428
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,740
other skunk lines uh I did the Fester

1429
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:33,779
skunk with but I'm trying to grow out

1430
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:36,199
more of that but uh I've got some

1431
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,660
afghanis that have the skunk properties

1432
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:41,939
so uh if anything I'm gonna recreate my

1433
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:45,000
own skunk so that's in the works as well

1434
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:48,599
oh exciting now you got me wondering

1435
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,940
what are some of your favorite afghanis

1436
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,920
oh my God uh one of my favorite is the

1437
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,358
petroleum head stash

1438
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,420
um there was

1439
00:53:54,358 --> 00:54:00,659
um one that was it was an Afghani line

1440
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:04,619
and from the guy that created um

1441
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:06,179
harijuana he was a Steve talk no the guy

1442
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:10,140
that actually did it that Steve tuck

1443
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:13,078
made the seed line uh reproduced it

1444
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:15,118
um but the guy who made it was in Ukiah

1445
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:18,000
uh in California

1446
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,960
um but oh wow this guy was growing

1447
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,139
Mexican

1448
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,019
um Mexican varieties in Colorado before

1449
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:29,879
he came to um uh California

1450
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:32,579
and um at the time uh the afghanis came

1451
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,079
in they basically killed all the

1452
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:36,119
Mexicans that they were growing and

1453
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,818
started growing these afghanis which

1454
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,880
were medium-sized Bush

1455
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:44,039
um catalabra style bushy afghanis that

1456
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,240
turned red and purple

1457
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,440
um and he showed me pictures of these

1458
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:50,039
things

1459
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,659
um and the the petroleum head stash that

1460
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:53,818
I grew was like fruit punch like

1461
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,739
Hawaiian fruit punch

1462
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:57,599
um super tasty

1463
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:00,539
um euphoric body

1464
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,940
uh body effects and Stone Anaheim at the

1465
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:05,699
same time so it was like a clear uh

1466
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,920
Afghani and that was that's what people

1467
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:09,659
should want it's like a you know it's

1468
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,940
not a narcotic effect it's it's

1469
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:13,858
basically you know what people would say

1470
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,740
like OG Kush is like a sativa It's like

1471
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:18,539
got that up high but it's got the stone

1472
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,358
and body effects at the same time so

1473
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:22,380
it's like a concert clear

1474
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,139
um

1475
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,480
you know effect which is very pleasant

1476
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:30,900
euphoric and that's kind of like what

1477
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,559
most afghanis should be is like that

1478
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,200
um

1479
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:37,380
but the petroleum head stash there's one

1480
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:40,439
that was done by reefer man and that one

1481
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,940
isn't the same as the the inbred line

1482
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,619
that I've had of the petroleum head

1483
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,780
stash I think they're either two

1484
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,220
different lines or that's something

1485
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,540
different or it's a hybrid of something

1486
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,338
else

1487
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:52,440
um but the petroleum headset that I had

1488
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:55,199
was like Hawaiian Punch

1489
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,260
um or fruit punch and um just delectable

1490
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,338
yeah I wish I had that again

1491
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,680
um

1492
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:03,900
anyway that that's that's what you want

1493
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:04,618
is uh one of those

1494
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,980
um

1495
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:11,579
afghanis that has that

1496
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:13,619
um Quality high in that you know kind of

1497
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:16,500
sticks out you know it isn't like a

1498
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:19,500
cloudy Stoney a narcotic drug type

1499
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,500
effect

1500
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,780
yeah beautiful stuff sounds great I wish

1501
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,420
I got to try it I have tried heroin or

1502
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,819
maybe not an original clone or who knows

1503
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:33,780
wasn't verified but also some really

1504
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:35,519
nice stuff yeah heroin here heroin is uh

1505
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,900
there's a lot of variations to it and I

1506
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,818
think that's because so many people got

1507
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,200
their hands on it so it's hard to say

1508
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:42,300
what's what

1509
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,919
I think that one's killer New Haven and

1510
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,599
the petroleum head stash

1511
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,280
um I don't know how much of the

1512
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,079
petroleum head stash is really in there

1513
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,220
or which one

1514
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:53,519
um

1515
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,899
but uh if I can talk to the the breeder

1516
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,699
again maybe I'll see if he's got any

1517
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,740
original seats I'm supposed to bring him

1518
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:01,618
some special afghanis

1519
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:03,719
um that he's been looking for so you

1520
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,760
know he's a an old

1521
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:07,500
head that's been in the know for a long

1522
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,599
time so

1523
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,460
oh that's very exciting to hear

1524
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,579
hopefully something comes with that

1525
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:16,800
oh it it will he's easy to find and um

1526
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:19,980
you know he's he's in the middle of

1527
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,200
uh Mendocino there so

1528
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,818
he's not a sea producer he doesn't he

1529
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,039
doesn't breed you know most people don't

1530
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:27,239
even know who he is he just he's just a

1531
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:29,699
guy that

1532
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,739
um tailors to the the community and they

1533
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:33,779
wouldn't even know that he is uh you

1534
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:35,338
know old school breeder

1535
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,019
that's that's the same that goes with a

1536
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:39,000
lot of these guys that don't seek

1537
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:40,259
recognition but

1538
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,639
um you know they've been doing their

1539
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,900
work for years and helping out the

1540
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,219
community because people don't realize

1541
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,200
that they're you know their doctors

1542
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:47,399
their business people their you know

1543
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,519
their gardeners they're different people

1544
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,720
and they're all out there

1545
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:53,519
um and I wish they would share their

1546
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,219
stories and either share them with me or

1547

you know get that you know

1548
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:00,058
get that story out there because a lot

1549
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:01,739
of the sad stories that go along with it

1550
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,359
you've really got to document it

1551
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:05,459
otherwise it just gets lost to time

1552
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,500
doesn't it right yeah absolutely and the

1553
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,599
people that should deserve quite you

1554
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,179
know uh you know

1555
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:16,559
deserve credit should get the credit

1556
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:18,659
yeah 100 100 so

1557
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,339
take me back what was your first

1558
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:24,558
experience with cannabis

1559
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:24,558
oh man God what was it

1560
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,940
um God

1561
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:33,239
I I you know I I think this first was

1562
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:35,099
like hash uh my sister had hash and I

1563
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:36,358
probably smoked some of her hash that's

1564
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:39,359
probably my first experience with

1565
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:41,759
mushrooms and hash but the the true

1566
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:44,219
first variety that I had was a Colombian

1567
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,180
green that

1568
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:48,019
um

1569
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:51,298
my friend got it from his father

1570
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:54,719
and this Colombian green was

1571
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:57,960
um grown indoors and it was super

1572
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,399
resinous but it caused uh that Colombian

1573
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,099
choke

1574
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,139
um and if you had this old Colombian you

1575
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:05,579
you know because basically it takes the

1576
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:07,858
wind out you smoke it and you're just

1577
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:10,980
coughing up along this

1578
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:13,019
um makes immense clouds of smoke

1579
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,818
um you're barely touching um you know

1580
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:16,259
with the flame the bud because you're

1581
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,579
you're getting through the resin profile

1582
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,140
but it's a you know it's a pure

1583
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,359
Colombian

1584
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:23,159
um

1585
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:24,900
and uh man it was it was incredible

1586
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,759
stuff that was just so potent after a

1587
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,099
couple hits you're just uh

1588
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,319
you're just kind of uh you don't want

1589
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:33,359
anymore but you're just so high that

1590
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,460
it's it's it's incredible

1591
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:38,639
um that was some Columbian green and

1592
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,679
that was like the first variety that I

1593
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:43,019
had other than Mexican varieties which

1594
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:44,940
were plentiful and many

1595
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:47,639
um and all that was brown bread and when

1596
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:49,559
I saw the green Bud for the first time I

1597
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,058
didn't even know what that was

1598
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,519
um I was like wow that's some green butt

1599
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:55,559
that's some cool looking stuff and then

1600
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,780
um the brown butt is what you know I I

1601
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:00,720
was majority familiar with brown or red

1602
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:03,540
or had different hair colors

1603
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:06,179
um you know Green bud and brown bud was

1604
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:08,400
the majority of what I grew up on and

1605
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:09,779
when the killer green buds came in with

1606
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,559
the afghanis

1607
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,960
um

1608
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,240
that was something different and those

1609
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,039
there was a lot of uh variations some of

1610
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:21,000
them were good some of them were so

1611
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:23,219
hashy that uh they were asterid and

1612
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,239
off-putting because there was no

1613
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:27,480
selection and they were getting all

1614
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,279
these land race afghanis and um you know

1615
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,260
they were just trying to find

1616
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,260
you know the good ones to grow but we

1617
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,180
were getting like you know everything

1618
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:37,619
and some of them were not always good

1619
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:39,598
you know if you're doing selection some

1620
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:43,140
of them are you got perfumey and Scentsy

1621
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:46,619
asteroids gunky uh those Astrid ones uh

1622
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:48,539
were just super hashy not tasty uh very

1623
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:50,880
hard to consume

1624
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:51,960
um but you know that's that's what

1625
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,519
happens when you're you know doing

1626
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,599
selections some of them are great some

1627
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,679
of them are good and some of them are

1628
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,500
kind of off

1629
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,419
there you go and so what was the

1630
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,880
progression from sort of that experience

1631
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:06,059
to thinking I want to start growing

1632
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,858
I started growing the Mexican seeds that

1633
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:10,980
I used to get so

1634
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:12,838
um I used to dig holes in the backyard

1635
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,240
in the the back seat I would get for the

1636
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:17,639
Mexican varieties because my cousins are

1637
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,679
Mexican and we used to get different

1638
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:21,298
Lots from their cousins so all their

1639
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,980
different cousins and family were

1640
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:24,780
bringing different types of in Mexican

1641
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,579
weed up from Mexico

1642
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,798
um you know visiting family members so

1643
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:30,839
I'd grow it out in the backyard

1644
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,318
um we're in Northern California you know

1645
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:36,719
14 miles away from Mendocino County

1646
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:40,380
um it was a perfect climate and then I

1647
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:41,759
dig holes in the hill and then I take um

1648
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,760
Greenhouse

1649
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:47,160
Roofing which was semi-clear and laid

1650
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,660
across the ground and I dig big holes so

1651
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:51,420
I was doing these greenhouses that were

1652
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:53,338
in the ground so as a helicopter a camp

1653
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,740
helicopter would come by and look down

1654
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:58,858
all this thing is like you know trash or

1655
01:01:55,739 --> 01:02:01,139
you know Greenhouse you know stuff

1656
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:02,759
that's just on the ground or in piles

1657
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:04,199
and they wouldn't realize there's you

1658
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,339
know being plants being grown

1659
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:12,000
underground in like holes so I was

1660
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:13,679
um I'll grill a whole Grill grower and

1661
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,940
that was my first Growing Experience of

1662
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,219
these varieties some of them would be

1663
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:19,679
above ground but I did a lot of stuff

1664
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:23,818
indoors are in the ground for a while

1665
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:25,379
and then I did uh I grew on a roof

1666
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:26,880
um growing plants on a roof was kind of

1667
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,920
sketchy

1668
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,119
um because of planes but I try to put

1669
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,980
them near trees or something like that

1670
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:33,960
to kind of avoid them but they were

1671
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,699
Mexicans so they were pretty tall and

1672
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,798
other ones would grow next to pine trees

1673
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:39,118
and they would get uh the size of pine

1674
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:40,920
trees

1675
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,358
um you know within a small amount of

1676
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,639
time you know with the hot California

1677
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:47,219
Sun things would get really quick I'd

1678
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:50,039
get really tall really quick and so you

1679
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:51,959
know one week you'd walk my plan and

1680
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:54,179
it's a couple feet tall the next week

1681
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,639
and it's freaking you know 15 20 feet

1682
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:58,558
tall

1683
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:00,179
with uh you know branches that as long

1684
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,980
as a human you know 14 feet long

1685
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:03,960
distance so these things get just as

1686
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:08,280
wide as they get tall and they're

1687
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:10,619
they're massively crazy big and uh I I

1688
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,900
miss those things I need to find those

1689
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:14,579
old Mexicans like that

1690
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,780
that's really interesting to hear how

1691
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:18,780
you did it back in the day do you

1692
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:20,460
remember when the first sort of uh brand

1693
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,339
name strain started rolling out like

1694
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:26,099
strains with names or uh was it sort of

1695
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:28,318
a progression yeah well I in High Times

1696
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,680
I remember uh you know there was in

1697
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:33,119
Thais and Mexicans durbins there was

1698
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:35,219
those type of branding brand names were

1699
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,140
like Durban Poison

1700
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:40,558
um

1701
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:42,539
I think skunk was known

1702
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,160
uh I don't think Northern Lights and

1703
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:46,019
that stuff hadn't been around yet not

1704
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,098
until later

1705
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:49,199
um

1706
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,760
there was there was Hawaiian there was

1707
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,379

1712
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:06,980
those Mexican red there was red hair

1713
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:11,099

Colombian Brown those Colombian gold uh

1716
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:19,679
there was Thai chocolate Thai

1717
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:21,419
things had names or places where it came

1718
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,338
from that was the majority of what stuff

1719
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,318
was coming on when there was like you

1720
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:27,659
know seed lines the cephan the seed

1721
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:28,858
banks started coming around

1722
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:31,920
um

1723
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:34,679
you know I think

1724
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,960
Northern Lights skunk I think those ones

1725
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:39,419
were the first ones that came out

1726
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,420
um Northern Lights with

1727
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:43,380
skunk Haze skunk you know Northern

1728
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,180
Lights I think there was all

1729
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,680
combinations of the same stuff I think

1730
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:48,000
the first

1731
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:49,379
um

1732
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,079
uh

1733
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,000
like Cannabis Cup brought some of those

1734
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,940
seeds being sold over here I you know I

1735
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,280
I don't remember too much it was all uh

1736
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:01,079
Tutti Frutti names people made up you

1737
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,519
know that was it was but the seeds the

1738
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,200
seed plant seed bank stuff I don't

1739
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:05,940
remember until later on

1740
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,338
in those early days were there any

1741
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:10,679
breeders who you sort of looked up to or

1742
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:13,679
were you so into it like you just hadn't

1743
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:16,500
even heard of them no back then it was

1744
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:19,440
so uh everybody's so paranoid that

1745
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,420
um you know no you had to like have

1746
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,338
family members and know people within

1747
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,139
the family to like get anything it was

1748
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:27,420
really paranoid

1749
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:29,460
um very stringent

1750
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,838
um you know anti-cannabis laws and you

1751
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:32,818
know you didn't want to be busted with

1752
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:34,199
anything at that time

1753
01:05:32,818 --> 01:05:36,900
um

1754
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:38,879
you know uh so everybody kept to

1755
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,579
themselves there was really a you know a

1756
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,440
lot of paranoia everybody's a snitch um

1757
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:46,760
you know people got busted for

1758
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:49,980
you know seeds and stems and

1759
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,720
not a whole lot so um no a lot of people

1760
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,760
just try to keep to themselves or they

1761
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,399
get busted you know if you if you didn't

1762
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,280
know anything you couldn't tell anybody

1763
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,039
yeah yeah very much understandable given

1764
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,040
the harsh penalties so I guess I'm

1765
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:07,739
wondering I how did you get the name

1766
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,239
snow hi and B when did you decide you

1767
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:11,519
wanted to start sort of formally

1768
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,078
breeding and giving your seeds out

1769
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:15,298
oh man

1770
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:18,000
um this name his name snow High came out

1771
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:20,579
my friend uh Dustin

1772
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,639
um and I he was growing the snow cap he

1773
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:25,559
got um one of the first clones out of

1774
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:28,019
Fort Bragg and when the Growers

1775
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,720
Mendocino were done growing it and no

1776
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:31,739
one else was growing at Lake County

1777
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:34,439
um

1778
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:36,479
so when I was uh it came online in the

1779
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,159
early 2000s

1780
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,719
um it was just the strain that he had

1781
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:43,679
been growing that

1782
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:44,879
um I was selling down here and uh I just

1783
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:46,558
used the name to see how many people

1784
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,539
were familiar with the screen to see how

1785
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,700
prolific it was around and not many

1786
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:51,420
people had known about it not at that

1787
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:54,298
time

1788
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:56,700
uh so it just happened to be the name I

1789
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:58,019
used as at the time of the set the

1790
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:01,500
strain I was selling

1791
01:06:58,019 --> 01:07:02,880
which was a really tasty good strain at

1792
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,739
least the first

1793
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,400
um version of it that came out because

1794
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:10,379
it soon became hybridized in The Taste

1795
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,220
and everything went downhill but the the

1796
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:17,039
real true Snow cap was mentholated minty

1797
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:19,679
Menthol uh candied

1798
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,599
um you know Wintergreen type smell and

1799
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,899
taste and flavor you know tropical candy

1800
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:28,079
it was very tasty and resinous had a

1801
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:30,119
great fantastic high and grew nice big

1802
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:33,359
Spears and this you know it was a it was

1803
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:37,380
a good good plant but uh it was really

1804
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:40,259
good at being able to deal with humidity

1805
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:41,579
and mold so people were growing in Fort

1806
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,420
Bragg

1807
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:46,318
um

1808
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:48,539
my father's uncle or cousin was growing

1809
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,940
it in the town of Mendocino and that the

1810
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:53,819
fog Bank was so thick

1811
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,679
and Mendocino the town of Mendocino that

1812
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:57,779
the plants were dripping with

1813
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,578
um with condensation just dripping

1814
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,079
because the sun was blocked out you

1815
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:03,720
could barely see the sun because it was

1816
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,579
like a little ring of you know a little

1817
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:08,098
bit of light but it was so thick with

1818
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:09,599
Haze and moisture on the coast of

1819
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:11,400
Mendocino because it's right on the

1820
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,400
coast of Northern California with all

1821
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,579
the Redwoods but these plants these snow

1822
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,380
cap hybrids were growing under like pure

1823
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:21,420
condensation I mean he was taking a

1824
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:22,739
bleach water solution spraying the

1825
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:25,140
plants and that's how I was able to grow

1826
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:28,619
with like almost no bite it was amazing

1827
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:31,020
but those hybrids became more uh

1828
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:34,198
prevalent and the majority of people

1829
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:36,299
that got what they thought was like snow

1830
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:38,639
cap was this hybridized version kind of

1831
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:41,278
the real stuff kind of wasn't available

1832
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,619
to people ah

1833
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:47,400
anyway that's the video Hive was

1834
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:49,920
basically uh snow cap and then um me

1835
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:51,960
saying snow High I guess I I just

1836
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,420
adapted the snow highs no caps no high

1837
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,619
thing and then that Bodhi convinced me

1838
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,140
to um

1839
01:08:55,619 --> 01:09:00,298
to sell seeds I was basically you know

1840
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:02,219
selling to the clubs and doing my own

1841
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:04,079
preservation work and you know doing

1842
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:08,759
stuff for fun

1843
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:10,619
um and my family's homes were uh being

1844
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:12,238
you know the the banks were trying to

1845
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:15,000
collect from them

1846
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,218
um family went through some uh times

1847
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,798
where they were in the hospital and

1848
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,420
weren't able to work so I tried to save

1849
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:24,479
my families

1850
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,859
um Properties by selling herb and I did

1851
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,619
that for a few years so that kind of got

1852
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:33,179
me into selling the herb to save their

1853
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:35,278
homes which I was able to do and then uh

1854
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:38,399
seed stuff just kind of evolved with

1855
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:41,160
that as well but mainly places but fun

1856
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,619
and uh trying to do preservation

1857
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:45,599
beautiful beautiful and is there a

1858
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:47,338
difference between legendary genetics

1859
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,739
and snow High seeds

1860
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:53,100
well uh legendary genetics was supposed

1861
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:56,698
to be for uh California it's no high for

1862
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:58,920
the rest of the world when the uh

1863
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:00,659
you know clubs weren't legal the

1864
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,480
problems with covid covid kind of

1865
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:05,460
destroyed all the the business that was

1866
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:07,799
going to be done and established at the

1867
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,119
time so a lot of

1868
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,600
um

1869
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:16,019
the work that Bodhi uh kagyu and Coastal

1870
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,460
seeds and and myself we were going to be

1871
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,739
uh

1872
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,198
in the clubs in California

1873
01:10:19,738 --> 01:10:23,519
um unfortunately covet happened right

1874
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:25,559
when we were getting into all these

1875
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,780
clubs but the clubs went out of business

1876
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,460
all the seed stock that went into these

1877
01:10:27,779 --> 01:10:32,698
places was lost

1878
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,319
uh saw that time money and effort was

1879
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:35,219
lost

1880
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,639
um

1881
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:42,179
but there was supposed to be a

1882
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,039
a separation of the two so we could do

1883
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:46,319
something here in California

1884
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,658
um and then something for the world that

1885
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,340
was already done previous to that

1886
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:51,839
unfortunately kova destroyed a lot of

1887
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:56,819
stuff and

1888
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,500
um trying to uh get back to uh work is a

1889
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,698
work in progress you know a lot of

1890
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:02,520
people have had to do that you know

1891
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:04,379
start over you know deal with their

1892
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,880
losses unfortunately I've had health

1893
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,560
problems

1894
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,480
um along the way as well so it's a

1895
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,600
double whammy when you're not well and

1896
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:14,339
trying to do things that

1897
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,159
um you know take effort

1898
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:19,140
so one of the questions we got submitted

1899
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:20,819
quite a fair bit from the viewers across

1900
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,699
both Instagram and patreon was that they

1901
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:25,619
were wondering these days how do you

1902
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:27,419
Source new genetics do you find it's

1903
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:30,300
becoming increasingly more difficult to

1904
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,739
find good sources for stock

1905
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,400
no

1906
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:35,579
um

1907
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,500
no I've always been the type that

1908
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:38,939
I help out my friends and my friends

1909
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,399
help me

1910
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:43,919
um so I try to be good to people and

1911
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:45,599
then people are also good to me so

1912
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,000
um it's kind of a Karma thing

1913
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,880
um you know if you're just trying to do

1914
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,039
uh your intentions are good

1915
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,859
um you know you should get something

1916
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:58,079
back with the good intentions

1917
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:00,479
um so I don't find it hard to find new

1918
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:02,039
genetics but it's also there's a lot of

1919
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,678
genetics that just need to be preserved

1920
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:06,960
already that still need work so there's

1921
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:09,420
no there's there's no time to lose

1922
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,859
there's a lot of work to be done and not

1923
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:15,060
enough time to do it

1924
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:17,519
sure so in general would you Advocate

1925
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,739
that people should be open to the idea

1926
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,719
of like maybe traveling to some of these

1927
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:23,218
native zones where land races come from

1928
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,500
and sort of doing their own little

1929
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:27,960
Expeditions or do you feel like overall

1930
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,880
it's it's probably too diluted and like

1931
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,560
maybe hard to find real stuff

1932
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,819
it depends on what kind of person you

1933
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,780
are

1934
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:36,119
um

1935
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:38,460
some places that are you know

1936
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:42,000
historically cannabis producing places

1937
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:45,539
have been dangerous for some people and

1938
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,779
depending on your level of

1939
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:50,640
um Danger uh your ability to deal with

1940
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:54,380
diseases

1941
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:57,300
um lack of food lack of services

1942
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:58,800
may affect your ability to go and get

1943
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:01,440
some of these things

1944
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,239
um other times you can you can go on a

1945
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,738
trip and find certain things but it just

1946
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:06,238
depends on

1947
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:08,459
um how you're trying to Source things

1948
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,500
are you trying to get it from a reseller

1949
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,779
or are you trying to go directly to the

1950
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,840
grower up in the hills

1951
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:18,719
um sometimes going directly to the hills

1952
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,179
won't work because they've already sold

1953
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,460
what they had to the resellers that sell

1954
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:25,380
them at the beach say in Mexico so if

1955
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,819
you go to the highlands of Oaxaca you

1956
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,500
may not find anything there because

1957
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:32,519
they've already sold everything that has

1958
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:35,520
been sold at you know the local beaches

1959
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,980
um and then the the cartels are

1960
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,620
something to deal with because you know

1961
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:42,178
you could end up with your body's head

1962
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:44,579
cut off or something like that because

1963
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:47,158
you're in the wrong place

1964
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:49,800
um so this depends on the country the

1965
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:51,059
place you're trying to go

1966
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,179
um

1967
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:55,800
yeah but I mean a lot of these there's a

1968
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,179
lot of countries in a lot of places that

1969
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,820
a lot of the the varieties are

1970
01:13:57,179 --> 01:14:01,679
disappearing so if you are historically

1971
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:03,359
trying to help these people uh

1972
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,600
documentation

1973
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:09,059
um and and helping them is a way that

1974
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,659
people could could do it you know

1975
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,000
um

1976
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:13,559
we're trying to figure out ways of doing

1977
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,658
some people are trying to help the

1978
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:17,219
people by providing you know vegetable

1979
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:20,639
seeds and

1980
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:21,899
um a way to sell those those foods and

1981
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,060
try to make something for those

1982
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:27,000
communities so they can be preserved

1983
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,620
um unfortunately a lot of cannabis

1984
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,679
producing areas have gone to like

1985
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:32,760
poppies or other things because

1986
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:37,140
um they're just trying to survive

1987
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:38,520
because of drought because of the um the

1988
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:42,119
laws

1989
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:44,400
um or the the racism that's gone on that

1990
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:45,658
kills like indigenous peoples

1991
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,000
um

1992
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:49,920
so we we need to say what's here before

1993
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,899
it's lost because every year things lost

1994
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,399
even a few years ago uh certain places

1995
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:55,319
are producing cannabis are producing

1996
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:57,420
cannabis anymore you know

1997
01:14:55,319 --> 01:14:59,579
um so there's there's a lot of loss and

1998
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:02,399
these people need help and their history

1999
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:05,279
needs to be preserved so

2000
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,079
I say you could go to certain places

2001
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:09,359
absolutely

2002
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:11,880
um but um sometimes

2003
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,559
you may going be going to a place that

2004
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,600
uh you're not gonna be able to find

2005
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,120
anything anyway so you need to do your

2006
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,100
homework and um

2007
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:21,599
there's got to be ways that we could

2008
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,400
actually help each other and help these

2009
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,380
indigenous peoples

2010
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:27,658
um so

2011
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,060
I think eventually we're working with

2012
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:31,859
like-minded people around the world uh

2013
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:34,140
we can help out these communities a

2014
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:37,439
little bit better and maybe like a

2015
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,940
global seed bank which the the funds

2016
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,799
will actually trickle down to the people

2017
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:42,299
actually should get it not just the

2018
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,860
people at the top

2019
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,239
do you think that something like that

2020
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:46,979
will happen or it might be like

2021
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:50,459
difficult to sort of get people on board

2022
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:51,479
no I I I think it should happen and it

2023
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,739
could happen

2024
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:54,779
um it just has to have the right people

2025
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:57,000
involved

2026
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:59,158
yeah I'd be interested to hear your

2027
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,439
thoughts on the recent legalization by

2028
01:15:59,158 --> 01:16:03,238
the Thai government I've often sort of

2029
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,460
in recent weeks sat and wondered to

2030
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:08,759
myself if there would be like a

2031
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:11,520
Resurgence in sort of Thai terroir

2032
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,380
produced land race and and like if the

2033
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,640
quality of it would be any good or do

2034
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,960
you suspect like you know people over

2035
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,579
there are just going to grow like modern

2036
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,039
you know stuff

2037
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:22,198
it depends I mean the terroir type stuff

2038
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,420
would be beneficial and it'd be good for

2039
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,158
the people uh along the borders but then

2040
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,020
you have the indigenous people that were

2041
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:29,579
you know growing these varieties to

2042
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,199
begin with

2043
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:32,819
um they've been forced from place to

2044
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:35,759
place anyway

2045
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:37,380
um for hundreds of years so

2046
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,840
um there should be protection for these

2047
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,400
people and there should be uh ability

2048
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,380
ability for these people to grow some

2049
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:46,679
things but if they're growing

2050
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:48,900
hemp on an island

2051
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:51,060
uh you know and destroying the the the

2052
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:53,219
lines that were indigenous that area

2053
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,020
were acclimatized the area

2054
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:57,060
um it's going to be like counter

2055
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:59,460
defeating the issue but you know like

2056
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:01,320
anything the people that are going to be

2057
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,939
able to grow these varieties usually the

2058
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:05,519
ones that have money

2059
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:07,198
um so it's a tough thing it should be

2060
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,080
kind of like

2061
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:12,599
um a protection as well as

2062
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,219
um like a historical type thing where

2063
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,900
we'll preserve the knowledge of the

2064
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:17,760
people along with the strains because

2065
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:20,698
it's like um

2066
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:23,100
you know it's like global history these

2067
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:26,460
varieties so there should be protection

2068
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:28,860
and uh the legalization will impart good

2069
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:31,439
things and bad things it always does

2070
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:34,139
yeah I'm certainly interested to see how

2071
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:36,000
it plays out it'll be um it'll be really

2072
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:39,020
cool to see if they started pumping out

2073
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,539
like some like really intentionally

2074
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:44,820
farmed Thai land race like what a

2075
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,439
treasure that would be well I'm actually

2076
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:47,399
trying to work with some of the people

2077
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:50,339
there

2078
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:53,099
um that are there now on you know things

2079
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:54,900
like that as we speak so some of the

2080
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:57,900
stuff I'm growing right now is from some

2081
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:00,658
of the Resurgence of the tie lines there

2082
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:02,399
preservation ties uh analyzing them so

2083
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:05,639
that is being worked on

2084
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:07,619
um I hope that we can do more of it and

2085
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,380
then make it so that

2086
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:13,640
they are preserved and not just you know

2087
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:16,079
it's just a a grab for genetics because

2088
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,239
it's more important than just the

2089
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:21,479
genetics it's the people it's the

2090
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:23,218
history there's there's more to it and I

2091
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:26,339
hope to to be able to help some of that

2092
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:28,380
if possible yeah look I'm sure you're

2093
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:31,619
gonna have a monumentally positive

2094
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:34,199
impact in it all out of curiosity would

2095
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:36,539
you look to go in there and want to sort

2096
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:38,039
of try to use the tie that's there that

2097
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:39,840
might be available or would you want to

2098
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:41,698
bring in like some of your own stuff

2099
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,440
that you think are this may not even

2100
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:46,678
exist there anymore

2101
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,879
well there's there's always that so I

2102
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:49,079
think there's enough time varieties

2103
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,119
there that

2104
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:53,158
they have enough but there might be a

2105
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,899
few that maybe need to be reintroduced

2106
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:56,099
but the majority of stuff they already

2107
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:58,259
have it

2108
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,579
um some places around the world I've

2109
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,800
tried to introduce stuff that's been

2110
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:04,319
lost like in in Mexico a lot of the

2111
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,260
varieties that they once had needed to

2112
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:10,019
be reintroduced so I've tried to

2113
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:12,539
um send seeds to places that

2114
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:15,480
um these varieties originally came from

2115
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:16,859
and tried to get them re-established in

2116
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,019
the property the same thing with wine

2117
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:22,139
varieties I've been trying to send uh

2118
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,480
Hawaiian Lions to people in Hawaii to

2119
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:25,140
get them to grow these lines again

2120
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:27,299
um

2121
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:29,219
I don't know if it's

2122
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,300
um naive or not but um you know

2123
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:32,279
hopefully

2124
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:34,860
there'll be some kind of resurgence for

2125
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:36,840
these varieties being grown in a place

2126
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:38,399
of origin Hawaii is kind of like not the

2127
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:40,860
same thing but

2128
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:43,679
um the idea is to bring back old

2129
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:45,420
varieties like gold and the Guerreros

2130
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,640
and the mutual cons and have them grown

2131
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:49,560
by the people that have lost them some

2132
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,420
of them have tried to get them out of

2133
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,580
the country to save them because the

2134
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:56,579
cartels have basically forced them to

2135
01:19:53,579 --> 01:19:57,539
stop growing these varieties

2136
01:19:56,579 --> 01:19:59,399
um

2137
01:19:57,539 --> 01:20:01,560
but they're trying to get them out to

2138
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:03,359
preserve them or protect them

2139
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:06,179
um the cartels are usually like young

2140
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:07,979
kids like you know 12 13 16 year olds

2141
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:10,500
all messed out and you know they create

2142
01:20:07,979 --> 01:20:13,379
like their own gangs like Zetas and

2143
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:15,899
stuff a lot of these are just young kids

2144
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,179
um unfortunately and they they get all

2145
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:20,339
messed out and they go attack other you

2146
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:21,840
know groups and kill each other and they

2147
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,880
get Savage because they've been on meth

2148
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,800
for so many weeks and months

2149
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,420
um but they also destroy you know the

2150
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,100
Cannabis production and then they go to

2151
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:31,020
poppies or something else that's you

2152
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,060
know quick to make money unfortunately

2153
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,340
but these these lost lines need to be

2154
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:36,960
reintroduced and saved

2155
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,239
um and I think the only way to do it is

2156
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,920
to kind of reproduce them somewhere else

2157
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:43,619
and then bring it in and then hopefully

2158
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,300
when things have stabilized some wet you

2159
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:46,859
know have it spread to more of these

2160
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,480
farmers

2161
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:50,698
and that should be done in Thailand and

2162
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:52,319
other places but some of it should be

2163
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:54,599
maintained and you know you shouldn't

2164
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,359
have been bringing in things you know

2165
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,800
um like if you're on a strain hunting uh

2166
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:01,079
Safari you shouldn't be bringing your

2167
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,119
hybridized Dutch varieties and giving it

2168
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:04,619
to the locals because it just pollutes

2169
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:06,359
the gene pool

2170
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:07,380
I'm so glad you touched on that because

2171
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:10,259
that was going to be the next question

2172
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:12,239
about our Dutch friends but um I would

2173
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,920
love to quickly touch on because we've

2174
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,678
had this discussion with a few people in

2175
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,480
the past but someone mentioned you know

2176
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:20,760
what what are you meant to take them if

2177
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,139
you're not gonna take them seeds and you

2178
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:24,600
know that's a great question we should

2179
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:26,940
delve into it vegetable seeds well it

2180
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,340
depends on the place that's like in

2181
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:30,599
Nepal Bodhi was trading them vegetable

2182
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,880
seeds you know something that they can

2183
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:35,520
grow you're not bringing in

2184
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,400
invasive strains you can get this the

2185
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,199
the seeds there locally but you're just

2186
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,779
providing more of what's already there

2187
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:44,158
to Farmers that have you know no money

2188
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:46,139
or a little money and you're providing

2189
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:48,000
something that can grow for food

2190
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,860
um food's always something that's you

2191
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,738
know we take for granted because we have

2192
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:54,359
supermarkets and most places around the

2193
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:56,099
world they don't have supermarkets you

2194
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:57,960
know even in Italy you have like markets

2195
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,699
but they don't have like what we do in

2196
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,140
in the United States or in other

2197
01:21:59,698 --> 01:22:02,339
countries where you can have these big

2198
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,560
huge places with all these different

2199
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:08,340
foods and meats and availability we just

2200
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,780
live so much higher uh lives than a lot

2201
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,760
of people do around the world we take

2202
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:14,519
for granted that you know

2203
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,340
seed stock of vegetables is is you know

2204
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,179
desirable and much needed and food in

2205
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,400
general

2206
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:22,440
so that would be one thing it just you

2207
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:25,079
find something that could be

2208
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:27,238
um used by them that you know does take

2209
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:28,439
up a lot of room see it's as long as

2210
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:30,178
they're not

2211
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:32,158
um brought in from another country and

2212
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:33,239
have diseases or pests which can be

2213
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,500
negative that's why you don't want to

2214
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:37,379
bring stuff from your country because

2215
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,579
you can bring invasive insects like

2216
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,199
stuff from China if people are getting

2217
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:42,359
seeds from China a lot of those have

2218
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:43,979
like weevils and and mites and different

2219
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:46,920
things that could destroy your seeds and

2220
01:22:43,979 --> 01:22:48,178
destroy your socks sucks so uh freezing

2221
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,619
your seeds before you bring them in

2222
01:22:48,179 --> 01:22:50,940
would be important but you should do

2223
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:53,099
that for all kinds of seeds that you're

2224
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:54,960
bringing in from another country that's

2225
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,120
why they have these sanitation

2226
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,500
certificates that you're supposed to use

2227
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,840
when importing seeds from other

2228
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:03,479
countries it's important because you

2229
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,520
know you're bringing in pests and you

2230
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:09,059
could be the one that was responsible

2231
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,800
for a plague uh you know insects that

2232
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,480
are bringing a certain fungus that's

2233
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,779
killing all the different citrus fruits

2234
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:17,519
or trees because you bought in cannabis

2235
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:19,800
seeds from somewhere you know that has

2236
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,540
this this type of insect that has this

2237
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,039
type of mold with it you know or this

2238
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:25,439
virus

2239
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:27,658
um it's all connected but if you get

2240
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:30,238
something from that country usually safe

2241
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:32,158
and you can buy it in bulk you know it's

2242
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,658
not too expensive and then you bring it

2243
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,939
to the people or you find something that

2244
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:37,859
you could trade with them that they want

2245
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:40,439
but those would be better things than

2246
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:43,079
providing genetics that can pollute

2247
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:45,960
there but they already have but

2248
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:49,019
if they have sources to you know

2249
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:51,140
International genetics already uh they

2250
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:54,179
can also import them themselves you know

2251
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:56,520
they can import that and dilute their

2252
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:59,279
their uh gene pool by themselves you

2253
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:01,440
don't need extra help from us

2254
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,779
definitely they definitely are people

2255
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:06,299
out there in uh these land race areas

2256
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:08,099
who came to grow some Californian stuff

2257
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,020
so I guess there needs to be some

2258
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,840
acceptance of that just as a follow-up

2259
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:15,060
to the last one if you were you know

2260
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:17,520
totally relieved of all responsibilities

2261
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,620
and we're totally able to go anywhere do

2262
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,179
a land race Expedition where would you

2263
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:24,000
want to head off to

2264
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:26,579
well before the uh the government went

2265
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,579
haywire I wanted to go to Miramar what

2266
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:30,779
was previously Burma and explore uh all

2267
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,658
that because

2268
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:35,639
um there's so many uh temples and

2269
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:38,599
there's quite a large country in you

2270
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:42,060
know between India and um you know

2271
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,739
southeast Asia so it you know a lot of

2272
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,880
export varieties could have been there

2273
01:24:43,738 --> 01:24:47,099
and there's a lot of different

2274
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,659
indigenous peoples groups that are kind

2275
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:51,539
of you know been cut off from the rest

2276
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:54,059
of the world so it's kind of like a

2277
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:56,279
um what do you call it like a a time

2278
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:58,699
capsule you know these people are living

2279
01:24:56,279 --> 01:25:01,800
in decades you know or

2280
01:24:58,698 --> 01:25:04,079
hundreds of decades behind some of us in

2281
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:06,360
a ways so uh finding some interesting

2282
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:09,420
stuff there would have been pretty cool

2283
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:11,339
um uh Africa going to the Congolese

2284
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,640
Basin countries uh a lot of that stuff

2285
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:17,520
has been uh pretty um

2286
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:20,820
pretty hard to get into and as far as

2287
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,980
the diseases and uh just the unruliness

2288
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:25,679
of the gorilla type

2289
01:25:22,979 --> 01:25:28,799
um you know armies in there uh it's it's

2290
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,658
really a hard place to get into a lot of

2291
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,060
that's been kind of um

2292
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:35,579
this range because the Belgian

2293
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:37,560
people had gone there and tried to take

2294
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:39,719
over the Congo years ago and they had

2295
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:41,400
hemp varieties so there's a lot of hemp

2296
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:43,679
varieties that were Escape cultivars

2297
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:45,000
into the congoley Congo and the

2298
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,158
Congolese Basin countries that surround

2299
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,079
it uh so a lot of people that think

2300
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:51,839
these there's indigenous sativas there

2301
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:54,000
some of it might be uh Escape cultivars

2302
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,079
that um you know acclimatized in the

2303
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,719
environment

2304
01:25:55,079 --> 01:26:01,260
another place would be some of the um

2305
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:02,460
South African South American countries

2306
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,380
um I definitely like to go back into

2307
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:07,439
Mexico I've been there a couple times

2308
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:08,819
and trying to find things but Mexico uh

2309
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:12,960
would love to find some more stuff down

2310
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:15,319
now down to Columbia uh Bolivia Peru uh

2311
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,939
that'll be uh fun places to go look at

2312
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:20,279
yeah certainly and and you touched on um

2313
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:21,599
you know a magical talking point which

2314
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:23,698
is that I wanted to ask you about what's

2315
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,440
your opinions on the Congolese you know

2316
01:26:23,698 --> 01:26:27,599
we don't see them represented too much

2317
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:30,238
but they are some really special strains

2318
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:33,420
what's your thoughts on them

2319
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:35,879
well the there is

2320
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,260
um there's there's pygmy peoples there

2321
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:39,060
there's several different groups of

2322
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,260
pygmies that are in the Congolese Basin

2323
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:42,360
countries

2324
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:46,079
um and I'll I'll make this reference in

2325
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:48,599
Egypt they had their gods and one of

2326
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,219
their gods was named Bess best was a

2327
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,340
pygmy

2328
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:56,939
um dark-skinned pygmy and he was a

2329
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:59,819
fertility God and in their fertility

2330
01:26:56,939 --> 01:27:00,539
um bases they would find

2331
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:02,880
um

2332
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:04,859
cannabis residue and seeds

2333
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,179
now the pygmies were from the Congolese

2334
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:08,219
Basin country they weren't from like

2335
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:10,800
where Egypt was now

2336
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:13,319
um so they must have seen that these

2337
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,880
indigenous pygmies were consuming uh

2338
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:15,658
cannabis

2339
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,159
um and they were using it for

2340
01:27:15,658 --> 01:27:18,539
childbirthing you know for the pain and

2341
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:20,638
everything so they were using it in the

2342
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:23,579
ancient past for that purpose

2343
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,679
um the other people that were a close

2344
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:27,779
relative to the pygmy people were the

2345
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,960
Kalahari bush people and these are some

2346
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:33,960
of the oldest known the oldest like

2347
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:35,939
people living on Earth that are closest

2348
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,520
to modern humans

2349
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:40,799
um but you know still a distant

2350
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,980
um human and these people are closest

2351
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,139
related to the pygmy people

2352
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:47,638
um it seems like these the Kalahari

2353
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:49,440
Bushmen

2354
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:53,100
um have a cannabis history

2355
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:55,678
um but their their genetics go back to a

2356
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,880
very old age where it seems like they

2357
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,440
left

2358
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,139
um Africa

2359
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:04,379
um maybe

2360
01:28:00,139 --> 01:28:06,840
76 000 years ago up to 130 000 years ago

2361
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:10,260
and then went into like southeast Asia

2362
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:13,739
and then back to South Africa

2363
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:15,360
um during like floods of the world

2364
01:28:13,738 --> 01:28:17,698
um so we're talking about a time frame

2365
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:20,039
of like 130 000 years

2366
01:28:17,698 --> 01:28:21,719
um and then you see in their genetics if

2367
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:24,539
you see a picture of a Kalahari Bushman

2368
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:25,380
you see that they have Asian

2369
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:29,880
um

2370
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:33,420
features like from China or Laos

2371
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:35,460
um and then I and in the early 90s or

2372
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:37,380
early 2000s I was looking at DNA because

2373
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:41,819
the they did the whole Genome Project

2374
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:45,539
and I found that these people have

2375
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:48,840
um Asian descent back you know from like

2376
01:28:45,539 --> 01:28:51,060
70 to 130 000 years ago so basically the

2377
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,739
genetic testing confirmed what I saw in

2378
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:55,260
the pictures

2379
01:28:52,738 --> 01:28:57,119
um I also looked up the phonetic words

2380
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,880
for cannabis that were similar to these

2381
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,500
Kalahari Bushmen for the same use and I

2382
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,119
I looked it up phonetically and then I

2383
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,979
looked up the pictures these people and

2384
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:06,300
then I backed it up with genetic

2385
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:07,859
sequencing

2386
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,800
um that they left

2387
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:12,420
um Africa and then came back

2388
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,060
um you know

2389
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:17,279
at one point which was kind of crazy so

2390
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:19,800
if you guys have time look up the sun

2391
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,119
people or the Kalahari Bushmen

2392
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,860
and you can see that they have like

2393
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:24,260
Asian descent but these are black

2394
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:26,639
indigenous

2395
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:29,400
Africans and there's supposed to be like

2396
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,840
the oldest living people on Earth

2397
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:32,399
um that are like you know been in the

2398
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,100
same place

2399
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:37,979
um you know from time immoral basically

2400
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:40,139
so my thoughts are that Candace left

2401
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:42,359
Africa with them or with other

2402
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:44,219
indigenous people and that's how it's

2403
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:47,119
spread around the world is from Africa

2404
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:51,359
and then you know went to the Americas

2405
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:53,340
uh went through uh Africa through the

2406
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,380
Middle East after the kyber pass through

2407
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:58,319
Afghanistan up and through China up

2408
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:00,420
through India and Southeast Asia and

2409
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:03,299
then down through Australia and then

2410
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:04,980
land bridges to Americas there's a lot

2411
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,719
of

2412
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:09,119
um

2413
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:12,359
knowledge and genetics that show uh

2414
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:14,219
travel during the low

2415
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:15,779
um the times when the waters were lower

2416
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:17,158
and there was more islands that there

2417
01:30:15,779 --> 01:30:18,960
was more

2418
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:21,299
um trans-pacific

2419
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,340
um migration of peoples like some of the

2420
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,880
people that are in Mexico kind of like

2421
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,980
um

2422
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:30,000
they look like some of the Africans from

2423
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:30,658
Western Africa around Senegal

2424
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,119
um

2425
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:36,059
and these are some of like the oldest

2426
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:37,500
um Mexican peoples in the uh the

2427
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:39,420
Americas

2428
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,219
basically they tracked all these old

2429
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,739
people ancient civilizations and found a

2430
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:45,600
lot of cannabis history among almost all

2431
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:47,579
the ancient civilizations and it's in

2432
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,800
the book I wrote which I'm still trying

2433
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:51,840
to finish up so there's a book on all

2434
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,100
this craziness as well but it needs to

2435
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,159
be finished

2436
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:58,199
oh wow any idea of when you know might

2437
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,299
sort of be looking to be done

2438
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:02,698
well hopefully next

2439
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:04,860
year or so but maybe sooner it's been

2440
01:31:02,698 --> 01:31:07,319
done but the the publisher said it was

2441
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:09,179
too big so I separated two books so the

2442
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:11,698
first book is called uh the tree of

2443
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:16,380
knowledge and it's basically um talks

2444
01:31:11,698 --> 01:31:18,000
about the two um the trees that were in

2445
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,199
the Garden of Eden one was the tree of

2446
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,300
knowledge and one was the tree of life

2447
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:23,638
so I based the tree of knowledge being

2448
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,199
the varieties that give you

2449
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:27,719
um knowledge and then the trio life

2450
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:30,000
being the varieties that give you

2451
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:32,460
um you know life like uh you know

2452
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,698
healing properties so I kind of separate

2453
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:37,920
the two in the the two books ah okay so

2454
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:40,138
sort of like psychedelics encounter this

2455
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,840
sort of thing well they're both cannabis

2456
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:45,300
but more of like uh the the varieties

2457
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,860
that give you knowledge and the ones

2458
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,060
that kind of have more healing

2459
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:50,519
properties so I've kind of separated

2460
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,080
them like the Indica hash plants and to

2461
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,719
one book and like the team is

2462
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:57,420
equatorials Mexicans and all that to

2463
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,158
another book so it's kind of splitting

2464
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:01,500
up the Cannabis genome into kind of two

2465
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:03,000
different sections yeah well beautiful

2466
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,319
stuff that's something to look forward

2467
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,960
to in the future

2468
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:09,119
hopefully as long as my health uh keeps

2469
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,980
up but yes yeah that should be uh

2470
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:12,719
something to kind of put my knowledge

2471
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:15,658
down on paper and kind of give people

2472
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:17,520
some interesting history to uh to look

2473
01:32:15,658 --> 01:32:19,019
at because everybody loves history as

2474
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,239
long as as well as cannabis history

2475
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:23,340
there's so much there that people are

2476
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:24,839
just not aware of that it you know kind

2477
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:26,940
of highlighting some of it's kind of a

2478
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,980
cool thing to do to kind of

2479
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:31,559
definitely and and during your answer

2480
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:33,799
you referenced uh you know the the

2481
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,239
migration of things down to Australia

2482
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,920
what I'd be interested to know is

2483
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:40,678
earlier on in the interview you also

2484
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,359
reference Mala Madness what's your

2485
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:44,100
thoughts on Modern Madness and do you

2486
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:45,899
know if it has any relation to Old

2487
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,679
Mother sativa or if they're quite

2488
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:48,539
different

2489
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:50,639
you know I don't I haven't grown old

2490
01:32:48,539 --> 01:32:53,100
mother sativa so I don't know

2491
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:55,020
um but a lot of those lines were there's

2492
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,340
a lot of Thai varieties

2493
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:59,159
um Colombians

2494
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:00,300
uh that were grown in Australia so

2495
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:02,158
there's a lot of Southeast Asian

2496
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,860
varieties grown there

2497
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:08,158
um so from the Mulan buddy Madness it

2498
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:11,099
has a certain growth structure that was

2499
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:12,599
um similar to uh the the Neville's Haze

2500
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,280
that I saw

2501
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,260
um so that's why I was coming up with

2502
01:33:14,279 --> 01:33:18,960
you know thinking that mall and Buddy

2503
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:20,699
Madness might be the source of

2504
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,500
um like the Neville's Haze instead of it

2505
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:24,779
being like um you know like a haze

2506
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,060
variety and anyway the Mullen bunny

2507
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:29,579
Madness uh has this upright structure

2508
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:30,960
I'd have to see some pictures of it and

2509
01:33:29,579 --> 01:33:33,238
you can see it's got a certain growth

2510
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,179
similar to zamal where it's kind of like

2511
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:37,678
an upright plant lots of shoots

2512
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:39,179
um lots of smaller flowers coming up

2513
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,880
from it but it's got a certain growth

2514
01:33:39,179 --> 01:33:43,679
look to it when it's flowering out like

2515
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:45,719
an upright plant

2516
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,158
um just unique

2517
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:49,859
um so maybe it's coming from some of the

2518
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:51,238
Thai varieties that it it you know that

2519
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:53,939
were there

2520
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:55,799
um but Australia's got some very good uh

2521
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:59,460
varieties you know from the the Thai

2522
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:00,659
lines the the the closeness to Papua New

2523
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,460
Guinea there's a lot of varieties from

2524
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:04,738
Papua New Guinea

2525
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:07,198
um the surrounding Islands Malaysia

2526
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:09,959
there's a lot of small stuff that's you

2527
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,939
know been through Indonesia that you

2528
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,679
know because of the drug laws they're so

2529
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:15,839
stringent that not much of it gets out

2530
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:18,119
of there but like Sumatra and Indonesia

2531
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,819
Malaysia there were some good varieties

2532
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:22,260
but they don't get any um knowledge of

2533
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:24,119
because of the drug laws you know you

2534
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:26,639
don't want to be king to death um not

2535
01:34:24,119 --> 01:34:28,738
not a cool thing for smoking cannabis or

2536
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,340
having a couple seeds

2537
01:34:28,738 --> 01:34:32,158
um

2538
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:34,139
but there's a lot of cool stuff that you

2539
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:35,460
know Australia do the proximity has been

2540
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:38,159
able to get

2541
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:40,800
um and create some really cool stuff

2542
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:42,359
um and you you look at the the size of

2543
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,300
the plants that grow in Australia the

2544
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:46,679
trees the trees have some growth with

2545
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:49,139
the eucalyptus and some of the other

2546
01:34:46,679 --> 01:34:51,600
trees that grow so large so fast that

2547
01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:54,119
cannabis that grows there also has some

2548
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,440
of those effects so acclimatizing stuff

2549
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:57,238
to Australia and then growing them

2550
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,819
elsewhere would be a great thing for

2551
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:04,019
some of the canvas breeders because of

2552
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:06,299
just the the environment of Australia

2553
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:09,139
yeah beautiful you heard it guys buy

2554
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,139
some of my seeds

2555
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:14,520
sorry just kidding around we've got a

2556
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:16,198
nice uh pool of fan submitted questions

2557
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,179
here but before we get into them I

2558
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:19,799
wanted to ask you this one might be hard

2559
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:21,539
maybe should have given it to you

2560
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,900
earlier to think about but

2561
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:28,019
how would you rank the overall hierarchy

2562
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:29,939
of hazes and when I say that I mean heck

2563
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,139
you could just say like Colombian at the

2564
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:32,698
top or something but you know what I

2565
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:34,619
mean for all the people who say they

2566
01:35:32,698 --> 01:35:36,178
like Hayes what's the hierarchy for you

2567
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:38,158
what's the number one and then how would

2568
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:41,060
you sort of rank them

2569
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:41,059
oh

2570
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,619
that's a really tough question

2571
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,198
um

2572
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:52,380
I don't know if I can answer it uh

2573
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:53,638
honestly because uh I just I love I love

2574
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:56,279
them all

2575
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:58,440
yeah that's a good answer as well you

2576
01:35:56,279 --> 01:36:00,000
know and and depending on the phenotype

2577
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:01,138
or the plant you know they could be a

2578
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,658
little bit different or something

2579
01:36:01,139 --> 01:36:07,980
special I uh especially like the Purple

2580
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:10,079
Haze phenotypes I like the

2581
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:11,759
um the profile the turpins because they

2582
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:14,760
have this like uh

2583
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,400
this port wine you know this grapey port

2584
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:19,679
liquor

2585
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:22,439
profile which kind of um like a

2586
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:25,579
Blackberry port wine liqueur

2587
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:29,279
um Aroma and taste but uh the high is

2588
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:31,019
luxurious transcending uh mind expanding

2589
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:31,800
psychedelic

2590
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,980
um

2591
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,360
and this the flavors and taste just uh

2592
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:39,119
you know

2593
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:40,259
make it luxurious and the effects it's

2594
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:42,260
just amazing

2595
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,260
um

2596
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:47,760
yeah it's hard to say I think um

2597
01:36:45,539 --> 01:36:49,679
the old timer's hazes which is not like

2598
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,199
real Haze but it's you know like a haze

2599
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,980
those Colombians are very special

2600
01:36:52,198 --> 01:36:55,678
um

2601
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:57,479
but some of the hazes that were uh like

2602
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,219
original Haze are very good too but it's

2603
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:01,678
a different type of effect

2604
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:02,760
but they're also very special it just

2605
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,359
depends

2606
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:08,820
sorry for the shitty answer guys

2607
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,738
no that's fine totally understandable I

2608
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:12,840
did notice in your catalog you had uh

2609
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:14,218
the black raspberry Haze it sounded

2610
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:16,619
pretty interesting can you tell me a

2611
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:19,139
little more about it okay well the black

2612
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:20,760
raspberry Haze it was uh it was just

2613
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:23,219
called Black Raspberry at one time but I

2614
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,880
didn't realize Bodhi had

2615
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:27,420
um

2616
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:29,880
a black raspberry uh had named his right

2617
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:31,800
before mine so I put the haze because it

2618
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:34,619
has the purple tine Devil's Haze in it

2619
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:38,520
it's basically the Maduro

2620
01:37:34,619 --> 01:37:39,599
which is organ purple tie line braid uh

2621
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,260
done by

2622
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,199
um

2623
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:45,420
RC colas in in Canada and he basically

2624
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:48,299
uh bred

2625
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:51,658
the Oregon purple tie traits out and

2626
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:55,619
made it more uh you know forward in the

2627
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:57,479
line and he he grew the line out of um a

2628
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:59,760
blue moonshine and then another organ

2629
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:01,979
purple Thai variety

2630
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:05,460
um and then pulled out the traits so

2631
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:08,879
Maduro is an organ purple tie dominant

2632
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:10,500
um variety and I used

2633
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,500
um

2634
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:16,198
a couple phenotypes for that and they

2635
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,800
turned purple and blue and red

2636
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:18,479
um

2637
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,699
when I was growing them and those were

2638
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:23,579
the mothers I used for the black

2639
01:38:20,698 --> 01:38:25,919
raspberry Haze and then the male I chose

2640
01:38:23,579 --> 01:38:29,760
um was the one that has the purple

2641
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:31,380
um trichomes on the the sepals so the

2642
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:35,760
male flowers that have the little Pond

2643
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:38,880
sacks had uh standing trichomes which is

2644
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:42,000
not too usual for male and they were

2645
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:45,060
purple coloration of the resin glands

2646
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,060
um and I use that mail on the Maduro

2647
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:50,760
line so it's organ purple tie

2648
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:52,080
with the Neville's Haze purple tie male

2649
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,360
line

2650
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:56,219
um so it's an F3 Neville's Haze with the

2651
01:38:54,359 --> 01:38:58,738
purple tie and the organ purple tie so

2652
01:38:56,219 --> 01:39:02,279
it's a real special Pine levels Haze

2653
01:38:58,738 --> 01:39:04,259
line and um the

2654
01:39:02,279 --> 01:39:05,300
black raspberry Haze

2655
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:09,500
um

2656
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:11,520
grows into these pink and purple red

2657
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,738
colored buds so you get these nice

2658
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,600
purple buds but the resins that

2659
01:39:13,738 --> 01:39:18,299
extracted from it have that color too

2660
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,699
they retain that color so extracts will

2661
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:23,579
have this like raspberry

2662
01:39:20,698 --> 01:39:26,099
um you know raspberry color like um

2663
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:28,559
Chambord you know that raspberry liqueur

2664
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:30,600
it has that color to the extract so you

2665
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:33,719
can make extracts that have this

2666
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:36,600
raspberry color to it and it makes a

2667
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:40,679
wonderful uh awesome high and they're

2668
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:42,840
tasty delectable sweet candied like

2669
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:44,940
raspberry taste

2670
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:47,159
um but it's got that nice Haze high it's

2671
01:39:44,939 --> 01:39:49,379
wonderful one person said it was the

2672
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:52,439
best high he ever smoked I said thank

2673
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:55,500
you you know it's nice but the the color

2674
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:57,299
and the special trichome resins that it

2675
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,100
produces is very special so it's it's a

2676
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:01,500
very good line to have in order to smoke

2677
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,940
great for breeding great for smoking and

2678
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:06,020
it's one of those you want to keep to

2679
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:09,539
yourself and share with special friends

2680
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:11,159
I love it stands right up my alley uh

2681
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:13,198
just while we're talking about the

2682
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:15,359
backstory of hazes quickly

2683
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:16,799
I know that this one's not made by you

2684
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,000
but I have a feeling you might be able

2685
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,460
to give me a bit of the backstory but

2686
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,420
can you tell me about the metal Haze you

2687
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:23,520
know there's not a ton of information

2688
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:25,079
about the backstory and you have used it

2689
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,360
for a few different things what's your

2690
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:28,738
thoughts on it well metal Haze was done

2691
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,139
by Dutch Flowers

2692
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:33,119
um it's a very potent line uh there was

2693
01:40:31,139 --> 01:40:35,880
you know a couple phenotypes

2694
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:38,158
um the phenotype that I got was one

2695
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:41,340
selected by the Rev he got the seeds

2696
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:43,738
from my friend four dragons

2697
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:45,480
um and he got them from the the auctions

2698
01:40:43,738 --> 01:40:47,039
and there wasn't many packs sold so

2699
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:49,678
there wasn't much metal Haze that was

2700
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,939
actually available unfortunately uh rev

2701
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:53,460
only

2702
01:40:50,939 --> 01:40:56,279
um selected the one female and then you

2703
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:59,399
know called the rest uh so there wasn't

2704
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:01,800
any to breed with I tried to take some

2705
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:05,238
F2 metal Haze that I had to breed with

2706
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:08,219
F1 but all I had was um

2707
01:41:05,238 --> 01:41:11,279
females I never got a male so I wasn't

2708
01:41:08,219 --> 01:41:12,119
able to breed the f2s to F1

2709
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,000
um

2710
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:17,819
so the metal Haze when I've looked at it

2711
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,439
and growing it out and seeing the

2712
01:41:17,819 --> 01:41:21,479
Expressions through recessives it looks

2713
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:25,198
like it's supposedly supposed to be a

2714
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:26,879
mix of a bunch of their sativas or Haze

2715
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:29,579
plants that they were growing under

2716
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,679
metal halide lights

2717
01:41:29,579 --> 01:41:33,899
um but what I saw from growing it out it

2718
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,579
it looks like it's got Mexican

2719
01:41:33,899 --> 01:41:37,439
um punto Rojo in there

2720
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:40,500
from the leaf structures

2721
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:42,658
so I think some of the the metal Haze

2722
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,520
um with the special parts that is

2723
01:41:42,658 --> 01:41:47,339
Mexican punto Rojo

2724
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:49,560
but that's just my uh interpretation of

2725
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:51,060
the leaves and uh you know some of the

2726
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,159
aspects I get from the stems and the

2727
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:55,320
coloration and that's just from you know

2728
01:41:53,158 --> 01:41:56,579
years of growing different writings that

2729
01:41:55,319 --> 01:41:58,198
could be off but that's what it looks

2730
01:41:56,579 --> 01:42:00,479
like to me so

2731
01:41:58,198 --> 01:42:02,219
um yeah so I have one called Dr Doom

2732
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:04,559
which is the metal dragon which is the

2733
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:06,719
metal Haze with the Burmese

2734
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:09,179
um in purple Vietnamese which is black

2735
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:13,319
purple phenotype which is Vietnamese

2736
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:15,179
with Vietnam Black and the Mexican Punta

2737
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:16,439
Rojo traits seem to be pretty dominant

2738
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:18,719
in that

2739
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:20,219
um and it's going to be fantastic I got

2740
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,859
some growing this year so it's gonna be

2741
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:25,980
can't wait till those are done

2742
01:42:21,859 --> 01:42:27,899
I love it sounds good uh we'll move on

2743
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:30,718
to the uh the fan submitted questions

2744
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:33,059
before we finally wrap up with the final

2745
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:35,880
five we give people the first one we got

2746
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:37,080
is a good one someone must be paying a

2747
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,819
lot of attention because I didn't even

2748
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:40,319
know about this but they said can you

2749
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:42,479
ask snow hi if you can tell us a little

2750
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,340
bit about some of the rare hemp seeds he

2751
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:46,459
has specifically I think he has some

2752
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:49,739

wow you managed to get him

2787
01:44:02,579 --> 01:44:07,019
yeah these were collected um in the

2788
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:09,419
1950s

2789
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:10,860
um or before the CR right before the

2790
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:12,658
Korean War

2791
01:44:10,859 --> 01:44:14,698
they have two varieties and they need to

2792
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:17,158
be preserved because uh they may be

2793
01:44:14,698 --> 01:44:19,319
getting unviable at this point but

2794
01:44:17,158 --> 01:44:21,179
um yeah I was trying to do um a

2795
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:24,118
preservation of hemp varieties as well

2796
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:26,039
because I think I like all cannabis and

2797
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:28,920
can there's so many different uh things

2798
01:44:26,039 --> 01:44:32,100
we could do for the world with them uh

2799
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,560
you know as far as medicine or

2800
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:37,380
um you know

2801
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:39,300
supplements or building materials

2802
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:42,000
um Plastics I mean there's so much and

2803
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:44,159
these have varieties will be just as

2804
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,840
valuable as you know these drug

2805
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:48,000
producing varieties

2806
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:50,219
um not only that you could have um you

2807
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,439
know disease resistance in some of these

2808
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:54,420
hemp varieties that may be lost in some

2809
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:55,559
of these I know drug varieties and that

2810
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:57,118
you can incorporate some of those

2811
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,119
resistances

2812
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:02,279
um and pest resistances into these you

2813
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:04,799
know drug types that might be favorable

2814
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:06,719
to certain places of the world or we can

2815
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,480
produce a hemp variety that will grow in

2816
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:11,639
a tropical Place unfortunately

2817
01:45:09,479 --> 01:45:15,839
um heat tends to make even drug

2818
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:19,560
cultivars I mean hemp cultivars into

2819
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:22,020
um like ganja because of the Heat it

2820
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:23,639
changes the the environment that it

2821
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:27,540
acclimatizes to the environment and then

2822
01:45:23,639 --> 01:45:30,359
it produces THC wow like what happened

2823
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:32,340
in the Congo with the Belgian varieties

2824
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:33,738
wow that's that's really cool to hear I

2825
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:36,360
hadn't really heard that Express before

2826
01:45:33,738 --> 01:45:38,759
there you go so

2827
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:41,339
one of the next questions we got is

2828
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:44,039
someone says right now from sort of the

2829
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:47,039
the menu the current offerings that snow

2830
01:45:44,039 --> 01:45:48,658
Ohio has what's his favorite and why

2831
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:49,319
oh my goodness

2832
01:45:48,658 --> 01:45:50,879
um

2833
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:53,099
too many favorites but one of my

2834
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:56,039
favorites right now is for a long time

2835
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:56,760
is called the devil's tit

2836
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:58,738
um

2837
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,960
basically when I first smoked the

2838
01:45:58,738 --> 01:46:02,638
parents uh the devil came to me with

2839
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,079
fruit in my ear and told me what to call

2840
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,060
it

2841
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:08,100
um

2842
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:11,760
Devil's tit is Durban Poison it was from

2843
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,539
a a clone from Mendocino that I got from

2844
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,539
um

2845
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:16,979
guy that was an old breeder that bred

2846
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:20,158
harijuana

2847
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:22,379
um he he didn't have that but he

2848
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:23,839
his friends had the Durban that I got it

2849
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:26,699
from so

2850
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:28,800
associate of that person anyway this

2851
01:46:26,698 --> 01:46:31,618
Durham poison was some of the most

2852
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,460
potent herb I've smoked to date

2853
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:34,920
um

2854
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:37,739
it turns purple has orange hairs red

2855
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,600
stems and the the devil's tattoos and

2856
01:46:37,738 --> 01:46:41,819
part of those properties

2857
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,199
um extracts from it are so powerful like

2858
01:46:41,819 --> 01:46:45,719
I've been in fetal positions because

2859
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,219
it's been just too strong

2860
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:49,260
um and I've heard that from a lot of

2861
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:50,819
people that the this is too potent for a

2862
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,440
lot of people

2863
01:46:50,819 --> 01:46:54,359
um you know and that that's not

2864
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:56,819
necessarily a bad thing you'd smoke less

2865
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:57,960
and sometimes you know you just need to

2866
01:46:56,819 --> 01:47:00,539
dose yourself a little bit less and

2867
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:03,300
you're fine uh the forest affects the

2868
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:05,158
The Taste is like strawberry lemonade or

2869
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:07,139
cherry chapstick or there's a skunk

2870
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:11,899
phenotype as well

2871
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:14,400
um all very uh rich in turpins and um

2872
01:47:11,899 --> 01:47:15,960
THC doesn't seem to be too high in that

2873
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,839
in the test results so there's something

2874
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:21,719
else in that that makes it extremely

2875
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:24,179
potent I know it's thcv or what it is

2876
01:47:21,719 --> 01:47:26,520
but something in the devil's tit

2877
01:47:24,179 --> 01:47:30,420
um makes it very very potent

2878
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:32,520
um and not all lab tests are conclusive

2879
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:34,440
because uh you know when I was testing

2880
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,300
things at the emerald cup they weren't

2881
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:37,738
testing for thcv and some other things

2882
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:39,600
so this is the problem with a lot of

2883
01:47:37,738 --> 01:47:42,059
labs they don't always test for

2884
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:44,100
everything unfortunately

2885
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:46,500
but um that was one of my favorites

2886
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:48,420
because it's um there's some faster

2887
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,880
phenotypes

2888
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:52,319
um it yields well it's got you know the

2889
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,760
the looks and smells the taste

2890
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:56,579
everything wants and it's it's got the

2891
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,800
potency Beyond and it's got equality to

2892
01:47:56,579 --> 01:48:00,658
it that's very unique

2893
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,300
um it can be a roller coaster but it's a

2894
01:48:00,658 --> 01:48:04,859
fun roller coaster

2895
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:06,900
I love that description that's beautiful

2896
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:09,599
the next question we have is someone

2897
01:48:06,899 --> 01:48:11,759
wants to know what strain do you have

2898
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:14,159
that's got the most unique terpenes and

2899
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:16,020
as a follow-up what sort of turf end

2900
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:17,698
profiles are you most interested in at

2901
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:19,619
the moment

2902
01:48:17,698 --> 01:48:23,759
oh wow

2903
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:25,198
um unique turpins there is a Mexican

2904
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,920
variety

2905
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:28,439
um

2906
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:31,800
called El Primo which is a Mexican punto

2907
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:34,198
Rojo it is uh it's got

2908
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,760
what I believe it's got this

2909
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:38,579
um

2910
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:41,219
the simple Turpin profile that is a

2911
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:43,260
fuel-like Aroma profile

2912
01:48:41,219 --> 01:48:45,719
um but it's it's basically what I think

2913
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:47,699
when people smell the chem lines they

2914
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:49,500
smell this simple Turpin profile and

2915
01:48:47,698 --> 01:48:53,158
that's what they love out of it it's

2916
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,960
like the unadulterated mixed up what

2917
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:57,719
they love out of the chem lines it's got

2918
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:59,698
that fueling smell but it's not it's not

2919
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:01,739
a sour diesel or you smell like that

2920
01:48:59,698 --> 01:49:03,359
it's just got that simple fuel Turpin

2921
01:49:01,738 --> 01:49:05,158
profile which

2922
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:08,759
is very unique

2923
01:49:05,158 --> 01:49:12,420
um but it's um psychedelic it's it's

2924
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:14,100
potent it's very luxurious

2925
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:16,319
um and it's

2926
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:18,719
it symbolized form it's it's the

2927
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:20,698
building block for what we love

2928
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,319
um in some of these lines so that's

2929
01:49:20,698 --> 01:49:23,879
coming out of that Mexican Punta Rojo

2930
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:25,618
and it's surprising because it's coming

2931
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,960
out of a Mexican cultivar and it's

2932
01:49:25,618 --> 01:49:30,179
Unique and I think that's you know what

2933
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,859
a lot of people you know been digging

2934
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:35,158
around for and can't find and I think

2935
01:49:31,859 --> 01:49:38,460
it's in one of those so El Primo is um

2936
01:49:35,158 --> 01:49:40,679
the line that um I found it in so anyway

2937
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:42,060
if people are looking for to recreate

2938
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:43,319
some of the chem lines I think that's

2939
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:45,900
where it's from

2940
01:49:43,319 --> 01:49:49,679
I also think I have um

2941
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:52,979
what created the uh the chem lines the

2942
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:55,440
Dogwood uh I think my friend made it and

2943
01:49:52,979 --> 01:49:57,178
he um he just didn't realize that's what

2944
01:49:55,439 --> 01:49:59,879
he made yeah he called it something else

2945
01:49:57,179 --> 01:50:03,359
the mongrel and it was also renamed the

2946
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:05,039
the dog bud but he called it

2947
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:06,839
the mom girl because it was a mix of

2948
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:07,500
different stuff

2949
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,739
um

2950
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:12,300
and that may just be one version of it

2951
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:13,379
um but I have the seeds I'm gonna try to

2952
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:16,079
grow them out and see what it comes out

2953
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:18,659
of them they're older so we'll see what

2954
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:21,380
did he describe it as the plants sort of

2955
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:24,599
how were they like Indica sativa

2956
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:27,300
indicas and sativas okay so they're a

2957
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:28,619
mix yeah it was a mix yeah I think he

2958
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:30,000
said like five different things he

2959
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:31,679
called it the mongrel so I have the

2960
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,300
mongrel seeds and it has the dog Bud

2961
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:35,399
seeds

2962
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:37,079
um so I you know and these dog blood

2963
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:39,539
crosses and stuff so I'll see if any of

2964
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:41,760
those will uh

2965
01:50:39,539 --> 01:50:43,439
we'll make it we'll be able to germinate

2966
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:45,960
so we'll see what comes out of them if

2967
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:48,118
they're similar or what they are wow we

2968
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,460
wait with bated breath that's cool I

2969
01:50:48,118 --> 01:50:52,500
mean you know if you had to guess the

2970
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:55,079
exact sort of genetics that were in chem

2971
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:57,300
dog what would you say it is

2972
01:50:55,079 --> 01:51:00,000
well I'd have to say that there has to

2973
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:02,340
be some Mexican in it from my

2974
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,260
you know finding this Mexican Punta Rojo

2975
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:06,000
so some Mexican

2976
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:07,380
um Afghani

2977
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,920
um

2978
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:13,260
probably Pakistani uh probably some kind

2979
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:15,300
of Southeast Asian in there too

2980
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:17,340
yeah I mean something that I've been

2981
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:18,900
discussing more with people like skunk

2982
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:21,119
VA and some of the people who are very

2983
01:51:18,899 --> 01:51:22,439
associated with the chem dogs is that a

2984
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,238
lot of people will talk about them as if

2985
01:51:22,439 --> 01:51:27,178
they're like this most hardcore Indica

2986
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:29,459
but many of them do have a decent amount

2987
01:51:27,179 --> 01:51:31,260
of sort of sativa like traits to them

2988
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:33,658
and aspects to the high they're just so

2989
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:35,880
potent you're sort of sometimes feel

2990
01:51:33,658 --> 01:51:37,618
like it's Indica right and that's right

2991
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:39,480
the Mexican comes along and it's super

2992
01:51:37,618 --> 01:51:41,819
potent it's got the chem qualities but

2993
01:51:39,479 --> 01:51:43,678
the Afghani kind of I would think would

2994
01:51:41,819 --> 01:51:45,779
go along like if you wanted to reproduce

2995
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,940
the chem wine with that Mexican Puerto

2996
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:49,979
Rojo and add some certain some specific

2997
01:51:47,939 --> 01:51:52,019
afghanis you'd have something pretty

2998
01:51:49,979 --> 01:51:54,539
close but the Monger I think was like

2999
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:57,239
five different things but

3000
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:58,618
um you know who's the I'm sure meant

3001
01:51:57,238 --> 01:51:59,879
more than one person be dog but the

3002
01:51:58,618 --> 01:52:02,639
whole thing is

3003
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,440
no one is claiming this and nobody knows

3004
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:07,440
where it came from so

3005
01:52:04,439 --> 01:52:10,678
why not my friend that did some work

3006
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:12,839
around the same time and a lot of people

3007
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:13,679
got seeds from him

3008
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,719
um

3009
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:18,118
a lot of people got seats from him and

3010
01:52:15,719 --> 01:52:20,039
then he because he got busted he kind of

3011
01:52:18,118 --> 01:52:22,259
went out of the the

3012
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:23,880
um you know from growing for a while and

3013
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:25,920
he had heart he's got heart conditions

3014
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:27,960
and issues like that so

3015
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,399
um yeah it's a bit interesting if that's

3016
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:30,658
what it is but you know who knows there

3017
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:33,179
might be some other person that created

3018
01:52:30,658 --> 01:52:34,920
dog but and there was a lot of other dog

3019
01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:36,600
lines out there there's dog [ __ ] and

3020
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:39,020
there's you know lots of people come up

3021
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:41,400
with the same name so it wouldn't be

3022
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:43,679
unlikely that more than one person

3023
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:45,839
created the same thing or something that

3024
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:48,420
was named the same thing so I'm not

3025
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,100
saying it is but uh I'm gonna dig down

3026
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:52,739
the hole and see what comes out of it

3027
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:54,960
yeah look I'm Keen to follow your

3028
01:52:52,738 --> 01:52:56,839
progress and see how that goes

3029
01:52:54,960 --> 01:53:00,539
the next question we got was a good one

3030
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:03,060
what's the most paranoia in juicing weed

3031
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:04,800
you've ever bred so one of your strains

3032
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:06,840
someone wants to get Paranoid by the

3033
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,860
sounds of it

3034
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,619
um

3035
01:53:07,859 --> 01:53:12,539
let's see here paranoiducing

3036
01:53:10,618 --> 01:53:14,039
uh there was

3037
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:17,880
um

3038
01:53:14,039 --> 01:53:19,560
one I grew that was Senegalese

3039
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:22,618
with

3040
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:28,320
Hayes and um

3041
01:53:22,618 --> 01:53:31,679
oh God it was Angola red with the tie

3042
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:35,279
so I did one with Senegalese Haze it was

3043
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:38,219
um Angola Thai with Angola red and it

3044
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:41,639
was Angola red tie

3045
01:53:38,219 --> 01:53:44,039
um Senegalese and uh like Neville's

3046
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:46,500
Hayes and I think that was one of the

3047
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:49,319
strongest paranoid inducing ones

3048
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:51,319
mostly was um from African sativas

3049
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:54,539
equatorial blinds

3050
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:55,920
ah interesting interesting okay because

3051
01:53:54,539 --> 01:53:57,479
you don't really see too many people

3052
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,300
playing with them outside of like

3053
01:53:57,479 --> 01:54:03,000
yourself and maybe gooey burrito

3054
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:06,679
yeah gooey's not too far from you know

3055
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,639
from where I grew it's in the same area

3056
01:54:06,679 --> 01:54:11,039
Northern California

3057
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,699
cool have you ever grown Mama gooey at

3058
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:14,460
all

3059
01:54:11,698 --> 01:54:16,618
I have uh gooey is very nice

3060
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:18,539
um yeah and I did some work with it I

3061
01:54:16,618 --> 01:54:20,279
need to grow some of the seeds but yeah

3062
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:22,198
it's definitely a producer it's got some

3063
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:24,479
wonderful buds on there and yeah it's

3064
01:54:22,198 --> 01:54:25,738
it's good stuff good good stuff to grow

3065
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:28,439
and breed with

3066
01:54:25,738 --> 01:54:30,000
yeah beautiful love to hear that so the

3067
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:33,299
next question we had was what's your

3068
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,039
thoughts on the makaido and how was the

3069
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,420
strain collected

3070
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:38,460
Mikado

3071
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:39,719
oh God you know I heard that was it was

3072
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:41,760
like a

3073
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:44,520
uh skunk Northern Lights Haze

3074
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,199
combination kind of like Jack Herer but

3075
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,520
other than that I don't know it's

3076
01:54:46,198 --> 01:54:50,819
definitely strong and it's got some

3077
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:53,760
unique traits to it so I don't know

3078
01:54:50,819 --> 01:54:55,380
yeah now look I I feel you on that one

3079
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,639
the next question

3080
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:58,920
um someone says can you give us some

3081
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:01,079
insight into your process of harvesting

3082
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,639
the trichomes from seeded bud with dry

3083
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:05,819
ice

3084
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,800
oh very easy so basically

3085
01:55:05,819 --> 01:55:10,319
um a lot of people are like I don't I

3086
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:12,420
can't try my my strains because I seed

3087
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:14,759
them well if you're if you seed your

3088
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:18,300
lines you basically take exceeded Buds

3089
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:19,219
and if you use dry ice with um say

3090
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:23,219
um

3091
01:55:19,219 --> 01:55:27,118
the the the the bubble bags so you use

3092
01:55:23,219 --> 01:55:29,460
uh I think 130 trichomes uh sorry

3093
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:34,139
millimeters High centimeters uh micro

3094
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:36,480
mesh so 130 micro mesh bag and you put

3095
01:55:34,139 --> 01:55:38,100
it in put your seeded buds in there with

3096
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:39,959
the dry ice crushed up and you take like

3097
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:42,840
a paint bucket and you flip it upside

3098
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:43,980
down you shake that out over

3099
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:46,020
um you know something that you can

3100
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:49,259
collect the resin glance out you can

3101
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:50,880
basically separate even fresh Bud fresh

3102
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:52,380
Bud works great

3103
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,579
um because then you have like you know

3104
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:56,819
that fresh

3105
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:58,679
um dry uh sieve and it's it hasn't been

3106
01:55:56,819 --> 01:56:01,019
decarboxylated yet

3107
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:02,760
um so you use fresh buds which are great

3108
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:04,560
or you can use the dry buds the good

3109
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,239
thing is you can separate the seeds and

3110
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:10,380
they're clean and then you got this nice

3111
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:13,559
nice fresh resin that you shake off from

3112
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:15,480
the plants and I use the 130 because it

3113
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:18,420
kind of you know it gives you the

3114
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:20,459
smaller microns and the larger mesh you

3115
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:22,380
know it kind of takes out the dust but

3116
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:25,260
allows you to get the resin glass

3117
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:26,940
and you collect that with um you know

3118
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:28,320
um a credit card or some kind of other

3119
01:56:26,939 --> 01:56:31,079
card

3120
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:33,179
um and I I usually shake them over you

3121
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:34,618
know a plastic drum that used for like

3122
01:56:33,179 --> 01:56:36,359
collecting oil or something some big

3123
01:56:34,618 --> 01:56:37,439
plastic thing you can kind of lay down

3124
01:56:36,359 --> 01:56:39,420
and collect

3125
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,919
cool that sounds great I'm gonna have to

3126
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:42,658
try that next time

3127
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:45,000
and you could you could shake out your

3128
01:56:42,658 --> 01:56:46,500
resin glands within a few minutes you

3129
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,779
know and collect them it's really a fast

3130
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:50,279
way of collecting resin glands

3131
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:52,859
and then you separate your seeds

3132
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:55,500
afterwards and uh if you wanted to

3133
01:56:52,859 --> 01:56:56,819
separate the seeds from uh the trash and

3134
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:58,979
stuff you can use

3135
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:01,618
um a two liter Coke bottle cut up with

3136
01:56:58,979 --> 01:57:03,899
strips and a vacuum um

3137
01:57:01,618 --> 01:57:05,399
uh connected to the back end of the the

3138
01:57:03,899 --> 01:57:07,439
two liter bottle and the bottom cut off

3139
01:57:05,399 --> 01:57:10,679
any kind of

3140
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:11,819
um can feed off the the Trashy sticks

3141
01:57:10,679 --> 01:57:13,199
and everything that are associated with

3142
01:57:11,819 --> 01:57:14,759
the seeds and then what will be left

3143
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:16,738
behind are the seeds because they they

3144
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:18,119
have a density and weight to them so

3145
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:19,638
it's a good way of cleaning your seeds

3146
01:57:18,118 --> 01:57:22,319
that way

3147
01:57:19,639 --> 01:57:24,179
Ah that's good I'm cleaning seeds right

3148
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,460
now so I'm going to implement this

3149
01:57:24,179 --> 01:57:28,679
I'll show you a picture of it so it's um

3150
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:31,739
you know I'll show you what it looks

3151
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:33,060
like and kind of explain to you how they

3152
01:57:31,738 --> 01:57:34,500
break down it's pretty easy you kind of

3153
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:36,360
build a little adapter to put on the

3154
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:38,099
back into the vacuum so you can use your

3155
01:57:36,359 --> 01:57:40,399
vacuum with it

3156
01:57:38,099 --> 01:57:44,340
fastest way to decede

3157
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:46,500
amazing amazing on to the last few fan

3158
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:49,380
submitted questions the next one is

3159
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:52,439
what's the most unique land race

3160
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:56,599
experience you've had

3161
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:56,598
oh God unique huh

3162
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:59,480
hmm

3163
01:58:10,859 --> 01:58:13,738
you know you got me stumped on that I

3164
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,198
don't know

3165
01:58:13,738 --> 01:58:18,479
um unique I love them all

3166
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:21,779
um I love the oh the Thai buds you know

3167
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:23,759
it's the Sweet Taste of the tie uh like

3168
01:58:21,779 --> 01:58:25,500
the dry you know it looks like you know

3169
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,020
what we used to get is Thai sticks or

3170
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:30,779
Thai buds the sweet taste the high was

3171
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:32,520
just euphoric and soaring and it's just

3172
01:58:30,779 --> 01:58:36,118
that wonderful

3173
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:38,159
um this high and it tastes so good I

3174
01:58:36,118 --> 01:58:41,698
think Thai buds are just amazing

3175
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:44,279
um you know compared to other stuff but

3176
01:58:41,698 --> 01:58:46,138
um you know I love Mexicans as well you

3177
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:48,779
know there's the Psychedelic potency the

3178
01:58:46,139 --> 01:58:51,719
quality the giggles the happiness from

3179
01:58:48,779 --> 01:58:54,300
it so I'd say it's a draw between Thai

3180
01:58:51,719 --> 01:58:55,560
Thai Thai sticks and Thai

3181
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:57,840
um and Mexican

3182
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,219
um stuff and I've had some stuff from

3183
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,779
Veracruz that was just so psyched out

3184
01:58:59,219 --> 01:59:03,300
the potent

3185
01:59:00,779 --> 01:59:05,519
um that it it can be noise-inducing as

3186
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:08,219
well very apparently inducing I remember

3187
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:11,099
being in Cancun and um smoking a big old

3188
01:59:08,219 --> 01:59:13,380
uh joint outside the window and then one

3189
01:59:11,099 --> 01:59:15,900
of the uh Federal is the guys the cops

3190
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:17,639
there shined his lights and at me

3191
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:18,899
because I was smoking outside the window

3192
01:59:17,639 --> 01:59:20,880
and I think he was trying to scare me

3193
01:59:18,899 --> 01:59:22,738
and [ __ ] with me and it got me all

3194
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:24,960
paranoid because I was smoking this you

3195
01:59:22,738 --> 01:59:27,000
know strong ass weed

3196
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,039
um that ended up flushing the rest of it

3197
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,020
down the toilet after smoking half the

3198
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,118
joint

3199
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:34,380
but it was legal at the time so I think

3200
01:59:33,118 --> 01:59:36,719
it was just a

3201
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:38,039
you know got overtaken by the paranoid

3202
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:40,020
inducing effects

3203
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:42,179
it's interesting you touched on the tie

3204
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:44,099
there because one of the questions we go

3205
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:47,399
is have you ever found an interesting

3206
01:59:44,099 --> 01:59:49,739
terpenes in the tire lines besides the

3207
01:59:47,399 --> 01:59:52,500
standard sort of spicy Haze or the lemon

3208
01:59:49,738 --> 01:59:55,079
that you commonly see

3209
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:56,939
uh yeah I mean there's Juicy Fruit Thai

3210
01:59:55,079 --> 02:00:00,899
which has got like a different fruity

3211
01:59:56,939 --> 02:00:03,719
Aroma and taste it grows different too

3212
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:06,779
um you know it's more of an upright

3213
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:09,179
um bilateral like it grows like uh what

3214
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:10,979
I would consider like a golden tie

3215
02:00:09,179 --> 02:00:13,380
um somebody's got into the stuff for

3216
02:00:10,979 --> 02:00:16,198
them the gold golden tie gold King tie

3217
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:18,239
uh it grows in like a an upright

3218
02:00:16,198 --> 02:00:19,738
straight plant

3219
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:21,178
um some of these ties I don't it's hard

3220
02:00:19,738 --> 02:00:23,638
to say they're kind of like a bean pole

3221
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:25,319
they go straight up and they have

3222
02:00:23,639 --> 02:00:27,359
um branching that's

3223
02:00:25,319 --> 02:00:28,738
um

3224
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:31,920
um

3225
02:00:28,738 --> 02:00:33,598
basically they grow perpendicular to

3226
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:35,699
each other alternating perpendicular so

3227
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:38,279
it's like perfect alternating form so

3228
02:00:35,698 --> 02:00:40,319
it's straight up and back and forth

3229
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:42,118
um and the The Taste is more of a

3230
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:43,079
fruitiness

3231
02:00:42,118 --> 02:00:45,179
um

3232
02:00:43,079 --> 02:00:48,719
you know ripe fruit kind of like a mango

3233
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:50,940
or you know Juicy Fruit gum

3234
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:52,679
um and then there's uh the mango ties

3235
02:00:50,939 --> 02:00:54,118
which I think are very in the same

3236
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:56,099
family and I think there's another

3237
02:00:54,118 --> 02:00:59,039
Highland variety and those were a lot of

3238
02:00:56,099 --> 02:01:01,440
the Thai sticks uh there's lemon ties

3239
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:03,960
which are this highland ties and those

3240
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:05,759
could be purple or green

3241
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:08,399
um and those have like a lemon Aroma or

3242
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,060
high limonene Aroma

3243
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:10,859
um

3244
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:12,239
and those are there's lots of different

3245
02:01:10,859 --> 02:01:12,899
lemon ties

3246
02:01:12,238 --> 02:01:15,539
um

3247
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:17,279
so you know it's it's hard to say uh

3248
02:01:15,539 --> 02:01:19,139
there's the

3249
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:20,698
um grassy varieties which are like some

3250
02:01:19,139 --> 02:01:22,980
of the Highland varieties are grassy and

3251
02:01:20,698 --> 02:01:24,839
they're more jungly uh like The Chiang

3252
02:01:22,979 --> 02:01:25,519
Mai

3253
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:27,900
um

3254
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:30,960
there's the chocolate ties which I think

3255
02:01:27,899 --> 02:01:33,960
are mainly Low Land lowland varieties or

3256
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:36,000
purple purple Thai varieties

3257
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:38,520
um but I'm trying to narrow down the

3258
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,020
specific varieties that that make up the

3259
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:43,199
the chocolate ties I think some of the

3260
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:45,719
60s were some of the the purple Highland

3261
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,399
ties or some of the Lao varieties

3262
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:48,840
um those were like some of the first 60s

3263
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:50,579
chocolate ties and then I think the

3264
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:53,940
lighter chocolate ties were some of the

3265
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:57,300
uh lowland Lao or some of the other uh

3266
02:01:53,939 --> 02:02:01,259
lowland ties that also had purple traits

3267
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:04,440
to them uh I think those ones are musky

3268
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:05,760
euphoric coffee tobacco tasting

3269
02:02:04,439 --> 02:02:07,738
um

3270
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,960
and there's also the red ties there's

3271
02:02:07,738 --> 02:02:13,098
ones that red red pigments

3272
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:17,039
um or like um Brown and those ones have

3273
02:02:13,099 --> 02:02:19,380
uh at signings the the red trites the

3274
02:02:17,039 --> 02:02:23,579
the carotenoid traits that seem to turn

3275
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:25,380
on red uh red stemmed red flowers

3276
02:02:23,579 --> 02:02:27,359
um which also turn into like a purple as

3277
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:28,800
well when dried

3278
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:32,098
um kind of similar to like a Panama Red

3279
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:34,079
and those who kind of have um

3280
02:02:32,099 --> 02:02:35,639
what is very similar to all the like the

3281
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:37,559
purple traits and those type of lines

3282
02:02:35,639 --> 02:02:40,920
and they are kind of like the Blackberry

3283
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:44,280
Port wineish grapes-ish but not like a

3284
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:46,679
candy grape more of like a a liqueur

3285
02:02:44,279 --> 02:02:47,399
um Turpin profile

3286
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:49,618
um

3287
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:51,779
but many of them have sweet tasting

3288
02:02:49,618 --> 02:02:53,759
stuff too so it's hard to say but

3289
02:02:51,779 --> 02:02:55,679
there's so many different ties

3290
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:59,280
um and I'm trying to get my hands around

3291
02:02:55,679 --> 02:03:00,539
a lot of them uh we're gonna be able to

3292
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:02,039
see all the different differences but

3293
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:05,639
there's there's many different fruit

3294
02:03:02,039 --> 02:03:09,060
flavor types as well as the sickly sweet

3295
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:10,859
types Highland lowland

3296
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:13,560
um and then you have stuff that are more

3297
02:03:10,859 --> 02:03:16,079
ganja varieties and more of the uh

3298
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:17,699
what they use for Thai stick and then

3299
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:20,960
some of the um

3300
02:03:17,698 --> 02:03:23,579
Indica types they're like Thai indica's

3301
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:26,340
Ah that's something you don't hear every

3302
02:03:23,579 --> 02:03:27,960
day well they're they're not in the true

3303
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:29,340
form like an Indica but they have the

3304
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:31,920
you know the hash your plant there

3305
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:33,480
they're thicker larger you know they

3306
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:35,760
look like

3307
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:37,919
hash plants but they're they're ties but

3308
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:40,860
they're pure ties they're just you know

3309
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:43,020
tie derivatives indicas

3310
02:03:40,859 --> 02:03:45,359
if that makes any sense so they it would

3311
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:47,400
be nice to see what the the chemotype

3312
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:48,598
compositions are if they have CBD in

3313
02:03:47,399 --> 02:03:50,939
them or

3314
02:03:48,599 --> 02:03:52,139
um you know if they're similar to you

3315
02:03:50,939 --> 02:03:53,698
know Mexicans or other things the other

3316
02:03:52,139 --> 02:03:56,520
thing is some of these lines were

3317
02:03:53,698 --> 02:03:58,379
imported from Mexico uh during the um

3318
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:00,239
Thai stick lines the guy named Brian

3319
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:03,659
Daniels was the Importer of a lot of

3320
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:05,819
Thai sticks his wife was married to well

3321
02:04:03,658 --> 02:04:07,799
he was married to a time woman and her

3322
02:04:05,819 --> 02:04:10,979
family her father was part of like the

3323
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:13,739
the head of police in Chiang Mai and I

3324
02:04:10,979 --> 02:04:16,198
think they they got indigenous tribal

3325
02:04:13,738 --> 02:04:17,879
people to wrap the sticks and grow them

3326
02:04:16,198 --> 02:04:19,979
on different

3327
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:22,679
um pieces of land and then they were

3328
02:04:19,979 --> 02:04:25,079
able to transport the sticks down to the

3329
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:27,179
the water and avoid

3330
02:04:25,079 --> 02:04:29,880
um you know police by you know paying

3331
02:04:27,179 --> 02:04:32,158
them off and basically this was done for

3332
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:34,199
like 20 years

3333
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:36,779
um and they would import sticks into

3334
02:04:34,198 --> 02:04:39,899
Sausalito into like a San Francisco area

3335
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:40,920
into Australia into different places

3336
02:04:39,899 --> 02:04:43,019
um

3337
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:44,460
so a lot of the stuff was brought in

3338
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:46,800
from other countries like Mexico to

3339
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:48,300
speed up the the the growth rates of

3340
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:49,980
some of the ties so some of the the

3341
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:52,980
hybridized highs that were grown in

3342
02:04:49,979 --> 02:04:55,259
Thailand and and Cambodian Laos were

3343
02:04:52,979 --> 02:04:57,238
probably like Mexican seeds or Colombian

3344
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:59,099
some of the Colombian seeds were brought

3345
02:04:57,238 --> 02:05:01,138
to Colombia

3346
02:04:59,099 --> 02:05:03,360
um and produced a line called sky blue

3347
02:05:01,139 --> 02:05:05,639
blonde because some of the tie lines

3348
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:07,679
were the Thai varieties were shorter

3349
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:10,800
flowering than the long uh you know

3350
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:12,599
Plumbing gold varieties you know ties

3351
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:14,400
are extremely long but Colombians are

3352
02:05:12,599 --> 02:05:16,440
even longer

3353
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:18,479
um but you can't grow a lot of Mexicans

3354
02:05:16,439 --> 02:05:21,419
in Colombia because they couldn't deal

3355
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:23,759
with the the extended um you know

3356
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:26,158
um daylight hours so they had to find

3357
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,980
varieties that would grow there

3358
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:31,079
huh what a detailed tie backstory I

3359
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:32,000
wasn't expecting to get I love it well

3360
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:34,260
good

3361
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,359
yeah it was about to say it does make me

3362
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:38,159
wonder how many other toys there are out

3363
02:05:36,359 --> 02:05:39,539
there that just sort of don't get any

3364
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:42,839
mention

3365
02:05:39,539 --> 02:05:44,819
well I mean what people grew there they

3366
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:47,400
were you know they they'd call it one

3367
02:05:44,819 --> 02:05:49,618
thing and then they they'd rename it as

3368
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:51,598
something else so there's Highland highs

3369
02:05:49,618 --> 02:05:52,559
lowland ties

3370
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,960
um

3371
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:57,320
stuff that was purple Thai maybe renamed

3372
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:59,760
here in the state's chocolate tie

3373
02:05:57,319 --> 02:06:02,579
lowland Laos could be renamed as

3374
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:05,460
chocolate Thai some of the mango ties

3375
02:06:02,579 --> 02:06:06,779
could be sold here as golden ties some

3376
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:09,960
of the Juicy Fruit ties could have been

3377
02:06:06,779 --> 02:06:12,238
renamed as like golden ties

3378
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,239
um some of the buddhistics could have

3379
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:17,879
been renamed as you know from

3380
02:06:15,238 --> 02:06:20,939
some of the lowland Laos or cambodians

3381
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:22,980
uh you know it was three sellers trying

3382
02:06:20,939 --> 02:06:26,339
to make money off some of this stuff

3383
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:29,879
I know in 1988 I we bought a chocolate

3384
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:32,880
pie out of San Jose for it was 80 bucks

3385
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:36,920
for an eighth which was a lot because

3386
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:40,199
most eights were you know 10 15 bucks

3387
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:42,599
so 80 80 bucks it was quite a bit or 75

3388
02:06:40,198 --> 02:06:46,500
bucks for an eighth for chocolate Thai

3389
02:06:42,599 --> 02:06:48,000
it was quite a bit yeah nice so the

3390
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:50,039
Final Fantasy mid question we have which

3391
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,979
is actually a really good one

3392
02:06:50,039 --> 02:06:55,260
um they have asked what is it that keeps

3393
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:57,299
you up at night in relation to cannabis

3394
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:59,340
what's the most concerning aspect of the

3395
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:01,260
modern cannabis scene or culture in your

3396
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:03,480
opinion

3397
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:06,179
uh the loss of

3398
02:07:03,479 --> 02:07:06,839
um genetic germplasm we're losing so

3399
02:07:06,179 --> 02:07:09,840
much

3400
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:12,420
of these old lines because people are

3401
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:15,539
growing up gelato and these other fast

3402
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:16,260
flowering lines that are kind of generic

3403
02:07:15,539 --> 02:07:18,840
um

3404
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:20,820
and what they what should be growing are

3405
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:22,619
these varieties that will give them

3406
02:07:20,819 --> 02:07:24,719
these awesome highs and these effects

3407
02:07:22,618 --> 02:07:26,399
but the problem is no one's experienced

3408
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:27,899
them because they didn't grow up in

3409
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:30,598
those ages

3410
02:07:27,899 --> 02:07:32,299
so it's genetic loss that I'm fearing

3411
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:35,340
the most because there's so many

3412
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:38,820
varieties that we lose due to non-viable

3413
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:42,420
seeds due to not getting the

3414
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:43,738
support to remake them or to make them

3415
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:44,699
available

3416
02:07:43,738 --> 02:07:46,678
um

3417
02:07:44,698 --> 02:07:49,799
it's just genetic loss because there's

3418
02:07:46,679 --> 02:07:51,300
so much that is awesome about the campus

3419
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:54,500
I mean these things have evolved with

3420
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:57,840
people so cannabis is is is is is

3421
02:07:54,500 --> 02:08:00,420
unique and um and varied as all the

3422
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:02,819
people in the world so you have all the

3423
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:05,099
different spices and tastes and colors

3424
02:08:02,819 --> 02:08:07,559
and experiences of all these different

3425
02:08:05,099 --> 02:08:09,300
people and fruits and vegetables that

3426
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:13,560
cannabis kind of

3427
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:15,300
um holds in its you know it's makeup

3428
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,619
um so it's like an experience but a

3429
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,719
human experience in a plant that you

3430
02:08:16,618 --> 02:08:21,299
grow that you can smoke so you can ex

3431
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:23,340
you can excuse smoking experience

3432
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:24,360
so all that's going to be lost all that

3433
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:25,260
history

3434
02:08:24,359 --> 02:08:27,299
um

3435
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:28,679
unless we're able to preserve some of it

3436
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:31,020
and

3437
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:32,460
you know I can't do it all and and my

3438
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:35,239
friends can't do it all so we need help

3439
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:38,219
from the general public to

3440
02:08:35,238 --> 02:08:40,319
help you know make this something that

3441
02:08:38,219 --> 02:08:42,060
people want to try because once you get

3442
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:43,979
to try this stuff you're going to want

3443
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:47,460
more of it because it's it's uh

3444
02:08:43,979 --> 02:08:50,939
beautiful and happy and you don't get

3445
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:53,399
stoned you get high and you get um you

3446
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:56,039
unlock knowledge that's not necessarily

3447
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:58,319
available to people unless they partake

3448
02:08:56,039 --> 02:08:59,460
in something like this cannabis allows

3449
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:03,299
you to

3450
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:05,880
use your mind in a way like a person

3451
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:07,980
that's studying meditation for you know

3452
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:10,500
many many years like a yogi somebody

3453
02:09:07,979 --> 02:09:13,678
that's able to get their mind to a place

3454
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:15,899
where they're able to perceive

3455
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:17,639
um things that most people can't because

3456
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:19,379
they're able to get to that level well

3457
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:21,480
cannabis is a tool that allows you to

3458
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:24,199
get to that stage in a much much faster

3459
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:27,059
rate just by smoking it

3460
02:09:24,198 --> 02:09:31,439
it allows you to free your mind from the

3461
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:33,780
constraints of what we think is moral or

3462
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:34,919
immoral and allows you to see things for

3463
02:09:33,779 --> 02:09:38,340
what they are

3464
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:40,980
and normal cannabis that people are

3465
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:44,880
smoking doesn't do that but some of the

3466
02:09:40,979 --> 02:09:48,118
varieties that are Thai or Mexican or

3467
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:50,099
Vietnamese or Colombian those can allow

3468
02:09:48,118 --> 02:09:52,019
you to get to those places and allow you

3469
02:09:50,099 --> 02:09:53,819
to access that knowledge that you

3470
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:55,560
normally wouldn't be able to get

3471
02:09:53,819 --> 02:09:58,439
so

3472
02:09:55,560 --> 02:10:00,239
I just hope more people will take the

3473
02:09:58,439 --> 02:10:02,939
time to either support the people that

3474
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:05,579
grow these varieties or help the people

3475
02:10:02,939 --> 02:10:07,759
that can make these available to more

3476
02:10:05,579 --> 02:10:07,760
people

3477
02:10:08,539 --> 02:10:14,279
sentiment so that brings us to our final

3478
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:17,159
quick five questions for the interview

3479
02:10:14,279 --> 02:10:19,439
so first one being what is the single

3480
02:10:17,158 --> 02:10:22,079
best or most memorable experience in

3481
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:24,479
relation to cannabis you have

3482
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:26,279
oh man uh I think the first time I

3483
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:29,459
smoked ham I read

3484
02:10:26,279 --> 02:10:31,259
I was uh at my high school and I had

3485
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:33,599
smoked some Panama Red and I thought it

3486
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:36,179
was laced with LSD I didn't realize at

3487
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:38,219
the time that you can't smoke LSD but I

3488
02:10:36,179 --> 02:10:41,579
had had L Steeps before that and I knew

3489
02:10:38,219 --> 02:10:44,399
the experience so I was so uh so high

3490
02:10:41,579 --> 02:10:47,279
that my friends had to carry me

3491
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:49,500
um up to the school because uh it was

3492
02:10:47,279 --> 02:10:51,359
just too high uh from the experience

3493
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:53,939
that I thought I was uh it had been

3494
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:55,439
laced with the LST and I thought I was

3495
02:10:53,939 --> 02:10:56,698
going to be flying high for a very long

3496
02:10:55,439 --> 02:10:59,519
time because some of these experiences

3497
02:10:56,698 --> 02:11:01,198
from Cannabis can be

3498
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:02,639
um like a very strong psychedelic

3499
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:04,439
experience for a short period of time

3500
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:06,960
you know a few hours or hour or whatever

3501
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:08,399
it might be it feels like hours but that

3502
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,039
was a very memorable experience that

3503
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:13,079
first Panama Red

3504
02:11:10,039 --> 02:11:15,118
amazing I love it I love it so on the

3505
02:11:13,079 --> 02:11:17,279
other end of the spectrum what's uh

3506
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:18,839
strain that all your friends were you

3507
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:20,219
know hyping up telling you was going to

3508
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:23,460
be great and then when you finally had

3509
02:11:20,219 --> 02:11:26,359
it you were like oh is that it

3510
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:26,359
G13

3511
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,440
G13 was something that was always kind

3512
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:33,899
of like hyped up for many many years it

3513
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:36,479
was this government strain

3514
02:11:33,899 --> 02:11:38,519
when I smoked it it's it's it's potent

3515
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:42,479
it's narcotic it's

3516
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:44,820
it's generic it's not some it's it's

3517
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:46,979
great cross to other things it's a it's

3518
02:11:44,819 --> 02:11:50,099
a shitty grower it's a small little hash

3519
02:11:46,979 --> 02:11:52,859
plant it's it's nothing special but it's

3520
02:11:50,099 --> 02:11:55,219
hyped to be something special so you

3521
02:11:52,859 --> 02:11:59,098
know hype works I guess

3522
02:11:55,219 --> 02:12:00,719
I love it I love it okay so if I was

3523
02:11:59,099 --> 02:12:03,119
gonna drop you off on a desert island

3524
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:05,520
and you can take three strains with you

3525
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:07,618
to grow for the rest of time what would

3526
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,900
you take with you

3527
02:12:07,618 --> 02:12:10,618
oh that's hard

3528
02:12:09,899 --> 02:12:13,559
um

3529
02:12:10,618 --> 02:12:15,679
Purple Haze

3530
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:15,679
um

3531
02:12:17,158 --> 02:12:20,179
Acapulco Gold

3532
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,840
this is hard

3533
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:27,480
chocolate Thai

3534
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:29,520
this for lack of you know I think I'd be

3535
02:12:27,479 --> 02:12:31,500
happy with those three strains though I

3536
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:33,480
I still want others but uh yeah those

3537
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:35,039
are being very happy for a long time but

3538
02:12:33,479 --> 02:12:37,799
I still want others but I think that

3539
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:40,800
kind of covers a lot of things

3540
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:43,619
love it love it love it love it so let's

3541
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:45,239
say uh you're dropping someone else off

3542
02:12:43,618 --> 02:12:46,559
on the island someone you're not a big

3543
02:12:45,238 --> 02:12:48,419
fan of what are you gonna leave them

3544
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:50,340
with

3545
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:52,578
um

3546
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:52,578
foreign

3547
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:59,880
but you know I'm a nice guy so I

3548
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:01,078
probably let him have some like Northern

3549
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:04,078
Lights or something

3550
02:13:01,078 --> 02:13:06,420
yeah something to numb the pain yeah

3551
02:13:04,078 --> 02:13:08,819
totally cruel

3552
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:11,340
love it okay and so final question then

3553
02:13:08,819 --> 02:13:14,099
if I gave you a time machine and you can

3554
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:16,440
go back anywhere in history anytime

3555
02:13:14,099 --> 02:13:18,480
where you're gonna go and what are you

3556
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:20,839
gonna collect and presumably seeds or

3557
02:13:18,479 --> 02:13:20,839
clones

3558
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:24,179
wow

3559
02:13:22,618 --> 02:13:27,839
um

3560
02:13:24,179 --> 02:13:29,699
I think the the zwustrian age uh you

3561
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,099
know when everybody was migrating to the

3562
02:13:29,698 --> 02:13:34,439
bulk region uh worshiping cannabis is

3563
02:13:32,099 --> 02:13:35,760
heoma they're bringing in cannabis from

3564
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:39,359
all over the world

3565
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:40,039
uh you know there's Sumerians there's

3566
02:13:39,359 --> 02:13:42,539
um

3567
02:13:40,039 --> 02:13:44,399
acadians there was all kinds of

3568
02:13:42,539 --> 02:13:45,060
different peoples there

3569
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:46,799
um

3570
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:48,380
Indus Valley

3571
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:51,420
um

3572
02:13:48,380 --> 02:13:53,340
yeah so yeah this is Western age so

3573
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:55,819
basically

3574
02:13:53,340 --> 02:14:01,619
um like 13

3575
02:13:55,819 --> 02:14:03,118
1300 you know 1300 BC e and uh I think

3576
02:14:01,618 --> 02:14:05,880
I'd be collecting a lot of different

3577
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:08,698
stuff at that point yeah definitely I

3578
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:11,159
think it would be wild the other place

3579
02:14:08,698 --> 02:14:12,299
would be maybe the 1960s in Colombia and

3580
02:14:11,158 --> 02:14:15,000
Mexico

3581
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:18,779
some brilliant answers there I love both

3582
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,060
of them get funky with it so I think

3583
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:23,158
that just about brings us to the end of

3584
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:25,320
it were there any comments or shout outs

3585
02:14:23,158 --> 02:14:27,420

3586
02:14:25,319 --> 02:14:28,679
