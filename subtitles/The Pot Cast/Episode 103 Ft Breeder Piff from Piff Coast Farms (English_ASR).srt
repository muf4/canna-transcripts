00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,200
the moment. Check out their AYPM. This

35

The final piece of the puzzle to ensure

43
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,759
that your room is killing it is our good

44
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,560
friends at Pulse. Their sensors are

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,478
second to none. Industryleading and just

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
recently they announced the Pulse Hub.

47
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,478
What more could you want? An integrated

48
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,319
unit for all of your sensors to ensure

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,920
that your garden is automated and

50
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,718
tracking all of the variables you may

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,759
not be consciously aware of. From VPD to

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,359
PPF, Dupoint, temperature, humidity, so

53
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,639
much more. You've got to get yourself a

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
pulse sensor, guys. It has

55
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,519
revolutionized the way I grow flour and

56
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,639
increased the tarpin content, the

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,959
cannabonoid content, the yield so so so

58
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,598
much more. Shout out as always to our

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
friends at Pulse Sensors. Likewise, if

60
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,119
any of you guys have been listening to

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,039
the show, you know that I am passionate

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,439
about helping people transition to

63
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,120
vaporized options if they're considerate

64
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,598
about their respiratory health. And for

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,759
me, Dynavap are the world leaders in

66
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,598
this. Be sure to check out their newest

67
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,318
release, the Hyperdine, which is

68
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,119
essentially a big bowl style unit. You

69
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,039
can fit easily like a quarter of a gram

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,800
in this thing. It's great for taking out

71
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,878
on the road. You know that it's going to

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
last you the whole time you're out. You

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,239
can really get a lot of bang for your

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
buck from the Hyperdine. Definitely

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
check that one out. I've been using it

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
myself. I really, really enjoy it. Check

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
these guys out. You will not be

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
disappointed. Massive shout out to

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,519

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,719
on the east

100
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,639
coast, a true Cuban haze

101
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,280
connoisseur, the man behind Piffcon and

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,359
Piff Coast

103
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Farms. A massive welcome to Breeda Piff.

104
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:12,959
So, without further

105
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,958
delay, let's get into

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,639
it. All righty, gang. Welcome back to

107
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,319
another episode. As usual, you're joined

108
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
by your boy Heavy Days coming at you

109
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,759
from Upside Down Library. And today, I'm

110
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,239
incredibly grateful to be joined by an

111
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
East Coast hustler, a Cuban Haze, Connor

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
sir, and the breeder behind Piff Coast

113
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,279
Farms. A massive welcome to Breida Piff

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,759
for joining us today. How you doing? Hey

115
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,000
man. Uh thank you for having me. You

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,639
know, I'm really honored to be here.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,839
Been a big fan of the show for a long

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,280
time. So, this is cool as [ __ ] Oh, man.

119
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,638
Likewise, I'm grateful that you're

120
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,559
joining me here and that that's cool

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,639
that you've been a fan of the show. The

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,720
question I love to ask everyone, what

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,120
are you smoking on

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
right now? I'm smoking Holy Communion.

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
This was gifted to me by a grower who

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
found it. You know, I was at an event

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,400
and they brought me back a sample and

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
gave it to me. So, I'm smoking it now.

129
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,399
Cool. So, I mean, what what are the

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
genetics behind that one? And like, how

131
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,159
would you describe the flavor?

132
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:19,120
All right. So, Holy Communion is our PC3

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
crossed with the Harlem Dreams. So, both

134
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,720
of those strains were bred by us. Um,

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,280
PC3 is our PIFF S2. It's an inbred PIFF

136
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,400
line. We're going for faster flooring

137
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,959
each generation. Um S2 is kind of where

138
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,038
we ended that one. And then um the

139
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,279
Harlem Dreams is the Cuban Black Haze

140
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,680
cross with Blue Dream, you know, and

141
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,638
that one just kind of added the bag

142
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,360
appeal. So crossing the, you know, our

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,439
our pretty haze to our fast haze is is

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,919
the Holy Communion, you know, that's

145
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,120
like our joining of our two biggest

146
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,120
Hifco staple streams. Oh man, that's

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,959
epic. There's I want to ask questions

148
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,600
about pretty much all those strains as

149
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,758
well as a bunch of other stuff. I guess

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,879
maybe the first thing to start off with

151
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,960
is a bit of like background because for

152
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,360
so many people including myself, they've

153
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,918
never had PIFF or like sort of the the

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,800
PIFF associated genetics that have, you

155
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:18,159
know, in the parentage. What how would

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,720
you describe the PF's effect and smell?

157
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
Um and what is it about it that's

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
developed such a cult following?

159
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,560
All right. So, the pith as far as

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,960
effects go, I would say it's like an

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,879
all-around weed. You can use depending

162
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,918
on the dosage, you can use it for many

163
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,360
things. If I smoke smaller joints, I can

164
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,439
smoke them throughout the day and still

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
be uplifted. But if I want to smoke a

166
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,160
lot at night, I'll smoke, you know, a

167
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,199
little bit more and I'll be more out of

168
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
it, you know. So, it can go different

169
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
ways on dosage. And it's different for

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,199
every person of course, but it's it's

171
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,680
usually known for an uplifting high. You

172
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:01,360
know, it is a sativa. So, but um the

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,918
smell I would call it like um incense or

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,038
cat piss or

175
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,279
uh basement, grandma's purse, you know,

176
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,639
there's so many descriptions that people

177
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:15,679
have come up with like mop water or and

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,478
it's a very very distinct smell. And

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,240
then I think the cold following thing is

180
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,159
likely because it was really produced on

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,598
a large scale on the east coast um you

182
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,680
know during the 90s and the 2000s. So a

183
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,598
lot of people were smoking this stuff

184
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,439
you know. So and at that time not a lot

185
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,360
of good weed was readily available like

186
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:40,160
it is now. You know at that time you had

187
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,840
like the Mexican brick weed you had the

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,199
Arizona which was a little better than

189
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,638
the brick. It was like

190
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,560
uncompressed and then it had like your

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,639
drows and your sour diesels and your

192
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,959
hazes, you know, your white widows and

193
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,319
your ties and stuff like that, but at

194
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,878
that time, you know, it was really hard

195
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,520
to find good weed like that and haze was

196
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,000
just kind of the best one.

197
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,799
Yeah. Epic. Okay. I mean, so many

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,319
follow-ups to go there, I guess. Why

199
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
don't you give us a bit of the backstory

200
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
on it? cuz in terms of what I've read

201
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,120
and been told, you know, uh, Cuban black

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,918
haze is is one of the many many

203
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,319
phenotypes of NL5 haze. Is that right?

204
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,560
And when when did it first pop up? And

205
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
is there just one phenotype of it or was

206
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,038
there multiple?

207
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,038
So, you know, there's many different

208
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,159
stories. I'm a bit I'm a bit on the

209
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,199
younger side, so I wasn't there when it

210
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,839
originated, you know, but from what I've

211
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,038
heard that it is an NL5 haze. It's an

212
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:41,479
NL5 haze A to be more specific because

213
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,479
the C side is more the surp

214
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,360
um some Cubans went to Amsterdam and

215
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,199
brought back the seeds and three phenos

216
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
were kept. Cuban black haze was one of

217
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,759
them. The other two died. This is the

218
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,240
only one that really lived, you know.

219
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,720
But um yeah, so there's uh there's a lot

220
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,360
of stories behind it and but I do know

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,680
it's been in the community since so 89

222
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
is like when the seeds were first made

223
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,759
and then 92 is when they were were

224
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,720
released.

225
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,159
Wow. Yeah. A long

226
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,759
time. So I want to quickly touch on

227
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,199
something you mentioned there which is

228
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:26,159
the distinction between the NL5 Haze A

229
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,320
versus the C. And as you'd be well

230
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,879
aware, there's quite a vocal sort of

231
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,680
population within the community who have

232
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,838
quite a feverous amount of tarpenolene

233
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,239
hate. I'd love to hear what's your

234
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,240
thoughts on the tenoline hate subject.

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,159
Are you in that camp? Are you not not

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,278
too like for me myself, I don't mind it

237
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,079
too much. Uh where do you sit?

238
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:50,000
Say no to Jack Turpps,

239
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,040
man. So listen, you know, here's my

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,080
thing, right? When I was first started

241
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,319
growing, I was, you know, smoking haze.

242
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,040
It was my favorite strain. So, I started

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,800
growing and I ordered haze seeds online.

244
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,799
But when I got all those haze seeds and

245
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,958
started growing them out, it was jack

246
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,039
turpps after jack turpps after jack

247
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,479
turpps. So, it's kind of tough, you

248
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,958
know, like when you're used to a certain

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
thing and then when you start, you know,

250
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,799
if you go anywhere else in the world

251
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,399
rather than like the east coast of the

252
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,399
United States, haze means tinolene.

253
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,639
But when you come here, Hayes is a

254
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,519
completely different experience. You

255
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,360
know, it's mercy and dominant. So, you

256
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
know, Jack is kind of taken over. I

257
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200
think that's why people hate on it. You

258
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,679
know, we still grow it for the people

259
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,320
that love it. You know, I can't hate too

260
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,319
hard, but I can't say that I wasn't

261
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
disappointed every time I got to week

262
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,800
two of Flower and the [ __ ] was Jack

263
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,159
Turpps again, you know? So, that's kind

264
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:51,278
of what set me off on that.

265
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,958
Totally. Totally. Okay. So, I guess I'd

266
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,078
love to hear a bit more about sort of

267
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,639
just the differences in the east coast

268
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,359
culture versus the west coast because so

269
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,120
much of what sort of goes around online

270
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,320
and what is in the the popular opinion

271
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,839
often relates to California. Often a lot

272
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,680
of the historical trends in California

273
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,680
dominate whereas as where you've just

274
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,000
you know alluded to even just within the

275
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,239
realm of hazes they were very different.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,399
So, you know, what was what role did

277
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,639
PIFF play historically? You know, was it

278
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,799
always there? Was it something that was

279
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,639
like kind of hard to get and you had to

280
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,399
be ahead and it was, you know, was it

281
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,078
hard to get and what was the other stuff

282
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,078
that was going around as you were

283
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,039
growing up?

284
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,039
So, I mean, you had to be in the hood to

285
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,919
get the haze, really, or you had to know

286
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:45,120
some Cubans or some Dominicans or

287
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,639
somebody in the Spanish culture really

288
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
to get if you really wanted to get the

289
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,480
haze or you had to go straight to the

290
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,440
hood to get it right off the block. You

291
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,240
know, it wasn't something that like

292
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,040
normally like the all the white people

293
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,240
around were messing with the sour diesel

294
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,120
and the Canadian beasters or drow they

295
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,680
call it or other exotics. But Hayes was

296
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,879
strictly always with the Cubans no

297
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,919
matter what. So you really did need like

298
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,120
connect to to really be able to get that

299
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,039
stuff, you know. But when you did,

300
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,919
people would pay a lot a lot a lot for

301
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,159
it, you know, like $600 an ounce back

302
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,519
then.

303
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:29,759
Yeah. Wow. Okay. And then I guess like

304
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,360
the the question I have is was it was it

305
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,958
obvious? Do you think it was obvious to

306
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
everyone who got it how special it was

307
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,078
or do you think like maybe it was a

308
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
little bit taken for granted? Because I

309
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,559
feel like there was this period where

310
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,320
everyone was talking about it and it

311
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,399
wasn't really around that much. Let's

312
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,680
say this time frame was about

313
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,200
2015, 2014, 15. Um, and then thankfully

314
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,559
it popped back up, you know, and people

315
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,000
realized it was still out there. Um, do

316
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,759
you think like it was appreciated or

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,159
it's just been super tightly held and

318
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,159
that's all?

319
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,838
It's really truly been super tightly

320
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,240
held. I mean, it's a little bit looser

321
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,079
in the Spanish community. Like, I know a

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,278
lot of people that have that that clone

323
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,199
that are just like, "Yeah, it's Haze."

324
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,838
you know, they don't know nothing of it,

325
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,759
but outside of those circles, like they

326
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,920
really it's really not wasn't out there

327
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,200
too much, you

328
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,360
know? So, that's that's what it is.

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,680
Like, it's normal for me, but it's not

330
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,639
normal for everyone. And like, I was

331
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,638
actually part of those people on the on

332
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,560
the forums back then, like searching for

333
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,879
this haze, and it brought me, you know,

334
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,039
here and I met a bunch of great people

335
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,679
and got linked up and it's been awesome,

336
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,838
you know. Yeah, totally. And look, I'm

337
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,838
super keen to hear your backstory. I

338
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,279
feel like uh we should go back to the

339
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,959
start, but before we do, I just want to

340
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:51,200
ask one quick question. Were you getting

341
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,638
access to any chem or sour, or were you

342
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,920
really sort of just sticking to that

343
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,000
Cuban haze lane? Oh, you know, I always

344
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,039
love the haze. I always picked haze over

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,958
sour, but yeah, definitely got sour. I

346
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,639
don't know too much about maybe not I

347
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,879
never heard the name Chem Dog from the

348
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,639
streets but I did hear it once I became

349
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,559
a grower which was pretty early in my

350
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,320
life at the same time you know so um

351
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,719
yeah I definitely got sour back in the

352
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,760
day and it was definitely everything

353
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,720
people say it was and it it was amazing

354
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,319
for sure. That's awesome. Well, I want

355
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
to loop back and talk about some of your

356
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,560
sour work but first as I mentioned let's

357
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,359
go back to the start and frame this chat

358
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,838
a bit more. So, what was your very first

359
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,399
experience with cannabis?

360
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,760
My first experience with cannabis, man,

361
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,039
um I was at my friend's James's house. I

362
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:46,159
was 12 years old. His sister had some

363
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:48,719
haze. And at the time, we were we were

364
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,120
like stealing cigarettes and and cigars

365
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,519
and smoking whatever we could, you know.

366
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,480
And uh we had a Swisser sweet wood tip

367
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,600
and we pencil packed that [ __ ] with haze

368
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,560
inch or two long and smoked it in his

369
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,639
garage. I was throwing up but I loved it

370
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,198
man. You know right after that I went

371
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,120
and got some hes you know and started I

372
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:13,359
found somebody with $10. I went and

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,519
bought a dime you know and or with 20

374
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,159
and you know bought two dimes and just

375
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,759
kept going like that ever since that

376
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,198
day.

377
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:26,078
Wow, that's interesting. And so, did you

378
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,000
get access to indica pretty early on or

379
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,439
did it take some time for before you

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,839
were like, "Oh, there's this other side

381
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,320
of the spectrum."

382
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:39,279
Well, um, generally like it was either

383
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,760
like haze or Mexican brick, which is

384
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,198
also sativa, too. You know, like I I

385
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,278
would rarely see indicas. I would see

386
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:49,000
white widow sometimes. I wouldn't see

387
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:51,439
many indacas, you know. It was really

388
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,919
weeds mids which is also a Mexican

389
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,079
sativa or you know and then we had the

390
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,120
drow I guess that was an indacica. The

391
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,278
drow was like the Canadian

392
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,000
M39 you know that came up through the

393
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,278
New York Indian

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,919
reservations and came down to us and

395
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,639
that stuff was like super dense and it

396
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:14,000
smelled like Arizona iced tea and it had

397
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,000
like orange hairs you know if you know

398
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
you know.

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,600
That's pretty funny. I think most people

400
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,399
got exposure to uh beasters at one point

401
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,680
or another. What was your progression

402
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,799
from sort of that early years through to

403
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,719
say having your first grow?

404
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,559
So, you know, from that moment, like I

405
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
said, I started selling, you know, just

406
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,198
to afford to smoke it. you know, I'd

407
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,479
find somebody to buy something so I

408
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:44,559
could get something to, you know, um, a

409
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,560
couple years later, one of my friends

410
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,119
that lived up this tree grew some plants

411
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,000
in his backyard and he ended up with a

412
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,078
QP and I was like, "Oh man, got a free

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,159
QP from that." And the very next year, I

414
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,319
popped some seeds. You know, my mom

415
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,240
killed them. I was 16 at the first, you

416
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,920
know, at the first time. But after a few

417
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,919
seasons, you know, she let me keep them.

418
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:10,798
And then I built a little indoor um my

419
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,160
first indoor grow was in a little PC

420
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,798
box. At least that's where I started the

421
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,240
seeds. I realized, you know, shortly

422
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,838
that that wouldn't be big enough. So I

423
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
uh sectioned off a little piece of my

424
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,119
closet. Then I got tents, you know, and

425
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,360
I just kept going from there.

426
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,639
Wow. I love it. And I always love asking

427
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,319
people, describe to me your first setup,

428
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,240
you know, like what what sort of gear

429
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,319
were you rocking? You know, we we all

430
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,798
can be honest with ourselves and have a

431
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,558
laugh when we look back.

432
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,679
It was a it was a little CFL inside of a

433
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,480
a computer PC

434
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,960
box with space blankets taped to the

435
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
inside of it. I had this light shining

436
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
out of it. crazy, you know, and my mom

437
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,319
would come in my room and think, "What

438
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,079
the heck? Why is that thing shining so

439
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,399
much?" But she never knew, you know, she

440
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,720
found out eventually, but that's

441
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,679
awesome. It reminds me of almost like

442
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,480
the uh the photoron, you know? Yep. So,

443
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,559
do those those first grows was it was it

444
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,880
just bag seed? Did you have any sort of

445
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,798
guesses on reflection what the genetics

446
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,679
might have been?

447
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,160
So like my first first grows were bag

448
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,280
seeds, but then I started ordering from

449
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,840
Attitude Seed Bank actually. Oh. And uh

450
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:34,399
yeah, so my first order was uh haze. It

451
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,159
was super silver haze, super lemon haze.

452
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,440
I got one of those greenhouse seeds uh

453
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,679
packs, you know. I got a I had a bunch

454
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,279
of that stuff at the time. Uh but all

455
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,038
that stuff ended up being Jack Turpp, so

456
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,440
I kind of was disappointed with the haze

457
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,279
stuff, you know.

458
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,840
Um, yeah, but I I grew some really cool

459
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,519
stuff back then.

460
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,599
Yeah, totally. There was a heap of

461
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,000
breeders who used to be on Attitude who

462
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,879
are kind of like defunct or like no

463
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,759
longer creating work and really unique

464
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,520
stuff and then I think like sort of

465
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,599
around yeah 2012 to 2015 it just started

466
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,960
to homogenize a bit. But that's cool. So

467
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,119
you you were getting some of that early

468
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
stuff. Was there anything cool you got

469
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,798
that really stands out to you in your

470
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,558
memory?

471
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,918
Yeah, I still have it to this day. Like

472
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,160
some of the first seeds I ordered was

473
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,720
like the Nirvana Super Stunk and there's

474
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,798
one seed in the That's the biggest seed

475
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
I've ever seen in my life. And I just

476
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,679
still keep it. But I should pop it, you

477
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,000
know. I love it. This thing is huge

478
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,720
though. It's It's ridiculous.

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
That's so cool. Just a little coconut.

480
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,319
Yeah, it's like the size of a peanut

481
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
almost. It's crazy. It's like a little

482
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,200
pee. It's insane how big it is. Never

483
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,000
seen anything like it.

484
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,840
That's so cool. That's so cool. Okay, so

485
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,759
sort of how would you describe your

486
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,279
development from that point? Because it

487
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,919
sounds like you're sort of cutting your

488
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,279
teeth. How would you how did you sort of

489
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,440
get access to the Cuban Haze at first?

490
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,119
So, you know, I got at that point I was

491
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,798
on the forums, you know, I got on all

492
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:09,839
the forums, Roll It Up, THC Farmer, IC

493
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,200
Mag, Seed Bay, you know, the Seed Depot

494
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,079
was probably one of my favorite ones

495
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,200
back then. I started trading clones with

496
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:20,558
people, you know. I got the uh cookies

497
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,038
early on. I got the gorilla glue. I got,

498
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,279
you know, a bunch of cool stuff. Uh I I

499
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,679
was growing outside as well. Like after

500
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,440
a few years, I started running gorilla

501
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,000
in the in the woods. Um and you know, we

502
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,919
were growing some big ass plants out

503
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,919
there. I was growing some uh Seedsman

504
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,840
White Widows. I had a keeper, you know,

505
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,360
that was my really good performing plant

506
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,558
out there.

507
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,158
Um, you

508
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,240
know, yeah. So, it went from that and

509
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,360
then to get the Haze, it was just, you

510
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,759
know, by meeting people. Um, this guy,

511
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,038
my boy, his name's Nugget. He, uh, he

512
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,798
had a link with the Cubans and he, uh,

513
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,359
had the Cuban Black Haze clone and he

514
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,279
gave it to me, man. And, you know, I

515
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,279
started right away working with that.

516
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,720
And then from that, I got attention from

517
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,038
the Cubans, you know, and I got to meet

518
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,600
them and a lot of Dominicans as well.

519
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,759
and a lot of people that have really

520
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,439
been this haze for the last 30 years,

521
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,599
man. And a lot of those guys have given

522
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,360
me clones and you know, so it's not only

523
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,798
that I have the black haze, now I have

524
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,639
like the the green haze, the golden

525
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,079
haze, the brown haze. There's a bunch of

526
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
different ones, you know, that these

527
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,480
different crews have that they're not

528
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,839
all necessarily the same, you I think it

529
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,038
all derives maybe from the Black Haze

530
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,879
originally, but um yeah, there are

531
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,440
different cuts.

532
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah. Wow. Totally. That must be like,

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,600
you know, sort of uh what a cool

534
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,439
progression to go from like smoking this

535
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,839
thing to getting access to meeting the

536
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,320
guys. That's that's really interesting.

537
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,918
I'd love to quickly hear, you know, I

538
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,279
there's so many different names. I'm

539
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120
sure people are a little a bit unsure of

540
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,879
what's what, just like I've been at

541
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,839
times, like so I guess I got two

542
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,320
questions. The first one is is Cuban

543
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,158
black haze, the piff, the church haze,

544
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,000
is that is that the New York haze? Is

545
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,000
that all the same thing? And then as a

546
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,359
followup, what's the differences between

547
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,038
the other ones? Like you just mentioned

548
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,599
the green haze and some other ones. How

549
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,279
would you describe those other ones? So

550
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,359
I would say absolutely yes. If you're

551
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,519
looking for that piff, Cuban black haze

552
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,399
is the one, you know, u there's no

553
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,240
mistaking it. So the green haze just

554
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,000
it's grows a little more green and it's

555
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,120
a little more sharp on the church kind

556
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,319
of smell. The brown haze actually turns

557
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,119
brown and it has like a damp kind of

558
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,279
basement smell to it. Um the golden haze

559
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,000
is 120day plant. That's the longest

560
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,158
flowering one. That one turns golden and

561
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,079
kind of velvety at the finish, you know,

562
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,799
but it's just a really long time to

563
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,558
flower

564
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,639
it. So but the Cuban black haze is, you

565
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,119
know, 90 days. That's the that's the

566
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,720
piff that most of the Cubans were on.

567
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,439
You know, any of these other just little

568
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,000
offshoots that were either bag seeds or,

569
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,480
you know, stuff like that. But it's

570
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,960
funny because I was talking to to this

571
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,120
Dominican dude, shout out Ed Farms. He

572
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,240
has a he has a pith cut and um I was

573
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,279
asking him like, "Yo, where'd you get

574
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,120
the seeds from?" And he told me, he said

575
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,000
he showed me. He's like, "It was a round

576
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,599
pack with the seeds in it." And I was

577
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,679
like, "Oh, there's no way. It has to be

578
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,439
greenhouse

579
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,960
seeds." And it turns out that one of his

580
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,000
cuts is from greenhouse seeds, and it

581
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,480
was a super silver haze um from like

582
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,640
2001. So, you

583
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,240
know, that's crazy to hear, but it's

584
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,559
that's what it's true. That's what he

585
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,038
says. And, you know, it can't be false

586
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,960
because you don't really see those round

587
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,319
packs like that. You know, he would

588
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,400
there's no way he could be making that

589
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,279
up. So, you know, that's that's one of

590
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,320
the stories that I've heard, too. Yeah.

591
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,399
Wow. Cool. Okay. So, um so what he's

592
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,319
saying is like he got something like

593
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,600
really really hazeling out of that super

594
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,720
silver haze pack. Yeah. Yeah. And it's

595
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,279
smells like piff, you know. But yeah,

596
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,120
super silver haze. So, and you know,

597
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,720
this was just sold as haze on the

598
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,959
streets in Washington Heights. Like, no

599
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,519
one ever knew the difference. So, it's

600
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,440
just, you know, Totally. totally. No,

601
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,319
that makes sense. I mean like you know

602
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,880
even if you do have certain skepticisms

603
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,200
about greenhouse and whatnot it makes

604
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
sense that a super silver haze seed it's

605
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,880
got a lot of haze genetics in it you

606
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
know maybe that's just the one in a 100

607
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,400
one in a thousand that's like a really

608
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,720
good throwback so that you know that

609
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,720
sounds totally reasonable to me I would

610
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,880
I would love to ask because a lot of

611
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,319
this like I I've heard stuff over the

612
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
years but it's just all sort of so

613
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,278
ambiguous to me but I think I was

614
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,240
talking to Bod a while ago and he was

615
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:52,159
saying that there's like the original

616
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,679
Cuban blacks and then there's also like

617
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,559
an S1 and the S1 like looks a bit better

618
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,720
and it it's more aesthetic essentially.

619
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,319
Do you know was have I confused that is

620
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,880
have you heard anything like that? Tell

621
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,240
me a bit more about that. There is a

622
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,278
PIFF S1 um the PFS1 originally came out

623
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,359
of Mass Genetics

624
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:17,919
um you know grow. So it was uh just a

625
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,399
bag seed out of his grow, you know, and

626
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,440
the haze was the only thing there from

627
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,480
what I know. So we al we all just say

628
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,080
it's an S1, but in reality it is a bag

629
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,679
seed, you know, but um yeah, it's it's

630
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,960
shorter flowering. It's like 75 80 days.

631
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,480
It's got that golden haze look and um

632
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,038
yeah, it's really got that piffy smell.

633
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,919
Doc Dia has bred with it a few times. I

634
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,640
I kept that line going, you know, made

635
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,038
the the S2s out of that and did a big

636
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
selection for my for my PF S2 cut, you

637
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,919
know. So, that's where that one comes

638
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,960
from.

639
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,799
Ah, okay. You just you just uh answer

640
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,519
the next question for me, but I'll just

641
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:01,359
make sure. So, so are you saying that um

642
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:04,240
you use that PF S1 and the original cut

643
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,879
to make your S2 line?

644
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,640
So it's only bred. So it's the piff S1

645
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,159
bred to itself to make an S2, you know.

646
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Ah, okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. I see now. I

647
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,120
see. So is are those basically the two

648
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,080
cuts that go around predominantly, the

649
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,678
original and then that S1? Yeah. And the

650
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,480
Brown Haze is out there pretty well,

651
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,840
too. You know, the Autobond Gold uh that

652
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,720
was given out by Stony, man. Rest in

653
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:34,240
peace. Um he was a really good dude. Um,

654
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,079
so he he's the one who gave out the

655
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,400
Golden Haze cut. It's not really shared

656
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,278
too much. And then, you know, the green

657
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,640
haze isn't really out there as much

658
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:46,720
either. And shout out to the OG in the

659
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,159
Bronx, uh, Mike for the for that.

660
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, man. I mean, shout out to all

661
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,919
those guys. I had no idea there was all

662
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,159
these cool variants that had essentially

663
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,320
just been, you know, spurred into

664
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,400
existence by people who just love Hayes

665
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,519
so much. That's that's really really

666
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,440
interesting. Okay. Um, look, heap heaps

667
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,158
of heaps of follow-up questions. You you

668
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,840
nailed the first one about the S2. I

669
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,880
guess a question I did want to ask you

670
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,278
because you've bred with so much haze is

671
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,120
do you feel it is possible to

672
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:21,000
encapsulate that like you know 100 day

673
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:24,158
plus sort of feeling into a more

674
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,720
commercially manageable offering or do

675
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,799
you think like look you can get most of

676
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,120
it there but it I don't know if it'll

677
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,918
ever be possible to really you know

678
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,558
offer the same thing in like a 9-week

679
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,360
sort of package.

680
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,678
All right. So, that's a good question

681
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,000
and I do believe you can get it most of

682
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,120
the way, you know, because we're finding

683
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,640
out about entourage effects coming from

684
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,719
tarpen. So, if you can still isolate

685
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,400
those same tarpen,

686
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,319
um, you know, in a shorter flowering

687
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,640
time, there's nothing to say that it

688
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,038
shouldn't have the same effect, you

689
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,600
know, but I will say that with the

690
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,599
longer flowering hazes, they go through

691
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,839
more cycles, right? So it'll shoot its

692
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,240
first set of hairs and those will all be

693
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,720
mature and then it'll shoot another set

694
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,720
of hairs and then those will get mature.

695
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,798
By that time those first tricoms are

696
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,640
pretty oxidized. So you're getting a

697
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,798
little more full spectrum on the longer

698
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,520
flowering stuff.

699
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:25,599
Yeah. Wow. It's almost like a a mixed

700
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,960
grade of heads in a sense. Yep. Yep. So

701
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,038
I think that's the big difference that

702
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,440
sets it apart. But if we're going off

703
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,919
the science, you know, based aspect of

704
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,720
it, then I say that we can isolate those

705
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,278
same tarpen and we should be able to get

706
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,319
close to around the same effects, give

707
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,159
or take. Sure. So, I want to talk about

708
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,000
some of your breeding in a moment, but I

709
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,480
guess before we talk about the actual

710
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,558
breeding and the the projects itself,

711
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,038
tell me a little bit about what was your

712
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,960
sort of transition from being a grower

713
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,319
with the cut to thinking, you know, I

714
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,640
want to start working with the genetics.

715
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,839
Well, you know, I I bred pretty early on

716
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,520
in my growing. It was an accident, but

717
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,439
um a male went loose in the in the woods

718
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,599
on my gorilla grow and I got a bunch of

719
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,640
seeds and then I grew those seeds the

720
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:15,119
next year and you know it was cool. It

721
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,880
was cool. So, I always kind of had that

722
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,119
had that uh you know goal and I always

723
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,960
looked up to breeders and thought it was

724
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,759
cool and um you know once I finally got

725
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,640
the PIFF um well I was even selling

726
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,398
seeds before that but um yeah I really

727
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,520
took it up a notch and started offering

728
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,678
more you know and then um yeah it went

729
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:42,000
well.

730
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,679
I love that uh the the first seeds was

731
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,278
maybe a little bit unintentional. That's

732
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,840
I think that's the same for a lot of us.

733
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,079
Tell me about what some of the genetics

734
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,079
you were originally crossing together

735
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,678
maybe when you first started, you know,

736
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,119
sort of doing the more planned work.

737
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,000
What were some of the stuff you worked

738
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:01,439
with and any notable stuff like that

739
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,200
went ahead or that didn't go ahead?

740
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,038
That's so funny, man, because my first

741
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,000
intentional like serious breeding

742
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:11,038
project was from seeds that Bod sent to

743
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,798
me, man. Um, back in like 2012. Oh, wow.

744
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,038
He when he first got the Cuban black

745
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,359
haze cut, you know, I was searching for

746
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,679
it back then. I emailed him and told him

747
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:22,798
how much I wanted it and he sent me some

748
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,960
Cuban black haze NL5 seeds. So, my first

749
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,119
like real serious breeding project was

750
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,640
that, you know, I found a mail in there.

751
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:34,959
I fed them. I hit a lung candy. I had

752
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,038
uh uh the sour a sour Nevada I had at

753
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,960
the time. Sour Nevada was like a chem 91

754
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:43,038
sour diesel from Reservation Labs on the

755
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,440
seed depot. I had a bunch of cool stuff

756
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,278
that I had and you know that was kind of

757
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,440
like my first big like you know I got to

758
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,079
preserve these. I I ended up reversing

759
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,080
that male with Florel and I ended up

760
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,439
getting like a couple seeds on that as

761
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,359
well. I never popped them or anything

762
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,759
but it was kind of cool. You know it was

763
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,079
a piffy male. The females that I got

764
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,240
from those seeds weren't as piffy. I

765
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,960
only got six seeds from them originally,

766
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,919
you know, and uh I popped four of them

767
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,159
and kept two and, you know, I popped the

768
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,200
other two a few years later, but they

769
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,240
didn't end up going. So,

770
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,319
wow, that's like so cool. Like full

771
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,679
circle, you know, as um as we were

772
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,599
chatting about earlier, you know, like

773
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,519
Bod giving you a shout out in his most

774
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,278
recent episode. That's that's really

775
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,440
interesting that he sent you those seeds

776
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,558
and uh and I guess there's another sort

777
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,399
of synchronicity and a loop back into it

778
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:37,599
all. The Band-Aid haze, you know, it's

779
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,359
got got the Cuban black haze in it. Um I

780
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,278
I don't know if I've seen you work with

781
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,879
the Band-Aid haze. Do you do you ever

782
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,398
plan to What's your thoughts on it? Do

783
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,399
you consider it a haze? I know some

784
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,158
people were a bit weird about it, but

785
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,719
most people are like really into it.

786
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,120
I like the band-aid, you know. Um, don't

787
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,880
get me wrong, I do like the Cuban Black

788
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,518
Haze a little bit better. I feel like

789
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,159
the Band-Aid is a bit longer flowering

790
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,798
than the original Black Haze. So, by the

791
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,960
time I had access to Band-Aid, I already

792
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,240
had the Black Haze. So, at that point, I

793
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,480
was like, I'd rather just grow the

794
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,399
original, you know? But not saying that

795
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,960
it's a bad thing. It is a good cut. It

796
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,479
has a nice uplifting high. Uh, I have

797
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
red with it. I crossed it to the Black

798
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
Haze, but I did a little feminized BX

799
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,679
with that. I called that black band-aid.

800
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,960
Only like 10 packs went out to some of

801
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,480
my early followers. Um I I crossed it to

802
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,558
the Harlem Dreams as well. I don't have

803
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,759
it at the moment, but you never know. I

804
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,440
might get it back and breed with it

805
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,720
again. We'll see what

806
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,519
happens. Yeah, sure. No, look, that

807
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,600
makes sense. If like if sort of in a

808
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,519
attribute sense you've you've got better

809
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,000
use out of the original, then obviously

810
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,240
it makes sense to breed with that. Um,

811
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,159
one of our listeners was wondering the

812
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,720
Do you know the Band-Aid Haze, does that

813
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,240
use the original cut or the S1 when they

814
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,079
made it? That was the original cut. So,

815
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,558
back then, Bod got the original cut from

816
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:04,879
Asher in Miami. So, shout out to the

817
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:06,558
homie Asher. Asher won on IC Mag. Um, he

818
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,399
gave him the cut back then and it was

819
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,440
the real deal. That's the real Cuban

820
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,599
black haze, the no one. Nice. Okay. And

821
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,759
then so my other quick follow-up one was

822
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:18,398
does that mean sometimes I've heard the

823
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:22,158
word Money Mike's Blackhaze. Is that the

824
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:24,398
S1? Money Mike's Black Haze is is that

825
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,240
one? Yep. So that's kind of how the

826
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,599
chain went. I believe I think it went

827
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,880
from Asher to Money Mike to Bod maybe.

828
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,519
But yeah, I know Asher is the one who

829
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,679
supplied that cut originally. Okay. But

830
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,038
yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. All right. I

831
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,278
think I'm with you now. I think I'm with

832
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,519
you. So yeah. Sorry. So let's jump back

833
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,759
to it. So, you know, you you made those

834
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,519
initial crosses and you got that bit of

835
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,038
experience with the Florel, which is

836
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,480
really cool. It's something I would love

837
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,440
to do one day. I haven't had a chance to

838
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,440
do it myself. Where did you go next from

839
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,759
there? Um, from there, you know, I um

840
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,240
started having kids, so I was slowing

841
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,679
down on growing a bit. And then, um,

842
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,599
once I bought my first house, I was, you

843
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,519
know, built out my basement. It was

844
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,759
going full speed growing. And you know,

845
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,280
at the time I was just always I was

846
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,119
always growing a little something, but

847
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,919
you know, that's when I really went up

848
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,559
full speed and I was going to a lot of

849
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,039
conventions and meeting people. And you

850
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,799
know, Swamp Boy seeds were a big um

851
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,878
inspiration for me because I went to go

852
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,320
see them at uh Nan in Boston. And um

853
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,440
they were doing a big seed release

854
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,119
there. And you know, it was a lot. You

855
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,480
know, I did the math on it on how much

856
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,399
those packs were and how many there

857
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,639
were. And I was like, "Man, these guys

858
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,000
are freaking killing it." So, I was

859
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,599
like, "You know what? Let's try it,

860
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,398
man." You know, I was working seven days

861
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,879
a week, two jobs, you know, taking care

862
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,799
of five kids. Said, "Shit, man. If I can

863
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,639
sell some seeds and this is going to

864
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,960
help me out, then I'll do it." And I did

865
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,838
it, man. You know, I'm so grateful for

866
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,559
it now.

867
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:01,039
Totally, man. Totally. I uh big shout

868
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:05,719
out to Big Ricky and Chrome, you know.

869
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:08,480
Um, obviously TK, Swamp Boy, phenomenal

870
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,480
stuff. How did how did you progress to

871
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,599
to offering the seeds? You know, what

872
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,480
was your first offering and uh what what

873
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,960
sort of led after that? So, my first

874
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,240
offerings I think were like uh some sour

875
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,800
diesel line I was working it was AJ Sour

876
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:28,239
Cut cross with uh Sour Double Kush from

877
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,560
Canaventure cross to the Sour Nevada

878
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,879
from Reservation Labs. I think that was

879
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,400
the first drop. But, you know, I really

880
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,960
started making a name when I when I

881
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,440
reversed the PIFF S1 and I made the PIFF

882
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,400
S2s and then uh I I reversed the Black

883
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,119
Haze, made the Black Haze crosses and

884
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,639
when the Harle Dreams came and you know,

885
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
so I just started kind of offering them

886
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,920
on Instagram and then it started getting

887
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,320
like a lot so I made a website and just

888
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,838
kept going from there.

889
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,720
That's really really cool. Out of

890
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,279
curiosity before we move on, did anyone

891
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,439
send you any photos they found out of

892
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,880
those packs that sort of really

893
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,559
impressed you? Did you end up, you know,

894
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,599
anything come back your way as a result

895
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:12,000
of it? Hell yeah, man. A lot of stuff. I

896
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,480
have so many beautiful photos of these

897
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
of these plants. You know, something

898
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
that came back to me was the Harlem

899
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,960
Dreams, actually. Um, you know, when I

900
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,440
when I reversed the Cuban Black Haze, I

901
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,519
hit everything in the stable. The Santa

902
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,880
Cruz Blue Dream was one of them. I

903
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,960
didn't really think much of it. You

904
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,599
know, everyone loves Blue Dream, but no

905
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,920
one's crazy about Blue Dream. You know,

906
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,519
it's just a big ass yielding awesome

907
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,039
plant for a cultator, you know. But I

908
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,480
didn't think much of the seeds. But one

909
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,239
of my customers hit me up and he was

910
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,280
like, "Yo, man. I I grew this Harlem

911
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,000
Dreams. I just want you to try a

912
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,720
sample." So, he sent me a sample. And

913
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,358
when I tried it, man, I was blown away.

914
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,919
It was amazing, you know, like it was

915
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,159
purple. It smelled like straight piff.

916
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
It was It left that incense smell in the

917
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,039
room after you smoked it, which is like

918
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,598
a big thing that piff does. Um, it had

919
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,279
the taste. It was everything. So, I hit

920
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,039
him up where I was like, "Yo, I need

921
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,480
that

922
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,279
cut." And it's funny because I ended up

923
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,440
popping I didn't even pop those seeds uh

924
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,079
until then. That day I popped 25 of

925
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,480
those seeds and I didn't find one pheno

926
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,839
that was as good as that one. So, you

927
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,559
know, eventually I'm like, "Yo, dog, let

928
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,719
me get the cut." And uh he gave me the

929
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,239
cut, man. So, shout out to the homie. He

930
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,799
never wanted to be named, but you know

931
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,879
who you are, brother. I appreciate you,

932
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,039
man. That's it's a big one. Harlem

933
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,039
Dreams is a huge one for us. It's

934
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,239
awesome.

935
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:43,039
Yeah. What a beautiful story. And uh

936
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:45,838
give a a shout out to a homie down

937
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:48,719
under, Eli Cash. He he popped some of

938
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,559
the Harlem Dreams S1s, found a a really

939
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,239
nice feno, has done some breeding of his

940
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,199
own with it. So, there you go. Testament

941
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,358
to the work, right? Hell yeah. That's

942
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,799
awesome, man. I'm happy to hear that. I

943
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:02,159
was going to ask maybe as a quick little

944
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,519
follow-up, what was uh the combo of like

945
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,598
obviously, you know, as you just said,

946
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,519
Cuban, Black Haze, Blue Dream, bit of an

947
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,280
unexpected winner there. Were there any

948
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:13,000
other combos that caught you a bit off

949
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,839
guard with what you saw come out of it?

950
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,519
Um recently, yeah, like of that Autobond

951
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,239
Haze. Um I have a I have a Feno of the

952
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,480
Autobond Pers, which is uh holy, which

953
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,039
is a Harlem Dreams cross with the

954
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,159
Autobond Gold. And remember the Autobond

955
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,599
Gold is the 120day Haze, right? But this

956
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,480
Feno is like 65 days. I couldn't believe

957
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,640
it, you know? That's something that

958
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,400
caught me off guard recently, like you

959
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:43,358
know, in feno hunting.

960
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,440
Yeah, totally. Totally. I guess as we

961
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,880
talk a bit more about breeding, I'd love

962
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,358
to know like is there is there a certain

963
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,519
like philosophy or sort of guideline

964
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,598
you're trying to adhere to or is it more

965
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,239
just sort of playing and exploring? And

966
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,480
I guess as a quick example by that, do

967
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,639
you have this approach where it's like I

968
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,719
just want to work with sort of haze

969
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,480
dominant stuff or is it like no no I'm

970
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,919
not confining myself like that but

971
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,920
that's just what I'm interested in right

972
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,760
now.

973
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,838
Well, you know, I love Haze. I love Sour

974
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,560
Diesel. I love Turpps, man. I love all

975
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,199
the fire turpps. I am I am partial to

976
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,519
Haze, of course. You know, mainly that's

977
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,000
what I work with, but I'm I I other

978
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,920
flavors, you know. I like I like

979
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,519
everything.

980
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,000
Sure. Sure. And I I wanted to ask like,

981
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,079
you know, what what's your thoughts on

982
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,679
the progression of the seed market?

983
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,400
because I think it's undeniable that

984
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,480
over the past say 5 to 10 years

985
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,639
feminized seeds have really become the

986
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,800
dominant driver in the market in terms

987
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,719
of supply and demand. And when I speak

988
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,440
to a lot of breeders many of them say

989
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,759
that this is being reflected in this not

990
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,358
not just in their sales but in what

991
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,720
they're planning to do. You know you've

992
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:58,880
got breeders like Exotic Mike who at one

993
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,559
point in time were very reluctant to do

994
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
fems and now it's all he does and he

995
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,480
says you know it's just because the

996
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,159
numbers speak for themselves. Are you

997
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,079
feeling anything like that at the

998
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,559
moment? I know you offer both regs and

999
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,640
fems. Do you plan to continue offering

1000
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,239
regs or do you feel like the market's

1001
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,639
just too strong and there's not the

1002
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,159
demand?

1003
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,838
You know, I'm I'm always going to offer

1004
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,199
regs as well because I want to think

1005
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,920
about the other people that want to

1006
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:25,838
breed too, you know, um like me. Like I

1007
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,838
would have loved to buy some piff rags,

1008
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,358
you know. So yeah, I mean I'm just

1009
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,000
waiting for the right male to make a

1010
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,719
piff regular. My sour diesels are regs

1011
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,800
right now, you know. Um, but yeah, I'm

1012
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,118
cool with regs and fems. It's just

1013
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,000
whatever the project is. Uh, I feel like

1014
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,960
it's a lot easier with regs cuz a lot of

1015
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,239
problems happen with

1016
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,320
reversals. So, sometimes you miss out

1017
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,358
and you lose a crop and and it sucks,

1018
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,000
you know, but it happens, you know. Um,

1019
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,559
regs are definitely a lot

1020
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,400
easier. That's for sure. Totally. And

1021
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,440
you know what? I want to actually take a

1022
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,480
moment to jump into this because so many

1023
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,318
people who have never done

1024
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,559
reversals would understandably

1025
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,880
underestimate the issues that can go

1026
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,318
wrong with it. So, I'd love to hear one

1027
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,000
of your reversal failures cuz I I've

1028
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,880
told mine, but I really want to hammer

1029
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,880
it home that like I you know, I feel

1030
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,760
like it's up to the stars sometimes as

1031
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,160
to whether reversals work. Well, [ __ ]

1032
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,760
man. I'll give you my latest dilemma. my

1033
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,358
holy communion X. Um hopefully you know

1034
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,839
someone awesome is listening to this and

1035
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,639
has an answer. But I've tried to reverse

1036
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:40,318
it four times now. The first run it was

1037
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:43,039
just STS normal every 3 days. Um the

1038
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:46,880
second run um well actually my friend

1039
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,199
tried it as well. He did STS failure. So

1040
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,480
I tried this last run. I did two plants

1041
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:55,519
STS, two plants colloidal silver and two

1042
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,119
plants elite times elite. all, you know,

1043
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:03,280
different ratios and they all created

1044
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,880
the sacks, but no pollen, no seeds. So,

1045
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,119
yeah, I can't figure it out, man. This

1046
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,720
plant won't

1047
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,160
reverse. So, I' I've had trouble in the

1048
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,358
past, but usually when you do multiple

1049
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,920
plants, you'll get some that you'll

1050
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,799
still get some, but this one, I I can't

1051
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,200
get nothing. I would love the scientific

1052
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,039
reason for that, you know. Yeah, that's

1053
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,000
really interesting. I guess just as a

1054
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:28,559
quick followup, have you ever pollinated

1055
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,880
it? Does it make seeds?

1056
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,838
Yes. Yeah, I've pollinated her and she

1057
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,119
does. She made seeds. That's a real

1058
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,000
interesting one. You know, like

1059
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,838
obviously historically TK has held the

1060
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,440
crown as being like the very difficult

1061
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,119
plant to reverse, but um it's it's

1062
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,519
interesting. It sounds like this one

1063
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,200
could also be up there. So maybe someone

1064
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,280
has the answer. Maybe they can they can

1065
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,439
help chime in. That that would be really

1066
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,760
interesting if they did. That would be

1067
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,838
cool, man. Yeah. I just want to quickly

1068
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,079
loop back cuz in the past answer you

1069
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,239
mentioned the PFCO sour. Tell me a

1070
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,240
little bit about your sour, how it came

1071
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,639
to be in existence. I took a quick look

1072
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:10,000
online before and I think you use some

1073
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:12,559
karma genetics in it. Yes. So, uh, the

1074
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,199
Piffco sour. I was collecting all the

1075
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:19,199
sour diesel cuts, you know, the Choco

1076
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:23,199
cut, res cut, the Albany cut, the Nutoo

1077
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,759
cut, the Devil Harvest crew cut, you

1078
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:29,118
know, JP plant speakers cut, you name

1079
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,280
it. Like, I had every sour cut that you

1080
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,920
could find. And I hit them all with a

1081
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,680
Karma Genetics, Sour Diesel BX2. Shout

1082
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,838
out to the homie Karma, man. He sent me

1083
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:43,598
those seeds as well. And um you know uh

1084
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:46,000
I hunted 200 seeds and found you know my

1085
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,680
my sour the piscoco sour diesel and that

1086
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,838
one ended up being the J plant weaker

1087
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:54,399
sour cross with the with the karma.

1088
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,759
Oh I I want to talk about your one but

1089
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,920
before we go there tell me like roughly

1090
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,599
out of all those sour clones you listed

1091
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,318
which ones did you think were all right

1092
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,960
and which not so much?

1093
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,119
So, historically, like originally on the

1094
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,760
forums, there was really just the Choco

1095
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,039
and the AJ cut. The Choco was the real

1096
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,800
cut. The AJ cut was not the real cut.

1097
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,639
And, you know, that's just how it was.

1098
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,480
Now, I've met AJ in real life, and his

1099
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,239
cut is the real cut, but the one that

1100
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,400
went around on the farm in the day as

1101
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,679
the AJ cut was like a a taller, lanky

1102
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,280
headband kind of looking cut, and it

1103
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,598
didn't really grow like sour. Like the

1104
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,839
Choco was always the real one. And I

1105
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,318
still stand by that. Like the Albany was

1106
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,920
really good, too. The Resco's really

1107
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,838
good, too. They're all right there, you

1108
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,519
know. But the Choco is just has always

1109
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,440
been the one, you know, that I've that's

1110
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,119
the one I've had the longest. That's the

1111
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,838
one that I've always had as sour before

1112
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,280
I got all these hype sour cuts, you

1113
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,400
know, that was just always like that's

1114
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,839
my sour and the AJ, but you know, the

1115
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,480
Choco was always better. So nice. Okay.

1116
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,799
And so why did you uh go with the J

1117
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,800
plant speaker one?

1118
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,240
That's just the best feno that came out

1119
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,519
of the seeds, man. You know, I can't

1120
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:10,399
control it just because I like the choco

1121
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:13,039
the best as the cut out of those seeds,

1122
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,639
man. You know that J Plant Speaker one

1123
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,079
had it. It was there was there best

1124
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:21,920
taste. It really filled the pallet with

1125
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,519
the sour rocket fuel taste, you know,

1126
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,480
that a lot of sour hasn't really been

1127
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,920
hitting like lately. So, that's why I

1128
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,800
kept that one, man. You never know what

1129
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,960
you're going to get out of these seeds.

1130
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,680
Yeah, totally. I mean, it almost like

1131
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,159
people can take uh you know, rest easy

1132
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,318
knowing that you've done the permeations

1133
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,679
and combinations and as you said, you

1134
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,119
know, different things are going to

1135
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,879
click better than others. So, that's

1136
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,880
cool to hear. Do you plan to mostly do

1137
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,720
hybrids? Are you going to keep

1138
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,358
purifying? You know, like I I know Karm

1139
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,959
is I think he's gone to the BX4. Do you

1140
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,519
have any plans to do that or what's your

1141
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,559
plans to do with the line overall? So,

1142
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,639
I'm at F2 now. So, I've gone two

1143
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:04,719
generations. Um, I'm going to go F3s

1144
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:08,639
next. So, and I'm also going to do like

1145
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:10,799
a back cross, maybe uh, you know, do

1146
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,358
some in crosses, different crosses. I'm

1147
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,200
doing definitely some hybrids, you know,

1148
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,119
working on that probably outdoor next

1149
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,318
year.

1150
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah. Nice. Okay. And you just mentioned

1151
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,719
outdoors, you know, which of your

1152
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,880
offerings would you say lean a bit more

1153
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,879
to the outdoor side will do a bit better

1154
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,519
out there?

1155
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,000
Um, well, our sour jeezels were like

1156
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:36,880
record some of the best freaking outdoor

1157
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,280
stuff that I've seen, you know, in the

1158
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,640
east area. So, that was cool. Um, those

1159
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,160
were actually bred indoor that

1160
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,118
generation, but I have done a couple

1161
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,639
generations outdoors as well. Um, I

1162
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,000
don't know. They're all different, man.

1163
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,440
Generally, the hazes are pretty good

1164
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,440
outdoors if you can get the ones that

1165
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,519
finish in time. If you're in like

1166
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,599
somewhere like where it's nice all the

1167
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:00,079
time and you have unlimited flowering

1168
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,760
time, then you can do great. They

1169
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,800
usually don't mold up too much. They're

1170
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,960
pretty pest resistant. Um, we just have

1171
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,960
here finding the ones that finish in

1172
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,960
time.

1173
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,960
Sure. Yeah. Okay. I had a few people ask

1174
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,519
they uh they noticed you were working

1175
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,119
with the block work haze. I couldn't

1176
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,039
find too much information about it. Can

1177
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,000
you tell us the genetics and what that

1178
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,119
one brings? Yeah, the black work haze is

1179
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,960
uh the green haze crossed with Harlem

1180
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,039
Dreams. So, the green haze has always

1181
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,800
been my favorite color. You know, back

1182
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:35,119
in the day, all the different kinds of

1183
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,880
hazes. You could get the gold haze, you

1184
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,358
can get the dark brown haze, you can get

1185
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
the army green haze, or you can get the

1186
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,440
neon green haze. And the neon green haze

1187
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,200
is the one that I always liked. You

1188
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,800
know, it's just got this extra sharpness

1189
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:51,439
to it. Um, so yeah, I crossed that to

1190
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,119
the Harlem. I only gave those seeds out

1191
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,039
to the people who came to uh that year's

1192
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,760
Piffcon um in the VIP boxes. So, there

1193
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,199
was 50 packs released

1194
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,920
total. One of the growers out of there

1195
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,719
took that and won first place the next

1196
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,838
year at New York Growers Cup. So, that

1197
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,679
was cool. And then,

1198
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:13,119
um yeah, so that's what Blockwork Haze

1199
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:16,000
is though. It's a Green Haze times

1200
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,000
Harlem Dreams.

1201
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,880
Nice. Okay. And and would you say that

1202
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,838
it's sort of in that category of sativas

1203
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,240
where it's like really really like racy

1204
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,480
like maybe a bit anxiety edge or is it

1205
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,719
more like just like uplifting and fun

1206
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,119
and not not like on that anxiety end of

1207
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,959
things?

1208
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,200
I don't get too much anxiety from it.

1209
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,679
You know I have I have but everybody's

1210
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,439
endockinabonoid system is different. So

1211
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,598
it's hard to say man. I can never really

1212
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,920
promise on effects. That's the one thing

1213
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,838
I you know I can give you good turpps. I

1214
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,039
can give you the right turbs, but I

1215
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:53,039
can't tell you how it's going to affect

1216
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:54,480
your body, you know. Yeah, sure. Sure. I

1217
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,960
wanted to quickly ask, one of the fans

1218
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,240
asked, "Have you run any of the uh

1219
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,159
Masonic Wilson Cross Cuban Blackh?"

1220
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:05,919
Yeah, shout out to Masonic, man. I have

1221
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:09,519
a keeper cut of El Kubano. It's a 56 day

1222
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,159
cut. It smells piffy. It has little pink

1223
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,920
on the finish. It's pretty nice, man.

1224
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,399
you know, he ran a whole bet of the of

1225
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,480
some of my this year and crossed them

1226
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,639
all again. And, you know, I I I like

1227
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,960
Masonic, man. He's cool. Shout out to

1228
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,318
him, man. And uh yeah. Yeah. I like the

1229
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,159
El Kubano as well. Shit's fire.

1230
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:31,358
Totally, man. Shout out Masonic. I like

1231
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,199
him as well. Um I wanted to quickly ask

1232
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,519
you, what were your thoughts and your

1233
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,000
opinions on the Dutch Haze? You know,

1234
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,159
like I mean obviously you've mentioned

1235
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,440
um Jack Herrer, but what about things

1236
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:46,159
like Amnesia Haze or some of the really

1237
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,838
old Dutch haze like you know like the I

1238
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,679
guess like the original haze for lack of

1239
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,838
a better words like posatronics sort of

1240
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,838
stuff. Well, you know, a lot of that

1241
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,679
stuff kind of just falls under the jack

1242
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,078
turpps for me. There are a lot of you

1243
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,399
know tpinolene dominance. That being

1244
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,119
said, you know, when I came to Spanabis,

1245
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,960
my first time in Europe, uh, Karma gave

1246
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,760
me some Neville's haze. That was very

1247
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,159
piffy, you know. So, the I I see that

1248
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,440
some of that haze does exist out, you

1249
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,679
know, but you just got to find the right

1250
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,159
stuff. This tarpinolene is so dominant

1251
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,078
that most haze seeds on the market, if

1252
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,440
there's any trace of tarpinolene in the

1253
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,440
in the genetics, it's going to be

1254
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,400
tarpinolene dom. You know, you don't

1255
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,400
really find that stuff too often.

1256
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:32,079
Yeah. To No, totally. Totally. I wanted

1257
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:35,280
to ask you your thoughts on like how we

1258
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,760
might be able to initiate people into

1259
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,599
sativas who maybe aren't sort of that

1260
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,559
interested or maybe just haven't had the

1261
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,240
greatest experience. I guess the first

1262
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,319
question is do you do you think that the

1263
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,239
the best way is through something maybe

1264
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,239
that you might argue is a little more

1265
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,000
approachable at first like like a super

1266
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,479
silver haze or just something a bit more

1267
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,400
chill or do you think no no no go for

1268
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:03,039
the more unique like long flowering [ __ ]

1269
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,039
black haze A5 C5 something a bit more

1270
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,960
like you know maybe a bit more like more

1271
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,960
risk more reward sort of vibe what's

1272
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,440
your thoughts

1273
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,440
well uh you know the nose knows bro. So,

1274
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,440
if you have access and you can smell

1275
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,119
some samples and check out some stuff

1276
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,639
and see what you're vibing with, try it

1277
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,960
out. You know, that's what I say. Um, a

1278
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,118
lot of people have a big misconception

1279
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,400
of what sativa and indica really is. You

1280
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,400
know, it doesn't mean that it's going to

1281
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,639
be uplifting. Just because it's a narrow

1282
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,358
leaf plant, you know, a lot of this

1283
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,960
stuff is based on the

1284
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:37,039
tarpen. So, it's tough. You know, it's

1285
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,400
tough to to navigate, but you just got

1286
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,639
to have good weed, man. Show it to

1287
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,039
people. They're going to smell it. If

1288
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:46,000
they like it, they're gonna smoke it,

1289
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:49,119
you know.

1290
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,719
Yeah, certainly. I guess if I zoom out

1291
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,358
from that question, do you feel like it

1292
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,439
like more and more people are are losing

1293
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,639
that passion for sativa? Cuz sometimes I

1294
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,480
hear this sentiment that like the

1295
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,159
younger generations, they're just sort

1296
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,719
of into indica. Most of them have never

1297
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,000
even really had sativa. Do you do you

1298
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,799
feel that at all? Do you have any

1299
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,119
concerns or thoughts about that?

1300
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,880
Well, you know, it's more about the

1301
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,800
newer generation is kind of likes the

1302
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,760
candy, you know, and that's just what it

1303
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,119
is, at least here, you know. Um, but

1304
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,599
there there's always going to be people

1305
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,160
there that like sativas or like the idea

1306
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,599
of sativa and will go searching for it

1307
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:29,318
and, you know, and they'll find it, you

1308
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:33,200
know. So, I think I think

1309
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:35,440
uh, you know, and also there are short

1310
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,799
flowering sativas, so they're not

1311
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,639
completely gone. Most commercial

1312
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,400
cultivations also offer sativa as well,

1313
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,920
you know, at least here. So, I'm not

1314
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,920
sure how it is for the rest of the

1315
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,920
world.

1316
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,039
Yeah. No, certainly certainly I I do

1317
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,880
love me some uh some short flouring

1318
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,519
sativas and and for me that was the

1319
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,280
gateway into the more longer stuff. So,

1320
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,199
you know, I think it's and but likewise,

1321
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,640
you know, I've had some pretty profound

1322
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,159
experiences just having some long

1323
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,799
flowering stuff. So, I think either is

1324
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,358
probably a pretty reasonable approach.

1325
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,720
Um, I I guess I I sort of implied it in

1326
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,239
that last question, but I haven't asked

1327
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:15,358
you. Have you smoked much of the uh the

1328
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,879
the A5 or the C5 clone that you know

1329
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,039
sort of go around? And what's your

1330
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,358
thoughts on those as alternative NL5

1331
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,920
haze cuts that are considered in pretty

1332
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,719
high regard?

1333
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,800
Yeah, man. I had I I had Yo, Sammy visit

1334
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,519
us here, man, and he brought some A5 and

1335
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,519
C5. I was able to smoke both of them.

1336
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,079
They were good, man. I like the A5 for

1337
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:38,559
sure. The C5 Jack Turps, not my thing,

1338
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,200
but I see why it was important, you

1339
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,920
know, if that's the mother of all of

1340
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:46,879
most Jack. It's pretty cool. But, you

1341
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,880
know, the A5 was spicy, leathery, you

1342
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,559
know, it was good. It definitely piff

1343
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,160
reminiscent.

1344
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,920
Yeah. Nice. Nice. I had I had a uh I had

1345
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,078
a bit of a weird question for you, but

1346
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,760
it it came up a lot amongst the Patreon

1347
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,359
listeners, so I did want to ask it,

1348
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:07,040
which is why do you think that the PIF

1349
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,440
and and also Sour, why why do they draw

1350
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,279
so much emotion from the masses? You

1351
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,440
know, it feels like the conversations

1352
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,640
get really heated and they feel so

1353
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,358
polarizing about the

1354
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:20,078
backstories. What What do you think it

1355
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:22,639
is that makes these strains evoke such

1356
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,480
emotion from people?

1357
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,039
Oh man, I don't know. It's tough. It's

1358
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,199
just like anything else, you know.

1359
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,199
People, you know, some people have

1360
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,598
really made a living off of this, off of

1361
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,078
this, you know, and have families or

1362
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,838
lost loved ones over Haze and Sour. So,

1363
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,240
it's a touchy subject for some people,

1364
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,239
you know, and then, you know, it just is

1365
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:45,118
what it is.

1366
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,479
Sure. Sure. And I mean, while I've got

1367
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,079
you on, you know, I haven't had a chance

1368
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,480
to talk to to many East Coasters uh in

1369
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,599
the recent past. And in the advent of

1370
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,039
the whole sprayed pack revolution, I'd

1371
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,400
love to hear your thoughts on it. You

1372
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:59,358
know, do you think it's a dying fad? Do

1373
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,519
you think it's something that's going to

1374
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,279
stay? I I know that at least from what I

1375
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,800
hear, they're more prevalent sort of on

1376
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,359
the East Coast. What's been your

1377
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,519
experience with it all?

1378
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,440
Yeah, spray packs are going crazy right

1379
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:14,639
now in New York City, man. It's it's

1380
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,318
wild, you know. Um, but listen, if kids

1381
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,838
are going to smoke cotton candy flavored

1382
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,358
vapes, why? And if they have the

1383
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:22,480
opportunity to smoke the same cotton

1384
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:24,400
candy flavor on weed, why wouldn't they?

1385
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,800
That's what they're smoking, you know.

1386
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,160
So, yeah, it sucks, you know, but it is

1387
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,519
what it is. And there will always be

1388
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,719
people something natural. So, not to

1389
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,759
worry, man. I don't think we're going to

1390
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:37,799
get taken over by spray turpps anytime

1391
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,559
soon. But I would watch out more for

1392
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,400
like a lot of tarping companies make

1393
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,960
imitation turpps. So I could grow some

1394
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,639
some runs that looks like, you know,

1395
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,798
looks really good but has no turpps and

1396
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,519
then just spray it with extra runs

1397
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:56,000
turpps. And that's happening a lot too,

1398
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:58,000
you know. So you never know what's in

1399
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,400
that stuff. And yeah, I don't I don't

1400
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,280
know. I don't really I don't mess with

1401
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,480
the spray turpps at

1402
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:09,119
all, you know, but can't stop them.

1403
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,159
Yeah, totally. Totally. I guess my only

1404
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,599
followup is do you think that it will

1405
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:17,279
sort of fall in popularity but still

1406
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,039
sort of remain in the background or do

1407
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,640
you think it's like a a trend and it's

1408
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,119
just going to fall off eventually and

1409
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,358
we'll just move on?

1410
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,318
Well, it'll probably around if they find

1411
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:29,920
a way to make sure it's safe and stuff

1412
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,000
and you know licensed companies are

1413
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,639
doing this. There's there's already many

1414
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,199
infused products on the market. You

1415
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,838
know, like I said, mostly it's infused

1416
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,759
with botanical derived turpps that are

1417
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,239
supposedly of the same strain, you know,

1418
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,359
just to make it a little bit more smelly

1419
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:49,039
or last longer in the jar, you know. So,

1420
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:50,639
this stuff is happening now, you know. I

1421
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,119
don't think it's going to go anywhere.

1422
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,639
Maybe with legalization, tougher to do

1423
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,000
flavored stuff, you know, on the legal

1424
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:59,679
market. So, you probably won't see it

1425
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,519
there, you know, at least for a while

1426
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,199
because that more appeals to kids and

1427
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,880
that's why they they don't allow that,

1428
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:08,399
you know.

1429
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,358
Yeah, sure. No, I understand. Um, I

1430
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,200
wanted to ask you, what pack would you

1431
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,598
recommend for someone listening who just

1432
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,879
wants to try some PIFF type genetics?

1433
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,039
You know, something where they might be

1434
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,039
able to find a a plan in there that has,

1435
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,358
you know, some of the attributes that

1436
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:26,239
sort of people are really fond of in the

1437
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:28,480
PF. Honestly, man, like I would go for

1438
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:29,919
the Midnight Mass. That's just like if

1439
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,240
someone put a gun to my head and said,

1440
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,920
"Pop one seed and it has to have piff

1441
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:35,959
turpps." like I would go with the

1442
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,760
Midnight Mass. That's a Cuban Black Haze

1443
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,280
BX1. Uh using the Harlem Dreams. Um

1444
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,160
those have been around for a while, you

1445
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,519
know, good seed stock. Many, many great

1446
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,920
fenos in there. Um as far as the new

1447
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,079
crosses from the block work run, I would

1448
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,838
go with like the block haze. That's the

1449
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,160
block work haze cross back to the Cuban

1450
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:58,880
black haze. So again, it's just, you

1451
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,239
know, you're going to find in there and

1452
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,599
you know, you'll find some good ones for

1453
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:06,159
sure. But really, honestly, anything I

1454
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,240
offer, man. Anything I offer is is going

1455
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,558
to be what it is, you know? You just got

1456
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,399
to what's your preference.

1457
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,160
Yeah, totally. Totally. Look, I I love

1458
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,720
that. And on the other end of the

1459
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:19,399
spectrum, for maybe someone who's a bit

1460
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,279
more initiated, willing to run things

1461
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,599
longer, what would be your

1462
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,359
recommendation for like, you know,

1463
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,039
someone who's like, I I want to run

1464
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,480
something 100 days plus. What do you

1465
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,880
got?

1466
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,159
Well, I just dropped these tie pips. Um,

1467
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,000
it's a double tie from Ace Seeds. It's

1468
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,239
the Coach Cheng tie cross with the Mayo

1469
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,239
tie. And then I crossed that one to the

1470
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:43,598
block where Kay's, you know. So, you'll

1471
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:46,239
find some 120 day in there.

1472
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,599
Ooh. I I've I've read of that cross, but

1473
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:48,959
I haven't really spoken to anyone who's

1474
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,559
run it. Can you tell me a little bit

1475
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,639
about what your experience with that one

1476
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,760
is like and and what what's the effect

1477
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,838
like on those uh those land race tires?

1478
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,520
It sounds cool.

1479
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,759
It's really cool, man. It's actually

1480
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,039
quite piffy and I was surprised, you

1481
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,799
know, because I always thought that it

1482
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,039
came more from the Colombian side. At

1483
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:10,639
least that's what people say, you know,

1484
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:13,599
but this this tie is, you know, kind of

1485
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:15,759
incensey and, you know, kind of kind of

1486
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,200
piffy. It's a little different, but I

1487
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,720
really like it, man. I think it's really

1488
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,759
fire. It's super long flowering, but I

1489
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,239
think people are really going to dig

1490
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,280
that one, man. That's why, you know,

1491
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:29,279
it's good [ __ ] That that's awesome. And

1492
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,599
you sort of read my mind because my next

1493
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,880
question was going to be do you plan to

1494
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:37,760
look into like more raw unworked sort of

1495
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,640
stuff like land race or do you think you

1496
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,880
want to do more refining of what you've

1497
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,960
already got?

1498
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,798
So, you know, I'm always refining what I

1499
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,039
have, but at the same time, I'm always

1500
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,599
creating something new in those

1501
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,119
generations, too, you know. So, I'm

1502
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,519
always going to be adding some new

1503
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,039
stuff, old stuff, cool stuff in the mix,

1504
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,199
whatever kind of stuff I like that I

1505
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:03,199
come across, you know. Uh, lately I ran

1506
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,679
into some AFC goo when I was in

1507
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,279
California and um, yeah, I really liked

1508
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:08,558
it. So, I got the cuts, I got the mom

1509
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,400
goo and the afu. I'm going to cross them

1510
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,559
to the haze and hopefully find some pip

1511
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,798
goo and that shit's going to be fire,

1512
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,960
man. You know, so it's just anything,

1513
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,960
you know. But, yeah, I have some seeds

1514
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,400
on the list that I want to pop. I got,

1515
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,880
you know, some old stuff, some new

1516
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,160
stuff, some stuff that I made, you know,

1517
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,280
bunch of stuff. I love to ask people,

1518
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,679
what do you consider to be like the

1519
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,920
rarest seeds in your collection? Maybe

1520
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,318
for sentimental or for historical

1521
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,920
reasons. What What's the stuff that you

1522
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,920
know you would grab first? Not

1523
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:44,159
necessarily to pop, but just rare. Oh,

1524
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,159
man. I don't know, man. I got a lot. I

1525
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,679
got a

1526
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:50,558
lot. We'll see.

1527
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:54,078
Damn. I don't know, man. It's tough. I

1528
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:57,200
have a lot of old amazing stuff. I can't

1529
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,960
say this one now. But I do know that if

1530
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:03,480
ever anything ever happens, I will get

1531
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,480
my seeds and run out of the house.

1532
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,920
I love that. I love that. All right. So,

1533
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,920
that's where you're running first.

1534
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,039
Yeah. Yes. Definitely to the seeds for

1535
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,119
sure. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. Um, one of

1536
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,960
our listeners, they they wanted to ask

1537
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,519
you if you could give us a little bit of

1538
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,358
info on the PIFF S2s. You know, we did

1539
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:24,159
sort of mention them a bit earlier, but

1540
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,759
like uh how would you describe them and

1541
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,440
what are some of the differences maybe

1542
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,280
in effect and profile? Cuz you mentioned

1543
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,039
that, you know, shorter flowering was

1544
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,440
something you were aiming for. What else

1545
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,279
sort of goes along with it? You're going

1546
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,119
to find some super piffy stuff in there,

1547
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,839
man. shorter plants like it's more on

1548
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,318
the NL5 side. So, you know, but it

1549
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:45,199
really does carry that piff turf. Well,

1550
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:47,358
I would say like, you know, five out of

1551
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,519
10 fenos had it. And, you know, some

1552
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:52,239
fenos would be like a little more ED

1553
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,838
side, like kind of like beef jerkyish.

1554
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:55,679
And, you know, I've seen some weird

1555
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,679
stuff come out of there. I've seen some

1556
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,279
really cool stuff come out of there. I

1557
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:03,279
have my keeper out of there. It's called

1558
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:05,119
the PC3, the Piff Coast 3. Uh, you know,

1559
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,400
I gave it to Purple City Genetics. they

1560
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,079
were selling it as the New York City

1561
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,519
PIFF number three. So, it's been in a

1562
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,599
lot of facilities across the United

1563
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,318
States and you know that's kind of the

1564
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,480
one of the well-known cuts. Um, so yeah,

1565
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,480
that came right out of the PIFS too. Uh,

1566
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,719
you know, you know, so if you got those

1567
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,880
seeds, pop them. You can find some fire

1568
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,439
in there.

1569
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,880
Yeah. Nice. Nice. I I wanted to ask you

1570
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,039
cuz one of the listeners they did sort

1571
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,838
of pose an interesting question and um

1572
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:34,558
I'll I'll try to frame it because I I'm

1573
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,920
not aware of all the intricacies of it

1574
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,839
all but basically they were sort of

1575
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,400
saying that like from what they had

1576
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:43,599
heard like the Nuggies cut was maybe a

1577
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,880
bit more NL leaning compared to the um

1578
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:49,920
the other one and they sort of felt like

1579
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,680
that detracted a bit from the overall

1580
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,639
essence of the PIFF being in that like

1581
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,399
it's meant to be this sativa And um I

1582
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,920
guess I'd be interested in hearing like

1583
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,440
do you just view it like it's all it's

1584
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,519
all the same line. It's just various

1585
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,240
representations of it. Or do you do you

1586
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,318
view the piff as like it is this sativa

1587
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,759
thing and it should stay that? Like it's

1588
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,279
obviously more of a philosophical view,

1589
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,200
but how do you view the line in that

1590
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,200
sense? Well, you know, the piffas came

1591
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,038
from like what we call the brown haze

1592
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,038
cut, you know, so that didn't derive

1593
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,799
from nuggets uh Cuban black haze. But at

1594
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,119
the same time, I' I've grown both

1595
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:26,960
Asher's cut straight from Asher and

1596
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,039
Nugget's cut straight from from Nugget,

1597
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,798
and they're the same [ __ ] It's Cuban

1598
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,960
black haze, man. There's only there's

1599
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:37,199
only one rail cut, you know? So,

1600
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:40,639
um, as far so, it's all the same. Yeah.

1601
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:42,798
Yeah, it's that's it. Same [ __ ] man.

1602
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:44,960
Ah, there you go. There you go. Okay.

1603
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,798
Um, the next question I wanted to

1604
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,559
quickly ask you and before I wanted to

1605
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:51,599
jump into some Pivcon stuff, which I'm

1606
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:54,480
excited to talk about, is what gets you

1607
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,640
excited strainwise? Is there a clone out

1608
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,760
there that maybe you've tried or you

1609
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:59,038
don't have yet? I know you just

1610
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,400
mentioned the AF GUI, so I'm going to

1611
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,039
make you I'm going to pull another one

1612
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,480
out of here, but um is there uh is there

1613
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,720
something that you're excited to work

1614
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,880
with in the future?

1615
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,399
Well, hell yeah, man. That's why Piffcon

1616
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,200
is awesome. you know, I got that double

1617
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,720
tie from a fifth pound grower, you know,

1618
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:16,480
so like it's awesome to see all the

1619
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:18,558
different hazes that people enter every

1620
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,880
year and, you know, that's kind of my

1621
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,920
way to to find some new genetics as

1622
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,760
well, man. And we do data data testing

1623
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,318
on all of them as well, you know. So,

1624
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,280
it's really cool data

1625
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:30,960
collection. Uh, we're finding some

1626
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,519
really cool hazes that way. I've seen

1627
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,679
some come across some really nice stuff.

1628
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,519
Definitely.

1629
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:41,038
That's so awesome that you're able to

1630
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,719
get stuff back from your supporters. I

1631
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,160
want to hear about Piffcon. So, why

1632
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:45,919
don't we start off? Why don't you tell

1633
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,639
me about the genesis? You know, where

1634
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,798
did the idea come from and how did you

1635
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,239
first start to get the wheels in motion

1636
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:55,759
to bring it to life from an idea?

1637
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,159
Well, you know, I was just going to

1638
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,920
events around New York City and there

1639
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:02,318
was a couple different competitions and

1640
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,318
I was like, you know what? Let me uh let

1641
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,920
me make one for P, you know, and that

1642
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,000
was it. So now we're here four years

1643
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,159
later and it's getting bigger and bigger

1644
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,159
every year. We had over 2,000 people

1645
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:16,879
last year. Uh Piffcon is a PF haze

1646
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:20,838
convention and competition hosted in New

1647
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:24,640
York City. Um you can enter one ounce of

1648
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:28,519
flower. Um you know to be judged by 12

1649
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:31,440
hand selected judges, you know.

1650
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:33,038
Um so yeah, it's really cool man. It's a

1651
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,400
competition. A lot of people come out

1652
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,079
for it. It's the premier, you know,

1653
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,920
Sativa Haze Cup, man. This is where all

1654
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,559
the Sativa lovers come out. All the Piff

1655
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,159
lovers, all the Haze lovers. It's It's

1656
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,039
the most amazing thing in the world to

1657
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,440
me, man. It's like It's my favorite day

1658
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,440
every year.

1659
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,679
Wow, that's incredible. I I can only

1660
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,679
imagine. I guess I want to ask some more

1661
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:58,239
specifics about it, but first I want to

1662
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,558
give you recognition. How much work goes

1663
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:02,318
into setting it up?

1664
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,039
It's a lot of work, man. It's a lot of

1665
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:07,000
work. But it takes me all year to set it

1666
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,319
up and then all year again for the next

1667
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,920
year, you know. But it's worth it, man.

1668
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,558
It's so worth it to bring the community

1669
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,798
together, you know, to have the all

1670
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,680
everybody in Hayes comes together for

1671
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:21,759
Piffcon, man. It's so cool. That That's

1672
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:24,639
killer. How many How many people do you

1673
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,920
think end up attending?

1674
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,480
So, the first year we had 300. Um the

1675
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,119
second year we had 700 and then the

1676
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,199
third year we had 2,000.

1677
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,599
Oh my god, that's so cool for an organic

1678
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:39,759
event. So tell tell me what was the most

1679
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:42,000
recent one like? I've seen videos. It

1680
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,920
looked like it was going hard. It's

1681
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,440
amazing, man. It's just a giant

1682
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,519
nightclub, you know, with 50 Haze

1683
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,400
vendors that flew in from across the

1684
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:54,798
country to showing off. You know, you

1685
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,240
can get Haze genetics there. You know,

1686
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:58,960
you got everybody entering in the

1687
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:01,118
competition. You got, you know, just so

1688
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,440
much cool [ __ ] man. the It smells like

1689
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,760
incense for a for a block away, you

1690
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,240
know, when you pull up to Piffcon. It's

1691
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,400
awesome.

1692
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:13,439
What was uh what was the most impressive

1693
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,440
sample you tried? The most recent one.

1694
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,639
Oh, man. It's hard to say, man. I can't

1695
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,358
I can't say, man. There a lot of

1696
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,960
samples. Tell tell me one or two that

1697
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,400
you know just were good enough that they

1698
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,519
sort of jumped to mine. And there's many

1699
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,480
more excellent unnamed ones,

1700
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:32,559
you know. Oh, actually, Mr. nice guy.

1701
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,960
He's a He's a grower out of New York. He

1702
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:38,680
he entered some Midnight Mass that I

1703
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:42,240
just loved, you know, right off the bat.

1704
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:44,118
Um, man, I'm trying to think. And I

1705
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,598
think, you know, for

1706
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:49,440
me, Seven Leaf, Haley's Comet is some of

1707
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,160
my favorite, too. You know, that that

1708
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,039
was entered into the last pip. So, those

1709
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:57,038
were I think those were my two picks.

1710
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:00,400
But, you know, the judges, the judges

1711
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,319
voted and uh the Band-Aid won, man. Hell

1712
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,480
yeah. Shout out to Bod, you know,

1713
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,159
Band-Aid won. Shout out to Doc D, too,

1714
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,318
for all the for all that work there,

1715
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:10,000
man. And shout out to Rich So far. He

1716
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,880
was the grower of the Band-Aid Haze. He

1717
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,960
did a phenomenal job. You know, give you

1718
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,960
guys a tip. You know, curing is super

1719
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,600
important. And if the weed is still

1720
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,798
spongy and and, you know, smelling good,

1721
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,640
it's going to have a higher chance with

1722
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,560
the judges, man. if the stuff's dry by

1723
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,239
the time I get it, you know, they're

1724
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,880
going to get overlooked, man. So, he was

1725
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:30,639
one of the guys that just his flower was

1726
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,480
fresh, it was grown well, it was trimmed

1727
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,119
well, it was beautiful, and that's the

1728
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:38,479
one that took it, man.

1729
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,000
You know, that's exciting. I uh I I

1730
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,278
might have missed it. How How many

1731
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,960
categories are there? Is it just the

1732
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:47,679
one? So, actually, it's three

1733
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:50,560
categories. So, that was the over 75 day

1734
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,920
flowering category or the connoisseur.

1735
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,560
And then we have the commercial grade

1736
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,158
which is under 75 day. That one was

1737
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,719
taken by Lobster Family Farms uh with a

1738
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:03,238
his holy communion pheno. And then we

1739
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:06,560
also have an extracts uh

1740
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:07,919
category. And uh I think pot snobs won

1741
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,759
with the new berry haze. I'm not sure

1742
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,798
off the top of my head. I think that

1743
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:15,279
Yeah, I believe so. Wow. And and

1744
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:18,399
something I I love to ask everyone who

1745
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:21,600
breeds with sativas is do you feel that

1746
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:24,158
you can encapsulate that sativa feeling

1747
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,560
into a concentrate or do you feel like

1748
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:29,519
it's it's not quite the same as when you

1749
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:33,759
say have the flour? Oh no, you can do

1750
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,600
it. [ __ ] fire too, you know. I got we

1751
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,520
make all the different types of

1752
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,920
extracts, you know. I got the piff carts

1753
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,640
that leave that piff incense smell in

1754
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,079
the room after you puff it, you know,

1755
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,000
they don't really wash too well.

1756
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:49,079
Honestly, most sativas with the smaller

1757
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,920
glands and the long stalks and you know,

1758
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:56,238
but you know, I BH works well, you know,

1759
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,800
other extraction methods. But we're

1760
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,599
going to find washers, too. I just did

1761
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,320
some piff uh washer crosses. So, we're

1762
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,640
going to find some hashm piff this year

1763
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,639
cuz hash rosin's a big big market in the

1764
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,679
United States.

1765
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,000
Totally. Totally. And I think that

1766
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:15,840
concentrates are a key gateway to the

1767
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,238
younger audience who are mostly

1768
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,760
utilizing pens and things like that. You

1769
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:21,839
know, obviously you're talking about a

1770
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,679
higher grade product than a pen, but you

1771
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,360
know, you get my point. But I guess I'd

1772
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,239
be interested to hear, do you think that

1773
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,920
overall with time we could get to the

1774
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:31,759
point where like people are really

1775
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,480
really into sativas or do you think like

1776
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,560
it'll always probably be the the smaller

1777
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:39,839
subsect and like you know the the

1778
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,840
minority not the majority?

1779
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,920
Well, every place is different, man.

1780
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,239
Sativa is the most requested strain in

1781
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,640
New York, you know. Um people want

1782
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:51,039
sativas here. So it's different in every

1783
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,640
market, man. You know, it's tough. It's

1784
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:54,800
tough to say.

1785
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,880
So it's just more about providing good

1786
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,279
turpps and good flour and good

1787
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,960
experience and you know wherever you can

1788
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:03,359
do that it doesn't matter the strain man

1789
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,000
it's just matters whether it's it's good

1790
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:08,559
and people like it you know

1791
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,800
indicica or sativa

1792
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,920
totally totally totally I love that I

1793
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,600
think we just got to get to the point

1794
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,440
where people can try it you know I know

1795
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,239
that was my issue for the longest time

1796
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:20,319
was just exposure I couldn't get it but

1797
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,319
it's really just a testament to what

1798
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,079
you're doing helping get get the

1799
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,439
genetics out there so people can expose

1800
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,679
themselves. I think we're on to the uh

1801
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,678
the quickfire final questions at this

1802
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:34,560
point. So, the first one that I wanted

1803
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,640
to ask you was what was the single most

1804
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,320
memorable experience you've had? You

1805
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,640
know, and I say to people, I'm not

1806
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,399
necessarily meaning like the most stoned

1807
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,159
you've ever been, but just like the most

1808
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:47,319
memorable for whatever reason

1809
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,960
with

1810
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:54,599
cannabis, man. know that comes right off

1811
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:57,198
the top of my head is um when I was

1812
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,560
younger, one guy that I used to buy haze

1813
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:03,039
from used to chill at the corner of my

1814
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:05,199
block and he had his car always there.

1815
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,880
And one day my brother was walking over

1816
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:09,519
by that corner and he found a bag of

1817
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,279
haze that was ran over and he brought it

1818
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,239
home and gave it to me and I traded him

1819
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,639
like an ounce of Reggie for it and it

1820
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:19,439
was like a 2.1 that was completely

1821
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,400
flattened but it was lime green haze and

1822
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:25,759
I love that [ __ ] That's just a funny

1823
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:28,079
story that comes off the top of my head.

1824
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,719
I love that. That's so cool. And what a

1825
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:32,800
what a great early memory. On the other

1826
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,359
end of the spectrum, so to speak, what's

1827
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,279
a strain where everyone was hyping it

1828
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,039
up, you were quite excited to try it,

1829
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:42,759
and then eventually when you did, you

1830
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,760
were left a little disappointed?

1831
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:50,079
Damn, that's a tough,

1832
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:52,000
man. Um, I don't know. I'm never too

1833
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:55,840
disappointed with trains, man. I don't

1834
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:00,479
know. There's like everything has its

1835
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,960
place, you know? Um, yeah. I can't say.

1836
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,479
I can't say, man.

1837
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,239
I love that. That's Hey, that's a good

1838
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,000
problem to have if you've never if

1839
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,639
nothing jumps to mind. I love that. I

1840
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,719
love that. Um, so imagine I'm going to

1841
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:15,360
drop you off on a desert island. You can

1842
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,640
take three strains or packs of seeds

1843
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:18,639
with you. You know, it could be a clone.

1844
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,400
It could be a pack of seeds. What three

1845
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,719
things are you going to take to grow out

1846
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:25,839
for the rest of eternity?

1847
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,079
Oh man. Three things to grow for the

1848
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,880
rest of

1849
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:32,600
eternity. I'm going to

1850
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,480
take the Holy Communion

1851
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:38,480
X. Um, I'm going to

1852
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:41,279
take Swift Co Diesel and I'm going to

1853
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:43,039
take the Grapefruit Chem and that's it.

1854
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,559
I'm out.

1855
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:46,800
Oh, tell me a little bit about the

1856
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,039
grapefruit chemically. I saw it on your

1857
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,800
Instagram page.

1858
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:52,479
Grapefruit Chem is awesome, man. It's

1859
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,199
one of the top five strains that I've

1860
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:58,479
ever grown. Non Hazes, I would say top

1861
01:13:55,198 --> 01:14:01,039
five, but super loud, man. And it's like

1862
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:03,198
how loud sour diesel was back in the day

1863
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,279
is how loud grapefruit chem is.

1864
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:07,519
Grapefruit is across from breeder Steve

1865
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:10,158
sweet pink grapefruit to what I believe

1866
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,840
is chem, but there was three chems in

1867
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,599
the room at the time. So we're not

1868
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,079
really sure which one, but out of the

1869
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,560
progyny I would say it's probably the D,

1870
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:21,119
you know. Um, but yeah, it's it's from

1871
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:26,719
Tradewind Seed Company. That's the homie

1872
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:29,359
man. Uh, I was at the 2016 kneecam and I

1873
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,800
was wearing a [ __ ] cookie shirt and

1874
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:33,198
because at the time, you know, I'm like,

1875
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,000
"Everybody's frosty cookies, [ __ ] that."

1876
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:38,158
You know, so I was rocking that wave and

1877
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,359
uh he the homie Tradewinds really like

1878
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:40,359
my shirt and he's like, "Oh, I want to

1879
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:43,519
show you this

1880
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:46,238
jar." And uh he popped it open and the

1881
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,159
whole crowd around me was like and they

1882
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,238
all turned and looked at the jar and it

1883
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:52,079
was the grapefruit chem man. And yo,

1884
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,319
homie was so cool that he went home and

1885
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:55,279
he brought me back cuts the same day.

1886
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:57,439
You know, I've been rocking the

1887
01:14:55,279 --> 01:15:00,158
grapefruit chem since then. So, shout

1888
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:02,559
out to the Homie Traman Seed Company.

1889
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,198
That's killer. I love that. I love that.

1890
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:08,239
So, the next question is, imagine

1891
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:10,238
there's been a massive fire. You didn't

1892
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:12,559
get to save the whole seed collection,

1893
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:15,519
but you know, as you're siving through

1894
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,600
the ashes, there's one unscathed pack

1895
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,080
that you can use to restart your whole

1896
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,120
company. What's the one pack you're

1897
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:24,719
going to use to restart the company?

1898
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:28,158
Man, hopefully there's still a pack of

1899
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:30,880
black marquees or Harleys in there. You

1900
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:32,719
That's what That's what I need. I love

1901
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,079
it. I love it. We I'm going to I'm going

1902
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,719
to be a stickler and pushy. You got to

1903
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:40,238
pick one of the two. Which one?

1904
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:41,760
Ah, damn it, man. You know what? I'll go

1905
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:43,759
with the blockcase. It's got a little

1906
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,239
more variety in there. If I ask one that

1907
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,159
I'll get a little more population. How

1908
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:49,599
about that? I love that. See, now now

1909
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:52,319
you're now you're breaking the rules of

1910
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:55,199
the game. That's what we need.

1911
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:57,119
Um, okay. So, the final question I love

1912
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,719
to ask everybody. I've got a time

1913
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,960
machine for you. You can go anywhere,

1914
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,039
anytime, any place. You can get seeds or

1915
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,198
a clone. Where you going to go? What are

1916
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:06,399
you going to get?

1917
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:08,799
Damn. I'm going to go back and meet

1918
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,719
Neville, man. You know, see what his

1919
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,800
original hazes were like. you know, when

1920
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:15,600
the Cubans first started growing the A's

1921
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,360
and you know, I'll go back then just to

1922
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,400
just to see just to really be part of

1923
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,880
it. You know, that's a brilliant answer.

1924
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,960
It's it's so true to your roots that uh

1925
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,279
it makes perfect sense and I'm sure you

1926
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,000
would you'd find a bunch of cool stuff

1927
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:32,319
in there. No doubt. So, that's epic,

1928
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,319
man. I I think with that, it just about

1929
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:35,920
brings us to the end of it. Did you have
