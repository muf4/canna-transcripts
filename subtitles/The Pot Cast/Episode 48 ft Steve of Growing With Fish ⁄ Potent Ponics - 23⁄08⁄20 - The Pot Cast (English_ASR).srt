00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
of concentrates i've been doing mostly

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
live resin and live rosin um some

64
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,399
gorilla glue 4 lately just because it's

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
quite available here in

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,680
southern oklahoma and then also a little

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,760
tenth planet uh and then what else we

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
had a a

69
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,518
strawberry banana sunset or something

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
like that i think was the other one that

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,599
we've been smoking on lately but i'm

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,000
more of a concentrate person uh

73
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,159
i have some digestive tract stuff that

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
uh that concentrates really help a lot

75
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,318
with and um you know

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
as someone is using it daily for medical

77
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,318
reasons as well as enjoyment uh i tend

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
to get you know a lot better bang for my

79
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,639
buck spending money for concentrates

80
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,120
than i do for uh for flower

81
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,958
wow what a range of awesome awesome

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
different directions we can go in with

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,000
that one and i want to hear about all of

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,199
them i guess the first thing that comes

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
to mind is

86
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,399
oklahoma you don't hear a lot about the

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,640
scene out there what's your take

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,360
uh oklahoma's very interesting you have

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,518
a lot of

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
very opposite ends of the skills skill

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
spectrum i guess

92
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,878
you have people that have you know just

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,360
found out about cannabis that you know

94
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,039
maybe have a lot of acreage and and you

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
know a lot of money that they've been

96
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,919
saved away that are just you know

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,280
learning how to grow cannabis for the

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,439
first time maybe you don't even know

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,039
what a photo period is

100
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,120
and then you have all the way to you

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,519
know people coming in from cali that you

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
know have everything kind of uh on a

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,840
nice system that you know they just plug

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
and play and away they go so it's it's

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
kind of interesting you you have um the

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,158
price is stabilized at around twenty two

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,239
hundred dollars a pound for quite a long

108
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,318
time plus minus i mean you do have some

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,719
super cheap stuff coming in now and then

110
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,238
but um you know it really is kind of the

111
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,158
better quality stuff really is kind of

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,000
holding its price point uh more than

113
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,519
some of the other newer markets uh

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,120
having gone through this in colorado

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,799
california and a couple of other states

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
and a couple of other countries now as

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,439
well um

118
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
it really is kind of holding its price

119
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,560
point a little higher than some of the

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,560
other places i guess uh maybe just

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
because of of the demand going up

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
because of current global events but

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
um

124
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
uh it really is kind of interesting it's

125
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,519
also uh one of the lowest regulated

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
scenes so if you're interested in

127
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,839
developing products if you're interested

128
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,199
in um developing methods if you're

129
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,319
interested in developing stuff that

130
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
you're going to

131
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,719
um you know further refine it's a great

132
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,758
place to do that because you know 2 500

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,440
bucks

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,960
up until recently was all you needed to

135
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,839
get going and you could have a full

136
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,399
vertical a cultivation an extraction and

137
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,279
a retail space for less than 10 grand

138
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,120
so

139
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,599
you know to have all those licenses in a

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,478
straight row as a you know for for for

141
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,400
that cheap compared to the and anyone

142
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,399
that's tried for a license in california

143
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,159
or some of the other states they're

144
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,799
they're probably sitting here screaming

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
at

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
whatever they're listening to this on

147
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
them uh you know i know i spent a year

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,079
and a half trying to get licensed in

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,399
california and and working with the city

150
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,079
council and working with you know

151
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,679
everyone that we needed to to to

152
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,758
properly go about that and we're still

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,439
denied one and then to be able to come

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,960
out place like out here and just waltz

155
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,120
in and immediately work with someone

156
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,198
that's you know established out here and

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,720
get going is quite nice and and kind of

158
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,720
takes away a lot of the regulatory

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
hurdles it's kind of interesting to see

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
kind of a conservative mindset to the

161
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
cannabis industry and there hasn't

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,319
really been a lot of other states that

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,759
have taken that now one thing i said i

164
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,959
mean one downside would be that it did

165
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
take them a little bit longer than some

166
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,239
other states to get universal testing in

167
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,519
which i would have liked to have seen

168
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,879
done earlier but

169
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,279
aside from that uh you know they are

170
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,600
kind of slowly catching up incrementally

171
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,519
uh with some of the other states in a

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
more sane way i think than than a lot of

173
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,799
other places

174
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,478
yeah wow it sounds like there's a lot of

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
opportunities going on there and a

176
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,918
really nice detailed analysis of the

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,319
situation

178
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,198
would you think that the environment

179
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,439
itself is conducive to growing cannabis

180
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,319
and in the long term do you think it'll

181
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,000
um kind of rise as a premier sort of

182
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
state to be producing it in or do you

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,519
think that it's just the the friendly

184
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,799
legalities at the moment are what i was

185
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,318
allowing it to kind of flourish

186
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
i think it's a little bit of both i

187
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
think that um there's definitely

188
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
oh

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,519
a small i would say maybe 15 to 20

190
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,279
percent of the cultivars that are

191
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,079
traditionally going on say the west

192
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:39,198
coast that'll actually really excel here

193
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:41,198
and most of them having done two two uh

194
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
summers now growing stuff out here the

195
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,240
durban poison the malawi uh malawi and

196
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,919
swazi crosses and southern african

197
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
crosses and then some of the other

198
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,839
equatorial strains seem to be the ones

199
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,079
that really you know they're used to the

200
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,758
heat they're used to the higher humidity

201
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,000
they don't really care so much about the

202
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,160
heat uh and um they seem to really you

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
know pack on a few extra pounds or not a

204
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
future pounds but a few extra grams and

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,879
you know when you're talking fields or

206
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,478
rooms a few extra pounds uh when you're

207
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,560
doing greenhouses or outdoors

208
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,000
specifically um you know you have really

209
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
high temperatures you know it can get to

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,038
be 107 110 so

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,639
what is that in a celsius is that like

212
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,639
37 38 yeah yeah

213
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,800
i think you're back um yeah so

214
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,879
yeah so sorry i just came back from

215
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
zimbabwe so i'm still pretty fresh with

216
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,598
my my conversions um

217
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,598
but uh uh but you know so so you have to

218
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,759
have strains that'll tolerate that your

219
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,319
your pure indicas really do not like

220
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,680
that heat uh or traditional indicas we

221
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,598
all know that the classifications have

222
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,439
changed now but um your traditional

223
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,279
stuff that you know your purple heavy

224
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,439
stuff really doesn't do super well out

225
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
here on the outdoor stuff again that's

226
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,279
more adapted to cold climate

227
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
you know again i'm being very generally

228
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,799
broad obviously there's lots of

229
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
exceptions to that but um you don't see

230
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
a lot of that stuff and you see a lot

231
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,280
more fungal issues that people aren't

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,038
used to um

233
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,638
i've seen last year there was a huge

234
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,279
outbreak of septoria not only in

235
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
oklahoma but in tennessee and a lot of

236
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,559
other states that were doing hemp and i

237
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,639
really think a lot of it came from

238
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,478
the lack of biodiversity in the soil you

239
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,000
had a huge outbreak of septoria fusarium

240
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
and there was all in these fields that

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
were corn or soybean or wheat last year

242
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,560
that were just completely dead fields

243
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
there was no microbiological diversity

244
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,639
in the in the soil so how is this plant

245
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,680
going to have any type of microbe for

246
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,560
lack of better uh or for simplification

247
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,719
a microbial and not a vaccination or

248
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,399
exposure to fungals to know how to make

249
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,680
any type of resistance against them you

250
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
know if you have a totally dead field

251
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,239
it's not going to know what what

252
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,158
something is if it comes against it it's

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,519
like taking someone that was living in a

254
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,038
bubble and dropping them into times

255
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,639
square you know their immune system is

256
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,559
not going to know what to do

257
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,720
it's the same kind of way so i think

258
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,159
that um we were able to quickly at least

259
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
in the three farms that i worked with

260
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,759
last year on this with the septoria we

261
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
were able to quickly use a heavy

262
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,159
microbial inoculation of both um a

263
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,199
bacterius complex bactilis pamila

264
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,919
spectulos subtilis and a lactobacillus

265
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
making labs uh uh i prefer kefir based

266
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,639
labs in the traditional k nf labs but we

267
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,879
can get into that later um but

268
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,958
and then doing an imo treatment after a

269
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,919
week of that of rotating those other

270
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,239
treatments

271
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,679
and uh just as a water and a foliar and

272
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,320
we were able to treat almost all those

273
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,879
fields and we only threw out maybe 15

274
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
plants across those three forms so um

275
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,159
and again we caught it early if those

276
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
one you know once septoria gets beyond a

277
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,719
certain point those plants are boned

278
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,120
right so it's systemic so um but if you

279
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,639
can catch it early you can treat it and

280
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,799
we had very good luck by doing that but

281
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,039
again it was with microbial inoculants

282
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,838
not with a spray not with the fungal not

283
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,679
with sulfur with it with proper

284
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,000
probiotics it's the only way to treat

285
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,838
some of this stuff

286
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,159
wow i'm already looking forward to this

287
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
chat already but before we get into it i

288
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,439
definitely want to chat about zimbabwe

289
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,160
because that's just itching to be

290
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,680
discussed i did want to quickly clarify

291
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,000
or not clarify i just wanted to quickly

292
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,719
ask you mentioned that in oklahoma the

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,839
prices have stabilized at about 2200 a

294
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,079
pound overall what do you predict will

295
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
be the kind of long game

296
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,359
pricing for a pound do you think that is

297
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,559
the ballpark of what you want it to be

298
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,399
do you think that it's maybe still a

299
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,159
little high and with more production we

300
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,360
could get it down where do you think a

301
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,600
good price point is long term

302
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
i think well i guess the the first

303
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
answer i would have is i don't think

304
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
anybody knows the honest answer to that

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
question

306
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,360
but i will tell you what i think is that

307
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
i think that you're going to have craft

308
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,159
growers that are going to have and that

309
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,239
are going to stamp out a brand for

310
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,679
themselves that for high quality and

311
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
they're going to hold their higher price

312
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,278
you see people like dragonfly earth

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
medicine and the wonderful group of

314
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,559
people in the den purity network that

315
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,799
they've built up and all those wonderful

316
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,879
farmers that work so hard to grow you

317
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,399
know clean medicine and they're able to

318
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,559
hold their brand and hold their prices

319
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,879
up i think you know following similar

320
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,639
type things you have um you know other

321
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,039
similar type groups out there that have

322
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,159
these uh different um standards for

323
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,360
their product and i think that's going

324
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,199
to be a way for people to really

325
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
separate themselves from the pack and

326
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,879
and allow craft growers to really excel

327
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,959
when you have you know a lot of these

328
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,958
bigger producers and especially later on

329
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,000
when you have other countries when you

330
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,719
have you know nations like colombia and

331
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,799
zimbabwe and places that can grow for

332
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,560
you know much cheaper prices than than

333
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,399
the united states has you know could

334
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,399
ever grow for i think you're still going

335
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,120
to have a a absolutely be able to

336
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,799
compete you know right right there at a

337
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
really great price point and you know

338
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,000
probably around that fifteen hundred two

339
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
thousand dollar maybe even higher price

340
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
point uh per pound for that really craft

341
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,399
cannabis because it's worth it and and

342
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
the inputs are there and if you don't

343
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,200
you know you're not gonna get that

344
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,319
a cheap pound that that's hand trimmed

345
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
right like it's there's just certain

346
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
things that just has a cost to it for

347
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,759
the quality and and the same way with

348
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,239
with um

349
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,919
uh you know fine wine or or any fine

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
food you know you pay for that higher

351
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,479
quality and i really think that that's

352
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,919
going to be you're going to have your

353
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,759
craft growers that really separate

354
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,439
themselves pretty quickly and then

355
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,879
you're going to have the kind of just

356
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,639
you know general production for

357
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,879
everything else you know

358
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,639
yeah certainly and i would love to get a

359
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,559
little more into the nit gritty of that

360
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,120
because i've had a lot of people message

361
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,039
me over the past year or so and they

362
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
kind of reference this idea you talk

363
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,559
about and they're like i would love to

364
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
do that i'm wondering what are some ways

365
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,599
to do it and the thing i would always

366
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,120
reply with is

367
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,519
i always think that if you're trying to

368
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,799
set yourself apart one easy way to do it

369
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
is to

370
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,319
get like a strain and find your own

371
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
unique keeper of it ideally something

372
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,079
that's not already in circulation maybe

373
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,439
you even breed it yourself which that's

374
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,439
you know a bit of a different discussion

375
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
but what are some of the ways you think

376
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
people can build a brand because i

377
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,039
thought like unique strain maybe you

378
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,039
know even unique cultivation style

379
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,958
aquaponics what do you think how can

380
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,039
people help to establish themselves as a

381
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,559
unique producer

382
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,399
well i would say definitely look at

383
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,838
unique products if you have the ability

384
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,000
or if you have a recipe for something

385
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,360
that grandma made that was super awesome

386
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,639
make an infused version if it's

387
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
something that's allowed in your state

388
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
you know and these types of things where

389
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,519
you already have something unique you

390
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,359
just didn't think of using it in the

391
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,519
cannabis realm or some other stuff so

392
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,039
but in particular one one way that i

393
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,200
work with a lot of companies is with

394
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,799
aquaponics and in fact there's a group

395
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,800
right now i'm working with on a licensed

396
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,639
application in chicago where we're going

397
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,359
to be donating 100 of our fish to the

398
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,200
local community so our cannabis facility

399
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
is providing free food for the local

400
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,480
community on top of all the medicine

401
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,639
we're providing for our for the patients

402
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
within the community so we're able to

403
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,159
feed people we also will set up

404
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,679
with a lot of these aquaponics systems

405
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,919
we'll set up wicking beds on the outside

406
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,120
because we do have to um you know we can

407
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,879
discharge a little bit from our

408
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
filtration system if we're brewing and

409
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,600
we make extra and we need some place to

410
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
put it without having to pay for

411
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,040
disposal in places like california we

412
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
can set up wicking beds and just have a

413
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,879
public garden out front and have and

414
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,439
grow vegetables for our community again

415
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,879
being more than just a cannabis

416
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
a company but being a pillar of the

417
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,078
community that's giving back to the

418
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,719
community and you know using the whole

419
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,479
uh converting greed into good and

420
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,639
and and really bringing the whole

421
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,639
message and the energy of cannabis i

422
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,680
mean think about everyone listening to

423
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,278
this show how many times has funds that

424
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,359
started with cannabis

425
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,480
ended up creating and helping someone

426
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,680
that you knew

427
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,639
in in a hard spot or with car parts or

428
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,078
with rent or with whatever all of us did

429
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
at some point all anyone that's in the

430
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,759
cannabis industry started slinging

431
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,278
eights or slinging grams and that's why

432
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,958
we're in this point there's very few

433
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,439
people that didn't get into it that way

434
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,679
or if they did they got into it late

435
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,120
but if you got into it pre-legalization

436
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,799
that's what you did all of us got

437
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
started that way right that's and then

438
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,240
we got into growing and then we got into

439
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
you know more and more and more so

440
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,560
so

441
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,399
this is really a way where we can give

442
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,599
back to our community and do it as a

443
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,278
byproduct you know those fish are

444
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,959
providing fertilizer for us and we're

445
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,039
able to just give them back to the

446
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,198
community as a way to to feed people and

447
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,639
again that that helps us with our story

448
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,120
helps us with our brand helps us with

449
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,720
our whole you know eco or eco not only

450
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,278
equal responsible but community

451
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,000
responsible with our company

452
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,439
yeah what a powerful message because i i

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,679
even had a question about that so we

454
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,839
might even jump to it but whenever i

455
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,719
discussed aquaponics with i've got a

456
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,959
friend

457
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
let me let me clarify you you know the

458
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,159
guy i'm trying to think of the real big

459
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,199
aquaponics guy in queensland in

460
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,519
australia

461
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,919
mr murray holland murray so i got a good

462
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,078
friend who has trained under him so he's

463
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,639
quite knowledgeable and um you know

464
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,958
firsthand knowledge from murray and he

465
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,360
said he's interested in cannabis um and

466
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,479
he said that he always kind of struggled

467
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
to see

468
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,839
a big cultivation facility doing

469
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,679
aquaponics purely for the sense that he

470
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
was like it just seems weird to have a

471
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,399
store that sells fish and cannabis

472
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
because he's like that would be the end

473
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,600
goal like you've got fish and cannabis

474
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,519
you need to sell them both

475
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
i guess you've just provided a really

476
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,399
nice alternative pathway to use those

477
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
fish do you think that idea though that

478
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,919
they raised is a legitimate sort of

479
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,879
concern about like you've just got

480
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,000
you're ending up with these two

481
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,600
different products or do you think we

482
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
just need to look deeper like what you

483
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,278
mentioned as to how we can utilize the

484
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
resources

485
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,759
so so there's kind of two pieces to that

486
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,959
so first off one of the other things

487
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
that we've i've talked about with

488
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,000
california producers is doing a cannabis

489
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,600
infused smoke fish so taking taking the

490
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
fish doing fillets and then doing a

491
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,079
cannabis glaze a flavored glaze and then

492
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,639
smoking it and then doing it selling

493
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,039
that as a product so you could actually

494
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,879
have a very good um you know a

495
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,559
value-added item with the cannabis and

496
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,320
have the cannabis be the value added

497
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,679
rather than you know so depending on how

498
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,600
you want to go with your business model

499
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,758
you could also raise tropical fish and

500
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,480
flip those as well for profit and that

501
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,480
and often can be much more profitable

502
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
than raising food fit and actually in

503
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,240
almost all cases is more profitable than

504
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,519
raising food fish so if you're strictly

505
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,440
focused on profits as a cannabis company

506
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
you know avoiding food fish altogether

507
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
now the other component and this is only

508
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,959
an issue in the united states

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,198
is you cannot get a meat processing

510
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,838
license which you need to have to kill

511
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,719
the fish and clean the fish

512
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
and

513
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,199
a cannabis license because

514
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,278
cannabis is still federally regulated as

515
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,639
a schedule 1 drug and the meat

516
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,919
processing

517
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,880
facilities are all uh inspected by

518
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,880
federal inspectors from the usda they

519
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
can't step foot into a facility that has

520
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,400
schedule one drugs on the property and

521
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,480
then

522
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
they're just conflicting right so so you

523
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,480
have this issue where i have to license

524
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,599
a third-party processor that's already

525
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,199
licensed

526
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,599
where they come pick up the fish or i

527
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,120
deliver the fish either live or or

528
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,639
frozen uh whole frozen on ice and then

529
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,119
have them clean them you know

530
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,120
third-party and to legally resell them

531
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,479
so that that is a regulatory issue that

532
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,239
is currently an issue in the united

533
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
states because because of the current

534
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,599
federal law that people it's kind of a

535
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,360
weird

536
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,599
thing that i'm sure no politician

537
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,240
thought about as a weird but you know

538
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,879
it's an off weird thing but it is a

539
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
legal hurdle uh for aquaponic cannabis

540
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
facilities currently in the united

541
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,880
states now in kentucky

542
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,960
i actually helped

543
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
the guys over at um

544
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
one of the universities uh i don't know

545
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,200
if they got the thing but i helped write

546
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
a grant for um i believe it was langston

547
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,519
university if memory recalls last year

548
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,599
but anyways help them write a a grant

549
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,798
for a truck a processing truck so that

550
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,319
they'd be able to go around to the

551
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,558
different aquaponic cannabis companies

552
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,918
in oklahoma because oklahoma currently

553
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,440
has the most number of aquaponic

554
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,038
cannabis licenses of any state in the

555
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,360
united states right now so

556
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,359
in terms of number of businesses so

557
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,719
um uh there there's quite a few

558
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,199
different companies that have adapted a

559
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,880
coup both uh existing facilities and

560
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
then you know new built from scratch

561
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,440
facilities uh in the tulsa and oklahoma

562
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,960
area as well as oklahoma city area as

563
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,880
well as further south where i am um

564
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,279
that are all uh all doing cannabis now

565
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
and um yeah

566
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,359
kind of lost my train of thought there

567
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,280
no that's just a trail of knowledge we

568
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,918
need to leave some cookie crumbs

569
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,079
um so i guess the question it raises for

570
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,480
me is you just paint such a beautiful

571
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,720
picture with this do you anticipate that

572
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,960
as the years go by we're going to see an

573
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,079
increase in aquaponic cultivation or do

574
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,038
you think that it's just one of those

575
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,319
things where you know you're always

576
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,000
going to have the people who want to do

577
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,000
the rock wool and you're just never

578
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,359
going to change their mind

579
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,038
oh no i think you're always going to

580
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,479
have people that have their set system

581
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,759
that works for them and hey if someone

582
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,759
has a system it works for them and

583
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,558
they're crushing it why change it like i

584
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,160
don't

585
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,599
i'm not going to you know if you have if

586
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
you just kill it with soil or you kill

587
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,558
it with hydra or you kill it with cocoa

588
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,558
like rock it man

589
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,240
but i do think that and having done lots

590
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,759
of side-by-sides now and then consulted

591
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,160
for lots of companies that paid me to do

592
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,480
side by sides um we can crush the i'm

593
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,798
sorry about the pupper i have a younger

594
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,798
pupper that uh all poppers are welcome a

595
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,440
little bit younger we can edit that out

596
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,119
so um so with aquaponics we've managed

597
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,480
to get significantly higher terpenes

598
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,798
than all of our our hydro or soil uh

599
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,038
controls across the board we've had not

600
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:53,440
a single test out of over 120 ever come

601
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,000
back lower on the terpenes compared to

602
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,759
uh dual root zone aquaponic control um

603
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,880
even non-dual roots and aquaponic

604
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,200
controls

605
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,400
will about 75 percent of the time will

606
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,759
be almost all but the best living soils

607
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
and that's just through terpene and

608
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,240
cannabinoid testing that we've done now

609
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,359
what we attribute it to is one of two

610
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,200
things uh either there's an endophyte

611
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,879
you know certain endophytes that are

612
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,159
colonizing the plant from the aquatic

613
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
microbiome

614
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,039
or the stimulation of having both the

615
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,519
terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes or a

616
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,759
combination thereof of what i just said

617
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,519
and this um of having those two

618
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,798
microbiomes the terrestrial microbiome

619
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,480
in the soil area and the upper half of

620
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:33,679
the root zone and the aquatic layer in

621
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,839
the lower half of the root zone with

622
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,880
dual root zone pots allows you to have

623
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,000
you know such an increase in

624
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,600
biodiversity that um uh you know you get

625
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,038
that increase in stimulation of the

626
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,959
plant's immune system and what does a

627
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,038
plant do when it needs to defend itself

628
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,880
and gets the planet's immune system

629
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,798
stimulated increases terpenes and

630
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,000
depending on what the stimuli it is so

631
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,679
by increasing the number of

632
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,519
non-pathogenic microbes to the root

633
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,320
system you can basically give it more

634
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,079
vaccinations for you know a simplified

635
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,519
way of thinking about it and increase

636
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,678
the total terpene production by giving

637
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,119
an exposure to more microbes in a way

638
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
that's not going to screw with it and a

639
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,239
negative input so that's that really

640
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,600
allows us to give us a huge advantage

641
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,200
the other big advantages that we have is

642
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,798
we use around 18 percent uh with my

643
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
methodology

644
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,119
of water compared to many other uh soil

645
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,038
grown methods you know a drain to waste

646
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,479
or most of your soil outdoor

647
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,640
and that's just gallons per day per

648
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,240
plant uh under a four month grow three

649
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
to three and a half to four month growth

650
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,079
cycle so assuming you have a minor veg

651
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,839
and then a quick flip so um uh you know

652
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,279
uh we've had really really great luck

653
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,439
with that and then also increased

654
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,038
acceleration and growth so in veg

655
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,840
we have no problem hitting the two to

656
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,319
four inch a day mark all day long with

657
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,519
aquaponics it's not even we don't even

658
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,839
have to try

659
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,918
it's just incredible how fast and anyone

660
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,678
can go onto my youtube and and see for

661
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,679
themselves time-stamped videos of

662
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,120
different farms if multiple farms on

663
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,360
there that you can see you know

664
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,199
incredible acceleration of growth

665
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,879
um but uh the

666
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
the farm i was just working with here in

667
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
in southern oklahoma we were averaging

668
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,519
two to four inches of growth per day on

669
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,359
all of our mother plants in the

670
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,839
greenhouse it was you know

671
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,678
it's kind of goofy it's it's fun to or

672
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,038
it's not even it's annoying to go back

673
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,038
to soil because you're like this is like

674
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,960
watching paint dry you know it's just so

675
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,679
slow and then we were able to shave on

676
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,038
flour anywhere from 5 to 14 days off the

677
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,798
flowering cycle

678
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,240
by increasing the speed of that as well

679
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,240
um

680
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,599
just in terms of speed of growth again

681
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,440
we attribute that to increased gas

682
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,678
exchange in the root system it really

683
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,279
does make a big difference

684
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
wow yeah there's so many things we've

685
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,240
got to talk about there i just want to

686
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,158
quickly jump back because i'm a really

687
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,919
big fan of when you were talking about

688
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,559
the plant's immune system and the

689
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,240
increased terpenes to assist with that

690
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,918
what's your thoughts around the use of

691
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,599
chitin-based products as i mean to do

692
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,720
that and are you still able to utilize

693
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,719
those in aquaponics

694
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,720
oh yeah in fact you asked a really

695
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,199
awesome question so um i actually just

696
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,759
did a trial of three different

697
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,558
chitinase-based treatments for insect

698
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,240
control when i was over in zimbabwe so

699
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,240
we did um a liquid so

700
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,599
are you familiar with imo or indigenous

701
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
microorganisms from korean natural

702
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,918
farming okay so so if you're familiar

703
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,798
with that what we do is um we did one

704
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,679
method where we took that and did a 30

705
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,798
insect frass and then 60

706
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,679
or 70

707
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,440
rice

708
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,519
and then mix that together cooked it and

709
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,919
then did that as an imo treatment for

710
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,200
collecting the um

711
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,840
microbes and then we were able to

712
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
collect uh a chitinase feeding you know

713
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,359
uh microbes that would feed on the

714
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
exoskeletons or the plants or i'm sorry

715
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,038
the insects not the plants um to defend

716
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,319
the plants from mainly the biggest issue

717
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,400
we're dealing with is these large

718
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,319
african grasshoppers um

719
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,480
they're i don't maybe they were locusts

720
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,678
but they were huge and they were they

721
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,278
were the biggest problem we had because

722
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,038
they chew the bark off the plants and

723
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,558
they that was the biggest issue is

724
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,599
they'd chew the cambrian layer off the

725
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,278
plants so um

726
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,519
uh that was the biggest problem we had

727
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,679
so the the uh

728
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,200
the large grasshoppers would chew the

729
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,640
cambrian layer off the plants and then

730
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,000
the plants would you know basically the

731
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,480
top anything above that would start to

732
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
die off so we started spraying with that

733
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
and that was by far the best treatment

734
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,759
that we had for any of the things that

735
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,360
we had and we were able to kill the

736
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,519
grasshoppers it took a couple days to

737
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,879
work but once we were spraying the

738
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,359
plants and sprayed the ground and we

739
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,880
were doing that once a week um it worked

740
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,798
incredibly well and we just made a

741
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
liquid imo from from that the same way

742
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,278
that you would make liquid imo from an

743
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,439
imo uh one and you get imo2 and then we

744
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,759
also tried

745
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,840
where we did the normal imo collection

746
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,759
and then introduced insect frass at the

747
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,319
point of im03

748
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,720
rather than at the point of im01

749
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,639
and we found that while it did work it

750
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,519
did not work anywhere near as well it

751
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,520
did

752
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,359
the the efficacy wasn't anywhere near as

753
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,240
well and then the other one we did is we

754
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:57,278
did it with im04 and again that was very

755
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,278
similar to im03 while it was it did work

756
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,119
it didn't work as well as doing it at

757
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,759
the im01 stage

758
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,199
so um with that and then again now you

759
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,440
have a bunch of free chitinas that's

760
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,278
available for the plants to absorb in

761
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,640
you know via the roots or any other way

762
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,640
that it wants to because you're just

763
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,400
melting insects in your fields and that

764
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,159
was one of the best general insect

765
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,919
sprays we were able to use that as our

766
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,480
one of our mainstays for our insect

767
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,480
control over in zimbabwe

768
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,798
yeah wow i mean you know what i think

769
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,200
it's probably about time we jump into it

770
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,278
so for anyone who hasn't quite picked up

771
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,519
on it you did a stint in africa just

772
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,440
fairly recently would you be able to

773
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,519
give us a rundown on i guess how the

774
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,679
opportunity just at least initially

775
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,599
presented itself

776
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,600
sure so i've been working with a couple

777
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,158
of different groups out of canada and

778
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,439
for off and on for a couple of years and

779
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,760
one of the groups i'd worked with

780
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,038
previously had someone that was working

781
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,558
with a different group over in europe

782
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,720
and africa and

783
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,399
started talking to them and

784
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
they kind of needed someone that knew

785
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,360
the ropes on the cannabis side of things

786
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
to go over there and kind of train

787
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,479
people up so

788
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
uh ended up getting together with them

789
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
took a little bit longer to get the

790
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,558
funding together mostly because of the

791
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,719
fda rules that came in place uh back in

792
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,720
october was october 27th when the sky

793
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,038
fell so um

794
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,798
or whatever it was so that happened and

795
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,798
then anyways ended up over in africa and

796
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,200
in december so um so i was over in

797
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,400
zimbabwe or ended up over in zimbabwe

798
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
and then

799
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
we're getting everything going we had

800
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,519
750 acres

801
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,278
that we were prepping we had about 15

802
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,240
acres that we had planted and ready to

803
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,480
go

804
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,038
and then the virus hit

805
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,679
and everything stopped

806
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,359
and then i had about 72 hours to get out

807
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,880
of the country if i was gonna get out

808
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,839
wow

809
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,080
so uh yeah so that was uh

810
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,720
that was my stint so hopefully when this

811
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,918
all settles down next year

812
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,839
probably

813
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,759
the i'll think you know we'll we'll

814
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,759
figure it out but right now they

815
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,158
harvested off what was there and

816
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,240
everything's on pause because

817
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,919
i it's it's it's psychotic to try and

818
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,759
move any products around the world right

819
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,880
now and trying to move cannabis is even

820
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,440
harder

821
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,520
so it's just kind of a process it all

822
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,640
and sit on it for now because

823
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,000
financially it's the only thing that

824
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,038
makes sense on the scale that we're

825
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,599
doing it

826
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,599
yeah i totally get that and i mean we're

827
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,839
gonna probably dig around this topic for

828
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,798
a little while but just to go back for a

829
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,398
minute

830
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,558
you mentioned that things are on pause

831
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,879
at the moment i actually know a guy

832
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,639
who's involved in um general hydroponic

833
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,480
stuff and many years ago he was

834
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,080
contracted to go to zimbabwe i think

835
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,038
just to grow some lettuces and things

836
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,038
like that

837
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,440
and he set the operation up it sounds

838
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,038
like kind of a similar situation to you

839
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,399
he felt confident he'd trained them up

840
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,558
well enough and then he left and it was

841
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,319
all going well for probably six twelve

842
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,798
months and then after a while it just

843
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,639
started going really bad and

844
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,079
he was getting emails about it and he's

845
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,278
just like i don't know what's going on

846
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,199
but apparently it's starting to go

847
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,599
really bad and what it ended up

848
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,000
happening was that the locals were just

849
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,678
so kind of unfamiliar with um he was

850
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,919
using salt based nutrients in a pure

851
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,919
hydroponic setup but basically what had

852
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,399
happened was they were using like a part

853
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,880
a and b nutrient and

854
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,639
one of the a or the b had run out and

855
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,799
they just didn't understand how it

856
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,799
worked and so they were like oh we just

857
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,918
used the a in replacement if we don't

858
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,679
have any b

859
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,520
and it just kind of highlighted that

860
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,278
like it was such a foreign style of

861
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,720
growing that they just they didn't fully

862
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,640
understand it

863
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
do you feel like that might be the case

864
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,440
now that if you

865
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,038
like that might be why things are on

866
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,880
pause because there is still a bit of a

867
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,558
learning gap for them to fully get

868
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,559
autonomous with it

869
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,960
no no the reason why everything is on

870
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,359
pause is because they're uh the value of

871
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,000
their dollar is uh

872
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,639
collapsed because of the virus but uh

873
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
so that that's honestly but um the the

874
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,480
the other reason but as far as

875
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,558
agricultural stuff um they are

876
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,000
incredibly learned with agricultural

877
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,440
practices especially organic

878
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,079
agricultural practices they they are

879
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,759
very good about uh uh doing a lot of of

880
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,119
stuff that we would consider similar to

881
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,798
maybe natural farming uh but

882
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,519
they also have a huge presence of

883
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,599
syngenta uh if you go into um or

884
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,960
monsanto as you guys may also know them

885
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,119
as um

886
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,120
uh for those you know they that's their

887
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,199
other name but and if you go into harare

888
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:17,278
or any of the bigger areas uh kodoma or

889
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,440
vic falls or anywhere you're gonna see

890
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,919
syngenta syngenta syngenta and they sell

891
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,759
all they probably sell 85 to 90 of the

892
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,120
seed in the whole country

893
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,798
which sucks

894
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,479
but that's probably the biggest issue is

895
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,319
that it's hard to find it's hard for

896
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,640
farmers to find a seed now the moment

897
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,359
you get away from any of the big cities

898
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,880
it's all organic as can be they they

899
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,398
they don't they've never seen a

900
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,600
pesticide they don't know what a

901
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,359
pesticide is like it's fine right so

902
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,879
it's just about or they do but it's

903
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,558
organ you know they're making ferments

904
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,960
and stuff right it's not like

905
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,038
or artis or they're there's burning

906
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
something you know a

907
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,558
smelly herb that to have the smoke waft

908
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,278
through to get them upper you know they

909
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,480
have some other method it's not

910
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:59,440
one thing i would say and it's funny

911
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,960
because i had this conversation with

912
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,440
somebody else

913
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,038
zimbab actually this week um just

914
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,640
because of the current events in the

915
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,679
united states is that i said you know if

916
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,759
something were to happen with the

917
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,360
government in zimbabwe everyone can just

918
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,440
kind of farm like everyone knows how to

919
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,199
farm everyone knows how to self-sustain

920
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
themselves from a survival standpoint

921
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,798
whereas in the united states people

922
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,240
don't you know large percent united

923
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:21,119
states doesn't even know how to plan to

924
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,759
seed

925
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,038
and grow a bean or tomato you know it's

926
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,679
just not something that people are

927
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,200
familiar with or been exposed to so

928
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,200
whereas you know a lot of these other

929
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,200
parts of the world yeah maybe they don't

930
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,798
have all the things that we have but you

931
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,880
know what everyone there can feed

932
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,720
themselves if they have to or you know

933
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
they they they all have a garden every

934
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,519
single person has a garden in their on

935
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
their property they're they're grown

936
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,240
food you know and it's culturally you

937
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,840
know

938
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,519
a lot different where they're they are

939
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,439
more so sustaining in terms of food

940
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,119
production and you know if i was going

941
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,159
to get stranded and something like that

942
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,519
you're going to have more food in a

943
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,720
place like that even though it sounds

944
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,200
kind of crazy

945
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,640
so i i think that probably a question a

946
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,200
lot of a lot of our listeners are

947
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,799
wondering is whereabouts in zimbabwe

948
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,319
were you based geographically and what

949
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,158
type of strains did you found work

950
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,599
really well there

951
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,120
sure so we were growing a couple of

952
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,719
different cbd cultivars in kodoma um i

953
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,639
actually don't have the strain list in

954
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
front of me i have it i posted it up on

955
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,840
my instagram i have the exact strains

956
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,518
that we were growing there we were

957
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,839
actually the first company to legally

958
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,759
import them into zimbabwe um actually

959
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,639
funny story on that which i'm sure the

960
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,079
uh

961
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,200
the guys at the airport don't want me to

962
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,000
tell you but i'll tell you anyway

963
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,960
because it's funny um

964
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,558
so we we get these seeds in right and

965
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,079
it's like a big giant pack of seeds and

966
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,839
like you can smell it right because

967
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,759
they're fresh seeds right so they they

968
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,278
smell like terpenes like you it smells

969
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,919
like a fat old bag of wheat and they

970
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,679
open it up and the cops are like whoa

971
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,038
and then they're like can you do this

972
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
and then they want to see paperwork and

973
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,240
then they held it for a couple of extra

974
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,558
days and and checked with the ministry

975
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,558
of health and all this other other crap

976
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,558
so so we finally get it clear and then

977
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,720
they come out and then so the the they

978
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,079
have like the like the narc cops or like

979
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,759
the drug cops there and they're laughing

980
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,759
about and they're like cool well let's

981
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,240
test the dogs right so they go and they

982
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,079
grab the dogs and they bring they put

983
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,079
three packages out and ours is one of

984
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,398
them and the dogs completely ignore it

985
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,000
and they get real mad and we're just

986
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,839
sitting there laughing and then we

987
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
realize like they're getting really

988
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,038
they're they're getting more mad so we

989
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,558
just kind of like can we get the paper

990
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,839
can we get paperwork and get out of here

991
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,038
now like

992
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,000
it's time to go

993
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,798
like let's not push the limits

994
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,839
yeah

995
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,918
lovely so i mean in terms of zimbabwe

996
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,359
were you more up north more down south

997
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,640
or do you feel like the whole area is

998
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,879
just pristine it doesn't matter where

999
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,038
you are

1000
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,559
sure so i was like i spent so i did go

1001
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,038
out and visit in yonga which is in the

1002
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,759
far east over by mozambique um but then

1003
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:50,158
i also um where my the farms where i was

1004
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,079
working in was one is in morindera

1005
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,919
and the other one was in um north of

1006
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,439
kodoma i'm not going to give the exact

1007
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,960
location just for security reasons but

1008
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,759
north of kodoma

1009
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,919
so

1010
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,038
um was probably the biggest large city

1011
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,159
nearby

1012
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,079
do you feel like zimbabwe in particular

1013
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,679
has a really nice sort of environment

1014
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,918
that's conducive to growing or do you

1015
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,919
think that the end game is that like

1016
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,759
most african countries will just be set

1017
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,080
to go hard

1018
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,679
no i think zimbabwe particularly has a

1019
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,359
wonderful climate temperature wise and

1020
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,240
humidity wise and everything else and

1021
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,879
the soil is very conducive for it so

1022
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,960
fantastic and i mean when you're there

1023
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,600
did you try to grow anything in the soil

1024
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,200
or was it all aquaponic so

1025
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,558
one one of the two farms i worked with

1026
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,919
was aquaponics and the other one was

1027
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,918
soil so

1028
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,240
okay cool and what would be your

1029
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,080
recommendations for someone looking to

1030
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,798
work with some soil they've got that's

1031
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,759
never been like tended to so to speak

1032
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,158
and they're going to have to maybe put

1033
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,919
some inputs in what are your go-to

1034
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,360
inputs that you might put into the soil

1035
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,640
to help give it some nutrients

1036
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,558
so um

1037
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,399
oh man it's really going to depend on

1038
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,319
what that soil is so if there's a lot of

1039
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,359
not a lot of organics in it i would say

1040
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,519
you know making sure you can add a

1041
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,719
compost or some you know leaf mulch or

1042
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,399
something like that

1043
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,919
um or you know it's really just going to

1044
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,759
depend on it you know my first thing

1045
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,599
would be get a soil test and find out

1046
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,280
what's going on in there and you know

1047
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,639
get some under a microscope slide so

1048
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,599
that you can see what the heck is going

1049
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,838
on

1050
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,280
sure i guess maybe one of the more

1051
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,799
commonly heard claims i hear is that uh

1052
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,079
basically

1053
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,280
uh what is it biochar and cover crop i

1054
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,200
always hear those two things because

1055
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,960
it's like it makes sense in theory right

1056
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,039
do you feel like that actually works in

1057
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,280
practicality

1058
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,838
so

1059
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,159
i've done a lot of testing with biochar

1060
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,519
um i'm gonna be an outlier and tell you

1061
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,679
i think it's in

1062
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,280
75 to 90 percent of people's farms

1063
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,960
complete snake oil

1064
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,879
i don't think it'll do anything if

1065
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,679
you're doing good composting good

1066
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,918
microbial inoculation your knf inputs

1067
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,320
you are going to notice absolutely zero

1068
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,319
difference in yields terpene content or

1069
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,400
cannabinoid content and i say this

1070
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,240
because there's a farm in gilchrest

1071
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,680
colorado that i've worked with that we

1072
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:09,519
put together in 2013 or 2000 2013 and um

1073
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,519
i couldn't remember it was 13 or 14. um

1074
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:15,039
and so they have six acres of hemp there

1075
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,440
okay now there's half acre of uh zero

1076
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,838
control half acre of one percent biochar

1077
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,400
half acre of control half acre of three

1078
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:24,400
percent biochar half figure control half

1079
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,680
acre of five percent biochar and a full

1080
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,039
acre control that we were doing some

1081
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,559
other testing on

1082
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,358
um

1083
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,199
in

1084
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,880
all those years we've had no difference

1085
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,439
in yield the only difference we've

1086
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,000
noticed is the size of the cover crop

1087
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,000
uh is larger on where the higher amount

1088
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,838
of biochar is so you could say that

1089
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,480
there's more microbial biodiversity in

1090
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,719
the surface of the soil strictly

1091
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,440
speaking for cbd hemp

1092
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,679
it has made no visible financial yield

1093
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,280
growing at a half acre scale

1094
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,199
over all those years

1095
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,560
so and i can say that based on you know

1096
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,519
numerics and you know financials so

1097
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,759
based on that then yes i i think it's

1098
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,239
not no if you have a super compact clay

1099
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,240
or you have just really terrible soil or

1100
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,759
no organics at all yeah it's going to do

1101
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,358
wonders for your soil but if you're

1102
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,839
dosing with all your normal you know

1103
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,920
probiotics and your knf inputs and

1104
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,920
everything else it's not you're gonna

1105
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,119
you're already adding all the microbials

1106
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,720
and a lot of the other stuff that you

1107
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,160
have you don't need an extra space for

1108
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,239
it to survive

1109
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,000
so you're not really adding us something

1110
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,159
that's not already being colonized

1111
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,280
happily you're you're inoculating on top

1112
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,319
of

1113
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,519
you're just adding a space for the

1114
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,200
inoculant but if you're already adding

1115
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,400
the inoculant it's kind of a redundant

1116
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,358
sure

1117
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,400
and just as a sort of a random curiosity

1118
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,639
for myself

1119
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,880
do you feel like the microbial diversity

1120
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,719
there is plentiful enough that you don't

1121
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,559
need to supplement with any sort of

1122
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,319
microbial product that would might be

1123
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,358
like more external or even something

1124
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,800
like say a mycorrhizae

1125
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,598
uh it really depends on what you're

1126
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,839
doing now i prefer to still do some some

1127
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,760
external inoculants um i've found in

1128
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,759
aquaponics just in terms of products

1129
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,359
mammoth p is probably been one of the

1130
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
biggest in terms of

1131
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:11,119
uh amount of testable

1132
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,320
in ppms available of a nutrient from any

1133
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,920
microbial i've ever tested with

1134
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,119
aquaponics it is the one that has

1135
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,838
increased

1136
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,838
any nutrient by the largest amount by by

1137
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,078
not adding any additional salt right so

1138
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,719
by not adding any physical phosphorus

1139
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,880
just by adding the micro microbe it is

1140
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,439
increased phosphorus on average around

1141
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,119
30 to 35 percent in on aquaponic systems

1142
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,639
so if you can get that established and

1143
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,480
get those microbes in your system it's a

1144
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,679
great inoculant i often recommend that

1145
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,240
and recharge from from real growers over

1146
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,519
at uh the guys that do do grows we often

1147
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,358
recommend both of those for people

1148
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,440
inoculating their new aquaponics systems

1149
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,880
to get those bacteria species as

1150
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,320
nitrifying bacteria those those initial

1151
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,280
mycorrhizal protectants you know

1152
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,359
something that's going to get in there

1153
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,960
and outcompete pythium and root rot and

1154
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,319
a lot of the other issues you have with

1155
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,720
with aquatic-based systems be it

1156
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,880
aquaponics or hydroponics

1157
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,000
yeah wow what a powerful testament to

1158
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
the product

1159
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
so

1160
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,879
if we get into the nit gritty of the

1161
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,639
aquaponics itself what sort of things

1162
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,640
are you feeding the fish and

1163
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,279
supplementing the system with and do you

1164
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,118
still have to use any because i i think

1165
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,200
i remember i spoke with you maybe a

1166
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,440
while ago and you mentioned that

1167
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,199
like iron can sometimes be hard to find

1168
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,559
you might need to supplement with it

1169
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,838
have you found workarounds for those

1170
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,119
things or it's still like you know

1171
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,960
there's certain principles that still

1172
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,039
apply

1173
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,440
so um regardless of what's doing with

1174
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,838
aquaponics you know fish waste is not

1175
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,440
microbially or i'm not not microbial

1176
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,639
chemically designed

1177
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,358
to grow plants right like that was never

1178
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,719
part of the plan with that so um fish

1179
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,319
waste does not provide everything it

1180
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,480
will provide the vast majority so we can

1181
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,039
get anywhere depending on cultivar 80 to

1182
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,800
90 percent of the nutrients that we need

1183
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,559
for feeding uh

1184
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
you know for almost any cannabis

1185
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,320
cultivar uh is going to fall into that

1186
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,400
range from the base nutrient now we will

1187
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,519
need to supplement potassium

1188
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,760
calcium

1189
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,440
uh iron and some micronutrients

1190
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,960
depending on the cultivar now certain

1191
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,519
cultivars will really plow through

1192
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,199
molybdenum and zinc and a couple of your

1193
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,880
micronutrients other ones don't it seems

1194
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,480
to be more predominantly on the ones

1195
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,559
that are more colorful your purples and

1196
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
your oranges and they seem to especially

1197
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,358
molybdenum they plow through it because

1198
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,479
they need it for the anthocyanin

1199
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:19,279
production

1200
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,719
so

1201
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,320
and and anyone that doesn't know if

1202
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,239
you're having problems with your purples

1203
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,599
not being purple add some molybdenum

1204
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,439
sodium molybdenate at uh like a 0.1 part

1205
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,039
per million dosage it'll it'll

1206
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,960
immediately turn your plants purple if

1207
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,400
they have the genetics for it

1208
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,960
again it has to do it and you got to

1209
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,599
trigger the gene but plants will also

1210
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,679
create extra anthocyanin to bind up a

1211
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,599
mild molybdenum toxicity so you can

1212
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,399
actually force the plants if it has it

1213
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,039
to

1214
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,280
produce extra anthocyanin by a forced

1215
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,400
mild quote you know again

1216
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,240
mild

1217
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,599
molybdenum toxicity

1218
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,519
you go too hard you're going to cause

1219
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,559
all the problems with your nitrogen but

1220
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,119
you know that's a whole separate

1221
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,639
discussion but uh um but for purples you

1222
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,559
know definitely so

1223
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,159
uh and silica so i've done a ton of

1224
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,719
side-by-side testing with silica and we

1225
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,239
did silica testing um and what actually

1226
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,598
uh i'll we'll start off with the

1227
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,279
beginning of why we started looking at

1228
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,599
silicon with aquaponics was

1229
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,839
specifically was there was a gentleman i

1230
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,280
can't remember his name at a boulder

1231
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,279
when i used to work at the aquaponics

1232
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,440
source i used to work and help we had a

1233
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,040
whole plant team and a product team and

1234
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,880
everything and we had different things

1235
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,480
that we worked on and developed

1236
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,318
well the plant team was trying to figure

1237
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,318
out why our aquaponic tomatoes always

1238
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,960
tasted slightly different than the than

1239
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,519
the hydroponic or soil tomatoes so

1240
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,838
we went and had them tissue sampled and

1241
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,519
sure enough it was silica and chloride

1242
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,838
were the two things that were missing

1243
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,599
which was very strange um and this was

1244
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,039
before we learned about flavonoid

1245
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,559
testing and all that we were looking at

1246
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,759
this more from a nutrient kind of

1247
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,838
perspective before uh you know

1248
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,000
anyways i was a little bit greener on

1249
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,199
the trying to fine-tune this on the on

1250
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
the plant side of things i wasn't

1251
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,279
thinking cannabis mindset with the

1252
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,838
vegetables you know what i mean um so

1253
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,839
anyways so

1254
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,199
uh so um the issue so what we did was we

1255
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,480
tested that and noticed the silicon the

1256
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,480
chloride so what we did was we upped the

1257
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,199
silica we upped the chloride and we had

1258
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,280
a huge increase in uh not only yield

1259
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,358
above about 15 to 20 but we also had a

1260
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
reduce in reduction in powdery mildew

1261
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,159
and molds and we also had a reduction in

1262
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,639
um

1263
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,679
we also had a reduction in uh issues

1264
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,279
with um uh uh crispness so if we

1265
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,039
harvested lettuce and put it in the

1266
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,960
fridge we were able to get anywhere from

1267
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,318
five to eight additional days in the

1268
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,240
fridge where it's you know before it

1269
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,759
started to wilt and look like crap

1270
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,479
so we were also you know and other

1271
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,079
things like powdery mildew and cucumbers

1272
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,280
and and

1273
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,960
the total um um failure rate of flowers

1274
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,880
on cucumbers were also increased by

1275
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,119
increasing silica as well and it seems

1276
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,079
to be a threshold around

1277
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,440
60 parts per million in aquaponics

1278
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,880
really seems to be that minimum

1279
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,159
threshold at least for most crops and

1280
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,240
then cannabis seems to be a little bit

1281
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,159
higher than that but um

1282
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,358
but in general that's some of the

1283
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,879
different rabbit holes that i've had the

1284
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:05,838
pleasure of jumping down with some of

1285
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
the different groups that i've worked

1286
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,759
with

1287
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,838
yeah wow very very detailed analysis of

1288
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,680
what's necessary there

1289
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,199
a question i've always been wondering is

1290
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,279
do you think that

1291
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,199
even with the use of aquaponics if

1292
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,839
you're in somewhere like zimbabwe you

1293
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,118
could still get some sort of terroir or

1294
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,000
do you think it just it probably has to

1295
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,559
be in the ground to sort of do that

1296
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,719
also i do think and i and i

1297
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,960
so i'm two minds in this so one you're

1298
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,039
not i wouldn't qualify it i wouldn't go

1299
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,599
in with an aquaponics system into humble

1300
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,599
and say it's a humble terrar right like

1301
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,920
that's it's not gonna have the the

1302
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,760
microbes and the flavors from the ground

1303
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,599
what i would say is that you could make

1304
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,480
a good argument that aquaponics is its

1305
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,800
own terrar because it is its own root

1306
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,719
biome that is completely unique now you

1307
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,480
will have unique two different climates

1308
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,838
and you could say maybe you know certain

1309
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,280
things and you could absolutely develop

1310
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,078
something similar because again your

1311
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,800
microbial biodiversity and it's funny

1312
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,240
you mentioned that nasa did a study

1313
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,760
a couple years ago and i was working

1314
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,919
with a vegetable farm that participated

1315
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,720
in this and they did dna studies on

1316
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,599
trying to see okay well what are all the

1317
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,919
mineralizing microbes if we went to mars

1318
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,599
or someplace like that what's the pack

1319
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,760
of microbes we need to bring to

1320
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,440
aquatically mineralize either human

1321
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,599
waste or animal waste or whatever we're

1322
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,240
going to do for fertilizer so so

1323
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,720
whatever you know biological waste that

1324
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,479
we're going to process and to plant food

1325
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,239
what packet of microbes do we need so

1326
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,159
they tested all manner of soil microbes

1327
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,679
and aquatic microbes and they had some

1328
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,480
cool results so one of the things they

1329
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:41,279
found was that the the most are the

1330
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,440
least biodiverse aquaponic system

1331
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,200
was um 168 percent more biodiverse than

1332
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,400
the most biodiverse soil system they

1333
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:52,879
test in terms of microbial species count

1334
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,240
so they they the aquatic biome just

1335
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,240
slaughtered it but if you think about it

1336
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,000
the aquatic microbiome has had an extra

1337
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:00,159
billion years to evolve

1338
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,760
so of course that makes sense right that

1339
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:02,559
that's a no-brainer

1340
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,680
so

1341
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,400
that was really interesting and then

1342
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:09,118
also uh they found that you know none of

1343
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,039
the aquatic tests had the same microbes

1344
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,960
you had radically different chains of

1345
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,880
microbes that were mineralizing the same

1346
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,480
minerals and completely different chains

1347
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,640
some of them were two some of them were

1348
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,960
up to eight and everything in between

1349
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,118
and each each one was different there

1350
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,720
was no universal and that was i think

1351
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,000
one of the even trippier things is that

1352
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,078
you have all these different ways that

1353
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,719
this has co-evolved around the planet to

1354
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,039
mineralize xyz minerals a thousand

1355
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,519
different times so who knows you know

1356
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,039
there is such a big rabbit hole and no

1357
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,358
one's looking at it for aquatic

1358
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,119
mineralization it's there's billions of

1359
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,199
dollars in ag tech sitting there on the

1360
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,680
table and and no one's even looking at

1361
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,879
it you know it's really a huge if

1362
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,078
someone out there is listening to this

1363
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,760
and wants a gold mine there you go you

1364
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,560
know pick what pick pick literally any

1365
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,280
microbial chain and 78 of them will live

1366
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,759
in a terrestrial microbiome so you 78 of

1367
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,599
those microbes that you can hunt for

1368
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,520
will live in both soil and aquatic so

1369
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,599
it's it's an area that needs a ton of

1370
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,280
research it needs lots of university

1371
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,359
students doing lots of papers it needs

1372
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,519
all of those things

1373
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,960
wow yeah that's almost like a gold mine

1374
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,318
of papers you could put out on that

1375
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,280
subject

1376
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,199
i guess

1377
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,599
i then start to think

1378
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,239
what would be in your mind the most

1379
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,920
optimal end goal for these producers in

1380
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,078
africa do you think that it's going to

1381
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,760
get probably turned to oil or do you

1382
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,280
think that the flower could become of

1383
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,640
good enough quality that it gets

1384
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,000
imported into more kind of uh expensive

1385
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,879
western sort of countries as a

1386
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,599
generalization or what what do you think

1387
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,079
is the ideal end goal for these african

1388
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,240
countries such as zimbabwe

1389
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,400
i think really their bulk goal is to do

1390
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,078
bulk isolate production doing oils that

1391
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,680
are separated out

1392
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,160
they're not again they're not going to

1393
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,078
compete for quality the they can compete

1394
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,078
for scale you know the cost of labor

1395
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,359
there is very cheap um your average

1396
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,039
person there makes eight to twelve

1397
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,279
thousand dollars a year most of them are

1398
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,639
closer to eight or less i'm just giving

1399
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,880
the idea of people in zimbabwe in terms

1400
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,358
of u.s money per year

1401
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,400
and that's you know middle class so

1402
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,078
um

1403
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,480
do the math on how cheap some of these

1404
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,599
people are living per year or per day

1405
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
you know it's

1406
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,240
you know

1407
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,559
something that neither you and i could

1408
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,078
are capable of doing that's for sure um

1409
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,199
and um

1410
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,720
but um

1411
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,318
uh definitely something where i think

1412
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,239
that you're gonna have you know these

1413
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,318
low labor costs are gonna end up being a

1414
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,838
player in the market long term where

1415
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,519
what are you gonna do when someone can

1416
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:32,799
bring over shipping containers and stuff

1417
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,400
that's being produced for eighteen

1418
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,640
dollars a pound

1419
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,480
or twelve dollars a pound you know

1420
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,920
uh if you're competing you know whether

1421
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,920
they what they will do is drive out the

1422
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,480
aurora drive out the canopy drive out

1423
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,559
the the the budweiser drive out the

1424
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,079
marlboro and the philip morris that

1425
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,400
they'll drive all those guys out you

1426
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,839
know what i mean and and i'm okay with

1427
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,599
that

1428
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:54,960
you know we all the craft growers that

1429
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,000
listen most of the craft girls on the

1430
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,480
show they're not competing with them

1431
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,318
anyway they're not even on the same

1432
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,159
league

1433
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,000
so yeah so i've actually heard of some

1434
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,879
other people who've done some stuff down

1435
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,280
in africa like most notably uh gene

1436
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,838
finder has done some stuff and i'd even

1437
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,680
heard some rumors i think it might have

1438
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,759
even been put out by of all people

1439
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,679
chimera that

1440
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,000
um like the philip morrisons are

1441
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,598
interested in looking into africa did

1442
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,358
you see any other people or other

1443
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,280
operations down there looking to do

1444
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,598
anything like that

1445
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,519
oh yeah and actually the the i guess

1446
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,599
what i would say is the most concerning

1447
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,280
is you have uh there's a chinese uh

1448
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,559
group that's kind of moving into africa

1449
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,559
that wants to kind of push into the

1450
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,960
cannabis market and they're trying

1451
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,800
really hard to find genetics they don't

1452
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,639
have genetics they were desperately

1453
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,480
trying to talk to anyone westerner for

1454
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,719
genetics they wanted to desperately buy

1455
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,119
anything that i had um that that seemed

1456
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,879
to be the thing that they didn't have um

1457
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,880
but they are setting up some big

1458
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,400
operations over there and you know who

1459
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,079
knows what they're going to do the to

1460
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,760
the the price points in the industry i

1461
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,519
mean they already have completely

1462
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,680
collapsed the fiber market and the oil

1463
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,639
market you know price point wise to make

1464
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,919
it really hard to compete so um let's

1465
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,239
hope that they don't try to move in on

1466
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,440
the other stuff but again

1467
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,358
they're still never going to compete

1468
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,358
with the craft growers you're not going

1469
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,279
to the people that are going to go you

1470
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,119
know that are buying high quality stuff

1471
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,200
right now are not going to ever look at

1472
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,599
that anyway you know what i mean

1473
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:25,358
yeah of course and so i guess my next

1474
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,880
question although for you it would be

1475
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,199
specific to zimbabwe but i think you

1476
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,760
could broadly apply it to anyone who's

1477
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,358
going to a kind of an area where

1478
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,200
like there is cheaper labor and they're

1479
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:36,400
looking to set up a bigger operation do

1480
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,879
you think in that sort of general

1481
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,240
situation you would look to bring in

1482
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,599
some genetics like what you just

1483
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,199
mentioned or do you think that it might

1484
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,039
be more wise to work with any

1485
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,318
pre-existing cultivars that might be

1486
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,639
there

1487
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,039
no so i actually i well

1488
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:53,440
i i have access and have some some

1489
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,679
wonderful zimbabwean cultivars i picked

1490
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,599
up and then younger but

1491
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,279
they are not heavy yielders they're

1492
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,440
they're not commercially viable stuff

1493
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,200
you if you're growing on a commercial

1494
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,000
scale and if i'm growing and setting up

1495
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,679
for someone as a consulting client i'm

1496
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,679
setting it up as a resin factory and it

1497
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,679
needs to pump resin out i don't care

1498
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,519
about anything other than that you know

1499
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,960
we're trying to pump flour and pump

1500
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,199
resin you know that that's what we're

1501
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,039
doing it needs to turn over quickly it

1502
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,039
needs to be resistant to most things it

1503
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,880
needs to not be a pain in my ass to grow

1504
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,239
it's not to have some wack-ass feeding

1505
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,160
schedule that's going to make me pull my

1506
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,919
hair out or some other baby thing that

1507
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,759
that particular strain is is going to

1508
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,440
annoy the crap out of me about that

1509
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,440
everyone you know everyone has a strain

1510
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,519
they love but it does this xyz weird

1511
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,318
thing if you don't do it right right so

1512
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:37,920
um

1513
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,759
try to avoid all that stuff and just get

1514
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,680
to something that's easy consistent that

1515
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,240
people that aren't on the same skill

1516
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,919
level as me can can pump out and run and

1517
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,759
and it doesn't matter what i can do it

1518
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,440
matters what the guys i train that leave

1519
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,800
behind can do and that's the thing i

1520
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,960
think that a lot of people set

1521
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,318
themselves up for is that anybody that's

1522
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,240
high skill level could come into

1523
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,558
anywhere and crush it and get the place

1524
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,318
back and go online it's can you train

1525
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,079
the guys and then leave them with a

1526
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,400
coloring book simple methodology that

1527
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,920
they can follow after that that that

1528
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,880
they can succeed with and that's really

1529
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,440
i think

1530
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,280
an area where um you know

1531
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,599
it's hard to because there isn't a lot

1532
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,040
of agricultural education in africa in

1533
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,920
local languages

1534
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,159
in fact there's almost nothing in

1535
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,838
agriculture stuff in shona which is the

1536
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,239
native language in zimbabwe it's really

1537
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,519
hard to find even plant names and stuff

1538
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:27,919
like that when i was trying to research

1539
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,679
plant names and pathogens and and pests

1540
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,519
it was hard for me to look up that in

1541
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,318
shona or english right like there's just

1542
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,079
nothing they just it's all verbal like a

1543
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,519
lot of african stuff is just verbal

1544
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,440
right they just don't

1545
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,838
there's not a lot of documentation or

1546
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,838
there isn't

1547
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,960
like the language isn't there for that

1548
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,118
type of long-term documentation for lack

1549
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,599
of a better word with

1550
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,519
with the languages right for for our

1551
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,280
specific craft it just hasn't been

1552
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,920
developed yet there's no word for

1553
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,359
terpene or cannabinoid or it just did

1554
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,480
you see i'm saying like it's almost like

1555
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,719
with the

1556
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,559
with like the people that um

1557
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:08,480
uh i know uh uh uh was it uh oregon

1558
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,559
pdx uh um

1559
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,000
oh i like blanking out on her name right

1560
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,599
now uh uh jared and angela uh pranks

1561
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,760
they're working on the the sign language

1562
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,519
for the cannabis um it's almost like

1563
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,000
that they don't have the language for

1564
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,880
our industry in the african languages so

1565
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,280
some conversations are hard to have

1566
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,720
yeah just trying to explain things on a

1567
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,559
basic level when they don't even

1568
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,480
understand even if they understand

1569
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,599
english i just went over their head you

1570
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,519
know what i mean

1571
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,280
yeah yeah and then you know

1572
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,480
and and then also just trying to make

1573
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,000
sure that like

1574
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,280
when you're trying to find seeds or if

1575
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,960
you are trying to acquire anything that

1576
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,640
like it can be quite the

1577
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,079
quite the hectic thing to do and and

1578
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,719
quite the long journey to get to the

1579
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,318
farm or you know you might have to

1580
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,919
i don't know jump on one leg and rub

1581
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,199
your belly to get them to believe that

1582
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,559
you're not a cop and all kinds of other

1583
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,000
goofy stuff but generally when you have

1584
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,319
waist length dreads it gets you by most

1585
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,318
of that

1586
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,719
i like that and you you bring up a very

1587
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,399
valid point you know like we both need

1588
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,639
to have the same lexicon otherwise we

1589
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,318
can't really talk can we but just to

1590
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,400
jump back to one of the previous points

1591
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,079
if you're willing to what sort of

1592
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,920
genetics did you take with you that you

1593
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,839
thought would do well there and long

1594
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,240
term do you think that down the track

1595
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,838
people will breed stuff specifically for

1596
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,159
that area

1597
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,639
sure so so the stuff that i specifically

1598
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:27,759
brought was durbin uh and then i brought

1599
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,838
some uh reunion island seeds

1600
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,680
which uh the old zamasu

1601
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:35,679
yeah i love it um so uh because they're

1602
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,598
damn near there it's very close latitude

1603
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,118
wise to where we were it was not far off

1604
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,400
a lot so i figured hey if it's gonna

1605
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,400
work

1606
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,119
and get me the that that weird gene

1607
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,880
expression with the continuous flower

1608
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,640
i need to grow it you know at that same

1609
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,079
lot you know as close to that latitude

1610
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,920
as i can and hey if i'm going to be in

1611
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,400
zimbabwe hey let's go for it right i'm

1612
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,800
going to be there so um

1613
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,039
and then um what's the other one g13

1614
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,039
hash plant from dragonfly earth medicine

1615
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:04,000
was the other one that found its way

1616
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:06,558
over there allegedly um so

1617
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,119
uh that's the other one that uh was the

1618
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,280
the thc cultivars that we brought over

1619
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,200
um we had some other stuff that again i

1620
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,400
haven't written down on the post i i

1621
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:15,759
don't remember what the other stuff was

1622
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,720
but those are the ones that i brought

1623
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,960
over

1624
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:21,519
personally for my own smoke

1625
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,440
sure and i mean to me the the first two

1626
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,199
you mentioned the durbin and the zamal

1627
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,800
sounds like pretty clear winners you can

1628
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,199
understand why it's going to work well i

1629
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,119
am curious to know did the g13 hash

1630
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,759
plant just freak out or it handled it

1631
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,760
pretty reasonably well considering

1632
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,480
it loved it yeah i know

1633
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,400
yeah

1634
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,838
all of them did great i mean and i

1635
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,039
specific i knew it was a pretty it's a

1636
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,639
pretty sativa leaning plant and it i

1637
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,239
just it's my favorite thing to smoke all

1638
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,920
day long if i'm gonna smoke one plant

1639
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,679
all the rest of my days

1640
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,760
uh ever since last april when i was

1641
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,838
first introduced to that cultivar and

1642
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,160
it's got its claws into me so

1643
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,159
yeah it's thanks josh and kelly yeah

1644
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:59,920
it's a beautiful plan i think i've been

1645
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,318
lucky enough to try some of that same

1646
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,639
cut and yeah very special stuff

1647
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:06,639
so the next question i guess i was

1648
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,519
interested in is that we're hearing a

1649
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:12,480
lot of talk these days about how

1650
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,759
there's kind of this detrimental i don't

1651
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,519
know if detrimental is the right word

1652
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,520
but people comment about how we see a

1653
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,280
lot of hemp sprayed with distillate and

1654
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,679
it's getting passed off do you think

1655
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,599
that's that is a bit of a risk with the

1656
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,440
massive influx of cheap distillate

1657
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,400
coming into the market long term or do

1658
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,240
you think that's more of just like a

1659
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,519
short-term thing and people will catch

1660
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,239
out how like you know they'll learn to

1661
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,599
pick up on it and just stop buying it

1662
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:34,799
no i mean i think it's definitely a

1663
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,318
problem i think it'll definitely become

1664
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,599
a problem especially international stuff

1665
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:38,960
where it's a lot easier to hide it on

1666
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,720
bigger batches

1667
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,720
but i mean [ __ ] i

1668
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:44,959
i can remember a lot years and years ago

1669
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,519
seeing people spraying garbage weed with

1670
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,480
terpenes in california you know as soon

1671
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:52,798
as they were as soon as uh river was a

1672
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,400
blue river or what was it blue river

1673
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,759
chirping yeah yeah it came out with blue

1674
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,519
dream yeah

1675
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,799
yeah and as soon as they came out with

1676
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:02,318
those terpene vials man it was all over

1677
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,838
like like that's

1678
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,838
when as soon as people started doing the

1679
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,759
isolated terps and spraying it i can

1680
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:09,759
remember seeing i know

1681
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,839
i was where i went and had a guy i was

1682
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,400
consulting for in san diego and he comes

1683
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:17,599
up to me with this bag of white moldy

1684
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,599
like very clearly pm covered weed he

1685
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,079
thought it was awesome because he

1686
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,720
thought it was frosty and he had never

1687
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,960
seen pm before and it was sprayed with

1688
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:30,239
terps to hide the the boy high school

1689
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,920
locker room smell yeah and he it dude we

1690
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,519
i about fell out of my chair laughing

1691
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,599
because this dude had paid like three

1692
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,719
grand or some [ __ ] for some moldy ass

1693
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,119
weed oh yeah i guess it is a it's a real

1694
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,358
risk factor isn't it but i mean it

1695
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,318
brings us on to the more valid question

1696
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,400
which is

1697
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:48,400
what do you think will be kind of the

1698
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,920
next step with distillates where do you

1699
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,680
what sort of products do you think will

1700
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,280
be utilizing this more cheaper

1701
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,719
distillate do you think pens is going to

1702
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
be just you know it's just full steam

1703
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,439
ahead or where do you see things going

1704
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,639
well the pen market is rapidly changing

1705
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,720
because um you have all the one we don't

1706
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,558
know well the pen market's interesting

1707
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,318
because you have terpenes that are

1708
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,559
highly regulated in europe in an

1709
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,798
isolated form that are not regulated in

1710
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,079
a blended cannabis form which at some

1711
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:15,599
point is going to have to have some type

1712
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,599
of legal reckoning at least in the eu

1713
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,119
market and probably on the wider

1714
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,039
international market

1715
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,880
and then you have um

1716
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,798
you know pens are popular but again you

1717
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,280
have the coils that depending on quality

1718
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,960
can be a health hazard you have you know

1719
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,798
depending on the blend with the terpenes

1720
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,000
can again be a health hazard so but

1721
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:33,358
people love them

1722
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,679
the pens are one of the most popular

1723
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,440
things out here edibles are also super

1724
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,358
popular and cooking oil is super popular

1725
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,440
here in oklahoma those three are are

1726
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,279
about 65 of the market because it's a

1727
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,039
lot of older people they want to be able

1728
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,559
to dose themselves and they want

1729
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,039
something that's not a little more

1730
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,440
discreet and not you know chiefing out

1731
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:54,079
the neighborhood you know what i mean

1732
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,838
yeah certainly and i mean

1733
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,400
it raises a really personal point to me

1734
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,239
because i've actually uh i've cut down

1735
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,160
my usage quite a bit over the past year

1736
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,159
and i'm i'm perfectly happy with that

1737
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,159
and it's made me realize when i go have

1738
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,480
a hit of some of the australians i used

1739
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,480
to be puffing on all day it it sends me

1740
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,159
flying and so i can totally empathize

1741
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,358
with older guys who are like i just want

1742
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:15,519
something that tastes good and doesn't

1743
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,440
destroy me do you think that this will

1744
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,960
become a growing

1745
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,039
kind of demand in the market and

1746
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,960
eventually we'll almost see like a

1747
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,960
divergence of strains where there's like

1748
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,039
the everyday stoner strains and then the

1749
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,679
more casual guy ones because

1750
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,039
being in that more casual sort of

1751
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,399
like let me just put it this way if

1752
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,318
someone gives me some weed and i and

1753
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,318
it's strong and i hit it man i'm just my

1754
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,400
day's gone

1755
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,239
yeah i know and it's funny um you

1756
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,838
mentioned that i i was in the colorado

1757
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,959
market when that first legalized and

1758
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,199
wrecked and you know what one of the

1759
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,880
highest sellers was the first two years

1760
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,318
was the rookie cookie which was a five

1761
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,559
milligram cookie

1762
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:53,039
five milligrams right so think about

1763
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,640
that you know so there's a huge market i

1764
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,079
would probably say it's 30 you know an

1765
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,078
enormous percentage of the market of

1766
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,680
people that are they're weekend warriors

1767
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,960
the people that haven't smoked in 20

1768
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,039
years or whatever and they they don't

1769
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,159
want to get obliterated and they don't

1770
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,159
know how to dose themselves like

1771
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,558
with a joint or a bong or certainly not

1772
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,000
with dabs right so so

1773
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,359
uh they need a way that they can dose

1774
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,639
themselves so you know i've worked with

1775
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:15,838
a bunch of different technologies that

1776
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,480
we'll be bringing to market later this

1777
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,159
year that help with that um that uh

1778
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,318
we're not ready to release publicly yet

1779
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,759
but um i have a new facility that we're

1780
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:25,838
pretty close to getting ready here in

1781
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,839
oklahoma uh in the next couple of weeks

1782
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:29,599
that will uh in august we'll have some

1783
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,639
announcements about but um we have a

1784
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,240
couple of different versions of stuff

1785
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,078
that allow us to adjust the potency and

1786
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,279
maintain the terpenes and a couple of

1787
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:39,280
other cool things that'll allow us to um

1788
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,640
give some more rookie versions but of

1789
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,319
those types of products but i do think

1790
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,400
you are going to see a huge demand for

1791
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,400
those you know more lower potency

1792
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,400
products because again that really is

1793
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,838
the vast majority the people that dab

1794
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,760
all day and the people that smoke lots

1795
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:53,440
of blunts and joints and you know a lot

1796
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,119
of the people that grow

1797
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,679
use it pretty heavily right but we're

1798
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,358
not the majority of users we're we're

1799
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:00,879
probably you know we're five ten percent

1800
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:03,199
of the market you know we're a very

1801
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,640
small minority uh of the overall

1802
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,000
cannabis market so we need to all

1803
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,078
remember that and i think a lot of us

1804
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,159
forget that because we get so used to

1805
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,680
the dab culture and everything that uh

1806
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,719
you know we forget that most people just

1807
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,558
smoke joints on on weekends right so

1808
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,719
or after work you know

1809
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,240
yeah totally totally and i mean it's

1810
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:22,000
interesting you raised the point about

1811
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,838
the rookie cookie because my next

1812
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,239
question to you was going to be do you

1813
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,920
think there are any major leaps to be

1814
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,679
made in the edibles field or do you

1815
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,519
think it's simply just about making it

1816
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:32,960
taste better and less like weed or do

1817
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,039
you think there's like some next

1818
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,440
generation like leap that might happen

1819
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,440
that makes it even better

1820
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,280
oh yeah there's a ton of advancements in

1821
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,639
bioavailability that are not being

1822
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,079
exploited right now in the market

1823
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:47,440
without getting into specifics and

1824
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,440
getting myself into trouble there's a

1825
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,920
bunch of different ways that you can

1826
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:55,039
rapidly increase the the potency of of

1827
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,920
cannabis and sometimes you know 5x

1828
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,159
uh and efficacy or even more on you know

1829
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,680
by changing some variables and and

1830
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,000
changing the way that your body looks

1831
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:06,879
and uptakes the the molecules be it cb1

1832
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,719
or cb2 receptor or some of the others um

1833
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,280
you can get down some pretty cool rabbit

1834
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:13,519
holes um again without getting myself

1835
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,119
into trouble uh with ndas that i've

1836
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,199
signed

1837
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,400
yeah we won't we won't uh go too far in

1838
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,239
that direction but that's there's

1839
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,838
definitely some cookies for people to go

1840
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,759
follow up on them

1841
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:24,719
if they're so interested

1842
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,599
so

1843
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:30,399
on the topic of edibles i was interested

1844
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,798
in picking your brain do you feel like

1845
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,519
there's any difference in the quality of

1846
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,199
edibles produced in terms of the strains

1847
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,199
used and i don't just mean like in terms

1848
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,039
of the yield you might get back but do

1849
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,279
you think a certain strain makes a

1850
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,599
better edible or it's it it's a

1851
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,760
processed it's so processed to the point

1852
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,680
that you kind of lose that sort of

1853
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,440
originality of the strain it came from

1854
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,358
originally

1855
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,679
uh so i think there's it's kind of a

1856
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,838
two-part question so uh first part i

1857
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,919
would say is that one terpenes

1858
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,318
absolutely are going to have an enormous

1859
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,280
impact on the efficacy of your

1860
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,960
um um you know medicinal value of your

1861
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,440
edibles the same way that they do for

1862
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,920
smokables um uh you know let's just take

1863
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,559
example seizure medications okay so if

1864
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,159
you have cbd okay and i have um and i

1865
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,519
treat someone with cbd and they don't

1866
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:22,000
respond okay you there's certain um uh

1867
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,920
cannabinoids i'm sorry certain terpenes

1868
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,838
that you can combine with cbd i don't

1869
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,639
remember the exact ones but i know that

1870
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:28,159
um

1871
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:30,078
uh uh

1872
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,558
what's his name house of harlequin uh

1873
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,640
wade laughter um he he talked about it

1874
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,480
extensively when he was on my show uh i

1875
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,000
believe it was episode 140 of of the

1876
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,000
growing with fishes podcast if you want

1877
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,920
to know exactly

1878
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,880
he talks about the specific terpene

1879
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,240
groups in that episode but um

1880
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,559
there's certain terpenes that actually

1881
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:50,879
will help dramatically suppress cannabis

1882
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,559
seizures when taken with cbd but there's

1883
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,599
other ones that will antagonize them so

1884
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,480
if you take pining and terpinoline and

1885
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,480
beta-carothylene those are

1886
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,480
hyperstimulative terpenes you do not

1887
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,880
want those as a seizure patient you want

1888
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,480
to avoid those explicitly because they

1889
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,480
can induce seizures so you might have

1890
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,199
someone that has a cbd cultivar that's

1891
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,440
high in those that's not getting relief

1892
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,798
from their seizures or even having them

1893
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,639
induced by them

1894
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,318
whereas you take that same patient give

1895
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,960
them a cbd cultivar with those different

1896
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,838
sets of terpenes and absolutely you know

1897
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,838
have

1898
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,318
efficacy with that product so so that's

1899
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:28,558
a absolute thing now um

1900
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,318
one thing that i found that and this is

1901
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,839
goes back to when i was first doing this

1902
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:36,880
back old school uh in the free people's

1903
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:39,599
market was um uh doing decarboxylation

1904
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,240
in sealed vessels so we would do it in

1905
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,519
mason jars or in a pressure cooker or

1906
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:45,598
some kind of other seal thing and

1907
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:47,119
initially we did it was to see basically

1908
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,559
to not let the whole neighborhood or

1909
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,838
apartment complex know that we're

1910
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,760
cooking right

1911
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:53,759
it's kind of a problem if i'm making a

1912
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,680
big batch you know everyone knows in the

1913
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,760
neighborhood you know my house smells

1914
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,358
great well when you're in a less than

1915
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,280
legal area that can be a very big

1916
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,759
problem depending on who your neighbors

1917
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,280
are so we originally did that but what

1918
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,760
we realized was we were trapping the

1919
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,119
terpenes in so we so the method that i

1920
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,440
prefer to decarboxylate if you're

1921
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,280
decarboxylating flour for those at home

1922
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,599
that are are making their own edibles is

1923
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,920
take take your flour

1924
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,760
dry it out and then fill your mason jars

1925
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,159
up about fifty percent of the way and

1926
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,200
then put them in the oven uh

1927
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,440
and and cook them at about 240 degrees

1928
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,279
for you know one hour and that'll

1929
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,358
decarboxylate your stuff really really

1930
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,960
really well and then also trap those

1931
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:35,358
terpenes in it also won't stink your

1932
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,880
house up or it very you know you'll be

1933
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:38,558
it'll smell maybe like you're smoking a

1934
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,400
joint like you'll know that there's weed

1935
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,760
there but it's not you're gonna bomb the

1936
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,440
house out right

1937
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,480
so then you take those and put them in

1938
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,559
the fridge

1939
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,719
and what that's going to do is

1940
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,400
cool and condense the any of the the

1941
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,000
compounds that were turned into a gas

1942
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,838
mainly your terpenes allow them to

1943
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,519
recondense back onto that plant material

1944
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:56,558
and and come back out of the gaseous

1945
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:58,639
form

1946
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,640
well that means that when i take that

1947
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,159
and now uh use that for making my

1948
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:04,159
edibles that that's now rebound back up

1949
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:06,480
on the plant material or what i prefer

1950
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:08,798
to do is i'll take that that half of

1951
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,199
decarboxylated jar and i'll fill it two

1952
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,038
thirds of the way with with my oil or

1953
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:14,879
butter or whatever i want to infuse and

1954
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,359
i'll throw that in a pressure cooker and

1955
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,000
we'll we'll pressure infuse that and

1956
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,759
decarboxylate that uh you know and we'll

1957
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,838
decarboxylate it first and then we'll

1958
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,200
we'll pressure infuse it for you know 30

1959
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:26,880
to 40 minutes

1960
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,118
in a pressure cooker

1961
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,200
at you know 5 to 10 psi real low psi

1962
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,798
real real low uh and you know just

1963
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,199
enough to to get that pressure on the

1964
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,880
jar and then and then take those out and

1965
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,318
then take that strain it now i have my

1966
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,559
infused oil and that's that's one of the

1967
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:43,599
easiest ways for people at home to make

1968
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,960
high quality high potency decarboxylated

1969
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,760
oil and you don't have to use a pressure

1970
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,679
cooker but it does help

1971
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,839
what what one thing i did want to add to

1972
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:53,038
that don't do the butter or oil and then

1973
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,558
put them in the jar if you don't have a

1974
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,839
pressure cooker they will explode in the

1975
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,440
oven

1976
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,440
if you're going to do that method with a

1977
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,559
jar infusion you do have to put it in a

1978
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,760
pressure cooker you have to have even

1979
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,119
pressure on the outside and inside

1980
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,160
otherwise they will explode just as a

1981
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,318
safety thing

1982
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,318
yeah very valid point

1983
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:09,838
so if we just jump back to the africa

1984
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:11,599
stuff for a minute i just wanted to

1985
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:13,199
touch on a topic you mentioned way back

1986
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,119
but i put a little dot because i wanted

1987
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,159
to come back to it is you were talking

1988
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,000
about how

1989
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,318
with your aquaponics system you could

1990
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,159
get away with i think you said about 18

1991
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:25,119
of the water usage usages some other

1992
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:27,279
sort of methods and it immediately made

1993
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,880
me think for for somewhere like africa

1994
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,880
or anywhere where there's like a water

1995
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,640
scarcity that's got to be one of the

1996
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,680
determining factors in terms of the

1997
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,838
system you use is that correct

1998
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:41,598
absolutely places like island nations in

1999
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:43,440
the caribbean uh australia uh africa and

2000
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,599
particularly island nations because they

2001
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,119
don't have a big water supply i know

2002
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,079
there's a there's a gentleman who does

2003
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,240
um

2004
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,160
uh i can't remember the name of his farm

2005
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,598
but he's in barbados that that is now

2006
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,078
also doing cannabis but he was doing

2007
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:59,119
vegetables for a long time and it he was

2008
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:01,039
doing it because they their their entire

2009
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,720
total gallonage of fresh water on the

2010
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,319
whole island is very limited they only

2011
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,239
get so much rain and that's all the

2012
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:09,279
fresh water they have unless they bring

2013
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:11,038
it in or desalinate so um you know

2014
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,280
having an area that especially when

2015
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,440
they're hyper limited on that and and

2016
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,680
cutting that down can be a great way to

2017
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,599
you know reduce the the water per crop

2018
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:21,519
yield and you know you can even further

2019
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,880
reduce it if you're in extreme measures

2020
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,798
now i don't recommend this for

2021
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,119
commercial cannabis production because

2022
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:29,599
the liability of if your indexing valve

2023
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,559
fails you can lose five rows of cannabis

2024
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,640
in a couple of hours um but

2025
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,559
uh if you're doing it for vegetable

2026
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:38,239
production and you're willing to ha

2027
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,000
to gamble that or have someone that's

2028
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:41,358
just actively inspecting them every few

2029
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,719
hours

2030
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:44,960
which you can do when labor costs are

2031
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,480
cheap obviously um

2032
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,639
and then um

2033
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,480
uh you you can do that with with

2034
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,358
indexing valves where i can run just

2035
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,760
enough water to do one trough and the

2036
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:59,358
sump to to take that back in and i can

2037
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,359
run four or six troughs of of plants uh

2038
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:03,199
you know whoever length

2039
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,679
off of one body of water and you can get

2040
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:09,838
extremely low in terms of total water

2041
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:12,399
volume for a large amount of plants

2042
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,078
you know per run in extreme cases and

2043
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,559
we've done vegetable production that way

2044
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,318
in jamaica and then uh some cannabis

2045
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,599
with that methodology again i try to

2046
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:21,279
avoid it with cannabis because it's too

2047
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,720
much of a liability if i have an

2048
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,480
equipment failure i just lost a

2049
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,318
greenhouse and

2050
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,760
you know if you you do not ever want to

2051
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:28,960
explain that to someone you're working

2052
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,039
for because

2053
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,119
it's not going to go well

2054
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:35,039
yeah i can i can certainly imagine that

2055
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,720
conversation

2056
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,799
in terms of when they're finished

2057
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,318
growing the product and they're going to

2058
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:42,239
harvest it they're going to dry and

2059
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:43,759
they're going to process it what sort of

2060
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,239
things happen there do we see the sort

2061
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,359
of drying techniques you might see on

2062
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:49,439
say

2063
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,318
mr nice's instagram feed where there's

2064
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,599
like these crazy warehouses just with

2065
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,279
tons of biomass just all drying out is

2066
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,519
it like that or is it a bit more like

2067
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,920
out in the sun how do they dry and

2068
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:03,838
process and manage all of the biomass

2069
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,760
once it's grown

2070
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,279
are you talking in africa yeah apologies

2071
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,920
yeah in africa

2072
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,720
sure so in africa remember zimbabwe was

2073
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:16,079
the tobacco capital of the planet so

2074
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:18,798
tobacco it has this enormous tobacco

2075
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,880
infrastructure so they have these huge

2076
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,519
brick tobacco barns that are

2077
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,920
you know an acre two three sometimes

2078
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,040
four acres in size that are that are you

2079
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,480
know basically just um uh corrugated

2080
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,479
steel and brick

2081
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,358
and you know some local wood to timber

2082
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,039
them up

2083
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,319
and there's huge bays and they have

2084
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,000
these furnaces on the end where they

2085
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,920
heat them up and they run warm air

2086
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
through them to heat the tobacco so

2087
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,480
they're they're basically taking those

2088
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,479
and you know cleaning them up uh running

2089
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,838
ozone through them so they can uh kill

2090
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,919
all the bad microbes or anything that

2091
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:50,719
might be living in there to to sterilize

2092
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,480
them

2093
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,838
and then converting those into cannabis

2094
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,519
drying barns and at least on the large

2095
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,278
scale i've seen three separate farms in

2096
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,880
zimbabwe i had a chance to visit some of

2097
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,319
our competitors not competitors but

2098
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,079
other producers i guess is probably the

2099
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,400
better way to put it in zimbabwe and

2100
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,798
they were all all of us included all of

2101
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:08,960
us were using you know old tobacco

2102
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,640
properties because they have the uh the

2103
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,719
well infrastructure they have the

2104
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,719
irrigation infrastructure they have the

2105
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,640
water reservoirs and they have the

2106
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:19,198
tobacco drying bar you know the drying

2107
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,039
barns they have the the tractor

2108
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,879
buildings that we can use for you know

2109
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:23,920
extraction and everything else so it has

2110
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,079
kind of the

2111
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,759
pre-built infrastructure or at least the

2112
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,119
the framework for a pre-built

2113
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,119
infrastructure that you know maybe it

2114
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,000
needs to be brought up to code maybe i

2115
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:33,759
need to

2116
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,759
you know update things in terms of

2117
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,679
modernization but

2118
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,880
you know 80 of what i need is already

2119
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,600
there

2120
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,079
yeah wow and in terms of the processing

2121
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,920
does it take place in africa or does it

2122
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,519
go somewhere else how do they do that

2123
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,560
part

2124
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,080
so so uh almost it's interesting

2125
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,159
there's a couple of ways that it happens

2126
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,920
from african countries

2127
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,719
so one way that happens is they'll take

2128
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,399
it dry it and ship it out as dry biomass

2129
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,560
another way they'll do it is take it and

2130
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:04,960
separate the oil and then sell that and

2131
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,640
basically 55 gallon drums of

2132
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,600
of oil or 30 gallon drums of oil or

2133
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,079
whatever

2134
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,159
the other way that they'll do it is um

2135
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:13,119
they'll take it they'll dry it

2136
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:17,039
safe

2137
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:19,679
down to 35 40 or 35 percent then they'll

2138
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,679
ship it to australia and dry at five

2139
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,760
more percent and now it's processed in

2140
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:28,000
australia and now it can qualify for

2141
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,760
australian gmp and and thusly eugmp and

2142
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,399
backdoor into the eu so you have a lot

2143
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,400
of companies that are producing in

2144
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:36,000
you know other parts of the world be it

2145
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,319
south america or africa that are

2146
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,158
backdooring it into the eu market via

2147
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,079
australia and

2148
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:43,759
i don't know how long that door is going

2149
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:45,119
to last but at least currently that

2150
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,520
that's a way that some of the larger

2151
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,760
companies are doing it and

2152
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,760
you know again i haven't moved anything

2153
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,679
since

2154
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,199
february january or february so that

2155
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,640
could have changed you know i don't

2156
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:59,039
quote me on that and say that i was

2157
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,600
wrong if that's changed since then but

2158
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,399
um that was how it operated up until you

2159
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,840
know

2160
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,719
things started getting crazy over there

2161
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,719
in africa and i came back in april so

2162
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,000
yeah i mean of course all comments taken

2163
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,079
in good faith

2164
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,319
you mentioned earlier and i wanted to

2165
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:16,960
specifically ask about this

2166
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:19,119
the price of the oil it's astronomically

2167
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,960
low i think i heard before we even

2168
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:23,840
chatted a few months back someone quoted

2169
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,158
something like 200 a gallon or just

2170
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,679
something which just blew your mind open

2171
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,399
what do you think that's going to do to

2172
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,840
the global kind of pricing and is it

2173
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:34,158
like what is the price like what's the

2174
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,239
going price over there

2175
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,599
uh so i don't

2176
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,879
i don't know what the current price in

2177
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,280
africa is um we were all looking at

2178
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,440
that refining it into internet mostly

2179
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:47,198
european markets um

2180
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,519
without getting into specifics that may

2181
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:51,279
or may not get me into trouble but um

2182
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,199
that was all all going into european

2183
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,679
markets so i i could tell you what that

2184
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:57,599
price was but i don't know what you know

2185
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,359
what the the low ball stuff that you're

2186
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,079
seeing out of there's a big company at

2187
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,759
lesotho and a couple other places um i

2188
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,359
also know that we originally wanted to

2189
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,280
get launched in south africa and then

2190
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,198
south africa started randomly arresting

2191
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:12,000
producers that were legally licensed

2192
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:14,000
that were not violating anything

2193
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,679
so we got real

2194
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,039
sketched out about throwing a bunch of

2195
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,239
money down there and i certainly don't

2196
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:19,439
want to spend any time in the south

2197
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:22,439
african jail

2198
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:22,439
so

2199
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:26,718
i hear it's not a very good place to be

2200
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,920
so uh we we decided to move up to

2201
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,600
zimbabwe where it was a little more

2202
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,199
stable and then now

2203
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,880
that's happened things have gotten a

2204
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,319
little bit a little bit more interesting

2205
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,239
in zimbabwe than they were when i was

2206
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:37,599
there and so what kind of seo it all

2207
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:38,959
works out uh we kind of have some

2208
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,640
different assets in different african

2209
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,800
countries so and that was kind of the

2210
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,760
plan too we kind of know that

2211
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,239
if you're going to get involved in

2212
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,920
africa

2213
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,599
africa doesn't always have the best

2214
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,279
stability when it comes to government

2215
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,199
and regulations so you kind of have to

2216
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,519
diversify across a couple countries and

2217
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:58,158
have you know kind of one export company

2218
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,400
that can kind of conglomerate the uh

2219
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:02,719
output of those different countries into

2220
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:04,000
you know set contracts for for

2221
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,520
different different people

2222
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,279
internationally so that's kind of the

2223
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,880
easier way to operate over there it

2224
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:11,279
doesn't matter what type of agricultural

2225
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,760
crop if we're doing you know maize or

2226
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,000
corn or or whatever you know

2227
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,199
or cannabis it you know all of them

2228
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,800
pretty much operate that way by

2229
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:20,000
diversifying across nations because

2230
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,119
again

2231
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,479
it just changes too often over there

2232
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:26,000
yeah

2233
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,000
sure sure

2234
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,359
and so just to go back to yet another

2235
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,880
point you mentioned much earlier you

2236
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:33,039
said that you did come across some of

2237
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,719
the more indigenous cultivars the land

2238
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,640
races but they just weren't suitable for

2239
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,719
what you needed the ones you did come

2240
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,360
across did you feel like they were

2241
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,960
likely affected genetically by some

2242
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,719
modern form or they were likely

2243
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,399
untouched

2244
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,399
well i look i look forward to bulking

2245
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:51,039
them out and giving out a bunch of seeds

2246
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:52,319
for people to to tell me uh uh that's

2247
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:54,719
actually one of the plans i'm working

2248
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:57,119
with a mr green jeans garden

2249
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,719
in in uh in california to bulk out a

2250
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,920
bunch of those um

2251
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:01,439
so that we have those available for

2252
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,520
people to give out but i found that they

2253
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,359
are incredibly high in pining it's like

2254
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,360
smoking a pine tree i think that was the

2255
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:09,839
thing i instantly noticed and then the

2256
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:12,158
the cerebral high that i don't remember

2257
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,960
having since i was maybe a teenager you

2258
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,479
know just a mind-blowing cerebral sativa

2259
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,719
high that

2260
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:20,639
it was intoxicating and just

2261
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,760
i haven't had in just such a long time

2262
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,079
and it just was

2263
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,760
ugh i just i missed it and i forgot that

2264
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,158
i missed it

2265
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,239
oh yeah i mean as a lover of sativas

2266
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:32,719
myself that sounds beautiful

2267
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,238
in terms of the local population the

2268
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,000
local culture what's cannabis

2269
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,238
consumption like over there do people

2270
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,560
generally grow and smoke it or it's just

2271
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,279
not really used

2272
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,760
so cannabis is a very uh hush-hush thing

2273
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:47,759
it can get you well the locals can get

2274
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,400
seven to nine years in jail so they

2275
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:53,039
generally uh don't share it very often

2276
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:54,000
um but you will find that like in

2277
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:55,519
private

2278
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,600
well okay let me make sure i don't get

2279
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,080
myself anybody else in trouble in

2280
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,320
private areas and private clubs and

2281
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,640
things like that it is fairly well

2282
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:07,198
tolerated i've smoked in public quite a

2283
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,719
few times but again it was gated public

2284
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:10,399
right like it was not

2285
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,198
not like you had to pay to get in but

2286
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,198
like

2287
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,359
it was on like a balcony or it was like

2288
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:17,439
in a courtyard an area where you kind of

2289
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:18,799
had to get you know go into the bar and

2290
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:19,599
back out the back you know it was kind

2291
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,279
of a

2292
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,039
off on the side kind of thing kind of

2293
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,158
off maybe kind of the way it used to be

2294
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:28,000
in canada before 2004 maybe anyone that

2295
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,920
remembers those days where it was

2296
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,760
accepted but kind of like keep it on the

2297
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,840
dl you know what i mean maybe not so

2298
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,280
much bc but certainly more towards the

2299
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,719
quebec side of things

2300
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:37,599
um

2301
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,920
uh

2302
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:43,039
kind of kind of in that vein so um but

2303
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,719
out in the country like you know [ __ ] we

2304
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,279
smoked all the time like it was no big

2305
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,960
deal but um and then out with the rasta

2306
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:50,800
so there's a lot of rastafari and they

2307
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,119
smoke and chief up and that's you know

2308
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,679
obviously anywhere near them you're

2309
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:57,679
gonna have a cloud right so but but uh

2310
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:00,560
but in general culturally speaking it's

2311
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:02,960
not very uh popular except for like at

2312
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:05,120
the bar so you go to a bar and and it

2313
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,760
has a courtyard outside you'll smell it

2314
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:10,238
right but it'll often be like

2315
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,520
stuff that like mexican brickweed people

2316
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:12,799
wouldn't buy

2317
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,640
right it's going to be something that

2318
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,920
like looks like pine needles and it's

2319
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,800
like

2320
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,079
probably 80 leaves and maybe there might

2321
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,480
be like a little bit of maybe 0.1 to 0.2

2322
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,559
grams out of a gram as an actual bud

2323
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,759
and then maybe like 0.3 grams of that

2324
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,320
seeds

2325
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,800
and then like the rest is like leaves or

2326
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,679
like some other part of the plant that's

2327
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,440
in there

2328
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:37,039
so and then that's on the low end and

2329
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,119
then all the way up to stuff that would

2330
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,039
compare with like cali stuff like like

2331
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,479
really good high quality like some of

2332
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:43,760
the people over there are taking notes

2333
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:46,000
and watching youtube and listening to

2334
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,159
podcasts and there i mean it show you

2335
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,640
know instantly you can tell who's who's

2336
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,479
paying attention to to education and who

2337
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,159
who knows what a sense amelia is and all

2338
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:58,479
that and who doesn't because you know

2339
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,839
one one is bushweed and one is a

2340
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,079
something that looks like it came from a

2341
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,079
store here you know

2342
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,519
yeah totally i mean and that's that's so

2343
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,439
promising to hear that there are there

2344
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,560
are people pushing the craft and the art

2345
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:12,479
down there something i've wondered is

2346
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,400
you know days gone by and probably less

2347
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,079
so zimbabwe but you know historically

2348
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,719
there's been certain african countries

2349
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,800
which have been notable for the kind of

2350
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,480
unique hash they put out and it often

2351
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,719
historically would go to amsterdam and

2352
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:26,639
that's how it kind of got the reputation

2353
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,880
do you feel like as more modern

2354
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,960
production comes in there will be

2355
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,640
probably we'll see an end to that and

2356
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,480
like maybe not zimbabwe but other

2357
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,679
countries that are known for their hash

2358
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,678
it'll fall off a bit or do you think

2359
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:41,359
it'll always be there

2360
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:43,520
no so there is no shona word for hash

2361
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:46,639
zimbabwe no one in zimbabwe knew what

2362
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,719
hash was and what a dab was like that

2363
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,239
a large part of africa doesn't know what

2364
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:53,279
a concentrate is

2365
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,718
like or the concept of thereof

2366
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,158
like

2367
01:17:54,719 --> 01:18:00,560
smoking also is more of a taboo like

2368
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:02,879
just smoking anything is more taboo

2369
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,679
there like just culturally than here

2370
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,359
like

2371
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,880
in terms of general acceptance like yeah

2372
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:08,719
people smoke cigarettes and you can buy

2373
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,840
them or whatever but like

2374
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:13,119
not it's it's it's more

2375
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,800
like living in some of the more lit

2376
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,960
really progressive areas where there

2377
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,199
really isn't that many people smoking

2378
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,960
um you know it's just not

2379
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,879
they export all that like that was like

2380
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,719
the dirty white people thing right like

2381
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,440
that was not not trying to be racist but

2382
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,960
like

2383
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:28,319
that was that was kind of thing that

2384
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,198
they kind of were like yeah that's for

2385
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,719
them right like it's not for us yeah

2386
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:34,479
sure sure and yeah not trying to be

2387
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,158
derogatory by saying that but it

2388
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:37,119
culturally that that's really how it is

2389
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:39,359
there

2390
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,439
no heck in in terms of if we're talking

2391
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,359
about tobacco i can i can get behind

2392
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:45,119
that that's that's not something i need

2393
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,119
but um

2394
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:48,559
you've made me realize this is probably

2395
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:50,238
the longest we've ever gotten to an

2396
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,400
interview where we're finally gonna say

2397
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,559
all right time for the usual first

2398
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:57,439
question take me back what was your

2399
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:02,239
first experience with cannabis

2400
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:02,238
oh man first experience with cannabis

2401
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,678
so my first experience i remember having

2402
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,199
i don't remember my first experience i

2403
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,359
can remember the first time getting

2404
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:14,000
really high i remember that that i could

2405
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,679
tell you had clear as day i was going

2406
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,600
and i was working at a

2407
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,600
cyber cafe at the time and no one who

2408
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,360
knows me knows exactly the cyber cafe

2409
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,960
and the town near where i grew up and

2410
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,559
there used to be a train station near

2411
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,840
there with a guy named dan

2412
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,440
and uh

2413
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,199
we went there with a friend of mine and

2414
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,439
dan and pat and we went over there with

2415
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,599
a ceramic bowl that he had made in art

2416
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:37,919
class that looked like a dragon

2417
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,679
and uh we had packed a bowl of some good

2418
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,800
[ __ ] that one of them we got from a

2419
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,600
relative

2420
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,800
and uh man and it was a good spot

2421
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,560
because of the train station you could

2422
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,000
watch the police station and we were

2423
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,239
kind of up in elevation so if they

2424
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,679
pulled out we could peace out before

2425
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:53,678
they had a chance to come up to where we

2426
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,440
were and be out or you know at least

2427
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,880
have a chance to hide your weed so it

2428
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:57,559
was a good place to sit and smoke if

2429
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,960
you're a teenager

2430
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,199
[Laughter]

2431
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,600
because it's hard to get snuck up on so

2432
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:06,238
we used to go up there and man i just i

2433
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,960
remember that first time going holy crap

2434
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,879
like this is

2435
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,319
and then the day after that was the

2436
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,840
first time i ever got so high i couldn't

2437
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,880
get off the floor

2438
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,880
i remember that too

2439
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:20,479
brilliant and so

2440
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,238
how did that progress did you quite

2441
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:24,638
quickly start smoking more regularly or

2442
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:27,279
it took a bit of a while

2443
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:28,960
no i kind of was off and on and then i

2444
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:31,279
didn't really start smoking heavily

2445
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,960
until maybe

2446
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:35,119
four years later

2447
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,439
uh and that i was starting to get sick

2448
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:39,279
um and that's when i was so i have a

2449
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,519
digestive tract issue and i have issues

2450
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:43,840
digesting things and i was glu i'm hyper

2451
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,520
sensitive to gluten and it causes me all

2452
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,639
kinds of without getting into gross

2453
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:51,120
details unpleasant trees so um with my

2454
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:53,039
did this digestive system so

2455
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,639
i started smoking more and more and more

2456
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:57,039
flour because it was a thing that was

2457
01:20:54,639 --> 01:21:00,480
allowing me to eat i was gaining weight

2458
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:02,560
again i wasn't in pain and it was like

2459
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:03,759
solving a long list of my health

2460
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,560
problems

2461
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,239
and then finally i was dating this girl

2462
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,159
and she goes have you tried a raw food

2463
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:12,158
diet and just you know make just

2464
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,079
eliminating the possibility that it's

2465
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,759
your diet and i said no i haven't but

2466
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:17,920
you know what screw it like i've tried

2467
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:21,280
everything else let's just try it

2468
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,719
and uh so we did that and um

2469
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,479
found out that that was the issue so

2470
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,000
then after that i smoked a little less

2471
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:29,119
cannabis and then i got

2472
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,198
when i moved out to colorado in um

2473
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:35,039
2010 or 2011 or whatever it was um uh

2474
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,439
got into concentrates and then really

2475
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:39,359
got a lot like suddenly that was like oh

2476
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,119
my god i can be a normal person again

2477
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,279
like medically like i can feel like a

2478
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:45,039
normal the way i used to before i

2479
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:46,719
started feeling sick

2480
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:48,960
and that was really a huge change for me

2481
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:50,719
but what really made me commit my life

2482
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,719
to cannabis was working at the

2483
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:55,039
aquaponics source

2484
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,480
and we had this this guy come in

2485
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:01,198
uh and his son the first time he came in

2486
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:03,198
he was a cannabis refugee and his son

2487
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,439
was strapped to a stroller he couldn't

2488
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,919
move he could he was completely unaware

2489
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:11,039
of the world around him uh and you know

2490
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,920
he was disconnected from reality

2491
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:12,800
and

2492
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,480
uh

2493
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,400
they had just moved there he wanted to

2494
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:18,158
buy a system for himself to he wanted to

2495
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:21,119
grow his son's medicine he wanted to

2496
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:23,359
like you know get his son better

2497
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:24,559
this next time i saw them was three

2498
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:28,399
months later

2499
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:31,520
that kid opened the door on his own

2500
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:34,479
ran in and started smashing eight ounce

2501
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,280
measuring glasses and shot glasses i

2502
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:39,919
cried for like an hour straight

2503
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:42,238
because that kid was

2504
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,560
functionally a vegetable three months

2505
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:47,198
earlier and he's in here smashing stuff

2506
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,840
now acting like a little boy that is the

2507
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:52,399
best gift you can give any human being

2508
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,760
and if i can do even half of that for

2509
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,839
somebody else

2510
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,960
that's what i'm gonna do every day till

2511
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,960
i'm dead

2512
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,399
and after that that's what got me to

2513
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,079
commit to this and that's why i've got

2514
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:03,679
on this long crazy train of riding the

2515
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:04,880
cannabis industries up and downs

2516
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,960
throughout all these different

2517
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,719
industries and countries and

2518
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,158
all the different craziness that it's

2519
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,600
brought

2520
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,279
me and the different projects i've

2521
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,960
worked on and

2522
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,479
you know makes it easier to get through

2523
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,719
when something like the virus suddenly

2524
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:20,238
pauses your project you're like eh i'm

2525
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:22,000
still doing this for a reason and i'm a

2526
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:23,759
thousand percent behind and i'm not even

2527
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,319
going to trip on that

2528
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,079
yeah 100 what a what a powerful and

2529
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:28,960
personal story there

2530
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,238
so

2531
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:34,960
what was it that made you really

2532
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:36,959
kick the gear and to shift in terms of

2533
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,880
kind of seeing that the the cannabis

2534
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,880
community wasn't really utilizing

2535
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,639
aquaponics in the way that it could be

2536
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,239
what was it that got the fire under your

2537
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,880
ass about getting the message out there

2538
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:48,879
about aquaponics and cannabis

2539
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,960
sure so i've always been a big uh

2540
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,719
adequate proponent of um the pet trade

2541
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,719
and i was been uh being involved with

2542
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,840
aquaponic i'm sorry aquarium societies i

2543
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,359
was heavily involved with the bucks

2544
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,239
county aquarium society when i was

2545
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,960
younger

2546
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:02,718
and um working in the pet trade the pet

2547
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,039
trade and the drug trade have a heavy

2548
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:08,079
amount of overlap in case anyone's ever

2549
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,840
not worked in the industry uh so

2550
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,319
there's a lot of things that get shipped

2551
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,239
in boxes from point a to point b and get

2552
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:15,359
labeled as plants or

2553
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,198
fish or

2554
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:18,719
other things and they're not always what

2555
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:19,759
you think is in the box and we'll leave

2556
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,840
it at that

2557
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,560
um so

2558
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,760
um i got exposed to a whole lot of

2559
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,840
things that

2560
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,840
maybe uh not everyone else my age was

2561
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,520
exposed

2562
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,119
to and i learned how to grow and one of

2563
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,520
the things that we did at one of the

2564
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:36,800
places allegedly that i worked at that

2565
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,880
um

2566
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,239
we would do is take the filtration from

2567
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,239
the fresh water systems that would

2568
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:44,319
separate out all the fish waste and we'd

2569
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,678
use that on the cannabis plants as

2570
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:46,960
organic fertilizer because we were

2571
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,199
trying to cut down on the amount of

2572
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,639
fertilizer that we were buying because

2573
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:53,599
you're trying to reduce the amount of

2574
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:57,119
red flags that might get you busted so

2575
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:59,199
allegedly so um

2576
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:01,119
so so i i had kind of worked with that a

2577
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:03,919
little bit and then

2578
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:06,719
um i had gotten into soil growing uh uh

2579
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,158
later on uh not long after that and uh i

2580
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,158
kind of went down that rabbit hole but i

2581
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:11,759
still always use kind of like tea from

2582
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:13,039
well i would do my water changes and i'd

2583
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,039
suck all the fish waste out of the

2584
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:16,639
gravel and it always and the plants

2585
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:18,319
always just kicked butt when we did that

2586
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,400
right so i was always kind of fiddling

2587
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:22,319
with it kind of half halfway then i got

2588
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,479
into river tanks which is basically

2589
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:25,599
aquaponics uh if you're familiar with it

2590
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:27,919
was a product

2591
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,600
inserts for aquariums that allowed the

2592
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,359
aquarium water to kind of flow through

2593
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,120
little channels where it had plant pots

2594
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,880
you put soil and it would kind of

2595
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,719
automatically water the plants and

2596
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,520
filter the water at the same time and

2597
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,239
really allow for a healthy ecosystem

2598
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:44,400
for reptiles mainly um so it was really

2599
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:45,919
cool so i had been doing aquaponics but

2600
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:48,079
i didn't call it aquaponics we called it

2601
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,520
river tanks but that we just didn't have

2602
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:52,399
the terminology i had never been exposed

2603
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:55,440
to that word um so when i when i came

2604
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,799
out uh west i worked

2605
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:58,238
helping grow some cannabis with some

2606
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,639
friends of mine and

2607
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,638
when the floods happened in 2012

2608
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,279
in colorado when we had the the heavy

2609
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,840
floods and it took out the um

2610
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:09,599
uh the uh we had a big mod wall at one

2611
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,279
of the places working at the obliterated

2612
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,159
half the building so

2613
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:16,399
uh i i was suddenly out of a job so

2614
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:17,759
i applied for i typed in the word aqua

2615
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:19,359
on craigslist and got hired at the

2616
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,639
aquaponics source because they were just

2617
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:22,000
moving into a new place and they needed

2618
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,760
someone that could help with both the

2619
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,679
lab and and product development at the

2620
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,199
time when sylvia bernstein was there and

2621
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,960
she was kind enough to to give me a

2622
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,158
chance over there and

2623
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,719
um

2624
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:34,638
uh hired me because i had a you know an

2625
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,560
immense amount of experience both with

2626
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,920
cannabis and and in vegetables and

2627
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,280
everything else i worked briefly for a

2628
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,119
company called blood good landscape

2629
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,960
which is the oldest landscaping company

2630
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:45,039
in the entire united states based in in

2631
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:48,560
horsham pennsylvania and they've been

2632
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:49,679
around since the 1700s and they have an

2633
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,520
incredible

2634
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,600
place there but i got a chance to learn

2635
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,840
large scale ipm and fertigation and

2636
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,800
stuff like that working with with um you

2637
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,960
know trees and bushes and shrubs and

2638
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,560
annuals for people's landscapes and

2639
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,480
stuff and i worked you know selling

2640
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,560
plumbing kits and designing stuff for

2641
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,319
ponds there on the side helping him out

2642
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,159
so i got a chance to kind of get into

2643
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:11,759
that kind of scale before jumping into

2644
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:13,439
cannabis but having that kind of

2645
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,079
cannabis experience kind of on the side

2646
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:18,079
at the same time so coming into colorado

2647
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:19,840
and having those kind of dual skill sets

2648
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:22,079
really

2649
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,159
really worked out well uh coming into

2650
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:26,639
the cannabis industry and and working on

2651
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,719
the bigger scale of things and um

2652
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,159
uh and and made an easy transition

2653
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,920
working with the aquaponics first and

2654
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:33,599
then we did a whole bunch of research

2655
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,440
you know they wanted two weeks after i

2656
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,800
was there she goes so we're thinking

2657
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:38,158
about doing canvas i thought it was a

2658
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,159
trick question like they're they're

2659
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,359
trying to see if i smoke weed or not and

2660
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:43,279
they're gonna see if i admit it they're

2661
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:45,519
gonna fire me so i just totally played

2662
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:47,039
dumb and she about she like adjourned

2663
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,480
the meeting and i was like oh you're a

2664
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,198
serious

2665
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:52,879
let me tell you some stuff so

2666
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:54,319
so we sat down and then we ended up

2667
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,840
doing the whole project and i started

2668
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,759
working with the gentleman and robbie

2669
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,880
who was actually just on my podcast last

2670
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,880
episode

2671
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,319
and him and i did a ton of r d with with

2672
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,039
cannabis and a whole bunch of different

2673
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:07,039
setups in aquaponics uh a lot everything

2674
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:11,119
from wicking beds to dual root zones to

2675
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:13,600
media beds to dwc to dual root zones to

2676
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,519
55 gallon drums to like any kind of

2677
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,880
combination or setup you could do so

2678
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,639
we're trying to figure out what's the

2679
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,719
best commercial viable way because we're

2680
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,960
trying to figure out how can we sell

2681
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,439
more aquaponics systems and how can we

2682
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,840
turn this into a heavily commercial

2683
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,439
production how can we further produce

2684
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,800
fruit fruiting crops you know not just

2685
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:32,079
cannabis but anything we learn from

2686
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,320
cannabis is going to help increase

2687
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:36,800
production for peppers and tomatoes and

2688
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,559
cucumbers and and all of those things

2689
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,159
are easily transitionable over in terms

2690
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,480
of production so

2691
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:44,238
we worked hard on not only medicinal

2692
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,879
herbs and essential oil crops but also

2693
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,879
cannabis production in an r d greenhouse

2694
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,719
that we had 50 by 30 by 18 and we did a

2695
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,159
bunch of additional experimentation with

2696
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,920
climate control models and stuff like

2697
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:55,279
that with geothermal and solar water

2698
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,560
heaters and and

2699
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:58,639
some other stuff that we can get into if

2700
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,480
you want to but um we did a whole bunch

2701
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,840
of cool r d on that and and really got a

2702
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,919
chance to wrap our heads around stuff

2703
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,679
and figure out what works what doesn't

2704
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,000
um you know what

2705
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,880
could work if we did some changes and

2706
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,560
really kind of uh splay that out and

2707
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,920
figure out how to make it work and and

2708
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,360
after that we kind of just took that and

2709
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,800
ran with it and then we we started

2710
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:18,319
working with a medical dual root zones

2711
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,679
where we have a soil

2712
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,319
zone and that really allowed us an extra

2713
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,399
layer of control where we can supplement

2714
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,238
not only supplement nutrients but

2715
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,079
um have additional microbial zones you

2716
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:29,519
know mycorrhizae fungi are incredibly

2717
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,079
important for anything that's heavy and

2718
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,960
lignin and having done a wide range of

2719
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:37,039
crops in aquaponics the more wood

2720
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,399
and lignin a crop contains the more of a

2721
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,319
soil area you need so if you're doing

2722
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:42,319
fruit trees you might do a dual root

2723
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,399
zone pot that's maybe two-thirds soil to

2724
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:46,399
one-third flood and drain whereas on a

2725
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:48,000
cannabis you're going to be more 50-50

2726
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:49,920
and then on a lettuce you might be able

2727
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,600
to do straight dwc you might not even

2728
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,119
need soil at all because it doesn't need

2729
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,679
any there's no lignin at all in that

2730
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:57,679
plant hardly right so so

2731
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,119
that that lignin content is heavily

2732
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,639
dependent on some of the metabolites

2733
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:02,399
from the fungal

2734
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:04,319
inputs that come from the fungal part of

2735
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,638
the root zone if you don't have them you

2736
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:09,439
either will not get very good growth or

2737
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:11,600
you'll get strange or [ __ ] growth or

2738
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:13,119
you'll get a lack of fruiting production

2739
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,880
one of one of the three depending on

2740
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:16,960
what fruit tree species we're talking

2741
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,400
about or genus at least that i've worked

2742
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,639
with

2743
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:22,319
yeah wow i mean so many questions the

2744
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,279
first one which which comes to mind for

2745
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:26,079
me is

2746
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:29,359
for you in your mind right now what's

2747
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:31,279
the ideal composition of your root zone

2748
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:32,319
do you want all living organic soil do

2749
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,079
you want like what you just mentioned

2750
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:35,759
maybe a 50 50 where would you be

2751
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:38,319
shooting for

2752
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,880
sure so my ideal setup for a cannabis

2753
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:43,119
plant would be 50 50 living soil

2754
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,359
with a layer of burlap or cloth or other

2755
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:47,920
root permeable membrane that would be

2756
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:50,079
separate the soil from the flood drain

2757
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,279
and then lava rock below that to get you

2758
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:53,679
know some trace minerals and anything

2759
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,519
else inside of a contained pot and i

2760
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:59,119
prefer plastic and i know people don't

2761
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,880
like that but plastic or ceramic over um

2762
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:03,039
cloth pots because the cloth pots don't

2763
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,119
give you a seal if i have a nice seal on

2764
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:06,960
the side of it with plastic or ceramic

2765
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:08,559
when the water floods and drains in the

2766
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,960
bottom half of the pot like it does with

2767
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,960
the dual root zone pot it creates a

2768
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,520
diaphragm action that causes a forced

2769
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,600
gas exchange through the soil zone so

2770
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,280
not only is the lower half breathing and

2771
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,960
getting better gas exchange the soil is

2772
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:23,759
getting better gas exchange meaning all

2773
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:26,158
the soil microbes are even happier so it

2774
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,960
gives you this added benefit of almost a

2775
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:31,039
lung effect going on in the root zone

2776
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:34,158
yeah what a brilliant way to kind of

2777
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:35,679
help people um conceptualize the sort of

2778
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,158
gas exchange that's going on with the

2779
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,840
diaphragm i really like that so a

2780
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,158
question i like to ask most of our

2781
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,239
guests is a bit you know specific to you

2782
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:46,238
in this case is do you remember your

2783
01:31:44,238 --> 01:31:48,238
first aquaponic harvest and will it

2784
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:49,439
always be like you know this golden

2785
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:50,959
thing in your mind because we always

2786
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:53,039
talk to organic growers and they're like

2787
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,359
man that first organic crop i'll always

2788
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:57,439
remember it

2789
01:31:55,359 --> 01:32:00,238
oh yeah the the first crop i did i

2790
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:03,439
harvested it entirely too early

2791
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:05,039
and i i gave it way too much sugar so it

2792
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:06,479
was like starting to droop leaves

2793
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,119
because i had

2794
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,919
suffocated the roots

2795
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:12,719
but

2796
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:15,039
and i had it but but it tasted great you

2797
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:17,439
know but i i definitely remember just

2798
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:20,158
the sweetness and how it almost tasted

2799
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:21,839
like caramel it's like smoking caramel

2800
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:23,839
and it was an island sweet skunk and in

2801
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,840
fact that's the plant if you go back and

2802
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,440
look at my my very first article i did

2803
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,279
with high times on aquaponics it's the

2804
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:31,039
plant that's in that picture

2805
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:32,399
oh that was the first one we did that

2806
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,479
was full term

2807
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:35,519
with with cannabis we did pictures with

2808
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:38,158
that one

2809
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,679
and that we did in aquaponics that was

2810
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:41,439
of any kind of size i had done some

2811
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,239
small stuff before that was

2812
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,000
pure

2813
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:45,599
i'm sorry i did some other stuff that

2814
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,920
wasn't pure aquaponics but that was the

2815
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,960
first one that was pure aquaponics start

2816
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,480
to finish

2817
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,719
including flowering and everything in

2818
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:55,279
between you know from seed

2819
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:57,840
and uh that island sweet skunk is that

2820
01:32:55,279 --> 01:33:00,639
cut to this day was still exists in

2821
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,480
denver area i gave some to uh to the

2822
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:04,159
dude from dude grows and a couple of

2823
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:05,919
other people and i know he he's raved

2824
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:06,960
about it for for a while on his show as

2825
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,399
well

2826
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,119
lovely and i mean

2827
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:13,439
i know you're also a friend so you know

2828
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:15,519
shout out to our mutual buddy breeder

2829
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:17,678
steve for creating such a nice strain

2830
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,440
hell yeah actually uh one thing about

2831
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:21,679
breeder steve he's the original person

2832
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:24,238
to write about aquaponics in in any kind

2833
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:26,158
of written form back on overgrow he's

2834
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,759
the very first person and you can go

2835
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:30,319
back and search i've searched the

2836
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,239
internet top and bottom he's the very

2837
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:34,880
first person to ever write about

2838
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:37,678
anything that you could call aquaponics

2839
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:40,719
uh in in with cannabis in documented

2840
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:42,319
form and it was back in 1996 or 97 on on

2841
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,560
overgrow.net

2842
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:47,519
wow there you go that's a cool little

2843
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,320
tidbit from the archives i like that

2844
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,960
so the aquaponics is going well it's all

2845
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:55,359
starting to come together at what point

2846
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:58,480
did you have the idea for starting the

2847
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:00,799
potent ponics podcast

2848
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:03,198
sure so uh potent products podcast

2849
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,199
started actually as a debate between

2850
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,839
marty and i marty and i were debating on

2851
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:09,439
whether or not you absolutely had like

2852
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,039
what the differences was in yield

2853
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:13,198
between dual route zones and non-dual

2854
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:15,198
route zones and marty and i kind of got

2855
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:17,439
into a he a heated discussion then we

2856
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:19,759
realized we were the only people that

2857
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:22,399
were really on a on a had enough

2858
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,400
experience to have that level of of an

2859
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:26,799
argument and then we quickly became

2860
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:28,479
friends and then we got both got sick

2861
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,360
and tired of hearing you can't grow weed

2862
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,799
in aquaponics like we we heard that a

2863
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:34,399
thousand times and we're just sick and

2864
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,159
tired of it because we got plant and we

2865
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:37,759
i've pulled six and a half pounds off of

2866
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:40,000
a single plant and aquaponics that we

2867
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,679
planted in a greenhouse the last week of

2868
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,920
july and pulled down the you know in

2869
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:45,520
october right so

2870
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,359
don't tell me you can't grow a lot of

2871
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,719
weed on an aquaponic plant you can grow

2872
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:50,479
psychotic amounts of weed on an

2873
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,319
aquaponic plant if you if you do it

2874
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:55,118
right so

2875
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:58,399
um and i can prove it i got evidence

2876
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:01,439
video and everything else so

2877
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:04,000
so we basically started the podcast as a

2878
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:05,439
fu to everyone that told us that we we

2879
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,800
couldn't grow aquaponically so we're

2880
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:08,719
like screw it we're going to put the

2881
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,880
education out and teach everybody how to

2882
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,800
do it you know and maybe not every

2883
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,760
single trick that we know but you know

2884
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,360
98 of them so if we put out education on

2885
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,039
how to do it then everyone can know how

2886
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:20,319
to do it understand how it works and

2887
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:21,600
actually

2888
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:23,198
you know they can wrap their heads

2889
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,039
around it and maybe they'll even convert

2890
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:26,960
it or adapt it as part of their facility

2891
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:28,719
and and and one of the things is that we

2892
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,158
see a lot of soil growers adapting it

2893
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,760
for their nursery facilities because

2894
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:33,439
again the accelerated growth rate you

2895
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,280
get with the mothers if you're just

2896
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:36,879
producing clones for other people or

2897
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:39,039
you're you know or you're producing a

2898
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:41,279
large amount of plant volume for high

2899
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:42,880
turnover facilities

2900
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:44,719
you need to kind of have you know

2901
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,719
accelerated growth rate on your your veg

2902
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:48,880
production and and either you know

2903
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:50,960
growing them out in size or for straight

2904
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,039
clone production so a growing you know

2905
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,719
even using it in a large soil production

2906
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,079
facility it makes a lot of sense to have

2907
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,639
it for your nursery operations being

2908
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:00,960
aquaponics even even you know on on just

2909
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:03,520
a minor scale

2910
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,359
yeah what a powerful testament to the to

2911
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,080
the technology i guess

2912
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:10,479
and i guess for me the question i want

2913
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,399
to most know is what's it been like now

2914
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,319
to have been running for you know over

2915
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,799
200 successful episodes it's such a

2916
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:18,559
tremendous milestone in the podcast

2917
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,639
industry you know seeing as we're still

2918
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,080
yet to crack 50 over here

2919
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,760
what have you learned in that time and

2920
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:25,359
what's your key to success how do i do

2921
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:28,320
it

2922
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:30,158
um i would say uh

2923
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:32,399
one just experience of working with a

2924
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,719
wide range of different people um and

2925
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,399
then two you know making sure you you

2926
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,920
spend a little bit of time to research

2927
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:39,439
your people before you interview them

2928
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,480
and and you know try to learn a little

2929
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:42,559
bit about something that maybe they

2930
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:44,479
haven't talked about in other podcasts

2931
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,400
or maybe you know get them to go down a

2932
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:48,879
rabbit hole you know we i'm both of us

2933
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:50,799
have had a lot of really incredible um

2934
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,960
uh conversations and really wonderful

2935
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,960
explanations of some pretty complex uh

2936
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:58,239
ideas and and

2937
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:00,319
methodologies and um you know

2938
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:02,079
biological mechanisms and all types of

2939
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:03,679
things that that you know kind of came

2940
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:06,238
of maybe even an offhanded comment from

2941
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:08,158
someone in chat or or a weird question

2942
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:09,759
or an afterthought that maybe wasn't

2943
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:11,759
even on your original list i know some

2944
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,679
of the coolest answers i've gotten or

2945
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,039
someone that just randomly had an

2946
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,079
offhanded question about something or

2947
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:17,760
maybe something that one of the

2948
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:18,960
panelists had you know it wasn't

2949
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,560
something i had written down for

2950
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:23,359
original question list so

2951
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,960
it can be really cool and and and

2952
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,238
not only that just the diversity of the

2953
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,480
industry i mean you have so many

2954
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:29,279
different ways to crack the nut that

2955
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:31,198
um

2956
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:32,880
of growing cannabis and and doing pest

2957
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,879
management and doing nutrients i mean

2958
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,560
you got hydroponics aeroponics soil

2959
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,800
growing living soil

2960
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,119
uh aquaponics and everything in between

2961
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,320
so it's you know

2962
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:43,759
it's really interesting to see how they

2963
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,000
different compare and how different one

2964
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,199
accelerates one thing that it's always

2965
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,039
interesting to me is seeing you know

2966
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:50,319
different cannabinoid interpreting peaks

2967
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:53,039
with the different production methods

2968
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:54,559
and and how uh certain stressors because

2969
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,560
of those different grow methodologies

2970
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,840
can really peak certain things as one of

2971
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,039
the things i always find really

2972
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,360
interesting especially when you're doing

2973
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:03,039
side by sides and you know that maybe a

2974
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:05,839
certain weird thing happened maybe your

2975
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:08,079
ac failed or a pump failed or you know

2976
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,159
something else went wrong but it causes

2977
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,079
a weird side reaction or

2978
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:12,879
a weird peek we had a

2979
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:14,639
uh

2980
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,960
oh how can i say this without getting

2981
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,239
myself into trouble we had an anomaly

2982
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:22,079
happen

2983
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:23,678
that caused an immense increase in thcv

2984
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,760
uh uh

2985
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:27,679
production in one of our grows that

2986
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,880
allowed us to kind of chase the rabbit

2987
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:33,520
hole on what actually is the secondary

2988
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:35,279
uh increaser for that so um we've we've

2989
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,360
managed to hit some pretty high levels

2990
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:38,238
on on thcv with some of our one of the

2991
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:39,519
clients that we're working with in

2992
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:40,319
colorado

2993
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,560
so

2994
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,599
um uh you know there really is a lot of

2995
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,039
different and i think that's really an

2996
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,039
area where there there isn't a lot of

2997
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:49,198
research especially with cannabis there

2998
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:50,800
might be a way to really you know pluck

2999
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:52,559
the strings the right way to piss off

3000
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,520
the plant to really produce a large

3001
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:58,400
amount of xyz compound uh that might be

3002
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,920
a a value commercially that is easily

3003
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:02,879
replicatable i mean look at something

3004
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:05,359
like cornsmut um let's use that as an

3005
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,880
example with with corn you have corn

3006
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:08,960
that the they spray on the corn which

3007
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,159
increases makes this wonderful flavorful

3008
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,840
mushroom well um what they found uh and

3009
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:15,439
and mike west has talked about this on

3010
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,159
my show uh if you if you're familiar

3011
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:19,359
with him from embark health in canada

3012
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:21,118
he was one of the people that was

3013
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:22,399
involved with uh you got a chance to see

3014
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:24,719
some of the data i believe it was from

3015
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:27,118
emerald cup and they noticed there was a

3016
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:30,158
dramatic increase in cbt levels which is

3017
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:32,399
a miter cannabinoid from powdery mildew

3018
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:34,559
uh infected plants so plants that failed

3019
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,679
for pm also seem to have elevated levels

3020
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,480
of cbt

3021
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:41,039
so what if cbt ends up being and this is

3022
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:43,198
just for the sake of argument

3023
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:44,960
that cbt ends up being like the next big

3024
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:46,719
breakthrough in cancer drug you might

3025
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,800
have people intentionally infecting

3026
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:50,960
flowering rooms two weeks before harvest

3027
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,719
with powdery mildew to spike the cbt

3028
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,880
like this is something that mechanically

3029
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,960
might make sense or or some it might be

3030
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,719
a non-pathogenic microbe that we spray

3031
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,719
on the plants to boost something in a

3032
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:03,600
way

3033
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,319
or it might be a gmo microbe i mean you

3034
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,600
know

3035
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:06,639
people might get mad at me for saying

3036
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,280
that but you might have something that

3037
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:11,039
that's human made or or human isolated

3038
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:11,920
maybe not even human-made but maybe that

3039
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:14,158
grown

3040
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,239
uh and that's isolated from a natural

3041
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:18,079
source that that increases an xyz

3042
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:20,799
metabolite to spike a cannabinoid or

3043
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:22,559
terpene that that we use that we that

3044
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,639
five years from now we can't even think

3045
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,080
of not using you know i mean that you

3046
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,520
could have something that's that much of

3047
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:29,118
a breakthrough that suddenly increases

3048
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,960
thc by 10

3049
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:32,479
or or some other thing that that we just

3050
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:35,198
didn't know you know and these are all

3051
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:37,039
things that because of the the

3052
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:39,279
some of the results that i've seen with

3053
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:41,118
different issues that we've run into or

3054
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:43,118
or variables that we've experimented

3055
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,719
with but because of the the amount of

3056
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:48,000
control that we have with the dual root

3057
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:49,920
zone aquaponics we've managed to really

3058
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,039
have more knobs and buttons that we can

3059
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:55,600
turn and and push and levers to pull

3060
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:57,039
uh to change things and have more more

3061
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,039
variables that can be changed in

3062
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:00,560
different parts of the system and and

3063
01:40:59,039 --> 01:41:01,920
allow us to unlock some of the stuff and

3064
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,080
i think that again is an area that

3065
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,840
really could use a lot more flushing out

3066
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:07,600
and a lot more research

3067
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,440
a hundred percent that makes me so

3068
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,280
excited to hear talk about that because

3069
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:13,279
i mean you know to call on him again

3070
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,439
thinking back to when i spoke to breeder

3071
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:16,960
steve myself we kind of spoke about this

3072
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:19,919
not in the level you just did but

3073
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,840
talking about how you know when botrytis

3074
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,840
infects grapes it led to the like a

3075
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,279
creation of a new type of wine and it on

3076
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,480
face value you'd be like no i don't want

3077
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,158
botrytis

3078
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:30,238
so what you just said it just speaks to

3079
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:32,079
that philosophy so greatly which is

3080
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:32,959
amazing and i guess what i'd want to ask

3081
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:36,079
is

3082
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,840
kind of relating back to dragonfly they

3083
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:39,679
mentioned to me that

3084
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,440
they feel like when your soil is really

3085
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:42,960
alive and popping you can get different

3086
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:45,198
expressions and you kind of alluded to

3087
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,600
that yourself have you noticed a

3088
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:49,118
consistent sort of thing that comes out

3089
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,199
when you grow things aquaponically like

3090
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:52,719
a consistent way the profile is affected

3091
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:53,919
or maybe the tur have you noticed

3092
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,520
anything like that or you think it's

3093
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,600
variable you can't quite make broad

3094
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:59,280
rules of thumb like that

3095
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,840
sure i would say across the board

3096
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:05,679
beta-carotelline is is is above

3097
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:08,480
is elevated across the board um

3098
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:09,840
other than beta-carotelline it's the off

3099
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,479
the top of my head it's the only one

3100
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,079
that i can say is is pretty universal

3101
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:16,158
there's definitely spikes in other ones

3102
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:17,760
and certain in certain cultivars but

3103
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:18,960
that's the one i would say that

3104
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,119
you know

3105
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,480
any of them express in any kind of a way

3106
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:25,439
are going to have a night and day

3107
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:26,879
difference with the aquaponics um

3108
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:29,359
not not really ringing a bell on any

3109
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,440
other ones yeah no but that's great info

3110
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:33,118
in itself because i mean i was always

3111
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:34,879
surprised when i looked at like um

3112
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:35,920
terpene analysis of cookies and you'd

3113
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,239
see it had a good amount of

3114
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,840
beta-carotene in it and so it's like if

3115
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:42,079
that's what you're growing maybe you can

3116
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,920
get an even better profile profile out

3117
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:45,840
of aquaponics

3118
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:48,158
so we one of the biggest increases we've

3119
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,000
had strains go from four percent to nine

3120
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:52,799
percent cbd

3121
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,719
with aquaponics versus soil control

3122
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:57,279
that's been a huge increase and i know

3123
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,639
that uh green the there's a university

3124
01:42:57,279 --> 01:42:59,759
that was working with green relief

3125
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,440
incorporated which is one of the bigger

3126
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,920
companies in canada doing aquaponics

3127
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,399
they noticed a 14 increase in thc

3128
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:08,840
production against dwc controls with

3129
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:12,079
dual root zones so um you

3130
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:14,400
know and then also against soil as well

3131
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:17,039
i forget it was like 18 or it was even

3132
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:18,479
more against the soil so um and they

3133
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:20,479
have actual there's a published white

3134
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:21,678
paper on on their breakdown i don't

3135
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:23,759
remember the name of the paper anything

3136
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:25,760
but you can look it up um

3137
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,480
if you look up the the

3138
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:31,199
uh aquaponics association meeting for

3139
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:34,158
last year um i believe it's referenced

3140
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:36,238
in the the um the conference meet there

3141
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:37,839
if you're trying to hunt that down

3142
01:43:36,238 --> 01:43:40,079
yeah some great leads there for the

3143
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,920
listeners to follow up on just to jump

3144
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,519
back to our last question about you know

3145
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,279
having accumulated all of this

3146
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:48,000
experience and knowledge from having

3147
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:49,359
done your podcast for over 200 fantastic

3148
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,238
episodes now

3149
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:55,198
what's one thing that's changed in your

3150
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:58,879
mind since the start and what's a cool

3151
01:43:55,198 --> 01:44:00,799
discovery you've learnt along the way

3152
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,880
i think uh

3153
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,840
the biggest thing i've taken away from

3154
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:08,480
is is thinking about

3155
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:10,159
microbes as a machine i can use to make

3156
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,718
things for me

3157
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:14,879
in a plant way like a plant useful way

3158
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:18,000
so for a great example would be like

3159
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,960
thinking of knf as a machine that i can

3160
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,279
put plant inputs through to isolate

3161
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,760
minerals or plant hormones or other

3162
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:28,238
plant bishop beneficial

3163
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,520
compounds to accelerate growth rates so

3164
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:31,359
a great example of this would be

3165
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,320
something like

3166
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:35,039
a

3167
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:36,479
lactobacilli lactobacilli are great

3168
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:38,479
because that not only do they

3169
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,319
out-compete most pathogens e coli

3170
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:41,839
salmonella listeria

3171
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:43,198
they love to feed on all of those things

3172
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,960
which has been documented in both the

3173
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:47,599
meat processing industry but also the

3174
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,760
agricultural processing industry and in

3175
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,199
aquaponic production

3176
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:54,239
specifically through the university of

3177
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:56,158
kentucky state who did a research on

3178
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,839
both plant and fish production were they

3179
01:44:56,158 --> 01:44:59,920
able to get increase in fish production

3180
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,239
of 10 to 15 percent in terms of growth

3181
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:04,560
rate and plant production on average 18

3182
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:06,718
to 20 percent and most crops

3183
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,639
uh and that's all aquaponics to the

3184
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:12,560
university of kentucky state um you can

3185
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:14,400
check that out uh uh um joe pate uh um

3186
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,639
is the guy that uh

3187
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,319
uh george pate i believe is his actual

3188
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:20,960
name is the guy who did the paper on

3189
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:23,359
that uh a white paper on that um but um

3190
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,118
i was involved with the lactobacilli

3191
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:27,279
part of that so

3192
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:28,559
what i prefer to do with labs and i'm

3193
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,960
sure you've had other people on talked

3194
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,719
about labs on the show but i prefer to

3195
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,279
do it a little different so i prefer to

3196
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:38,000
do kefir based labs so i'll get kefir

3197
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:39,840
kefir depending on your culture

3198
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,560
on how you say it and it's a

3199
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:45,360
lactobacilli culture that seems to have

3200
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:47,199
significantly higher levels of different

3201
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:49,359
vitamin b complexes

3202
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:51,599
also works faster if i'm doing this on a

3203
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:53,759
commercial scale i don't have time to

3204
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:56,639
wait days and days and days for this to

3205
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,520
work it needs to work tomorrow so if i

3206
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,520
do

3207
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:01,040
large gallons and large volumes with

3208
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,440
kefir it will go

3209
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:04,960
you know 24 to 48 hours and it's ready i

3210
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:07,599
don't have time this is commercial

3211
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:09,840
production this is again a resin factory

3212
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,440
we're not going after you know trying to

3213
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,279
baby everything i don't have time for

3214
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:16,158
that um so

3215
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:18,399
we do a kefir based so we do kefir and

3216
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:20,879
milk instead of the traditional air

3217
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:22,879
collected um stuff

3218
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,400
and we find we get dramatic increases in

3219
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,719
growth rate compared to

3220
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:28,559
side by inside by sides doing everything

3221
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,239
everything else is identically the same

3222
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,080
just faster growth rate you get better

3223
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:34,158
vitamin b complexes

3224
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:36,639
what you can do with that is is that add

3225
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:38,158
spirulina so if i'm doing four gallons i

3226
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:40,560
lose some five gallon batches so if i'm

3227
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:42,000
doing four gallons of milk

3228
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,679
i will add

3229
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,238
um

3230
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:49,920
four cups of spirulina two cups of kelp

3231
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:51,599
extract and top off um uh whatever's

3232
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,679
left over with water and put a lid on it

3233
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,880
and ferment that

3234
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,480
for

3235
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,679
anywhere from three to five days the

3236
01:46:56,479 --> 01:46:59,039
first time and then once you get the

3237
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:02,319
good culture

3238
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:04,319
of microbes it'll go anywhere from 24 to

3239
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:07,679
72 hours depending on the temperature

3240
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:09,759
you're doing it and what it'll do is

3241
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,760
it will separate

3242
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,360
your

3243
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:15,520
phycocyanin from your

3244
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:19,118
the spirulina and it'll also separate a

3245
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:21,360
lot of the auxins from the kelp which

3246
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:23,519
and along combining with the vitamin b

3247
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:26,559
gives you kind of three major groups of

3248
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,320
plant stimulant

3249
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,080
compounds that will dramatically

3250
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:32,079
increase both growth rate but help with

3251
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:34,238
recovery so if i have a plant that's

3252
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:36,559
been mauled by insects that's been run

3253
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:37,839
over by a lawn lawnmower that's been

3254
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,639
i don't know

3255
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,719
whatever you did didn't water it you you

3256
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:45,039
over watered it you whatever you did

3257
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:47,198
it's just it's hurting bad it's a great

3258
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:48,800
fix-it spray if you i've put it on

3259
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:51,118
plants that had pepper plants that had

3260
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:53,360
been watered in two and a half weeks the

3261
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,639
leaves were so dry they were crispy like

3262
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:57,039
paper

3263
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:59,760
and crumble to dust and we put it on it

3264
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:02,479
and we had new growth on every single

3265
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:06,239
leaf node within three days

3266
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:08,158
on dead stems wow so it does unreal

3267
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:09,839
stuff to plants we just recently last

3268
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:11,039
week had it on a

3269
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,960
cherry tree that was completely

3270
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:14,479
defoliated defoliated by japanese

3271
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,319
beetles and we had new growth on all the

3272
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:18,959
branches within five days

3273
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:21,198
of foliar application so it really just

3274
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,279
it wakes the plants up and says hey time

3275
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:25,039
to reboot you know let's get going again

3276
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:27,759
and let's let's just go fast and let's

3277
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:29,600
just crank it out so i wouldn't use it

3278
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,360
late in the flower never use labs full

3279
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,119
yearly in flower it can mess with the

3280
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:34,479
trichomes

3281
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:36,399
and and you know

3282
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:38,718
great for veg you can use it on the

3283
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:41,279
roots in flour do not ever use it on the

3284
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:43,279
trichome heads in flour

3285
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:44,639
what an absolute goldmine of knowledge

3286
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,319
right there i just got to quickly

3287
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:47,679
clarify because this is the question i

3288
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:49,920
probably get asked more than anything

3289
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,679
related to kind of what you just said

3290
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,600
we often hear the saying you know you

3291
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:55,520
don't want to generally speaking apply

3292
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,199
really any foliars during flower because

3293
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,199
it can mess with the trichomes as you

3294
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:00,799
said but then you'll often hear some

3295
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:02,399
people and i'll acknowledge sometimes i

3296
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,440
say it too it's like well you know if

3297
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:05,439
you don't have a lot of pistol

3298
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:06,960
production before week two i mean you

3299
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:08,559
could use it in the first week maybe the

3300
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,239
second do you feel like that's

3301
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:12,080
detrimental or would you say look you

3302
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:14,879
know at a certain point there's buds and

3303
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:17,198
that's when you're damaging it

3304
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,118
no the issue is not the pistols the

3305
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:20,479
issues the trichomes the lactobacillic

3306
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:22,479
acid has a negative impact on the

3307
01:49:20,479 --> 01:49:24,799
trichomes themselves and it will

3308
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:26,399
directly impact resin production that's

3309
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,760
it's a much bigger problem than just

3310
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:30,079
turning the pistols a different color

3311
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:32,480
like with the with the ph changes

3312
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:34,158
sure so just to clarify that point if

3313
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:36,000
someone was early enough in flower that

3314
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:37,839
there was no trichrone formation but

3315
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,479
they felt the plant really needed the

3316
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,400
fixes but you still you still have that

3317
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:44,158
pre that pre-trichome production you

3318
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:45,679
remember a lot of those trichome heads

3319
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,319
they're not developed yet but that

3320
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:50,000
head's still there the the initial cells

3321
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:52,158
are already present on the leaf tissue

3322
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,719
right so it just has to grow

3323
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:58,319
so so you're still damaging that site

3324
01:49:54,719 --> 01:50:00,880
yeah right so fantastic fantastic

3325
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:02,880
so the next question i wanted to ask i

3326
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,279
mean it's on the same topic when we're

3327
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:07,840
talking about knf it's a whole world we

3328
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:09,599
can explore in its own right a story a

3329
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,000
story which has always stuck with me

3330
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:13,520
which i believe i think i'm pulling this

3331
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,679
out of the libraries of my own memory

3332
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,440
here so forgive me if i'm wrong universe

3333
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:20,000
but i think i saw it on the australian

3334
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:21,759
weed growing subreddit and this person

3335
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,960
was saying they were doing an aquaponic

3336
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,560
cannabis system and they were using i

3337
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,560
can't remember the number maybe five

3338
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,000
maybe six different types of kelp and

3339
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,360
they were like if you use these

3340
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,599
different types of kelp you kind of

3341
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:35,039
cover most of the bases have you ever

3342
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:37,039
heard of anything like that and what

3343
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,760
sort of k f stuff do you like to

3344
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:40,800
implement into your aquaponics

3345
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,880
sure so

3346
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,719
so i think that part of that is coming

3347
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:48,319
from a lot of the aquaponic people will

3348
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:50,719
tell you that sea salt or

3349
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:52,799
just kelp in general is kind of the the

3350
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,800
mineral fix it for aquaponics like i

3351
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,719
don't know what mineral deficiency i

3352
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:58,960
have but if i put this random mix of

3353
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:02,079
trace minerals it'll probably fix it and

3354
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:03,279
it never does but that's the general you

3355
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:04,559
know with lettuce when you're dealing

3356
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:06,238
with the low levels of nutrient they

3357
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,400
need yeah it'll fix it most of the time

3358
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:10,559
the problem you have with cannabis is

3359
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:12,319
and this is the problem i see quite

3360
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,560
often with people that follow the

3361
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:17,439
direction with cannabis specifically

3362
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,880
is that what does kelp have a lot of has

3363
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:20,879
a lot of boron

3364
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,239
now what happens if i do a lot of boron

3365
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,079
in a closed system i'm going to get a

3366
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:25,439
build up of boron now what does boron

3367
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:27,519
start to displace it's also going to

3368
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:30,079
screw up my calcium uptake because the

3369
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,080
boron the calcium ratio is very

3370
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:33,760
finicky if i go too high on the boron i

3371
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:36,399
need to really up my calcium where my

3372
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,679
uptake is going to be all screwed up so

3373
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,439
um

3374
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,199
you end up with these really big

3375
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:43,359
imbalances between the boron and the

3376
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:45,759
calcium that that chemically starts

3377
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:47,118
screwing stuff up in their own right

3378
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,280
with the people that just kind of go

3379
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:52,319
balls to the wall with the kelp extract

3380
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:54,399
and or the the the the sea salt the

3381
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:56,000
dilutions which they and usually end up

3382
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:57,118
with sodium problems but that's a whole

3383
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,279
other issue

3384
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:00,880
but there's again there's a lot of and

3385
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:02,719
i'm working on it currently on a book

3386
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,719
called um aquaponics which will be

3387
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,800
aquaponic cannabis book that'll kind of

3388
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:08,560
have all all the stuff broken down all

3389
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,320
the different normal reference stuff

3390
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,679
that as far as minerals that people are

3391
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:13,439
going to want to use

3392
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:15,760
and and all you know what you can and

3393
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:17,439
can't use why you specifically shouldn't

3394
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,400
use certain things just because of all

3395
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:19,919
the different stuff that i've kind of

3396
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:21,519
figured out over the years

3397
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,719
because there isn't really a good source

3398
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,639
in all and that's one of the biggest

3399
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:26,079
problems is there is no really reservoir

3400
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:28,319
other than the podcast that we've put

3401
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:30,319
out that i put out there isn't really

3402
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:32,479
anything specific to aquaponic cannabis

3403
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:34,000
that really has any kind of you know

3404
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,839
weight behind it certainly nothing

3405
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,719
that's been been done on a commercial

3406
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,400
scale so it's it's hard you know i i i

3407
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,760
fully understand why someone coming into

3408
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:43,039
it just doesn't have a lot of reference

3409
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,280
to it because unless you've listened to

3410
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:46,960
the podcast or taken you know one of my

3411
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:49,279
classes you're really not going to know

3412
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:51,439
what ppm's your stuff should be at what

3413
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:52,960
you know what is going to kill your fish

3414
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:55,759
another great example would be yucca

3415
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,599
extract yucca extract or sapenin is

3416
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,760
often used as a wedding agent for both

3417
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:01,760
pest management products and for for

3418
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,840
root wrenches and stuff like that

3419
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,880
the problem is it's incredibly fish

3420
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:09,679
lethal it is so fish lethal that the

3421
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:14,239
indians the yurok indians among others

3422
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:17,199
and and the northern um uh california uh

3423
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:19,439
would collect a yucca roots and they'd

3424
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:21,359
squeeze the juice out of the roots and

3425
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:23,039
collect that juice as a concentrate and

3426
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:24,639
put it in vessels and they'd evaporate

3427
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:26,319
it off and make a even further

3428
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:27,840
concentrate out of it then they get a

3429
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:29,599
couple of guys with a couple of those

3430
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,279
vessels that go upstream about a mile

3431
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:33,760
wait for the salmon run pour it into the

3432
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:36,479
river and it would kill all the fish

3433
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,480
within about a quarter mile of the river

3434
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:40,718
but they'd have about half a mile a mile

3435
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,000
down they have the whole village waiting

3436
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:44,079
in the river

3437
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,399
so they collect all the fish as they

3438
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:48,079
float by and then they cook them off and

3439
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:49,920
it gets rid of the sapen and then they

3440
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,880
can eat them so but that was literally

3441
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:55,118
used as a method for for you know entire

3442
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,639
tribes to feed themselves for years so

3443
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,639
this is something that's well not only

3444
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,239
documented in western culture but this

3445
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,079
is documented going back

3446
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:05,198
10 000 years that you shouldn't use

3447
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:06,719
saping in around fish so

3448
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:07,759
yeah i mean it's funny you mentioned

3449
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,599
that because i remember when i was on

3450
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,199
your show i brought that up and you were

3451
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:12,480
very quick on the ball to be like up but

3452
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:14,799
if your necroponics guys don't use it

3453
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:16,238
but um yeah very valid point and just

3454
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,079
you know further i just wanted to say

3455
01:54:16,238 --> 01:54:20,000
you know we're all really grateful for

3456
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:21,198
the the archive of knowledge you've put

3457
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,800
out around aquaponics because you

3458
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:25,839
certainly hit it on the head there's no

3459
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:27,760
other resource quite like your show

3460
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:29,920
what you just said raises a really

3461
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,760
interesting point in terms of what do

3462
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,679
you feel it's important to supplement

3463
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,840
your aquaponics system with versus

3464
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:38,319
what's it important to not supplement it

3465
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,000
with which you might for example bring

3466
01:54:38,319 --> 01:54:41,920
over as a bad habit because you know you

3467
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,920
could you use me as an example i'm happy

3468
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,760
to do that you know i come from soil i

3469
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:48,800
might you know without your knowledge i

3470
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,560
might be like man saponins are amazing

3471
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,920
so yeah what's some good things to bring

3472
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,320
with you and what's some things you

3473
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,920
should probably leave behind

3474
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:58,319
i would say um

3475
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:00,800
number things to avoid would be one safe

3476
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:03,198
and in two brassicas as a companion

3477
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:06,239
plant i for some reason still see people

3478
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:08,238
suggest that and i do not understand why

3479
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:10,879
anything in the mustard family kills

3480
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:12,479
mycorrhizal fungi it releases something

3481
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,239
called lillipathy

3482
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:16,238
which is a

3483
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:18,479
loose term for chemicals that kill

3484
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:20,638
nearby anything else that's living it's

3485
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:22,718
used both for coral or for the roots of

3486
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:24,560
plants or for it it's used for a wide

3487
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:27,198
range of different things but basically

3488
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:29,760
the plants uh brassicas do not have

3489
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:32,079
associative mycorrhizal fungi about 85

3490
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,320
percent of the world's plants do they do

3491
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:36,158
not they actively kill associated

3492
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:38,799
mycorrhizal fungi because it inhibits

3493
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:40,399
their own growth so they will not help

3494
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,079
you um

3495
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:43,920
and there's something again that i still

3496
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:45,840
suggest i still see people suggesting i

3497
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,679
don't understand it

3498
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,520
another one that i've learned this this

3499
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:52,239
year in particular in oklahoma southern

3500
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:55,280
oklahoma is do not grow cilantro

3501
01:55:52,238 --> 01:55:58,879
anywhere remotely near anything outdoor

3502
01:55:55,279 --> 01:56:02,559
cilantro attracts aphids of every type

3503
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:04,800
it's just a magnet root aphids

3504
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,320
regular tree aphid

3505
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,079
uh

3506
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:09,439
you know cotton aphids

3507
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:11,599
i've seen

3508
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,439
entirely two we just all of it got

3509
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:14,960
trashed and just no nowhere near the

3510
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:17,039
grow and then i went to another

3511
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,118
vegetable grow and found an incredibly

3512
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:21,279
bad root aphid infection which i posted

3513
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:23,118
a couple pictures uh not too long ago on

3514
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:24,800
instagram of probably the worst root

3515
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:26,639
aphid infestation but that again

3516
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:29,119
thankfully wasn't not in a cannabis farm

3517
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,560
was it a vegetable farm but again if

3518
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:32,079
that wasn't a cannabis farm we'd

3519
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,400
probably have to burn the whole place

3520
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:36,000
like if it looked like that like i don't

3521
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:37,359
honestly know what i would tell the

3522
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,319
owner

3523
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:41,598
it was that bad that like vegetables

3524
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:43,279
people are a little more okay with

3525
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:45,039
trashing everything you know

3526
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:47,118
yeah look i was gonna say anyone who's

3527
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:48,960
ever had to fight aphids in the cannabis

3528
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:50,880
context when they see that photo you put

3529
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,560
up there's a visceral reaction to it

3530
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,880
it's just like you got punched in the

3531
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,719
stomach you're like oh no

3532
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,159
well i got i got a picture if you scroll

3533
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:00,480
down a little farther on my instagram i

3534
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:01,759
got pictures of bong aphids from a grow

3535
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:03,759
i was called to and they should have

3536
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:05,840
called me probably two two months before

3537
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,880
they actually called me over there

3538
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,119
and

3539
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:12,800
every single plant probably had a

3540
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:15,920
minimum of 15 000 aphids on it an entire

3541
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:18,000
100 by 30 greenhouse every single plant

3542
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,760
like there was as much weight of aphids

3543
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,118
as there was biomass a plant in that

3544
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:25,119
greenhouse

3545
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:26,000
man they growing biomass or insect frass

3546
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,000
you know

3547
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,399
you could ferment all of that and sell

3548
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,880
it as an ipm like we were talking about

3549
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:34,238
and and you know you could maybe recoup

3550
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:36,079
your carbs

3551
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:37,439
yeah gosh please guys just grow good

3552
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:38,880
weed

3553
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:41,598
yeah

3554
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,279
so for me i think the logical next

3555
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:45,199
question is

3556
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:47,118
would you be able to give us a basic

3557
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:49,919
rundown on how someone might be able to

3558
01:57:47,118 --> 01:57:51,198
go up setting about a relatively simple

3559
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,039
setup at their home if they're

3560
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:54,719
interested in getting into aquaponics or

3561
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:57,198
would you advise that unless you're

3562
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:59,039
really ready to jump in there might not

3563
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:00,960
be a sort of get your toes wet option

3564
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:02,880
per se

3565
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,239
sure i would just say you know set up

3566
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,239
your system like you're gonna do for a

3567
01:58:04,238 --> 01:58:08,718
flood and drain cocoa

3568
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:10,879
setup and then instead of doing cocoa do

3569
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:12,800
do root zone pots flood and drain and

3570
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:14,239
you know cut your stand pipe to to four

3571
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,920
or five inches and just flood and drain

3572
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:18,799
the bottom half instead

3573
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:20,719
and then top feed with your upper half

3574
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,320
with either automated like we do on a

3575
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,000
large scale or you know hand if you're

3576
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:26,158
just doing a couple of plants at home

3577
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,319
and and you'll have a hell of a lot more

3578
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:30,000
control you'll have a lot better flavor

3579
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:31,198
on your plants and and again you're not

3580
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,479
going to have to do a lot of adapting

3581
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:33,678
you're going to you know you could

3582
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:35,359
absolutely do this if you don't even

3583
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:37,039
want to deal with the with the fish you

3584
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:38,559
can do hydro dual root zone and you'll

3585
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:40,399
still get an incredible increase in

3586
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,159
impact and i think you you anyone that

3587
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:43,920
even does this with a hydro dual root

3588
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:46,238
zone will notice immediate difference in

3589
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:49,440
flavor against any side by side

3590
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:51,439
yeah amazing and for someone who might

3591
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:53,919
exist like myself in a little bit of a

3592
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:55,598
more warmer country most of the year do

3593
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,118
you think that that is quite problematic

3594
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:59,199
because i think i've heard someone say

3595
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:00,719
that you know like in australia during

3596
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:02,879
peak summer you're going to really

3597
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:04,560
struggle to keep the fish alive because

3598
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,400
it gets really hot is that just

3599
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,080
something i've missed heard or do you

3600
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:09,759
feel like it's not particularly any more

3601
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:11,039
challenging

3602
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:12,159
no i mean i don't think that you're

3603
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:14,479
going to have any more challenges than

3604
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:16,079
we do here in oklahoma i mean frankly

3605
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:18,238
we're getting you know you guys have

3606
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:20,238
very similar summer peak summertime

3607
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:21,919
temperatures if anything we might even

3608
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:23,598
top out a few degrees higher than you

3609
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:25,279
guys fahrenheit wise so

3610
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:26,560
um you know if we can do it here i don't

3611
01:59:25,279 --> 01:59:28,479
understand why you guys can do that i

3612
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,159
would say that in australia in

3613
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:32,319
particular i'd be much more concerned

3614
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:34,559
about doing geothermal cooling both for

3615
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:36,960
your water and for your air uh i you

3616
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,320
know the the impact of pulling that cold

3617
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:40,158
air out of the ground is going to make

3618
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:41,679
it you know much much cheaper in terms

3619
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:42,719
of cost effectiveness for climate

3620
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:44,319
control

3621
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:46,239
and again with the thermal mass you have

3622
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:48,319
with the water you can run coils in the

3623
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:50,238
ground like we do here in oklahoma where

3624
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:52,000
we run coils in the water and then run

3625
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:54,000
them underground just to wick the heat

3626
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,520
off and the water sucks the heat in and

3627
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,279
we can actually pull air temperature

3628
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,960
degrees off of it by sucking it into the

3629
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:01,279
water using the thermal mass of the

3630
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,960
water as a battery basically to suck

3631
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:04,238
temperatures off and then bleed that off

3632
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:06,239
underground

3633
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:07,759
and we can again turning that off

3634
02:00:06,238 --> 02:00:09,439
increases the temperature in the

3635
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:11,039
greenhouse i was just at about you know

3636
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:13,519
two and a half degrees

3637
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:15,118
so yeah that's very nice yeah that's

3638
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,360
that's not trivial that's a good amount

3639
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:18,960
of heat reduction for sure

3640
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:20,639
especially we're talking about btus on

3641
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:22,560
an ac unit

3642
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:24,319
yeah when you're chomping through power

3643
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,400
i feel you

3644
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:27,118
so the next question that came up for me

3645
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:30,000
is

3646
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:30,799
in australia tilapia is actually illegal

3647
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,880
so

3648
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,320
what sort of fish would you recommend

3649
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:36,319
that might go well in one of these

3650
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:38,079
systems across the board and then maybe

3651
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:40,960
a specific one for australia seeing as

3652
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:42,960
unfortunately tilapia is out

3653
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,719
sure so across the board i would say

3654
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,399
anyone getting started

3655
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,599
you know depending on your tank size but

3656
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:49,839
assuming you aren't going anything

3657
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:51,440
incredibly small go with coir or

3658
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:53,360
goldfish because they're really

3659
02:00:51,439 --> 02:00:54,638
bulletproof they'll tolerate all kinds

3660
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,000
of stupid things that you might

3661
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:58,079
accidentally do

3662
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,840
and uh you know they have a good resale

3663
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:01,599
value you can almost always unload

3664
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,520
decent sized ones for people for their

3665
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:04,880
pawns you know i mean regardless of what

3666
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:07,040
country you're in

3667
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:08,480
especially butterfly koi butterfly koi

3668
02:01:07,039 --> 02:01:10,880
are easily you know you're going to

3669
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,638
increase them exponentially per per you

3670
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:14,800
know every inch that you add them you're

3671
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:16,319
adding you know anywhere from five to

3672
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,880
forty dollars u.s

3673
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:20,880
uh per inch so uh depending on how big

3674
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:22,480
they already are so you're talking quite

3675
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,920
a bit of money so if we're talking about

3676
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:26,079
cannabis production

3677
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,239
we don't generally care about feeding

3678
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:29,920
people i mean we do in terms of

3679
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:31,279
community outreach but

3680
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,520
most cannabis companies just want to

3681
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:35,599
turn as much profit as humanly possible

3682
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:37,440
right in terms of business model so if

3683
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:39,440
that's your goal with your business

3684
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:40,638
model going with butterfly koi or

3685
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:42,960
something that really is going to be

3686
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:44,560
your long-term best bet or with tropical

3687
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:47,920
fish that you can again turn around and

3688
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:50,080
resell arowanas arapaima

3689
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,480
other large fish that people have a hard

3690
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:55,118
time raising in large tanks that you

3691
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:56,479
happen to have a whole bunch of that's

3692
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:58,158
easy for you to do at the scale that

3693
02:01:56,479 --> 02:01:59,678
you're operating at

3694
02:01:58,158 --> 02:02:01,039
can be a really really great option

3695
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:03,279
financially

3696
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:06,639
for australia specifically

3697
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:08,238
murray cod or jade perch both will work

3698
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:10,319
very well um

3699
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:12,479
uh you know

3700
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:12,479
jay

3701
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:17,280
murray cod i believe will also go into

3702
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,359
brackish water or the jade perk i know

3703
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:20,880
correct me unfortunately i'm not the

3704
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:23,039
authority

3705
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,960
yeah so so those guys i would say be

3706
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:26,960
careful of anything generally that goes

3707
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:30,000
from salt water to fresh water they tend

3708
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:32,639
to absorb potassium at a higher rate

3709
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,479
salmonids in particular uh unless you're

3710
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:36,719
doing decoupled systems which i don't

3711
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:38,799
recommend um

3712
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:41,198
because it adds a whole other layer of

3713
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:43,360
complexity to your chemistry and just it

3714
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:45,198
adds money it adds cost to your run as

3715
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:47,519
well which is pointless you know we're

3716
02:02:45,198 --> 02:02:49,439
trying to cut the cost down not adam um

3717
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:51,520
but unless you're doing that

3718
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:53,118
salmon ends are just not an option um

3719
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,960
again for the same reason because that

3720
02:02:53,118 --> 02:02:56,960
mechanism that ingests salinity also

3721
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,118
affects potassium uptake and

3722
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:01,279
chemically with the fish

3723
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:02,479
yeah and the potassium levels that we're

3724
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:04,079
running with cannabis will kill the fish

3725
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:05,198
basically they'll have heart heart

3726
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:07,920
issues

3727
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:11,598
yeah yeah wow that's pretty serious

3728
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:13,359
so i guess to for me to wrap up this

3729
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:15,840
little segment quickly i just want to

3730
02:03:13,359 --> 02:03:17,439
know do you always grow aquaponically or

3731
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,639
is every now and again you're like ah

3732
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:21,439
you know i don't have a pump on here

3733
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:23,599
just do some soil

3734
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:26,000
so i i always prefer to do aquaponics

3735
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,560
but i i still do living soil i'm a

3736
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,319
i love uh we spoke about them earlier

3737
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:32,080
but i love dragonfly earth medicine and

3738
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:35,039
the whole living soil and and

3739
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:37,198
sustainability and ferments and moving

3740
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:38,960
into you know trying to to develop as

3741
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:41,759
many possible nutrient sources as

3742
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:43,118
possible without outside sources and

3743
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:45,360
that's some of the stuff i'm working on

3744
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:47,279
in the book as well is is what nutrients

3745
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:49,359
and ferments from k nf can i take and

3746
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:52,158
what inputs can i take in ferment and

3747
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,279
add to my aquaponics system to replace

3748
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:54,638
those minerals kind of like you're

3749
02:03:53,279 --> 02:03:56,000
talking about with iron and other things

3750
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:57,840
irons a particularly difficult one

3751
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,359
because of oxidation but a lot of the

3752
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:01,840
other ones can absolutely be heavily

3753
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:04,319
supplemented one that's often uh just to

3754
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:07,760
circle back to silica again uh silicas

3755
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:07,759
often people say ferment

3756
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:12,719
horsetail which is a a very common plant

3757
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:14,000
worldwide i believe i believe you guys

3758
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:16,800
even have that in australia if memory

3759
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,800
serves me correctly

3760
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:20,879
the downside with that is it has a

3761
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:22,479
compound and it actually affects vitamin

3762
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:24,800
b uptake

3763
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:26,959
which is going to slow my growth rate

3764
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,719
yeah now you know what has even more

3765
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,158
silica actually four times as much

3766
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:32,239
silica

3767
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:33,839
stinging nettle and everyone loves the

3768
02:04:32,238 --> 02:04:35,359
ferments thinking that all ready for the

3769
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,319
garden so if you're actually looking for

3770
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:38,880
silica

3771
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:40,960
forget the tail horsetail can also

3772
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,639
heavily accumulate trace metals

3773
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,639
including heavy metals which can cause

3774
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:46,719
you to fail for your testing so if

3775
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:48,880
you're in california you could actually

3776
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:50,319
ferment horsetail and cause yourself to

3777
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,159
fail your heavy metal testing by

3778
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:53,439
accident whereas if you go with the

3779
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:54,799
stinging nettle you're going to avoid

3780
02:04:53,439 --> 02:04:56,399
those issues because it doesn't tend to

3781
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:58,800
accumulate the heavy metals at the same

3782
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:00,238
high rate and it'll also add you know

3783
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,599
even more silica than the horsetail

3784
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:03,359
wheel so again it's just one of those

3785
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,800
things where once you start looking at

3786
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:06,639
some of the numbers on some of these

3787
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,000
ferments and and the breakdowns when you

3788
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:09,440
actually test them you realize some of

3789
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,880
this stuff is actually

3790
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:12,319
not what we thought it was and there's

3791
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,000
actually much better options that we're

3792
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:15,198
already using as part of our regimens

3793
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,960
that are actually supplying these other

3794
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:19,039
minerals at a much better rate that we

3795
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:21,520
just didn't realize

3796
02:05:19,039 --> 02:05:23,039
yeah wow still so much to be learned i

3797
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,119
guess

3798
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:26,800
um the a question i wanted to ask is

3799
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:30,078
just a really quick one

3800
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:31,760
can you use the the ward from aquaponics

3801
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:33,679
does it like can you use it as like a

3802
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,119
rooting stimulating agent or do you

3803
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:36,880
still use something else to kind of

3804
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:38,880
clone

3805
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,880
oh absolutely in fact i i've had an

3806
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,359
immense research built mainly with

3807
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:45,279
aeroponic growing but also with with

3808
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:47,519
just plug growing with aquaponics and

3809
02:05:45,279 --> 02:05:49,599
media beds as well with accelerated

3810
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,440
growth rate with the roots as well uh

3811
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:53,520
particularly with moringa trees we were

3812
02:05:51,439 --> 02:05:56,638
able to root moringa trees within you

3813
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:57,920
know 14 to 20 days and we're talking

3814
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,840
trees

3815
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,239
but with cannabis there's quite a few

3816
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,400
not only my own research but there's a

3817
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:06,799
uh

3818
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:09,198
what's the name of the company fish [ __ ]

3819
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:10,320
and then the other one's called poof or

3820
02:06:09,198 --> 02:06:12,000
poom

3821
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:14,000
uh there's a new company i just found

3822
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,198
out about the last last week or so that

3823
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
has another

3824
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:20,399
fish waste based cloning product and and

3825
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,319
both of them are based on fish waste

3826
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:25,198
or fermented fish waste or dried fish

3827
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:27,279
waste or shelf stabilized fish waste uh

3828
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:28,960
for cloning and all of their research as

3829
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:30,960
well for their both of their independent

3830
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,800
companies also backs up my own data on

3831
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,480
the accelerated growth rate from the

3832
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,960
fish waste as well so that again that

3833
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:39,039
increase in microbiological activity

3834
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,439
from those mineral sources really seems

3835
02:06:39,039 --> 02:06:43,198
to make a marked increase in um

3836
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:44,799
and rooting rate and reduction in

3837
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:47,039
rooting time

3838
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:48,480
yeah i kind of suspect it as much so

3839
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:50,960
that's that's lovely to hear that that

3840
02:06:48,479 --> 02:06:52,078
is the case but but we found that you

3841
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:53,520
know results with everything from

3842
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:55,759
cannabis all the way to moringa trees

3843
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:58,239
moringa's in jamaica we were doing a ton

3844
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:59,840
of moringa cloning because moringa is a

3845
02:06:58,238 --> 02:07:01,598
[ __ ] to germinate

3846
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,440
if you plant 10 seeds two of them will

3847
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:05,279
germinate right but you can clone the

3848
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:06,879
living crap out of it it clones pretty

3849
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:09,118
well if you just cut it and stick it in

3850
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:11,199
a media bed and let it flood and drain

3851
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:12,799
for three two three weeks and you know

3852
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:14,078
pull it out and you've got a tree you

3853
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:16,000
can plant in the ground and away you go

3854
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:18,238
you can plant the whole forest you know

3855
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,238
pretty quickly that way so uh these are

3856
02:07:18,238 --> 02:07:22,479
all methods that that you can do and uh

3857
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:23,279
you know very rapidly uh scale up and

3858
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:25,759
that was one of the things that we

3859
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:27,519
worked with the rastafarian group in in

3860
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:29,440
kingston and nayabingy was was helping

3861
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:30,880
them get some of that stuff going uh

3862
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:31,919
um i don't know what they're doing with

3863
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:33,199
it now but that was one of the things

3864
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:34,639
that they're doing as the main export

3865
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:35,759
was grinding up moringa leaves and

3866
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:37,440
trying to figure out how to increase

3867
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:40,800
their production

3868
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:42,799
yeah great info great info so

3869
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,079
one of the last topics i wanted to spend

3870
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,920
some time chatting about with you

3871
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:47,840
because i know that i mean it's it's

3872
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,239
obvious by just listening to the podcast

3873
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,800
thus far is you've got such an extensive

3874
02:07:50,238 --> 02:07:54,399
knowledge on ipm i was hoping to pick

3875
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:57,199
your mind a little bit about that and i

3876
02:07:54,399 --> 02:07:59,839
guess my first kind of question would be

3877
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:01,678
are there any common ipm treatments that

3878
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,520
you think people have kind of got it

3879
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:05,279
wrong and they should maybe stay away

3880
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,920
from and like i mean something we've

3881
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:10,800
already spoken about um saponins you

3882
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:13,199
know i've seen people use them as an ipm

3883
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:16,000
folia spray before would you be willing

3884
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:18,078
to do that if it was say living soil or

3885
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,158
what would you use as your first port of

3886
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:21,439
call as a general sort of spray to fight

3887
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:23,920
off some bugs

3888
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:26,479
well as far as general sprays for bugs

3889
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,158
my first go-to just as a regular general

3890
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,638
spray if we're not talking about

3891
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:32,319
off-the-shelf stuff would be the ipm imo

3892
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:34,880
that we talked about that we're doing in

3893
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:37,118
africa for off the shelf stuff if i had

3894
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:39,279
to pick a single product that worked on

3895
02:08:37,118 --> 02:08:40,960
the widest range of stuff it'd probably

3896
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,599
be a product called kapow which is

3897
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:45,118
lemongrass oil and castor oil

3898
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:47,679
i've had it work on everything from

3899
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:50,158
white flies to spider mites to powdery

3900
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:52,000
mildew and everything in between um so

3901
02:08:50,158 --> 02:08:54,479
as far as a shotgun blast that's gonna

3902
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,319
just hit everything and it's gonna not

3903
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:58,479
really negatively impact your plant or

3904
02:08:56,319 --> 02:09:01,359
its flavor that you can also use well

3905
02:08:58,479 --> 02:09:03,118
into flour when diluted uh it is the

3906
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:05,839
best as far as

3907
02:09:03,118 --> 02:09:08,479
doing all of those things simultaneously

3908
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,560
if we're talking about single sprays for

3909
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:12,879
mold it would be probably a product

3910
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,960
called sonata which is a bactillus

3911
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,279
pamilis which i found is the hands down

3912
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,039
best product for mold of any type and

3913
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:21,198
any type of indoor grow

3914
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:23,039
i've had the chance to work on it seems

3915
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:24,000
to knock back damn near anything i throw

3916
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:26,000
it at

3917
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,000
um and it's you know it's bactilus

3918
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,078
pamilis it's nothing crazy it's nothing

3919
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,319
toxic i don't have to worry about i mean

3920
02:09:30,078 --> 02:09:34,639
yes you have to wear your ppe just for

3921
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:36,559
compliance reasons but realistically

3922
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:38,319
it's not going to hurt you in any way

3923
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,360
um you know it's not like a chemical

3924
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:41,439
spray or something like that where i

3925
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:42,799
have to worry about my nervous system or

3926
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:44,960
some other issue that's going to be

3927
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:46,639
affected right it's just a bacteria

3928
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:48,880
right it's no big deal

3929
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:51,279
and then as far as insects beneficial

3930
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:53,840
insects i would have to go with

3931
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:56,078
uh lace swings and aureus

3932
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:58,400
hands down the those guys are and

3933
02:09:56,078 --> 02:09:59,118
nematodes uh you know they're kind of

3934
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:01,198
the

3935
02:09:59,118 --> 02:10:03,279
the pillars of any ipm that i'm going to

3936
02:10:01,198 --> 02:10:04,399
do off the bat and then we'll kind of go

3937
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:06,078
into

3938
02:10:04,399 --> 02:10:07,118
depending on climate really it's going

3939
02:10:06,078 --> 02:10:09,118
to change

3940
02:10:07,118 --> 02:10:10,399
around that more than anything else you

3941
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:11,679
know what what are the temperature

3942
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:13,279
ranges that we're going to do with an

3943
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:17,039
average day and that in that growth

3944
02:10:13,279 --> 02:10:18,719
cycle and like right now in oklahoma

3945
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:20,000
our current regimen that we're doing for

3946
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:21,520
pretty much everything outdoor and

3947
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,279
anything in greenhouse

3948
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,520
is radically different than anything i

3949
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:27,920
would ever do indoor because it's all

3950
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:28,960
stuff that can tolerate 95 degrees or

3951
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:30,800
higher

3952
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:33,520
you know what i mean that's not a whole

3953
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:36,480
lot of insects that's your assassin bugs

3954
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:38,079
your californicus your aureus

3955
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:39,519
and your rove beetles and that's about

3956
02:10:38,078 --> 02:10:41,118
it there's not a whole lot else that's

3957
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:42,880
going to live past that you know once

3958
02:10:41,118 --> 02:10:44,799
you get above 100 fahrenheit fahrenheit

3959
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,760
there's not a lot of insects are going

3960
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:48,079
to

3961
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:50,320
thrive in that environment

3962
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:51,920
yeah what what great information and i

3963
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:53,439
guess it does highlight you know it's

3964
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,399
hard to give these generalized answers

3965
02:10:53,439 --> 02:10:56,799
sometimes you've got to be a bit

3966
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:58,559
specific i know that you do a lot of

3967
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:01,440
consulting work for a variety of people

3968
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,719
especially for specifically ipm what

3969
02:11:01,439 --> 02:11:04,319
types of things do you find you're

3970
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:07,520
normally getting called in for and what

3971
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:09,599
are often the challenges you face

3972
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:11,360
um i would say number one people that

3973
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:13,039
don't realize the the mineral

3974
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:15,679
deficiencies they currently have going

3975
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:18,399
on at the farm um i've gone to grows

3976
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:20,000
where their head grower didn't know

3977
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:21,598
that they needed to balance the ph the

3978
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,679
nutrient solution

3979
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:24,480
and they had been there for quite a few

3980
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:26,560
months

3981
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:27,919
and had balked their way into the job

3982
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:30,400
somehow

3983
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:33,599
i've been into a grow where i watched a

3984
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:35,198
head grower transfer stuff into a room

3985
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:36,960
that had an ungodly amount of money

3986
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:39,759
worth of plants into it

3987
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:40,719
and then not prune off the damaged

3988
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:42,880
leaves

3989
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:44,239
and then immediately didn't even know

3990
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:45,599
that he had an affection because he

3991
02:11:44,238 --> 02:11:47,759
sprayed all this stuff and thought it

3992
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:48,960
was just done and thought it didn't even

3993
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,960
realize it because he didn't know he was

3994
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:52,560
supposed to prune off like just all

3995
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:53,920
kinds of just a lot of just like

3996
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:55,920
rudimentary stuff like people that

3997
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:58,319
pulled someone that had done like a tent

3998
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:00,639
grow and then put them in charge of an

3999
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,559
acreage or you know multi thousand

4000
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:04,639
square foot facilities it's like look

4001
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:06,480
don't do that grab someone that did cut

4002
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:08,800
flowers grab someone that did pansies

4003
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:11,279
grab someone that did geraniums you know

4004
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:14,880
who cares like just any amount of scaled

4005
02:12:11,279 --> 02:12:16,960
agricultural experience like at all

4006
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,560
um uh really what makes a big deal you

4007
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:21,279
know if someone just you know even

4008
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:23,119
growing beans for you know that's fine

4009
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:24,399
like i'll take that or you know the

4010
02:12:23,118 --> 02:12:26,479
other thing that i noticed is people

4011
02:12:24,399 --> 02:12:28,158
that from the military are really easy

4012
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:29,359
to work with veterans

4013
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:32,638
great man because they're used to

4014
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:34,799
procedures slps all that stuff they're

4015
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:36,400
used to regiment that you know the the

4016
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,840
it has to be done this way and it can't

4017
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:39,198
be done a different way

4018
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:40,800
and they don't think for themselves they

4019
02:12:39,198 --> 02:12:42,638
do what the directions say oh you know

4020
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,679
they do to the point where it's helpful

4021
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,639
and not to the point where it's a

4022
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:48,078
hindrance um uh uh you know i i've been

4023
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:49,920
some of the easiest people we you know

4024
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:52,158
we often love to hire veterans for that

4025
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:54,560
reason also a lot of the veterans are

4026
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,238
legally able to have firearms in states

4027
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:58,239
that you know you're also allowed to

4028
02:12:56,238 --> 02:13:00,319
have them you know under premises with a

4029
02:12:58,238 --> 02:13:03,118
license so they're also a great way to

4030
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:05,118
hire veterans for easy jobs as far as uh

4031
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:07,198
you know a high-paying job they don't

4032
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:08,559
have to do a whole lot uh and support

4033
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:11,118
people that maybe need a little extra

4034
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:12,880
help in society uh you know a lot of

4035
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,399
countries have have a hard time finding

4036
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,000
jobs for some of their veterans and it's

4037
02:13:14,399 --> 02:13:17,920
a great way for our community to support

4038
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,039
again we've talked about multiple ways

4039
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:21,359
that we can support our community it's

4040
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:23,679
just one more way that we can do that

4041
02:13:21,359 --> 02:13:25,279
yeah definitely it's a really lovely

4042
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:27,199
sentiment there to try to help out

4043
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:28,960
people who maybe need a little extra

4044
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:30,799
help and have certainly helped out

4045
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,920
others throughout their life in one way

4046
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,800
or another

4047
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,480
so

4048
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,000
something i would not only that you know

4049
02:13:34,479 --> 02:13:37,919
if you think about what's the number one

4050
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,880
enemy of our industry

4051
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:42,960
education or lack thereof and so so by

4052
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:45,520
by just providing good things in the

4053
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,439
community it opens people up to the idea

4054
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,599
of educating themselves about our

4055
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:51,279
industry i don't have to go out of my

4056
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:53,279
way to convert them they will convert

4057
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:54,158
themselves

4058
02:13:53,279 --> 02:13:56,479
yeah

4059
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:57,598
that's that's awesome isn't it

4060
02:13:56,479 --> 02:13:59,678
so

4061
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:02,639
you know kind of related to this topic

4062
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:05,520
we've seen that there's been a rise in

4063
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:07,599
educational sort of events platforms we

4064
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:10,079
saw last year there was a whole range of

4065
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:11,679
regenerative cannabis symposiums and you

4066
02:14:10,078 --> 02:14:14,078
even mentioned yourself you're now doing

4067
02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:15,599
aquaponic classes which is fantastic and

4068
02:14:14,078 --> 02:14:16,960
people should certainly jump on top of

4069
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,440
that if they want to get the inside

4070
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:22,000
scoop on how to do it all do you predict

4071
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:23,678
these will be more common going forward

4072
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,760
and what's your hopes for the sort of

4073
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:27,760
educational classes that you're involved

4074
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:29,520
in

4075
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:32,639
sure so i've been teaching educational

4076
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:34,159
classes since 2013 um both on vegetable

4077
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:35,599
side of things and on the cannabis side

4078
02:14:34,158 --> 02:14:37,519
of things depending on who i was

4079
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:39,840
teaching for as well as medicinal herbs

4080
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:42,000
i'm a passionate herbalist as well as a

4081
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:43,360
mushroom picker i love to pick

4082
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,560
all different types of wild mushrooms i

4083
02:14:43,359 --> 02:14:46,559
used to teach foraging classes in

4084
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:48,000
colorado anyone the the pleasure of

4085
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:49,520
going up with me uh

4086
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,599
almost everywhere to come with at least

4087
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,679
a grocery bag full of food

4088
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:55,279
so uh and it's sustainably you know we

4089
02:14:53,679 --> 02:14:56,480
weren't out there taking everything out

4090
02:14:55,279 --> 02:14:58,559
there either you know we're taking no

4091
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:00,879
more than 30 or 40 of what was out there

4092
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:02,560
so still leaving some behind it to be

4093
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,078
there for the next generation so

4094
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:05,280
something i'm very passionate about but

4095
02:15:04,078 --> 02:15:08,158
um

4096
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:10,639
um uh we marty and i as the gentleman i

4097
02:15:08,158 --> 02:15:12,399
do my podcast with we have a long format

4098
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:14,400
commercial aquaponic cannabis class that

4099
02:15:12,399 --> 02:15:16,078
we'll be releasing later this year um

4100
02:15:14,399 --> 02:15:17,198
we've been teaching a version i've been

4101
02:15:16,078 --> 02:15:19,198
teaching a version of that class since

4102
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:21,118
2013. um

4103
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:22,799
we've since turned it from a two-day

4104
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:25,118
class into a four-day commercial class

4105
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:27,360
and then now into a week-long

4106
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:28,799
intensive course that we have filmed at

4107
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:30,559
a whole bunch of different locations

4108
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:32,480
with a whole bunch of different chopped

had or you know maybe we can show you an

4112
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:38,639
example of somebody that screwed up real

4113

bad and maybe i just don't tell you

4114
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:41,840
where it is right so uh you know we

4115
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,520
could show you a bunch of stuff that

4116
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:45,199
maybe i just couldn't show you in a live

4117
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,440
class right or an example of something

4118
02:15:45,198 --> 02:15:49,198
that i just i had to be taken right then

4119

and there and we just shot us some some

4120
02:15:49,198 --> 02:15:52,638

they want to learn more about just

4155
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:05,039
general aquaponics and they want

4156

something that's really an incredible

4157

4162
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:18,000
i don't always agree with anybody 100 of

4163
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:19,519
the time but he uh he has uh probably

4164
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,040
the single best book out there in terms

4165
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:23,599
of system design

4166
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:25,760
um that's that's currently on the market

4167
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:27,280
we have roger terry from true aquaponics

4168
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:29,359
he's a wonderful gentleman that i will

4169
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:30,960
also work with on nutrient subscriptions

4170
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:32,239
if you have an aquaponics system or

4171
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:34,638
you're interested in getting a system up

4172
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:36,879
and running he's a great place to get

4173
02:17:34,638 --> 02:17:38,318
nutrients from or we can get you set up

4174
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:39,839
with a subscription service we do

4175
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:41,679
provide a subscription service that we

4176
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:44,239
test your nutrients for you and provide

4177
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:46,638
you custom custom nutrient solutions for

4178
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:48,638
your aquaponic or hydroponic system

4179
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:51,518
based on your current nutrient values

4180
02:17:48,638 --> 02:17:53,839
not based on some you know part 8 par b

4181
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:56,880
solution so we can dial that nutrient

4182
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:59,040
within you know a very small range to

4183
02:17:56,879 --> 02:18:00,638
specifically boost you know heavy

4184
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,080

blooms the gentleman who puts on the

4221
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:12,159
regenerative cannabis conference he's an

4222
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:13,920
awesome guy he's going to be talking

4223
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:15,679
about large-scale integration between

4224
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:18,478
aquaponics and soil production and how

4225
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:20,239
to utilize aquaponics or mineralization

4226
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:22,318
from aquaponics to further benefit

4227
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:23,840
large-scale soil production and we have

4228
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:24,718
uh even more speakers that we haven't

4229
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:26,960
announced yet that we're going to

4230
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:28,239
trickle out um to you know release a

4231
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:30,318
little bit more hype as we get a little

4232
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:31,599
bit closer to the event

4233
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:33,039
i don't know how you could get any more

4234
02:19:31,599 --> 02:19:35,599
hype because that's got to be one of the

4235
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:38,000
most well-rounded list of speakers i've

4236
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:40,558
ever heard and i'd like to give a little

4237
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:42,638
shout out to our buddy josh he's uh he's

4239
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:45,759
doing a lot to try to help promote

4240
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
education in the scene and i think we

4241
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:49,520
all value that greatly

4242
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,200
it goes without saying guys you got to

4243
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:52,800

4244
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,880
sold listening to that i don't know what

4245
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:56,398
you need at this point

4246
02:19:54,879 --> 02:19:57,679
the best part is it's free we're just

4247
02:19:56,398 --> 02:20:00,478
going to host it on youtube and we'll

4248
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:01,520
have free product giveaways

4249
02:20:00,478 --> 02:20:03,358
you know

4250
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,280
with the virtual stuff it doesn't you

4251
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:06,880
know normally with a conference it costs

4252
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:09,439
money to put the conference on you have

4253
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:10,879
to rent the event i have to rent chairs

4254
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:12,239
you have to rent you know all the

4255
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:14,318
different things you have to get hotel

4256
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:15,520
rooms you have to you know it gets quite

4257
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:17,199
a few

4258
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:18,720
people don't realize how expensive it

4259
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:20,479
can be to put on a conference it can be

4260
02:20:18,719 --> 02:20:22,719
incredibly expensive and if you don't

4261
02:20:20,478 --> 02:20:24,799
have the funds to do that it can be

4262
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:26,000
really hard to do so by having a virtual

4263
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:27,920
conference we don't really have a whole

4264
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,120
lot of overhead to do that so what we're

4265
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:32,159
going to do is we have a bunch of

4266
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:34,880
company sponsors people like recharge

4267
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:37,439
true aquaponics grow more a couple of

4268
02:20:34,879 --> 02:20:38,959
other guys that are out there um

4269
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:40,880
what's the name there's another company

4270
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:42,239
that does a fermented comfrey and some

4271
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:43,759
other stuff

4272
02:20:42,239 --> 02:20:45,600
that all going to be donating products

4273
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:46,639
that we'll have out there during the the

4274
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,120
event

4275
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:51,039
and that are all aquaponic safe or are

4276
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:53,040
or fish-based um we're talking a couple

4277
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:55,040
other people right now uh that we'll

4278
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:56,720
have out there and and donate those as

4279
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:59,040
well and just kind of promote the whole

4280
02:20:56,719 --> 02:21:00,639
education around aquaponic cannabis and

4281
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,920
just sustainable can not even just

4282
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:03,439
aquaponics but we'll be talking about

4283
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:05,120
how you can utilize some of this

4284
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:06,479
methodology in your soil growing we

4285
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:08,560
understand that

4286
02:21:06,478 --> 02:21:10,318
70 80 90 of people that are watching

4287
02:21:08,559 --> 02:21:11,680
this probably aren't doing aquaponics

4288
02:21:10,318 --> 02:21:13,199
and we're going to make sure that you're

4289
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:14,800
you know you're still gaining a

4290
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:16,399
knowledge and things that you can take

4291
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:19,039
away and apply to your soil grow that

4292
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:21,039
that maybe you hadn't learned before

4293
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:23,280
and there you have it guys you are now

4294
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:24,880
obliged to watch it's free what more do

4295
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:26,239
you need and i think that comfrey

4296
02:21:24,879 --> 02:21:28,000
company you mentioned might be casual

4297
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:29,280
fields shout out to him he's a really

4298
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,719
really nice guy

4299
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,200
great product by the way it's also

4300
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:36,478
aquaponics safe and a wonderful product

4301
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,920
yeah yeah he's another lovely guy um one

4302
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:39,199
of the final things i wanted to quickly

4303
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:41,760
ask you about before we get into the

4304
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:44,000
quickfire questions you put up a post

4305
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,079
which just blew my mind and struck my

4306
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
curiosity like nothing else when you did

4307
02:21:46,079 --> 02:21:50,959
an episode recently on your show with

4308
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:53,680
kevin mckernan about how covert 19 was

4309
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:55,839
found in cannabis tissue i mean this is

4310
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:57,600
just wild you know i guess the question

4311
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,920
is what implications do you think this

4312
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,120
has like i the thing that jumped to mind

4313
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:02,639
for me is it's like do you need to be

4314
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:04,399
worried about getting covered 19 from

4315
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:06,398
your plant

4316
02:22:04,398 --> 02:22:09,439
so so he

4317
02:22:06,398 --> 02:22:10,318
so okay so to clarify something on that

4318
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:12,239
and this is something that i

4319
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:14,559
misunderstood when when i read that

4320
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:16,799
paper and i read it twice before i even

4321
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:19,519
interviewed him on that um he developed

4322
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:21,840
an allele to test for the presence of of

4323
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:23,760
of covid19 so if you had an employee

4324
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:25,920
that sneezed on the plant or coughed on

4325
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:27,680
the plant or if i'm at a cannabis

4326
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:30,239
dispensary and we allow patients to

4327
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:31,120
smell the cannabis before they purchase

4328
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:33,039
it

4329
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:34,479
is there a way to test for that using a

4330
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:36,240
qpcr

4331
02:22:34,478 --> 02:22:37,679
and then what type of tests do you have

4332
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:39,280
to have what type of standard do you

4333
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:41,840
have to have so he developed all that

4334
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:43,040
but what he did on that was also develop

4335
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:46,079
it for the

4336
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:47,520
inputs and what he found that was scary

4337
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:49,920
and what was really interesting if you

4338
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:51,760
listen to that episode was how insane

4339
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:53,920
the bat guano was

4340
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:56,318
and how many different coronaviruses

4341
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:58,079
there were in the bat guano and how like

4342
02:22:56,318 --> 02:23:00,398
it just scared the living crap out of

4343
02:22:58,079 --> 02:23:02,639
them and and how like we really need to

4344
02:23:00,398 --> 02:23:03,920
all immediately stop using bat guano

4345
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:05,840
completely

4346
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:08,398
in the cannabis industry in terms of bio

4347
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:11,280
safety for all not only as a liability

4348
02:23:08,398 --> 02:23:13,599
for ourselves as a company for whoever

4349
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,600
you're working for but as an industry

4350
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:17,840
because we could be

4351
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:20,800
at least accidentally in theory the

4352
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:22,318
source of you know the next covid and we

4353
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:24,239
nobody wants that

4354
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:26,398
yeah thank you for that clarification

4355
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,639
it's still such an extremely valid point

4356
02:23:26,398 --> 02:23:30,639
i've been thinking something not too

4357
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:33,119
different myself i remember i had a

4358
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:35,199
friend who got an atypical pneumonia

4359
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:37,040
from handling guano last year and i was

4360
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:39,760
like this isn't just something you read

4361
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:42,479
about it actually happens

4362
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:43,680
yeah it's pretty scary i i had a pretty

4363
02:23:42,478 --> 02:23:45,358
gnarly experience when i was younger

4364
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:47,280
with a pretty rare type of pneumonia as

4365
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:48,559
well and we they never figured out where

4366
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,680
it came from and it makes me wonder

4367
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:51,680
because i was often heavily into

4368
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:53,680
gardening and now after listening to

4369
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:54,880
that it made me wonder is that where it

4370
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:56,880
came from

4371
02:23:54,879 --> 02:23:58,639
yeah i think that it there could be a

4372
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:00,159
whole range of things like that but

4373
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:02,318
that's that's interesting and yeah

4374
02:24:00,159 --> 02:24:03,680
thanks for clarifying that so on to our

4375
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:05,199
quickfire questions i'm really

4376
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:06,800
interested to hear your answers for this

4377
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:08,800
one so the first one i'd like to start

4378
02:24:06,799 --> 02:24:11,679
out with what's the most memorable

4379
02:24:08,799 --> 02:24:12,879
cannabis you've ever smoked in your life

4380
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:15,840
hmm

4381
02:24:12,879 --> 02:24:15,839
memorable cannabis

4382
02:24:18,639 --> 02:24:24,398
probably two things one the last joint i

4383
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:26,800
smoked with dennis perrone

4384
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:29,519
at new year's eve

4385
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:30,959
about two months before he passed away

4386
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,880
would be one of the ones that i can

4387
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:35,358
think of where i'll never forget that

4388
02:24:32,879 --> 02:24:36,959
one ever i'd it's the last time i saw

4389
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:39,439
him um

4390
02:24:36,959 --> 02:24:41,519
the other one was

4391
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:43,920
and that was at the castle on new year's

4392
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,960
eve um a castro castle anyone that knows

4393
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:48,239
the industry

4394
02:24:44,959 --> 02:24:52,000
or knows dennis um and then uh

4395
02:24:48,239 --> 02:24:52,000
the other one would probably be

4396
02:24:54,079 --> 02:25:00,159
dr uh there was one that i smoked with

4397
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:03,280
on the dragonfly earth medicine tent

4398
02:25:00,159 --> 02:25:05,600
two years ago at emerald cup

4399
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:07,680
and i'm trying to remember who gave it

4400
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:09,359
to me i don't remember i believe it was

4401
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:10,398
a weight laughter strain but i don't

4402
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:12,479
remember i

4403
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:14,079
he handed me the ball and i think he's

4404
02:25:12,478 --> 02:25:16,559
the one who grew up but i don't quote me

4405
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:18,239
on that but it was like a 16 something

4406
02:25:16,559 --> 02:25:20,000
or other and it just

4407
02:25:18,239 --> 02:25:22,079
kicked me in the teeth

4408
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:25,760
like it was the most

4409
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:28,639
most i've had my bell rung in 10 years

4410
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:30,079
um and that was that just stuck with me

4411
02:25:28,639 --> 02:25:32,239
i still i don't even know remember what

4412
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:33,760
the name of it was but i just that one

4413
02:25:32,239 --> 02:25:35,439
just hitting that that pipe you know

4414
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:36,880
just a regular glass bowl two or three

4415
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:39,040
times

4416
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:40,559
just kick my kick me in like i just did

4417
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:42,560
like three gram dab or something like

4418
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:45,119
that like it just the terpene profile

4419
02:25:42,559 --> 02:25:46,639
was just exactly what my body needed

4420
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:49,040
wow yeah that's awesome when you get

4421
02:25:46,639 --> 02:25:50,959
that special hitter like that so on the

4422
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:52,800
other end of the spectrum has there ever

4423
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:54,478
been a strain where everyone else was

4424
02:25:52,799 --> 02:25:55,840
really into it hyping it up and you're

4425
02:25:54,478 --> 02:25:57,840
like oh cool getting excited and then

4426
02:25:55,840 --> 02:26:00,520
you try and you're like it's not for me

4427
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:02,559
i don't get it cookies

4429
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:06,239
man i love this answer because i'm such

4430
02:26:04,239 --> 02:26:07,840
a die hard cookies fan like i [ __ ]

4431
02:26:06,239 --> 02:26:08,639
love it but i get how much people hate

4432
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:10,639
it

4433
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:13,519
as a grower

4434
02:26:10,639 --> 02:26:16,639
if i never saw cookies again

4435
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:18,800
it would be too soon

4436
02:26:16,639 --> 02:26:21,439
because cookies grows these little tiny

4437
02:26:18,799 --> 02:26:23,279
larvae buds that are just absolutely

4438
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:24,479
annoying is all hell for any of your

4439
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:26,479
trimmers that actually it doesn't

4440
02:26:24,478 --> 02:26:28,159
produce nice fat stuff it's easy to trim

4441
02:26:26,478 --> 02:26:30,318
it's all these tiny little

4442
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:32,239
you know super ball size bouncy ball

4443
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:34,079
size nugs that are you know quarter

4444
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:35,039
sized that are just a pain in the ass

4445
02:26:34,079 --> 02:26:37,439
trim

4446
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:39,439
yeah 100 i can certainly agree on that

4447
02:26:37,439 --> 02:26:41,120
point i won't argue there but for resin

4448
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:42,800
production for concentrates i get why

4449
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:45,680
people grow it it makes sense

4450
02:26:42,799 --> 02:26:48,959
but i agree for me smoking i love it for

4451
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:51,760
me growing it a little less

4452
02:26:48,959 --> 02:26:53,358
so the next question if you were stuck

4453
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:55,520
on a desert island and you could only

4454
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:58,079
take three strains with you which three

4455
02:26:55,520 --> 02:27:00,840
would you want to take

4456
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:04,318
so it would be hash plan

4457
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:06,559
g13 my blue hash that i've been working

4458
02:27:04,318 --> 02:27:08,398
on for quite a few years

4459
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:10,079
and

4460
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:12,639
hmm

4462
02:27:12,639 --> 02:27:16,879

4464
02:27:16,879 --> 02:27:21,438
for the viewers what what went into your

4465
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:24,720
blue hash it sounds interesting

4466
02:27:21,439 --> 02:27:27,200
sure it's blue dream and afghan one um

4467
02:27:24,719 --> 02:27:29,358
and hash plant so it was hash oh the

4468
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,479
plant it was afghan won a hash plant and

4469
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:32,399
we crossed that

4470
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:34,799
and we got a really fire male out of

4471
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:37,119
that let me cross that with a blue dream

4472
02:27:34,799 --> 02:27:39,358
cut that we had that was really thick

4473
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:41,520
stocked like freakishly thick stocked

4474
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:43,200
and just kicked ass in the wind

4475
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:45,439
out in the plains in colorado that was

4476
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:46,880
just it would grow like into like tree

4477
02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:48,800
trunks right and it would just hold

4478
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:50,239
itself up with fat nugs even in high

4479
02:27:48,799 --> 02:27:51,519
winds it would just take whatever you

4480
02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:54,079
threw at it didn't didn't really get

4481
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:55,760
broken at all and we crossed those and

4482
02:27:54,079 --> 02:27:58,318
and the progeny from that we've

4483
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:00,478
developed kind of two lineages that have

4484
02:27:58,318 --> 02:28:01,920
since been just we've gotten so many

4485
02:28:00,478 --> 02:28:03,519
different good crosses out of it that

4486
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:05,280
that we've kind of

4487
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:06,880
you can get if anyone's listening and

4488
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,880
want some you can get some through mr

instagram uh he he does have them

4491
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:14,159
available and he's one the only source

4492
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:15,840
of the the actual original genetics that

4493
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:17,760
i have out there currently

4494
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:18,799
damn i'm gonna have to hit him up

4495
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:20,639
so

4496
02:28:18,799 --> 02:28:22,639
on the other end of the spectrum and

4497
02:28:20,639 --> 02:28:25,599
this is one of my favorite questions

4498
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:27,840
if you had to drop off someone you're

4499
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,359
not particularly a fan of maybe you

4500
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,120
might even use the hate word though it's

4501
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:32,559
a little strong someone you're not a fan

4502
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:34,560
of you've got to drop them off on an

4503
02:28:32,559 --> 02:28:38,318
island and leave them with three strains

4504
02:28:34,559 --> 02:28:38,318
what are you gonna leave them with okay

4505
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:42,280
i'd have to think on this for a second

4506
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:45,359

and go anywhere around the globe

4524

presumably to collect some cannabis

about myself with the the ever elusive

that just about brings us to the end of

it

4545
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:19,760

4546
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,120
people wanted to check out your podcast

4547
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,960
what would be the best place for them to

4548
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:24,960
go find it

4549
02:30:22,959 --> 02:30:27,438
sure they can check me out at pomponix

4550
02:30:24,959 --> 02:30:30,478
and youtube soundcloud itunes

4551
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:32,318
i heart radio spotify run over 200

4552
02:30:30,478 --> 02:30:34,959
different platforms so they can find us

4553
02:30:32,318 --> 02:30:36,799
on whatever whatever fits your post

4554
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:38,559
if you know some of our episodes

4555
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:40,719
definitely are more video heavy you know

4556
02:30:38,559 --> 02:30:41,920
we have a tour of a glassblowing

4557
02:30:40,719 --> 02:30:43,199
facility and stuff like that you

4558
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:46,639
probably want to check out on youtube

4559
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:48,240
but i would say 95 of them or 98 of them

4560
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:50,478
are perfectly fine to listen to them the

4561
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:51,760
audio version but we get over 20 times

4562
02:30:50,478 --> 02:30:53,438
the listeners on the audio version i'm

4563
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:54,960
sure you're similar as well where you

4564
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:57,280
get you know

4565
02:30:54,959 --> 02:30:59,599
significantly more listenership on your

4566
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:01,200
audio version than the videos

4567
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,920
