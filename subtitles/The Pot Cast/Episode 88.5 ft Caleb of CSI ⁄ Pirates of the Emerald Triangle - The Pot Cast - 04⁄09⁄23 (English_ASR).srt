popular for you the purple Hindu Kush

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,720
because there's now a number of Hindu

123
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,919
kushers purple Hindu kushers

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000

125
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,519
lot of people are like is this the Yer

128
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,199
Kush you use that's not the Yer

129
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,159
cut well so okay

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,879
um so purple Hindu Kush this the the

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,800
purple Hindu Kush I have is the one that

132
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:32,199
was made popular in southern Oregon and

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,439
it sources back to Millerville farms in

134
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,840
southern Oregon and

135
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:42,600
uh according to them uh you know they

136
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:46,198
got you know some seeds

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,879
um of of H Hindu Kush groom out and

138
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,120
there was a purple one and that's where

139
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,560
it started

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,439
um there's a couple different variations

141
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,759
I'm not sure what entirely the the whole

142
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,680
story is but um um one story was you

143
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,080
know they took a male from from those

144
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,439
seeds and crossed it to the purple Hindu

145
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,198
and that's how they made jger it's just

146
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:14,160
a it's just you know a further you know

147
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,199
breeding of the same thing um and then

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,680
another I don't

149
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,879
know uh I don't know if it's a story or

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,879
if it's just my impression but it almost

151
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:27,478
seems like the Jagger could just be a

152
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:33,159
you know a hermaphrodite S1 seed from

153
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:35,680
the purple Hindu um but anyways um you

154
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,160
know and then there's a few stories of

155
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,478
where you know what that that Hindu Kush

156
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,680
exactly is I don't know if it even ties

157
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,360
back to like Amsterdam Hindu Kush or if

158
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,240
it's you know something entirely

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,280
different but supposedly the SE came

160
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,918
from uh this Pharmacy uh or I think it

161
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,239
was the pharmacy in like Los Angeles

162
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,279
somewhere around there

163
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,120
um so I don't know I don't know but uh

164
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,638
it was extremely popular in southern

165
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,840
Oregon um for for a lot of years and

166
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,519
every time I went up to Oregon I would

167
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,878
buy some of the finished flower at all

168
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,639
the dispensaries because it has that

169
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:24,240
similar uh that

170
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:27,360
similar uh black licorice Anis uh TP um

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,439
you know like meno purple s1's

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,520
do so

173
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,399
I kind of liked it yum cool and I mean

174
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,519
just to clarify which of the two plants

175
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,799
do you favor the Jager or the purple

176
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,959
Hindu

177
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:49,199
um I like the Jager better it it's more

178
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,719
refined you know um the purple

179
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,400
Hindu

180
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,720
um seem seems a little broad it's it's

181
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,799
kind of like when you grow a meno the

182
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,960
meno per cut and then a meno per S1 side

183
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,038
by side

184
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,839
you know they're they're extremely

185
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,560
similar but then uh a lot of times the

186
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,918
s1's will like refine you know certain

187
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,038
things they won't have be so broad you

188
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,359
know with their their their T

189
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:17,680
profiles so

190
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,240
yeah yeah yeah that's cool and and do

191
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
you you know you've sort of alluded to

192
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,680
it already you got a bit of a soft spot

193
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,879
for the licorice

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,639
turbs yeah yeah

195
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,639
yeah yeah like I love it too and I feel

196
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,639
like it's really under

197
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,319
represented yeah um one one thing I talk

198
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:41,679
uh a lot about with the you know like uh

199
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,600
you know my buddy Matt right and uh Noto

200
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,599
dog um is uh how the meno purple s ones

201
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,759
this is a total tangent of course but

202
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,120
there's like a recessive in there um

203
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:58,639
that is some of the strongest roadkill

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:03,679
skunk that I've found anywhere and it's

205
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:07,240
these little runty like ABCs runty these

206
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:11,039
little runty recessive plants um and

207
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,720
they just wre of just skunk spray as

208
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:17,199
close as I've really found you know I

209
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
mean they smell like spray whereas you

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,800
know the Sterling skunk I mess mess

211
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,879
around with that's more of uh you know

212
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:28,359
the the skunk got hit you know a day day

213
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,958
or three ago but th this stuff is almost

214
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,519
spray St because it's so

215
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,399
pungent but uh wow you you you basically

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,639
answered the question for me but just to

217
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,720
clarify because it was one of the

218
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,360
listeners they said I've grown a number

219
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,320
of your meno pers hybrids they've all

220
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,200
been Wicked and I've been kind of

221
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,360
uniquely surprised by each of them is

222
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,440
that skunk one you just mentioned the

223
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,759
most surprising thing you found in them

224
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,640
or have you found other equally weirdly

225
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:00,240
Divergent stuff oh yeah yeah not it it

226
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,360
it's one of my my favorite favorite

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,600
lines to play with or s1's um and you

228
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,600
know S1 you know all that stuff you know

229
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,720
will show up if it doesn't show up in

230
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,920
the F1 hybrid it'll show up in F2 you

231
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,839
know a lot of times but uh um there's so

232
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,559
much variation as far as you know

233
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,440
tarpine profiles and just variety and

234
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,399
that stuff I had one that was like a a

235
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,880
chocolate coffee

236
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,519
spice you know and then there tons of

237
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,919
just super super some of the fru stuff

238
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,600
you've ever smelled you know and then

239
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,439
there's there's hashy nog shampa ones

240
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,079
and you know Blackberry ones and grapy

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,839
ones and the skunky ones and there's so

242
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,559
much in those uh you know it's it's

243
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,639
always fun to grow those things that's

244
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,599
really really cool I would never expect

245
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,320
like a Bubba type plant by the sounds of

246
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,720
in terms of the smells that's that's

247
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,200
really cool and that that plant was

248
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,480
weird too uh it was like a lanky uh yeah

249
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,879
it it was way different than the norm as

250
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,079
far as most of the MPS ones go but

251
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,838
definitely

252
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,519
unique damn and I I mean you you touched

253
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,000
on it the Sterling skunk you know shout

254
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,679
out and uh you know rest in peace zoi

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,720
we're all grateful that he passed that

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,479
one on when I chatted with bod um in

257
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,879
December when I was in the states I met

258
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,278
up with him for dinner and he was like I

259
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,639
was like is it the real deal and he was

260
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,240
like yep the real deal what's your

261
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,720
thoughts on the Sterling

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,079
skunk it's it's cool I I like it a lot

263
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,360
um it uh you know the the ones I

264
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:44,199
released I I put a warning on because uh

265
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,440
I I would not recommend these to be

266
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,759
grown

267
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,279
indoors U they they definitely can be

268
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:54,480
some of the worst hermaphrodites inside

269
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,360
um but Outdoors zero hermaphrodites

270
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,680
which is you know par for par for the

271
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,240
course of how things work um

272
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:05,159
but uh you

273
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:10,159
know um it's definitely a line that uh

274
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:12,199
needs to be uh worked and you know

275
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,078
because when I reproduced them did my

276
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,160
open pollination there are ones that

277
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,958
were just you know Rocka just skunky as

278
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:24,759
hell they they made your eyes water that

279
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:28,119
so so so strong but you know it it's a

280
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,679
percentage game again you know and so a

281
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,560
lot of them are you know just variations

282
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:37,198
of and then you know

283
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:40,119
uh yeah but as as as a standalone plant

284
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:42,639
it's it's definitely not gonna be the

285
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,720
ticket you know doesn't produce you know

286
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,799
big fat chunky nugs or this that other

287
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,399
it definitely is a building block to

288
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:55,479
hopefully something better you know yeah

289
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,078
oh look I I was going to ask you know

290
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,639
what would you pair it with what do you

291
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:00,799
think you would pair it with that would

292
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,959
help help it to be what the public are

293
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,278
in search

294
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:08,719
of I mean I kind of want to pair it with

295
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:12,559
a few things um you know just to kind of

296
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
start with uh um I'd kind of like to

297
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:18,559
work like some of the skunky deep chunks

298
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,120
in there um you know to help you know

299
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,838
the plant out i' I'd like to also maybe

300
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,519
mix in the Christmas butt I work with

301
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,360
that has some strong skunky chps as well

302
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:33,159
to it and it has like some super

303
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,720
you know pungency as well um and then

304
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:39,159
you know if if you know I was able to

305
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,519
get something you know more so what I

306
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,519
was looking for you know to hybridize

307
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,639
something like that with like a chmd or

308
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,360
something that already has you know a

309
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:52,198
nice base and the potency uh I I I think

310
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,879
you couldn't go wrong and and like just

311
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,399
to confirm those ones you were saying

312
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,278
you know where it's like makes your eyes

313
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,600
water do you think that's the road kill

314
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,559
smell that people are searching of or do

315
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,040
you think the the thing that people in

316
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,039
their minds are looking for it's not

317
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,799
it's not like as real as what they think

318
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,240
it is and it's never going to be like an

319
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:15,879
actual Dead Skunk but this is pretty

320
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,560
close well I think people have different

321
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,679
uh things they're looking for some

322
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,278
people are looking for this roadkill

323
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:26,239
smell that's like a few days it's like a

324
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:29,919
muscular smell whereas like a a skunk

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,720
spray smell is you know know just you

326
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,399
know blinds your eyes you know make some

327
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,959
water you

328
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,720
know makes your lungs bleed you know

329
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,000
it's potent that's what I want from my

330
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,440
roadkill you know because you know

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,320
that's that's when you first hit that

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,600
skunk dead on no fence skunk but you

333
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,519
know um but you know the the the few day

334
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,240
old Road roadkill is still pretty okay

335
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,399
but I want that fresh fresh but I don't

336
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,639
know if it translates into dry weed form

337
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,320
do you think maybe like whatever tpin

338
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,959
are involved you know the trendy word

339
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,360
THS um do you think that they they're

340
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:12,399
just too volatile and you lose it really

341
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:17,759
quickly you know I think back in the day

342
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,480
um everybody was selling wet weed and so

343
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,560
your your your turps are still like

344
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,680
super strong with that wet but then as

345
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,799
soon as it's dry you know um it it's

346
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,278
gone you know with a lot of those you

347
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:34,479
know TPS and dials and all that kind of

348
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:37,360
stuff you know um yeah I think a lot of

349
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,399
the stuff we're looking for is is too

350
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,039
volatile to stick in a bag for too

351
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,318
long there you go there you go I um I

352
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,278
wanted to ask you because we we

353
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,679
mentioned bod and in relation to the SK

354
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:53,278
Sterling skunk I noticed on the website

355
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,039
you got the mango bishe and it's always

356
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,838
been one that's been interesting to me

357
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,919
because I remember bod made an offhand

358
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,440
comment years ago and he's like oh it's

359
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,078
like the blue dream of South America and

360
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,920
I I never never quite understood what he

361
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,278
meant by that but um I've tried some

362
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,039
hybrids and it's nice stuff what would

363
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,720
you say about

364
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,719
it that's a good

365
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,959
analogy I just I mean I've I've I've run

366
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,439
it a few times now and uh that's not

367
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,958
that's not

368
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,560
bad I mean that's like saying it's a

369
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,318
basic beginner plan yeah that's probably

370
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,559
pretty accurate okay it's like a it's a

371
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:38,360
beginner sativa yeah but but a long one

372
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:42,439
it it it takes just as long as uh as the

373
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,079
Burmese yeah oh wow really yeah yeah I

374
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,519
mean I like the mango be but uh there's

375
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,198
something about the Burmese like plant

376
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:55,360
itself that uh I'm really drawn towards

377
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:58,000
um whereas the the the mango

378
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,800
be yeah it's kind of it's kind of a

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,240
beginner plant you know it's it's a good

380
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:07,279
one though um and is the effect like

381
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,640
super uplifting or it's more in like the

382
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,798
mild uplifting

383
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,000
category ah I

384
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:21,439
mean I'm I'm I'm not a a I wouldn't say

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,558
I'm a a great sativa fishan quite

386
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,919
yet I've been buried in indicas my whole

387
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,079
life so you know uh get back to me in a

388
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,520
few years

389
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,240
don't worry I I'll come test all your

390
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:35,679
sativa hybrids for you all right sounds

391
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,919
good oh no just the P pure sativas I'm

392
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,080
okay with the hybrids oh true thought

393
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,880
I'd snuck in there I'll share I'll share

394
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,839
that's good that's good um one of the

395
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,880
fans submitted questions was people had

396
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,639
noticed that there were some nl5 Haze

397
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,559
hybrids sneaking into the

398
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
lineup can you tell us a little bit

399
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,960
about the cut you've been working with

400
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,440
are we talking like dog [ __ ] yeah they

401
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,360
must be talking about that I mean it's

402
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,759
had a big Resurgence and you know Noto

403
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,759
has been pushing it for rightly good

404
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:10,599
reasons right right right um that that

405
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:13,000
that's one uh I think I well and the

406
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,798
chem1 you know that that that definitely

407
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,240
you know I think Falls kind of into that

408
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:25,759
category a little bit um as far as any

409
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:29,120
uh other nl5 Haze hybrids uh those those

410
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:32,119
I'm not at Liberty to discuss right

411
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:36,158
yet we have to keep our eyes open and

412
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:40,279
ears listening well you know sometimes

413
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:43,799
the politics out there are

414
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:46,359
strange I'm actually impressed you have

415
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,000
been able to navigate the politics of it

416
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,879
all because you know you you do work

417
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,558
with a lot of different strains and that

418
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,000
sort of lends itself to people getting

419
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,759
butt hurt how how do you navigate that

420
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,079
space do you think it's just about like

421
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,558
when you do a project as long as you're

422
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,079
doing it with Integrity like people

423
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,918
can't really get too upset or like how

424
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:08,319
do what would be your general

425
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,840
advice I mean uh I wouldn't

426
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,759
say I navigate very

427
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,399
well everybody gets butt hurt I mean you

428
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,000
want a

429
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,640
list look at all the s1s you've made and

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,640
those are all the people I know

431
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,400
right the only people who aren't but Hur

432
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:32,038
are you know uh the Clones i' I've

433
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,919
personally held 25 years or so you know

434
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,640
wow okay so just yeah there's no there's

435
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,120
no easy way to do it you just got to do

436
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,280
it no no and you know honestly uh most

437
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,599
of the people who are but hurt I'm not

438
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,480
going to name

439
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,759
names but most of them didn't have

440
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,360
anything to do with creating breeding or

441
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,960
anything you know the the these cuts

442
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,959
that they're all butt hurt about you

443
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,720
know and you know a lot of times people

444
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,759
I I'll I'll research stuff before I

445
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,120
releasee something and you know some

446
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,000
something will have like you know five

447
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,678
different companies making the same

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,679
seeds so I'm like well they can't get

449
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,720
butt hurt at me oh no never mind I was

450
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,200
wrong they're butt hurt at me even

451
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,079
though there's a ton of people you know

452
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,319
and I I could tell you many stories on

453
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,759
the topic but you know I I'll leave that

454
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:28,879
one be for

455
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:31,038
now there you go look it's um it's it's

456
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,799
a tough one I definitely get it you know

457
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:37,759
because I feel like the landscape of the

458
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,279
community is ever changing and you know

459
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,079
how do you feel about that you know

460
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,759
because if we look at the commercial

461
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:48,240
scene at the moment the most biggest and

462
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,919
most popular companies like DOA like Deo

463
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,759
Farms these guys who are like you know

464
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,440
making millions and millions of dollars

465
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,319
off selling you know quote Cali packs

466
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,159
they're not the guys who are lorded

467
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,000
among the he Community you know like cuz

468
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
they're they're not like a breeders

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
breeder so to speak how do you feel the

470
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,558
scene is progressing in terms of that

471
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,200
landscape and what do you think is going

472
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:14,480
to be the trajectory going

473
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,440
forward I mean those are good questions

474
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:23,558
um but I gotta admit uh I I tend to like

475
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:28,519
stay in my little humble County hle and

476
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:32,399
uh I mean my my long-term goal you know

477
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:35,759
is um I'm hoping looking to have a

478
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,720
couple dispensaries up here a nursery uh

479
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,158
you

480
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,880
know a pretty nice breeding lab or two

481
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,919
um and then grow my own flower and

482
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,919
basically you know be vertically

483
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,799
integrated and just you know do

484
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,200
everything myself but on a very small

485
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:56,000
manageable scale that I can have fun

486
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,400
with that's that's my long shortterm

487
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,038
goal you know three four five years

488
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:08,000
um so as far as you know outside of my

489
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:11,000
little tiny bubble here um I don't pay a

490
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,240
whole lot of attention to it you

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,159
know yeah understandable and golly I'm

492
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,720
sure a lot of people are really excited

493
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,039
to hear that that's what you've got on

494
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,919
the cards do you think that it would be

495
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:26,720
based in like Northern California mesino

496
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,880
type area oh I I've I've already um I'm

497
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,919
already working on it I've got

498
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:37,120
um my my buildings and uh working on the

499
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,600
licenses and you know getting hopefully

500
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,278
getting stuff built out over the next

501
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:44,959
couple years so yeah and and and then as

502
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:47,319
soon as I'm open and you know good for

503
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,558
all that you know anybody who wants to

504
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:53,678
you know come through and you know visit

505
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,200
I'll I'll I'll have the spot to visit oh

506
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,080
my Lord I think everyone will put their

507
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,720
hands up to be guinea pigs whatever you

508
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:05,079
need tested buddy we'll do it for

509
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,798
you right right that's that's really

510
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,720
really cool because I feel like a lot of

511
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,839
people have a very Doom and Gloom

512
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,720
forecast for the industry going forward

513
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,359
so it's really refreshing to hear that

514
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,240
people like yourself are you know I

515
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,839
don't want to sound too dramatic but

516
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,000
it's it's almost like the

517
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,359
antidote right I mean don't don't get me

518
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,720
wrong I don't I don't think there's

519
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,759
going to be much money in it at all I'm

520
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,798
I'm I'm gonna have a tough time just

521
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:37,038
surviving but as long as I'm able to do

522
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:40,480
what I like to do I I think that's all

523
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:42,879
that I really want yeah brilliant

524
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,400
brilliant I'd love to ask you a few

525
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,679
questions about creating

526
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,320
seeds you know part of these are my

527
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,440
questions part of them are the listeners

528
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,278
submitted questions but the first one I

529
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,759
wanted to ask is how long do you let

530
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,480
seeds mature on plants for do you just

531
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,240
let it go the length it would normally

532
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,159
go or do you like really push it to try

533
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:07,278
to get the most out of it so uh I

534
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:09,240
generally um you know once the room is

535
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,240
like fully pollinated I don't start

536
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,679
counting down until the room's fully

537
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,159
pollinated or as pollinated as it's

538
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,400
getting and then I'll I'll leave the

539
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,200
seeds on the plants for between six and

540
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,919
eight weeks and you know just to make

541
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,240
sure they're you know nice and solidly

542
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,399
ripe and then uh um I've seen other

543
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,278
people

544
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,000
you know they're they're they're selling

545
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:37,319
seeds you know next day as soon as it's

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,798
down I'm like uh okay I I try to dry dry

547
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:43,519
my seeds for a couple weeks usually and

548
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,200
then then they get you know sorted and

549
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,918
sifted and blown and all that and then

550
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,480
they go in the fridge for

551
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,399
ideally no less than a couple weeks but

552
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,120
usually I don't like you know taking

553
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,759
them out of the fridge for at least a

554
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,199
month you know before you know I start

555
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,759
start messing with them but uh yeah

556
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,120
that's that's pretty much the the

557
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,079
average right

558
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,678
there yeah wow and and when they're on

559
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,398
the plants are you treating them as if

560
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,399
they're like a sensey crop or are you

561
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:14,839
like really pushing them with nutrients

562
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,879
and like not trying to avoid a fade and

563
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:22,079
just trying to keep it stocked up yeah

564
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,039
yeah I I definitely uh uh keep put uh

565
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:28,199
pushing them with Nitro and you know all

566
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:31,119
the other other uh nutrients um I'm I'm

567
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,480
not trying to flush them I'm you know

568
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,639
I'm trying to you know just keep feeding

569
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,000
those

570
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,159
seeds yeah beautiful beautiful and as a

571
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,240
followup I myself have been wondering

572
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,200
what do you do with your like the

573
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,880
material that's left over after you've

574
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,840
Shu the seeds you know there's a lot of

575
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,399
heads there do you try to like make a

576
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,519
concentrate or anything or like I've had

577
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,199
other people say oh it's usually not the

578
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,599
greatest material to try to do anything

579
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,798
with what do you do with it yeah

580
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,079
I'd love to do something because you

581
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,759
know I I like I don't like throwing

582
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,639
stuff away I like reusing I like I don't

583
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,640
like being wasteful you know if I can

584
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,840
help it and so you know to be honest

585
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,679
I'll end up with you know hundreds and

586
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:20,398
hundreds of pounds of that stuff all all

587
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,200
stored up and then you know realize I'm

588
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,558
not doing anything with it take it to

589
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,960
the dump or something the the green

590
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,839
waste I think last time I took it to the

591
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,200
green waste and it became some

592
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,240
compost yeah there you go it's a tough

593
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,200
one I I got one of those little purple

594
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,079
Pro units and um I tested some of it I

595
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,278
think it came out like seven or 8% so

596
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,000
it's definitely not like the Same by any

597
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,240
stretch not that I think anyone thought

598
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,599
so but yeah right right how do you like

599
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:54,038
your purple Pro you know so obviously I

600
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:56,798
saw the the discussion um about you know

601
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:58,759
when you and Matt not so met up and um

602
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,158
you know the the gist I got was that you

603
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,919
guys weren't really convinced about it I

604
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,278
think for me you know I I tested it a

605
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,360
lot and I think it works I think my

606
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,960
overall summary would be that I feel

607
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:15,678
like it really confirm it just confirms

608
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
what you already know you know like you

609
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,480
you you test a plant that's your

610
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,320
favorite plant and you know not like a

611
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
chem 91 but like a plant where you're

612
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,639
pretty confident it's pretty potent and

613
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,320
you know sure enough it will be the most

614
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,679
potent that you get tested M the thing

615
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:34,839
that I definitely thought was a hurdle

616
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,399
was that um you have to do a lot of

617
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,000
tests and then take the average um and I

618
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,439
thought that from a consumer point of

619
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,759
view people really want something where

620
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
you just put something in you hit the

621
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,879
button and then you get the accurate

622
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,599
answer straight away so I I think it's

623
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,399
something that can be used you got to

624
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:55,038
know how to use it um but it it's

625
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:57,319
definitely not perfect yet right right

626
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,759
yeah I'm I'm still a little suspicious

627
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,119
but

628
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,200
yeah well like I mean that's the thing

629
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,199
it's working on an algorithm which you

630
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,200
know it they they provide the paper so

631
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,480
you can read how they develop the

632
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,480
algorithm and I I trust that part of it

633
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480
but it seems like there's a lot of

634
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,360
variables and when I've been discussing

635
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,679
it with some other listeners who have

636
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,759
one as well we all seem to come to the

637
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,840
conclusion that there needs to be a far

638
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,640
more standardized way in which you load

639
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,398
it in because we've all noticed if you

640
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,120
just you know you fill it with some herb

641
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,439
and you do the test if you pull that

642
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,639
same little puck out and just like break

643
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,399
it up and then repack it back in so that

644
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,640
it's all the particles have been moved

645
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:37,959
around you can get variation so it seems

646
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,919
like there needs to be a very

647
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,798
standardized way to test it so that when

648
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,799
I'm telling you what I got it's the same

649
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,519
as what you're getting right right

650
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:50,519
gotcha maybe maybe I need to use a

651
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,440
little more i' I've got a bunch of stuff

652
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,919
I bought at a bunch of uh organ uh

653
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,840
Southern organ dispensaries and they got

654
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,440
their numbers on them so as planning to

655
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,720
test him here pretty soon I mean it

656
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,600
would be cool to see like the

657
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,319
incorporation of it into a breeding

658
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,959
program cuz that was what they really

659
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,038
pitched to me and and you know the

660
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,880
theory sounds solid where they were

661
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,919
saying you can test stuff like basically

662
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,559
apparently as soon as you get like resin

663
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,919
on the plant basically you can test it

664
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:22,119
and of course the numbers are going to

665
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,559
be like less than 1% but they'll still

666
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:27,439
vary and they they seem to suggest when

667
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:30,359
I was interviewing them that the the

668
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,240
stuff that tests higher earlier will be

669
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,719
the stuff that tests higher later as

670
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,720
well and they were basically saying you

671
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,558
can start thinning plants out in like

672
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,480
you know week four week five just based

673
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,678
on those preliminary numbers and I

674
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,519
thought that would be interesting for

675
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,880
someone like you who you know is going

676
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,720
through 500

677
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,799
plans right right yeah interesting

678
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,240
interesting stuff nonetheless just as a

679
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,679
a follow on from what we were talking

680
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,640
about earlier you know you're talking

681
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,880
about this facility one of the listeners

682
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,840
was specifically Keen to know would you

683
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,200
ever consider releasing

684
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:06,439
clones oh definitely definitely um once

685
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,600
I I have my you know my vertical

686
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:14,200
integration all going um my my uh main

687
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:17,798
focus would be uh I think a lot of

688
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,480
people don't want to you know uh you

689
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,119
know select their own you know seed seed

690
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,399
plants they don't want to you know grow

691
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,319
out a bunch of seeds and make their own

692
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:26,839
selections blah blah so one of the

693
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,839
things you know I definitely would be

694
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,720
doing is

695
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:34,918
growing out these populations making

696
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,200
selections choosing plants uh you know

697
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,640
for indoor grow outdoor grow you know

698
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,000
bunch of different things I really want

699
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,720
to you know make some ABC selections

700
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,759
types that people can grow in their

701
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,200
front yards or whever and just be like

702
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,919
haha you know but you know make them

703
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,120
selected plants so people don't have to

704
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,080
root through a 100 or 200 seeds uh you

705
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:01,038
know that might not be the best to find

706
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,558
good ones and so that that that's kind

707
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:07,200
of where where I'd be heading with with

708
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:09,079
all that for sure sure and and do you

709
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,919
think generally speaking the future of

710
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,038
growing is going to be more in clones or

711
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,679
you think it'll always be

712
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:19,638
seed well I think they all have their

713
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,600
place you know um you know clone clones

714
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:26,398
can be reliable um but you know SE seeds

715
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,879
are easy and also seeds you know pop

716
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,518
them in your fridge prop them your a

717
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,039
freezer they're good for 10 or 20 years

718
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,919
you know definitely definitely they're

719
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,839
like a bit of a Time vault in that sense

720
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,399
aren't they yeah yeah so I wanted to ask

721
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,519
you what do you think would have a

722
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,678
better chance of

723
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,079
success let's say you got a clone and

724
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,000
you want to improve it you know you're

725
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,879
like I've got this plant I really like

726
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,679
it there's there's one or two things I

727
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,080
can acknowledge are not perfect and

728
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,798
would be better if they were maybe you

729
00:31:54,079 --> 00:32:00,519
know bigger yield better structure do

730
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:02,558
you think you would be best to S1 it and

731
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,480
run through like 100 females and just

732
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,398
try to find a plant or two that has

733
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,399
those improved traits or do you think

734
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,239
you would be better to just try to make

735
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,879
some hybrids with a plant like a male

736
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,679
that you know maybe generally speaking

737
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,399
that line of the male has like better

738
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,880
structure and then you're just trying to

739
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,319
select a plant that's like mostly

740
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,000
leaning to the mom with a few better

741
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:26,038
traits right

742
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,880
um I don't know uh I think i' I'd lean

743
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:31,079
towards you know

744
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:36,720
s oneing it running running a bunch out

745
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:39,918
um and then um maybe ideally uh you know

746
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,399
finding a uh like an outcross type that

747
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,600
doesn't push anything

748
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:47,918
forward and or much of anything you know

749
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:49,798
like maybe structure or whatever but not

750
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,038
like Tarpin or potency or whatever

751
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,638
whatever and then you know make a hybrid

752
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:59,278
that you know takes the best qualities

753
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:02,398
of that you know and then uh you know

754
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,359
make some fairly stable SE seed lines

755
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,278
mhm and I guess as an extension of that

756
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,199
let's say let's say we're talking about

757
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,200
the TK CU I know you've done a lot of

758
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,960
work with the s1's of that TK generally

759
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,759
speaking you know it's it's got a bit of

760
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,399
stretch to it it's certainly not like a

761
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:21,359
squat Inda thing do you think if you

762
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,879
hunted through enough s1s you could find

763
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,719
something that is like quite squat or

764
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,840
there's like a limitation like if the

765
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,240
plant you're working with is very

766
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,439
stretchy like you're going to sort of

767
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,960
struggle to find a plant inside of it

768
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,919
that is like the same thing but on a

769
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,200
short

770
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:42,320
body yeah um with TK um I didn't really

771
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:46,399
find anything that was you know squat or

772
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,480
um you know Stumpy like that um outside

773
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,000
of you know just plants you wouldn't

774
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,519
really want to keep at all and I don't

775
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,880
think they were squatting Stumpy because

776
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,960
it was a good thing I think they were

777
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,399
just you

778
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,759
know you know uh inbred type runs you

779
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,479
know which you're going to get with any

780
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:09,639
S1 types you know you're always going to

781
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,800
get a population of uh recessive just

782
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,760
garbage and sometimes the garbage is

783
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,440
good though yeah that's true that's true

784
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,879
I mean not not talking about the garbage

785
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,200
can you tell us a little bit about the

786
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,639
TK 5750 cuz I've seen it popping up a

787
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:30,158
lot and uh I'm I'm interested you got my

788
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:33,760
ears peaked oh 5150 sorry the

789
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,480
5150 yeah no um so the

790
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,800
5150

791
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:42,918
um um I uh I sprouted a bunch of uh the

792
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,280
the first time I ran a bunch of TKS S1

793
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,358
seeds um I sprouted a bunch of them and

794
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,000
then my buddy comes through and he's

795
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:54,598
like um I I need some plants and I'm

796
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,599
like well I got all these seeds and uh

797
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,320
you know you could have all these seed

798
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,760
plants so he ended up running all these

799
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,119
TKS s1s and I just you know sprouted you

800
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,640
know another hundred you know the next

801
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:11,358
go around um but uh when I went over and

802
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:14,239
you know checked out his run of them

803
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:17,000
um my favores were number seven number

804
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:21,000
14 and number 50 and number

805
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,920
51 and uh I think the seven was like a

806
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,639
white you know the white it was like it

807
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,639
looked like the white um and then the 14

808
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:34,879
looked like a green Girl Scout cookie

809
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:37,440
plant right and then uh the 50 and 51

810
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,838
they were both OG Kush types you know TK

811
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:45,240
types um and you know chunky Frosty just

812
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,599
you know really nice and so you know I I

813
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,118
I got samples of you know those four you

814
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:55,480
know the four favorites from his his run

815
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:58,280
and uh um took them home and smoked the

816
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:02,039
you know smoked them all smoked the 51

817
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,640
it was just like H decent but whatever

818
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:09,000
but I smoked the 50

819
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:12,039
and um that that that one made every

820
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,519
time I smoked it it made me dur like

821
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,519
little little

822
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:21,039
crazy and you know I'm pretty good with

823
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:23,639
my smoke you know most of the time um

824
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,719
other people smoked it and they couldn't

825
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,199
function because you

826
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:32,598
know whatever

827
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:35,919
whatever so um it it you know it's the

828
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,240
number 50 but I started calling the 5150

829
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,240
because it was the 50 and the 51 that

830
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:44,399
were were were my Prime selections and

831
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:47,159
uh anyways so ended up keeping the cut

832
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,358
and you know working with it and it

833
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:52,159
breeds breeds pretty okay that's

834
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,159
brilliant you know cuz I I was going to

835
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,519
ask you are you really hunting like

836
00:36:54,159 --> 00:37:02,000
6,000 plants or something

837
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:04,480
oh no no when I saw 5150 I was like [ __ ]

838
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,760
he's going next level

839
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,039
now and and the other one I uh kept from

840
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,319
uh my my uh next run which was another

841
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:18,079
hundred and something or so was the 677

842
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:21,960
but that actually stood for bed 6 number

843
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:26,880
77 okay it wasn't it wasn't from another

844
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,679
700 plant run 5150 there you go every

845
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,480
keep your eye out for that and just as a

846
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,279
quick followup I might have missed it

847
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,159
does it have the same flavor profile as

848
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,440
the TK or is it like different in a way

849
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,679
it's it's pretty close to a traditional

850
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,400
TK nothing too too too impressive it's

851
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:48,598
just uh you know TK you know it's high

852
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,960
as what it is but th this one just every

853
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,640
time I smoked it it just seemed to you

854
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,358
know uh yeah do the trick that's

855
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,519
brilliant I love that I love that and

856
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:02,358
just you know while we're on the topic

857
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:05,000
of the TK do you have any thoughts on

858
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:08,000
you know Marty from TK Origins you know

859
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,039
has come out and said what he said about

860
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,960
the origin and you know the speculation

861
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,159
that it's like sort of Hindu by Hindu

862
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,280
roughly or you know whatever the Emerald

863
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,838
Triangle strain is what's your thoughts

864
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,599
on all of

865
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,880
that h i mean that's a that's a tough

866
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,880
one right there

867
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,920
um I mean um

868
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,519
yeah

869
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,599
uh uh that that's a good discussion

870
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:39,599
um I mean the the story has been

871
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:47,000
variable since the

872
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:50,920
start and um Marty uh he he posted uh on

873
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,159
icy mag years and years ago

874
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,639
um the same story but

875
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:00,000
different and so the story's been a bit

876
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,039
flexible for probably the better part of

877
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,159
the last 10 years give or

878
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:08,239
take um you know so are you sort of yet

879
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:11,078
to be

880
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,838
convinced I mean there's a there's a

881
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,920
good bit of truth to it let me put it

882
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,119
that way I that's a better way to phrase

883
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,159
it there's a good bit of truth to it but

884
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,400
I think some of the details might not be

885
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:27,279
a

886
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:29,960
100% um you know uh I'm I'm cool with uh

887
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,119
you know who who's who's the one who you

888
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:37,519
know uh found the OG Kush um and you

889
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:42,160
know sprouted that seed and that the

890
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:46,318
seed he sprouted does tie back in to you

891
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:48,960
know Marty and that whole crew so there

892
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:50,719
is a lot of truth to it it's just I

893
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,519
think some of the

894
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:57,519
details um I just I don't know if some

895
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:01,880
things that shouldn't be solid are being

896
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:04,759
made Solid now you know like it was a

897
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,280
mystery of what it could be but now it's

898
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,599
we know exactly what it was no no no I

899
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,519
don't think it changes that much I would

900
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,760
like

901
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:16,838
to um find out who the guy Marty worked

902
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,720
for back when he was a

903
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:24,440
kid um because Marty was just a water

904
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:27,598
boy back in those days and I've had

905
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:31,119
plenty of water boys I've never was a

906
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:35,760
water boy except for my own

907
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,440
[ __ ] but anyways uh i' I'd love to find

908
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,240
out who you know he was growing for

909
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,440
because obviously they should know what

910
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,719
that Emerald Triangle

911
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,000
was and I mean Marty thought it came

912
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,679
from Washington Seattle

913
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
area

914
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:57,159
um but um I mean the Emerald Triangle is

915
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,159
you know humble meno and TR Trinity

916
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:04,519
County you know so I don't know it's

917
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:07,399
it's it's interesting you know yeah I

918
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,559
mean could you just in isolation could

919
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,599
you believe the general formula of like

920
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,318
a Hindu cross to a Hindu type plant or

921
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,200
do you think oh that does like what

922
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,599
based on what you've seen that's not

923
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,919
really what you think it it could be it

924
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,800
could be a Hindu Hindu Kush type hybrid

925
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,240
um when my buddy grew out uh all those

926
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,800
uh TKS S1 seeds

927
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:33,799
um his room was a little over Nitro a

928
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,519
little too much nitrogen he he grows in

929
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:42,440
beds just like I do um and his room was

930
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:46,039
cold probably colder I think and his his

931
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,639
TKS S1 plants looked Jurassic like I'm

932
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:52,440
like how did nothing in that room look

933
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:55,639
like OG kush or triangle cush at all but

934
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,039
then then uh um because it I think it

935
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,279
was like a Winter Spring Run it was

936
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:02,199
probably a winter run and then he took

937
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,599
clones of all those plants and did

938
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,318
another run you know with the clones and

939
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,720
the whole room it was like you know 50

940
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:14,880
or so different uh s

941
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:18,399
s1s uh but from clone you know and it

942
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,519
all looked like triangle cush or OG Kush

943
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,559
the whole whole room you know from from

944
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:26,960
the Clone room but from seed it looked

945
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,640
Jurassic it was just old School Hindu

946
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,679
Kush type you know plants just you know

947
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:36,719
I don't know about ciny Hindu Kush maybe

948
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:39,519
maybe not but definitely some some

949
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:42,919
version of Hindu Kush yeah I believe

950
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:45,000
that totally yeah interesting Okay cool

951
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,599
so just a bit of an unrelated question

952
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,400
which I I love to ask all of the

953
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,640
Breeders who are a bit prolific what's

954
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,160
your advice for someone who's looking to

955
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:56,199
get into the breeding game and do their

956
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,039
own thing because as I mentioned earlier

957
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:00,480
there seems to be a growing sentiment

958
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,679
that people feel like it's hard to

959
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,960
differentiate themselves and you know I

960
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,358
think the majority of people who get

961
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,440
into breeding they're doing it for

962
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,119
passion and there's a part of them that

963
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,960
doesn't want to be perceived as you know

964
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,079
just producing a run-of-the-mill thing

965
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,480
that's like everyone else you know

966
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,839
everyone would like to produce something

967
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,400
that's unique and is going to stand up

968
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:19,920
do you have any advice for how someone

969
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,559
might be able to do

970
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,960
that well you know uh just recommend

971
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:32,200
that somebody you know find something

972
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:35,559
they they really like and just focus on

973
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:38,879
you know like one or two things because

974
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,640
uh um you know for example the way I do

975
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,640
things

976
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:49,558
uh it it's it's difficult it's it's not

977
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:51,598
entirely fun um and you know I think uh

978
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:54,559
I am gonna you know eventually here be

979
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,039
changing to you know just focusing on

980
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,400
you know a couple few things

981
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,119
and just you know really really try to

982
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,400
you

983
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,559
know you know work those things until

984
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,519
they're just amazing you know what I

985
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:13,040
mean versus you know all kinds of

986
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,759
different things e you know it gets

987
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,400
watered down so as long as you're

988
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,119
focused on something that just you know

989
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,760
is really you you're really passionate

990
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,680
about that that that would be that would

991
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,920
that would probably be the best bet

992
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,879
yeah definitely I I feel like if you're

993
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,000
passionate about something chances are

994
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,358
other people will be passionate about it

995
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,199
also and and even just from the

996
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,838
perspective of if you're passionate

997
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,399
about it people would be like oh like it

998
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:47,400
must have something to offer if that's

999
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,639
what you're really focused on you know

1000
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,880
right right right you know interesting

1001
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,358
okay one of the new favorite questions

1002
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,680
I've been asking a lot of people is

1003
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,480
without being being able to know

1004
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,719
anything about the individual cuz

1005
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,039
obviously you'd prefer to know specifics

1006
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,959
but without being able to know anything

1007
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:06,199
about the individual if you could only

1008
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,519
recommend one pack as just something

1009
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:10,399
where you think majority of people are

1010
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,960
going to be pretty happy with what they

1011
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:17,880
find inside of it what would be your

1012
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,880
go-to sort of offering for the general

1013
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:25,679
public um I mean uh uh there there's

1014
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,680
there's a there's a few but uh I think

1015
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:31,199
uh anything uh from the big bad wolves

1016
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:35,159
th those are you know kind of tried and

1017
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:38,799
true um you know shout out to Nato for

1018
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:41,558
sure uh you know his headband times

1019
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,079
KMD that that one I don't think

1020
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:48,000
anybody's found found a pack that hasn't

1021
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:51,039
had all kinds of gold in it so you know

1022
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,400
um I mean both the KMD and the headband

1023
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:57,759
breed really

1024
00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:01,280
well um yeah those ones are pretty tra

1025
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,480
and true that's music to my ears because

1026
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,480
I as soon as I got my hands on a pack of

1027
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,960
that cemd headband I put it away I was

1028
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,358
like this is the

1029
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,960
one right right beautiful stuff

1030
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,558
beautiful stuff I um you know you you've

1031
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,400
sort of touched on it and a lot of

1032
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,960
people are getting super hyped for the

1033
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,960
fact that uh you have some fun collabs

1034
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,800
coming up you know some with Noto some

1035
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,760
with Matt are you able to touch on some

1036
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,599
of the finer points I specifically one

1037
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,280
of the fans was Keen to hear a bit about

1038
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:37,000
the upcoming gel project or

1039
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:40,390
gel yeah yeah yeah yeah um I mean uh you

1040
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,960
know here's hoping to it reverses all

1041
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:45,920
[Laughter]

1042
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,960
right oh you know you never know you

1043
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,079
never know I emphasize that pretty much

1044
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:56,480
always you know

1045
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:59,599
uh total total tangent um

1046
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,519
I I just recently reversed a cherry

1047
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,640
pie and wow I fig I figured that one

1048
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,719
that one was like you

1049
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:11,279
know kick back relax watch the pollen

1050
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,558
fly right because you know Cherry Pie's

1051
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,280
a Herm you

1052
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:21,240
know it's it's gonna be easy uh complete

1053
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:27,440
fail I the the run is drawing right now

1054
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:29,838
but if I got 1% seed yeah I'm lucky

1055
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,159
so you know I don't I don't count

1056
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:35,239
chickens or I try not to and every time

1057
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,838
I do I get

1058
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:39,719
slapped wow I mean you know I've got to

1059
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,000
ask what sort of plants would you be

1060
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:46,159
most interested in pairing cherry pie

1061
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,960
with um I I I definitely you know wanted

1062
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,799
I always want s1's that's my main goal

1063
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,159
every time I do a reversal because I

1064
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,480
like digging through the s1's and you

1065
00:47:54,159 --> 00:48:02,440
know pull pulling plants out um but uh

1066
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:06,358
um I I had a a Bed full of granddaddy

1067
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:11,119
purple uh purple Urkel Grape Ape uh some

1068
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:12,558
of the Urkel s1s um and then uh I had

1069
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,760
the you know the opposite end of the

1070
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:20,280
spectrum you know uh you know ogs you

1071
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:23,400
know uh TKS sour D's you know that kind

1072
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,760
of stuff so you know and then you know a

1073
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,079
few few Inbetweeners you know

1074
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,400
um you got you got me thinking now when

1075
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:34,400
you do these reversals is it all very

1076
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,480
Ultra methodical in terms of what

1077
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,599
females go in the room or is it the case

1078
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,199
that because you got so much going on

1079
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,359
it's sort of like you've always got a

1080
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:45,759
good rotation of moms and you just sort

1081
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:50,039
of Chuck in what's ready to go oh no no

1082
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:54,960
no it's it's methodical um I I I try to

1083
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:57,318
do uh I I I try to you know do multiple

1084
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,400
different you know pairings like pair of

1085
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:02,000
things that are like kind pair of things

1086
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,358
that are opposite kind you know and then

1087
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,280
you know pair of things that are you

1088
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:09,519
know whatever whatever you know that I

1089
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:13,720
just think might might be cool um but uh

1090
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:15,440
I overdo it on on clone production like

1091
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:19,639
you know in an average month I'll

1092
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,639
probably you know end up taking I don't

1093
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:27,000
know couple thousand

1094
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:30,159
clones and then so I always or usually

1095
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,639
have a really you know broad pool to

1096
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:36,239
select what I want to put into these

1097
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:39,199
rooms and so you know I usually get what

1098
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,959
I want in my rooms not always but

1099
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:44,399
usually that's beautiful and I mean you

1100
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,119
you open the floodgates I feel like how

1101
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,880
on Earth like what's your clone Tech how

1102
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:53,280
on Earth do you do

1103
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:56,160
that just uh just just plugs and I also

1104
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,519
I use uh like big plugs

1105
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,480
um you know 50 per tray but they're like

1106
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:07,119
2in plugs whatever and uh

1107
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,679
um and that that allows me time because

1108
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,160
you know the plugs are big enough so the

1109
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:14,358
you know the Clones can sit in those

1110
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:18,159
plugs for you know three four five you

1111
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:21,199
know six weeks you know sometimes and so

1112
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:23,279
uh you know I'm able to have you know

1113
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,598
clones on deck for you know because if

1114
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,920
you're feeding you know five different

1115
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:31,920
rooms you're always trying to you know

1116
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,519
you need that stuff ready sure and do

1117
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,720
you have like a go-to rooting stimulant

1118
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:42,079
or is just variable I just use basical

1119
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,439
clonex um liquid you know uh and and dip

1120
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:48,280
and grow so you know neither of those is

1121
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,760
organic my cloning is not organic

1122
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,280
folks yeah no that makes sense so if we

1123
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,000
loot back you know you mentioned that

1124
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,440
you're trying to reverse first the jel

1125
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,798
what sort of plants do you think would

1126
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,920
pair really well with the

1127
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:09,239
jel I mean uh you know definitely chems

1128
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:11,519
ogs uh you know um diesels you know

1129
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:13,679
they'll kind of compound but you know

1130
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:18,480
everybody does that too the ones that

1131
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:20,679
you know are uh um you know a

1132
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,760
little a little bit of a mystery

1133
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,759
definitely would like to have some hash

1134
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:30,440
plants in there you know some p some

1135
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:34,960
hp13 that kind of stuff um you know I

1136
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,760
tend to with so like with Gil you know I

1137
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,440
would generally tend to stay away from

1138
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,480
fruity stuff you know like Cherry AK

1139
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:46,240
Strawberry Cough you know that kind of

1140
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,240
stuff um and I don't know if jel would

1141
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,000
be the greatest thing to you know slap

1142
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,078
against Girl Scout cookies or wedding

1143
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,159
cake or fritters or you know that kind

1144
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,920
of stuff like I don't I don't I don't

1145
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:02,159
think think Skittles would be in you

1146
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,798
know a gel run I don't know uh that

1147
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,199
might just get

1148
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:07,759
weird I mean it sort of makes sense like

1149
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:09,519
when you're saying it out loud I'm like

1150
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,040
yeah I I get the impression it would

1151
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,280
like dominate them and and like sort of

1152
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:16,639
model it a

1153
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,040
bit yeah yeah um so you know I

1154
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:22,400
definitely try for for like kinds but

1155
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:24,279
then you know something like you know uh

1156
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,280
some of the hash plants mixed with it

1157
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,760
you know they def only can you know make

1158
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,480
something decent I'd imagine yeah

1159
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,040
beautiful beautiful and you know if we I

1160
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,838
mean in my mind I sort of associated the

1161
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,279
the jel collab with Matt and I've heard

1162
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:44,440
you may be doing a headband collab with

1163
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:47,240
Noto is that correct oh uh well I mean

1164
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,720
uh it it might be a different type of

1165
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:51,118
collab of sorts uh you know we're we're

1166
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:53,679
we're still working out the details

1167
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,599
let's put it that way beautiful I know I

1168
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,358
know everyone's really really really

1169
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,440
Keen to to see that that take off you

1170
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:03,519
know cuz I mean I'd be interested to

1171
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,760
hear how do you compare that headband

1172
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,639
the LA Kush to other headbands is it

1173
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,400
similar is it different what do you like

1174
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:14,318
about

1175
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:19,280
it I mean uh NATO's headband is like a

1176
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:21,199
strong uh like diesel plant um other

1177
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,000
other headbands you know there's there's

1178
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:26,598
multiple OG Kush type headbands there's

1179
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,719
the 56 day head band there's Loompa

1180
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:32,160
headband both of those are you know just

1181
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:35,719
straight up OG cush types um then

1182
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:39,519
there's the 707 Headband which was like

1183
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:41,798
a OG sour diesel type you know um that

1184
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:44,880
was popular around here you know like 15

1185
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:50,639
years ago or longer

1186
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:54,160
um but uh um NATO's headband is is

1187
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,679
really similar uh to this this cut that

1188
00:53:54,159 --> 00:54:01,440
circulated around

1189
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:06,639
um like I don't know 15 15 to 18 years

1190
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:10,440
ago and uh multiple people uh had this

1191
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:13,519
cut as like a chem dog 91 but it was a

1192
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,358
sour diesel type plant you know I mean

1193
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:19,960
docta of archive you know got got this

1194
00:54:16,358 --> 00:54:24,000
plant as chem 91 and then uh I think

1195
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,760
Loompa Loompa got it as chem 91 too and

1196
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,079
the it was these

1197
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,720
plants like a sour diesel type plant

1198
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,280
just like uh NATO's

1199
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,039
headband

1200
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,440
um so I don't know I don't even know how

1201
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,920
they they got named as chem dogs or

1202
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,358
headbands or what it was

1203
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,960
just uh little strange a little strange

1204
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:47,679
but good quality

1205
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:50,838
plants do you do you know is that the uh

1206
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:55,879
the the JB Kim 91

1207
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:58,960
cut oh no no no no no the JB uh um I I

1208
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:02,559
got that that cut uh I don't know maybe

1209
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:07,318
15 years ago um or so and the JB was

1210
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:10,440
like uh I actually ran the JB next to um

1211
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:15,400
that other that sour diesel type chem 91

1212
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:18,400
cut um and the chem 91 was like this big

1213
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,160
Burly diesel plant whereas the JB was

1214
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,440
like this skinny little sad sister to

1215
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:26,558
sour d i mean just just in my side by

1216
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,920
sides you know

1217
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:33,200
one person's experience but I didn't

1218
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,798
have a whole lot of respect for the JB

1219
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,279
the JB

1220
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:39,559
one there you go yeah look I mean it

1221
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,319
goes to show just the sheer amount of

1222
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:45,760
cuts that are incorrectly named Kim

1223
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:48,239
91 right oh it was it was bad it was bad

1224
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,880
and it still is I mean you know there's

1225
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:55,318
there's tons of chem 91s going around

1226
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,760
you know right on the on the topic of

1227
00:55:55,318 --> 00:56:00,719
purple strains I wanted to talk to you

1228
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,079
about the pink and perss this is one you

1229
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,919
did you know it's it took place in

1230
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,318
between now and our last chat so we

1231
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,880
didn't talk about it last time right I

1232
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:10,480
remember when you first started posting

1233
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,280
about this the first thing I wanted to

1234
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,000
ask was what is it about this line that

1235
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,440
really captivated you cuz it seems like

1236
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,159
you were really interested in it and I

1237
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,400
was like it looks cool but you know I

1238
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:25,038
can't smell it I can't taste it what did

1239
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:27,960
you like about it okay so pinks and pers

1240
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:31,039
kind of started out as a mystery for me

1241
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,159
um I was I was touring my buddy uh Shiva

1242
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:38,240
I was touring his farm in

1243
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:41,399
mesino and he had made uh this hybrid

1244
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:44,519
that was like dogs Waltz the the purple

1245
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,960
dog um that was you know pretty popular

1246
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:52,838
around here for a while

1247
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:56,519
um he had made a hybrid with that um and

1248
00:56:52,838 --> 00:57:00,679
uh oh what did he oh he he crossed it to

1249
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:02,559
Afghan number one right and he had

1250
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:04,118
crossed a bunch of different things with

1251
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,960
that Afghan

1252
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:09,680
one um

1253
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,838
and everything else was just

1254
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:17,960
green and this dogs Waltz this you know

1255
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:21,199
purple dog bud or purple dog purple dog

1256
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:25,199
um every plant in his garden pretty much

1257
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:28,358
of that that cross had dark purple

1258
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:31,000
almost black flowers and pink

1259
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:34,558
hairs you know like bright fluorescent

1260
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,480
pink or almost red hairs

1261
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:42,240
and I'm like well all these other

1262
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:45,159
hybrids with the Afghani one are green

1263
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:47,919
so they probably didn't get any of this

1264
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:50,920
you know purple and you know pink hairs

1265
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,880
from the the Afghan one and I'm like

1266
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,358
I've grown dogs Walts I've grown that

1267
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,358
you know purple dog

1268
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,358
and this stuff doesn't look anything

1269
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:03,598
like it it doesn't purple like that it

1270
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:06,000
doesn't have you know pink hairs and so

1271
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:11,240
I backtracked and our buddy

1272
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:16,159
Blaze he had made a hybrid um of this

1273
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:19,879
Killer Queen uh meno purple cross to a

1274
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:22,879
Hawaiian and that the Hawaiian had pink

1275
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:26,400
hairs and then the meno Pur in that uh

1276
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,039
you know uh pushes its purple forward

1277
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,680
and he had actually made it F2 and he's

1278
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,640
the one who had given the the dogs Waltz

1279
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:35,759
to

1280
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:38,118
Shiva and so I was like you know I think

1281
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:42,559
I think I think you uh might have given

1282
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:44,880
him the wrong cut you know and uh our

1283
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,559
our buddy NCGA was the one who made the

1284
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,200
the Killer Queen meno perss and now you

1285
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:52,760
know we're we're backtracked all the way

1286
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:56,719
to like 200 what3 or something

1287
00:58:52,760 --> 00:59:00,240
2002 um anyways so I I had to

1288
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:02,239
investigate this all the way back and I

1289
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,479
you know finally figured that it wasn't

1290
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:09,038
what it was supposed to be it was you

1291
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,798
know this totally different thing um but

1292
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:13,000
uh you know I I liked it when I saw to

1293
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:15,719
his farm and he gave me a huge you know

1294
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,599
container of seeds and I ran out like

1295
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:20,159
180 of them and made an open pollination

1296
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,519
made a bunch of selections blah blah

1297
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,159
blah and then I ended up finding one of

1298
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:25,159
my favorite plants I found in a few

1299
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,078
years

1300
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:28,838
you know out of that which is uh the

1301
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,000
sweet

1302
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:34,599
16 what's she

1303
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,920
like she I mean no two people I I

1304
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:40,280
brought her to the the party uh that

1305
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,639
that Matt threw and uh no two people

1306
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,880
could describe her the same I mean I

1307
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:48,400
think she's like mango pineapple other

1308
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,480
people are saying like apple this um

1309
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,760
some people said mango some said

1310
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,920
Pineapple some said Apple it's like no

1311
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,559
PE no two people smelled smelled her the

1312
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,599
same but she was like one of the few

1313
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:05,839
that was like a green one in the whole

1314
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:07,720
bunch out of 180 um and full of seeds

1315
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:10,318
you know after just sitting for you know

1316
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:12,798
months or whatever just drying because I

1317
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:17,679
kind of neglected the the finish on that

1318
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:19,920
run um she rre and usually Mo most

1319
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:21,118
things don't smell you know when they've

1320
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,798
just been sitting

1321
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,720
forever and so she holds her tpin really

1322
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:31,599
well which is which is prettyy rare you

1323
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:35,199
know especially as strong as she was so

1324
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,519
you know um definitely one of my recent

1325
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,679
favorites yeah wow it sounds like a

1326
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,480
really unique profile as well like

1327
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,639
because you don't hear a lot about Apple

1328
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,318
profiles I feel like that's also a very

1329
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:49,798
underrepresented

1330
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:52,679
flavor right right kind of like the

1331
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:54,519
XP yeah you know what I forgot about

1332
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,679
that you know do you do you find that

1333
01:00:54,519 --> 01:01:00,199
tpine commonly in the

1334
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:03,639
x18 I mean when when I grew her yeah it

1335
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:05,759
was it was nice but that smelled like

1336
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:07,679
apple to me where I I don't get the

1337
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,079
Apple from the sweet 16 but other people

1338
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:14,598
do so you know okay interesting what so

1339
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:18,640
you're you get more of the uh the mango

1340
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:22,280
pineapple I guess yeah yeah yeah yeah

1341
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:25,318
wow everybody different yeah sure and

1342
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,400
and do you feel like it's like a hybrid

1343
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:32,199
sort of effect is it more indicia

1344
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:36,880
leaning um she almost seems a little bit

1345
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:40,480
more of a sativa effect to me yeah yeah

1346
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,838
I I honestly think she might be like a a

1347
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:47,039
throwback to uh the Killer Queen which

1348
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:50,599
is a Cindy 99

1349
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:54,480
hybrid um I think it's like a G13

1350
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:57,680
c99 but I mean that's that's a lot of

1351
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,119
lot of generations past that yeah I

1352
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:00,798
guess I was thinking about you also

1353
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,960
mentioned the Hawaiian I was thinking

1354
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:06,838
maybe it's sort of coming from both ways

1355
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,400
yeah it could be it could be wow all

1356
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:10,639
right that's that's more higher on my

1357
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,079
list to to give a good run because I I'm

1358
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:15,038
always keen on

1359
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:17,640
sativas yeah yeah yeah I mean on that

1360
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,480
topic you know you mentioned the uh the

1361
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:21,519
pink 16 one of your favorite in the past

1362
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:24,000
few years and earlier on in the episode

1363
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,559
you mentioned being really fond of the

1364
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,920
lemon tree I wanted to ask you a few

1365
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,480
questions about it because I have had a

1366
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,559
few people message me and say you know

1367
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,278
is is lemon party lemon tree that's the

1368
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:40,000
first question I

1369
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:45,199
guess um so I think um I think lemon

1370
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:49,159
party um might be an

1371
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:53,278
S1 possibly hybrid but uh either a S1 or

1372
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:56,719
hybrid of lemon tree um I think it might

1373
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:58,278
have come from like straight Organics

1374
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:02,519
and

1375
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:04,599
um it it it's like a a tall lanky plant

1376
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:07,960
at least it is for me it's a tall lanky

1377
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:10,880
plant and it's it's like just as pungent

1378
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,240
as Tangi like just over the top you know

1379
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:19,760
Candi just you know fruit but more on

1380
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:22,239
the lemon lemon tur profile um and uh

1381
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:28,200
then then lemon tree is like this short

1382
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:32,038
you know Stumpy Kush type plant um with

1383
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:35,759
just you know super pungent um just

1384
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:37,599
strong strong like lemon oil type

1385
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,799
turs

1386
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,480
more I'm terrible at describing this

1387
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:44,358
kind of stuff but that's that's kind of

1388
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,599
as close as I can get um they're both

1389
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:50,400
great plants but you know quite quite a

1390
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,440
bit different and yeah i' I've heard

1391
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,400
from some of the some of the guys uh you

1392
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:57,599
know that are real familiar with with

1393
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:00,480
lemon tree is you know you you do get uh

1394
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:04,160
some of the um some of the lankier

1395
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,760
sativa type plants coming out of them um

1396
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:09,159
there there's a bit of mystery to it I

1397
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,799
don't know if you know because uh some

1398
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:14,078
of them say it might might might have

1399
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:16,079
come from a orgon and it could be like a

1400
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,519
old Oregon Lemon

1401
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:22,640
Diesel I don't know yeah interesting

1402
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:25,920
okay and then so in that case which one

1403
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:27,920
do you like more

1404
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,559
h i

1405
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,680
mean I kind of like lemon

1406
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,359
party you know I mean that sort of makes

1407
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:39,480
sense in a lot of ways and I mean when

1408
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:41,440
you described it that sort of checks out

1409
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,880
a little more with the common lineage

1410
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,798
you hear which is like this meant to be

1411
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,240
what like a sour diesel Lemon Skunk sort

1412
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:49,880
of

1413
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:52,479
thing yeah yeah so something like that

1414
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:56,278
um it it's definitely one of the the

1415
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:58,199
most pungent plants um I've come across

1416
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:00,000
you know you run it with 50 other

1417
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:02,759
different hybrids and it's the only

1418
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,960
thing you can smell in the room you

1419
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:10,278
know wow that's beautiful I got a a pack

1420
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:11,920
of yours of the um the Melvin cross to

1421
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:13,760
the lemon party I was like man that

1422
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,798
one's going to be a

1423
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:19,720
hitter right right right now that one

1424
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,519
could be very very good yeah like what I

1425
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:24,838
was thinking it should be like citrus

1426
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:27,960
Central right like just exploding oh

1427
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:30,400
yeah yeah no definitely definitely yeah

1428
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,480
yeah that's cool okay and then I guess

1429
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,880
the final question on this one for me is

1430
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:39,838
I guess in a sense the lemon party s1s

1431
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,920
are essentially lemon tree

1432
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:46,318
S2s as long as the lemon party is like

1433
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,278
an S1 you know

1434
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:50,400
definitely yeah that's cool man I I know

1435
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,639
I feel like you're one of the only

1436
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:57,440
people who really gets into the S2s hard

1437
01:05:52,639 --> 01:06:01,199
I love it right right oh I'm I'm a huge

1438
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:03,519
fan of them you know yeah there we go do

1439
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,558
you do you offer any S3s at the

1440
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:10,798
moment no no and I haven't even offered

1441
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:14,000
any of my S you know legit S2s I I mean

1442
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:17,239
sure I probably have a few S2s but you

1443
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,278
know I'm they're not marketed as as S2s

1444
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:23,598
because I can't you know claim 100% that

1445
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:24,719
they S2s you know sure I mean and

1446
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,838
honestly

1447
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:29,919
most people I don't think would be

1448
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,400
extremely thrilled running out some S2s

1449
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,920
or S3s you know or the very least S3s

1450
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:38,358
you know yeah yeah true true it's

1451
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,119
different they they're sort of looking

1452
01:06:38,358 --> 01:06:44,078
for that Vigor yeah the lack of vigor

1453
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:47,240
just might not be the ticket so yeah

1454
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,039
okay I mean while we're on the topic I I

1455
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:50,199
I don't think we asked it earlier so I

1456
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,920
definitely got to ask it because it was

1457
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:55,118
submitted by three different fans what

1458
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,318
is the most interesting thing you've

1459
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:01,640
ever see come out of an S1 like really

1460
01:06:57,318 --> 01:07:05,199
just unexpected left of field huh um I

1461
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:11,759
think I posted pictures of it uh years

1462
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:14,719
ago on a on ID um uh I had this

1463
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,160
plant uh I think I I posted pictures of

1464
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:20,159
it was tight it might have got to two

1465
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:21,358
inches tall and but it was on its like

1466
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,399
20th

1467
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:27,400
node it was like a ball was like a

1468
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,278
little blue blue green

1469
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:34,400
ball it was like I had it for like six

1470
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:36,519
months and it was two inches tall at

1471
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,880
best I

1472
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:42,318
mean not the mut most people would

1473
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,960
want yeah and when I tried flowering out

1474
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:47,558
it

1475
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:52,240
died I was all sad it was not meant for

1476
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:54,880
this cruw world no it was it was a sad

1477
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:57,679
little ball of a plant

1478
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:01,519
oh wow I love it that's so cool you just

1479
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:05,639
reminded me of that incredible photo

1480
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:07,239
that uh Noto posted of that Mosaic Plant

1481
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:10,199
in your garden can you tell us a bit

1482
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:13,719
about that one oh that was in a a garden

1483
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:15,759
he was working with um but uh um I mean

1484
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:18,679
you know he's he's way more familiar

1485
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:20,159
with that uh there was a huge debate I

1486
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,719
never even ended up reading all the

1487
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:25,759
comments because it got a little too

1488
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:30,359
crazy um but but I mean a lot of people

1489
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:33,600
you know think that's a um you know a a

1490
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:35,520
virus or something blah blah blah but

1491
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,960
it's just as likely that it's just a

1492
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:43,520
genetic you know mutation as any virus

1493
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:46,880
so um you know hyp told me years ago you

1494
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,120
know when when when Kim D first was you

1495
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,000
know getting into circulation he was

1496
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:54,039
like you know that's just a genetic you

1497
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:58,238
know blah blah blah and not no stink

1498
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:59,920
virus and if if something's a virus you

1499
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:03,439
kind of expect it

1500
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:06,719
to pass on somewhere and when they don't

1501
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,599
like pass on I think it's probably just

1502
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:12,079
a genetic something

1503
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,440
something so what what's your verdict on

1504
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:15,359
variegation you know because there's

1505
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,519
still some people who are really adamant

1506
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:20,798
in their belief that it's a form of a

1507
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,440
virus and then other people are like no

1508
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:26,158
I think it's just a

1509
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:29,399
trait yeah I think it can be either or

1510
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:31,960
you know I I think you know if if you

1511
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:35,119
have a something that's variegated and

1512
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:37,880
you know it's in your rooms for x amount

1513
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:42,599
of years and then it passes on or it

1514
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:45,719
passes on um obviously it's a a virus

1515
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:48,719
but I mean I don't take any more you

1516
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:51,198
know time with a chmd cut you

1517
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,480
know you know taking clones or any of

1518
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,960
that kind of stuff and it's never passed

1519
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:59,959
on on so that just leans leans towards

1520
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,679
it's just a it's just a genetic trait

1521
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:05,000
you

1522
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:06,880
know I mean so yeah interesting

1523
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,520
interesting and you know it's been a

1524
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,239
while since we chatted so although it's

1525
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,679
sort of old news we just going to touch

1526
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,559
on it quickly how have you been affected

1527
01:10:12,679 --> 01:10:21,719
by hopl and

1528
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:24,360
vroid um so um back in like 2011 2012 I

1529
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:28,399
think it was um

1530
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:31,799
I uh I had gotten you know um I was

1531
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:34,198
doing some heavy trading with people and

1532
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,920
I'd gotten a bunch of cuts from you know

1533
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:39,158
jungle boys that you know before they

1534
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:41,800
were jungle boys and you know a few

1535
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:42,599
other cats I'll I'll let them name

1536
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:47,400
remain

1537
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,400
nameless um but I got just tons of this

1538
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:51,799
you

1539
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:56,039
know these messed up you know plants and

1540
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:58,960
uh I got the white fire uh the uh jungle

1541
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:03,640
boys you know five keeper plants of

1542
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:06,239
white fire the 43 the 80 the 28 you know

1543
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,760
and I grew them out and I'm like who

1544
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,399
would ever keep these plants they're

1545
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,760
complete garbage right they they all

1546
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:16,679
Herm they there's no Frost you know they

1547
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,800
look like crap and you know I have my

1548
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:21,319
the rest of my room looks great and

1549
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,719
anyways fast forward found out you know

1550
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:25,759
it was some kind of something you know

1551
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:27,719
they didn't figure out to years later

1552
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,760
but I figured out get rid of those

1553
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:34,560
[ __ ] plants you know and so you know

1554
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,320
I I quarantine everything you know

1555
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,480
especially more so now you know ever

1556
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:43,238
since like 2014 I'm like uhuh you don't

1557
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:49,000
come in unless you you got

1558
01:11:43,238 --> 01:11:51,638
papers uh but uh you know uh so uh you

1559
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,920
know i' I've definitely had had plants

1560
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:56,639
that you know were were positive but

1561
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,119
they've always in you know I've always

1562
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:04,119
quarantined them knew they were and so I

1563
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:08,639
either throw them away or you know uh

1564
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:12,439
um or keep them segregated um so I I

1565
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:16,079
haven't had any any HP uh whatever

1566
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:19,399
whatever any of that virus in in my room

1567
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:22,479
and probably a damn near a

1568
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:25,559
decade do you think that it'll be like

1569
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:27,399
um it'll be a a virus that sort of just

1570
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,960
dies out eventually cuz I feel like when

1571
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:30,319
I talk to people a lot of people are

1572
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,079
like you and they're like I now know

1573
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,880
what I need to do and I I don't feel

1574
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,519
like I've had it for quite a while do

1575
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,920
you think it'll it'll die out or do you

1576
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,679
think it'll be like the flu with humans

1577
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,279
where it just it just sort of circulates

1578
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,440
around and it's always there but it's

1579
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:46,359
sort of in the

1580
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:49,039
background it's really easy to not you

1581
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:52,599
know uh keep it from not

1582
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:54,800
spreading um you know uh just don't

1583
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,440
bring it in your rooms you know and it's

1584
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,000
really easy to spot I mean um ever since

1585
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:04,678
I got rid of you know um all the plants

1586
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,079
that had it you know years ago um you

1587
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:10,359
know and it started doing protocol you

1588
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:12,600
know of not introducing stuff you know

1589
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:15,279
straight into my rooms from strange

1590
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:18,320
Gardens um you know I haven't had a

1591
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:20,198
problem with it so you know I I think

1592
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:25,840
it's going to stay around because a lot

1593
01:13:20,198 --> 01:13:29,079
of people are sloppy you know you know I

1594
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,039
mean I I I have plenty of stories of

1595
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:32,600
bringing the wrong plant into the garden

1596
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:36,439
so

1597
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:38,880
yeah definitely definitely definitely I

1598
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:40,759
wanted to ask you about it because I've

1599
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,920
been wondering for a while the ruthless

1600
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,800
runs Cuts how is that different to

1601
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,000
normal runs and is it really connected

1602
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:52,560
to the rbl

1603
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,039
posy yes it is and uh um I think I

1604
01:13:52,560 --> 01:14:00,039
should just like um you know

1605
01:13:56,039 --> 01:14:00,039
uh keep quiet on that

1606
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,719
one I mean rbl is gangster rappers so

1607
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,239
you you probably don't want to tell them

1608
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:13,679
what their cut

1609
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:18,678
is um what what I will say though

1610
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:23,399
is uh for what it is it's a great cut um

1611
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:29,039
it um is one of the most stable cuts um

1612
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:33,839
that I've S1 and bred with um it uh is

1613
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:35,519
very potent and passes the potency on um

1614
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,760
and it's very

1615
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,280
uniform um but uh I have a hunt that

1616
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,199
it's an S1 of something else and there

1617
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:48,439
might not be any z in

1618
01:14:44,198 --> 01:14:50,839
it so I mean do you feel like runs

1619
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:53,279
really expresses a ton of Z generally

1620
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:56,039
speaking cuz I've felt like whenever I

1621
01:14:53,279 --> 01:15:03,158
tried runs I was like this is just

1622
01:14:56,039 --> 01:15:05,639
gelato uh so um I I have runs as well or

1623
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:08,119
just regular runs and yeah there's

1624
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:10,199
there's plenty of z in it okay yeah so

1625
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:13,158
maybe I just been having ruthless

1626
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:16,719
runs yeah essentially

1627
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:19,559
essentially makes sense it makes sense I

1628
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:22,158
mean out of curiosity why do you think

1629
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,320
like I've noticed that like the sherbet

1630
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:28,479
profile has really really come back into

1631
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:31,079
popularity and it's you know that creamy

1632
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:33,519
gelato sort of vibe seems to be very

1633
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:35,439
popular with people right do you have

1634
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,760
any suspicions about why that's come

1635
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:38,279
back around because it's almost like it

1636
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,520
had its time in the sun then it got

1637
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:43,359
pushed out of the way but now it's back

1638
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,840
again right obviously people like it I

1639
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:49,759
don't know I

1640
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:55,440
mean h yeah yeah yeah it's a good answer

1641
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:57,280
right know on on on that one uh um uh

1642
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,359
I've never actually run the the cookie

1643
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,920
fam sherbet I've always uh run the the

1644
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:05,759
green sherbet which was you know real

1645
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,239
popular around Humble at Mendo all that

1646
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:11,159
which is the one that you know seems

1647
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:12,158
like it's probably related more directly

1648
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:15,238
to

1649
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:17,879
Skittles you know whereas the sunset

1650
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:19,158
sherbet from cookie fan that's that's

1651
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,719
the one that's you

1652
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,679
know uh you know more more jaw aesque I

1653
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,800
think

1654
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,679
yeah that's certainly the flavor profile

1655
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,760
I think has been really popular

1656
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:34,079
recently yeah

1657
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:36,840
yeah y well we've got an interesting fan

1658
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:39,238
submitted one here they say this is all

1659
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,760
hypothetical but I suspect it relates to

1660
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:42,439
them um but they're saying you know if

1661
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,840
you were to live in like a prohibited

1662
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:46,839
State and the market there's no good

1663
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,279
weed you know no one even really knows

1664
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,800
what OG is what cookies is you could

1665
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,519
probably give them anything and say it's

1666
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,679
OG and if it was good weed they'd be

1667
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:58,719
like right right on um so the question

1668
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,399
is if you live in such an area what

1669
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,158
strains that you offer in seed form

1670
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:05,399
would you say would be a good thing

1671
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:08,399
where like you know it it's going to

1672
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:09,638
give someone like a quality end product

1673
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,519
they're going to be able to offer

1674
01:17:09,639 --> 01:17:13,440
something that's sort of not currently

1675
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,520
available what would you offer to

1676
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:17,279
someone who's in like an environment

1677
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,000
where it's just ample playing field to

1678
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:22,599
pump out some nice

1679
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
herb I mean I you know I always I always

1680
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,320
recommend the the the big bad wolves

1681
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,760
just because they got the potency you

1682
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:34,238
know super strong they stink and and you

1683
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,320
know they they've got pretty good yields

1684
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:40,919
too you know I mean when when I first

1685
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:44,359
ran the the one big bad wolf I mean if I

1686
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,719
had to kept that that cut uh I could I

1687
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,960
could be doing some four pounds of

1688
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:50,119
lights right

1689
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:52,399

1695
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:07,199
there been any major changes to the way

1696
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:08,359
in which you grow have you switched over

1697
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:12,119
to

1698
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:14,000

derbs um and a few other things a few

1735
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:08,198
other things but uh you know get getting

1736
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:10,158
away from the whole uh uh dessert I

1737
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:12,158
think the the last time I I did mostly

1738
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:14,198
dessert dessert

1739
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:17,039
products I want something a little

1740
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:20,638
different this time yeah understandable

1741
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,479
for sure understandable um I guess I'd

1742
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,920
be Keen to know you know this is

1743
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:25,879
probably going to be a weird question

1744
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,800
happy to happy to cut it out if it

1745
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:30,359
doesn't fit um what has been a line of

1746
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,279
yours that you thought would be really

1747
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,559
popular but like it turns out it just

1748
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,800
hasn't quite had as much traction with

1749
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,840
the general

1750
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:42,840
public I mean pinks and purposes are

1751
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:46,400
perfect perfect example um you know I I

1752
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:48,760
really like pink pinks and perss um but

1753
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:51,039
you know I also you know I'm not great

1754
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,520
at marketing either so you know I really

1755
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:56,359
didn't push it like you know I could

1756
01:20:52,520 --> 01:21:00,400
have should but yeah well very very few

1757
01:20:56,359 --> 01:21:03,880
people were like woohoo woohoo you know

1758
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:06,679
so you know we got to change their mind

1759
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,560
I think yeah yeah

1760
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:10,039
yeah that's all right you'll see it on

1761
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,360
my Instagram

1762
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:16,000
soon on uh on the other end of the

1763
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:17,719
spectrum what's what's one of if not

1764
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,359
your most popular lines if you just had

1765
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:23,719
to think off the top of your

1766
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:26,158
head um I mean uh

1767
01:21:23,719 --> 01:21:29,239
every everybody still I

1768
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:33,319
mean o overall people tend to like the

1769
01:21:29,238 --> 01:21:36,919
s1s over the hybrids in general and I

1770

mean the TKS ones the chem DS ones those

1771
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:43,920
are those are always at the top of the

1772
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:46,479
list so yep even even though I I I do

1773
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:49,840
recommend just for solely growing you

1774
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:53,678
know hybrids are you know better than

1775
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:55,840
s1's but s1's are better if you want to

1776
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,399
you know breed your own stuff with them

1777
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,119
make your own

1778
01:21:57,399 --> 01:22:04,198
selections yeah sure sure sure sure

1779
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:07,399
that's that's really interesting okay um

1780
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:10,279
and how much value do you think we we as

1781
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:12,719
a community should place on feno Hunting

1782
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:15,039
you know like I understand that you know

1783
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,480
everyone everyone wants to just run some

1784
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:20,800
keep clones and make some head stash

1785
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:22,879
every so often but me myself I usually

1786
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,000
try to have some new stuff in there most

1787
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,679
rounds to just sort of be at least

1788
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,880
slowly injecting some stuff in what do

1789
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,600
how do you feel about that do you feel

1790
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,359
like we should try to impart some

1791
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,400
impotance that you know there is value

1792
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:39,198
to always sort of having some new stuff

1793
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:41,399
rolling in oh yeah I mean it really

1794
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:44,000
depends on where you're at you know what

1795
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:46,599
what you're you know

1796
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,399
um you know what what what's important

1797
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,440
to you whether it's just personal smoke

1798
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:53,119
or you're you're doing it commercially

1799
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:56,799
or whatever um but I mean

1800
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:59,319
you know uh I don't know honestly uh I

1801
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:02,440
think it's always always good to you

1802
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:05,679
know R run some new with the old you

1803
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:07,359
know yeah definitely definitely I mean

1804
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,960
while we're talking about new and old I

1805
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:10,599
had no idea how I was going to slot

1806
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,760
these questions in but this is it right

1807
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,400
here we're doing it um you know I was

1808
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,199
specifically interested because you'd

1809
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:20,279
got this experience with the

1810
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:23,839
nl5 part of me was wondering is there

1811
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:25,920
any way in which this or just in General

1812
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,960
how your thoughts of Neville and his

1813
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,279
accomplishments have changed over the

1814
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,439
years you know now that you've had

1815
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:33,359
experience with some of these lines he

1816
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:37,559
was working with for example has

1817
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:42,679
anything changed at all I mean not

1818
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:46,159
really um I went through a phase through

1819
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:47,880
through probably the mid late 90s um all

1820
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:49,158
the way through you know probably the

1821
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:52,560
mid

1822
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:54,119
2000s where um I grew up in Humble so I

1823
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,280
wasn't really impressed with anything

1824
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:59,639
from

1825
01:23:56,279 --> 01:24:03,158
Amsterdam you know so you know you

1826
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:04,800
factor that in it's just like you know

1827
01:24:03,158 --> 01:24:06,439
but since then you know I I I've

1828
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,560
realized that there's tons of stuff from

1829
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:11,919
Amsterdam I like I just hadn't you know

1830
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:14,600
I was too stubborn to grow you know a

1831
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,279
bunch of it based on you know early

1832
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,719
formed

1833
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:20,479
opinions sure look I think we can all

1834
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,880
acknowledge that one way or the other

1835
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:24,519
you know maybe the opposite way for a

1836
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:27,079
lot of Growers you know they they they

1837
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:29,880
end up lording DNA genetics only to

1838
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:32,158
realize it's not as good as they thought

1839
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:34,600
on in that same sort of school of

1840
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:36,079
thought what's your thoughts on Shanti

1841
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,440
would you ever consider buying and

1842
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:41,000
growing Mr Nice Guy or is there a bit

1843
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:42,839
like too many concerns about the current

1844
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:47,319
gear versus the older

1845
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:51,279
gear uh I have so much to grow H it

1846
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:55,158
would be very hard to you know

1847
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:59,559
experiment with you know you know new

1848
01:24:55,158 --> 01:25:01,679
new stuff other stuff yeah so with that

1849
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:04,280
being said then who who were some of the

1850
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:08,719
Breeders who you at least now you know

1851
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:08,719
have held in high esteem from Years Gone

1852
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:17,399
by that's a good one

1853
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:20,760
um I used to really like DJ

1854
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:23,399
um but you know then I talked to

1855
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:26,280
DJ so

1856
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:28,599
I mean I don't know

1857
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:31,000
uh yeah

1858
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:34,239
um I I kind of

1859
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,118
hoped I would have learned more from DJ

1860
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:42,000
sure he's he's very much an enigma isn't

1861
01:25:37,118 --> 01:25:43,479
he yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh I'll

1862
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,760
probably cut this out but what what's

1863
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:49,718
your thoughts on um JD and the whole

1864
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,719
blueberry Bubba

1865
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,880
clams JD's ENT tning that's all I'll

1866
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,960
say right definitely definitely he's

1867
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:02,159
he's a character he's a

1868
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:04,560
character see now you don't have to cut

1869
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:07,399
cut it out you're too good to me you're

1870
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,400
too good to me um I think that just

1871
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:11,638
about brings us to our final five

1872
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:13,599
questions and they've evolved a bit

1873
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:16,800
since the last time we spoke so the

1874
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,480
first one is if you had to restart your

1875
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,360
company let's just say you know one of

1876
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,839
those horrible fires rips through your

1877
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:26,079
property I hope that never happens but

1878
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,360
let's just say hypothetically it did you

1879
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,399
had to restart your company from scratch

1880
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:32,839
with just one packet of seeds that

1881
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:34,039
you've made can be regular can be fem

1882
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,440
you can do whatever you want you know

1883
01:26:34,039 --> 01:26:38,319
you could find a female and reverse it

1884
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:41,638
what one pack of seeds are you going to

1885
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:47,359
pick to restart the company with damn

1886
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:47,359
just one pack yeah it's tough

1887
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:54,960
damn huh

1888
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:57,279
uh how about pinear Kush oh that's a

1889
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,158
solid Pig Tom i' be

1890
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,238
happy no I love pinear Kush when I ran

1891
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:04,238
it

1892
01:27:01,238 --> 01:27:07,039
out I want to revisit that one because I

1893
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:10,599
swear uh I can I can make some stuff

1894
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:13,600
with pinear that'll remind me of uh some

1895
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:15,480
of the old old stuff I got from my dad

1896
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,039
that you know he he got back in the

1897
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:22,319
early 80s and you know reminisce a

1898
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:24,679
little bit yum that sounds epic cool

1899
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,719
okay so next one we're going to drop you

1900
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,440
off on a desert island you can only take

1901
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,239
three strains with you for the rest of

1902
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:35,118
your life which

1903
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:38,519
three oh three strains how about

1904
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:43,079
uh sweet 16 you know because it's a

1905
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,080
desert island we need some tropical

1906
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:51,519
um uh oh damn how about purple

1907
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:54,480
Indica right for for our strong Indica

1908
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:57,960
Dom and then uh may maybe a nice select

1909
01:27:54,479 --> 01:28:01,718
cut of a wait do I get a pack or just a

1910
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:03,520
clone you can do either either or well

1911
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:07,079
I'll I'll definitely take some some

1912
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:10,400
burmes and then with with with that I

1913
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:13,600
think I could breed you know uh whatever

1914
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:15,519
I want that's a nice mixture I really

1915
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,039
like that okay so on the other end of

1916
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,719
the spectrum you're going to drop

1917
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,439
someone else off on the desert island

1918
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,920
you're not particularly fond of this

1919
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:24,039
person what are you going to leave them

1920
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,039
with

1921
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:31,760
Australian bastard

1922
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:31,759
cannabis oh no I play I

1923

[Laughter]

1924
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:40,880
play they wouldn't know if they could

1925
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:43,559
smoke it or not that's it right it's an

1926
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:46,440
ornamental

1927
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:49,840
yeah that's awesome that's awesome okay

1928
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:52,359
um which out of the chem clones are your

1929
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,360
favorite and is that also like in terms

1930
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:57,238
of smoking and then is that also the one
