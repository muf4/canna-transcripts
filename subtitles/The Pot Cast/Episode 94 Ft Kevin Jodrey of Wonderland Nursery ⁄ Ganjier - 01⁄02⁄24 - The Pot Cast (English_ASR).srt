incredibly well just everything exposed

168
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,479
almost no leafing required

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,879
uh a little color came in at the end but

170
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,079
just really good clean nice crisp fuel

171
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,759
so I've been smoking I've smoking the

172
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,439
[ __ ] out of that right now oh that

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
sounds gorgeous and you know shout out

174
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,160
to Gabe I follow his work it seems

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,800
really interesting you you mentioned in

176
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,000
the mix there the sfv OG and I wanted to

177
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,199
ask you you know you've probably seen

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,759
more ogs than just about anyone pass

179
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,120
through you know the nursery over the

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,199
years which OG is your favorite if you

181
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,879
had to just pick one or

182
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,038
two um that's a good question I guess it

183
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:07,919
depends on what I was doing with it so

184
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,038
if I wanted what I think was the the

185
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,079
best effect of an OG where it it just

186
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:17,680
caught me the best way it would be that

187
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,079
taga Canyon OG Kush they also call it

188
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,598
the the

189
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,120
Hollywood

190
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:26,199
and the the quality of the effect was

191
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,639
just stellar and I mean for me that's

192
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,759
the one that resonated with me as a

193
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:34,000
smoker best but a cultivator probably

194
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,840
the Larry cut the Larry cut it it it's

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,639
what the market really wants as an OG

196
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,679
and it's production potential is

197
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,439
incredible and it comes in earlier

198
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,038
outside and it's just really a an

199
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,240
excellent plant for commercial Kush

200
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:52,240
cultivation and the quality to flly was

201
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,038
epic so Hollywood to panga for smoke

202
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,680
Larry for

203
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:58,399
production wow I love it the um the

204
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,319
Tanger or the Hollywood you know it's

205
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,719
one that I feel like doesn't really get

206
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,400
as much of a mention as some of the

207
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,520
others and it's to me it's got that

208
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,878
gorgeous marshmallow sort of flavor

209
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,000
really don't see it too much elsewhere

210
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,560
um i' I'd be interested to know why do

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,120
you think it hasn't got quite as much

212
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,199
traction as some of the other more

213
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,280
commonly you know referenced

214
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,759
ones they were in really short supply

215
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,119
and so at the end of the day almost

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,840
every OG is really a a

217
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,800
self ghost cut Josh dcut original OG you

218
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,598
know whatever we want to you know Define

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,479
the name as but all these variations

220
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,800
come out and that Tanga cut was just

221
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,278
very rare and so I think the people that

222
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,120
had it realized the value of it and they

223
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,000
they held it inhouse a lot tighter than

224
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,200
a lot of the other Cuts were the lud to

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,759
13th is another rare one as well that

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,519
was held really close and so you don't

227
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,080
see the L to 13th cut in any big

228
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,480
circulation all the other ogs are

229
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,680
floating around everywhere you can get

230
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,159
your hands on them pretty quick but the

231
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:06,199
Tanga and the Louie both of those were

232
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,799
um guarded so to speak and then I got a

233
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,320
hold of them and I shared them into the

234
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,439
system just so the genes wouldn't be

235
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,600
lost so there's Farmers that still run

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,959
both of those you know in our area and

237
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
out of the area so which is the main

238
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,719
point of genetic preservation you got to

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,278
get the plants into multiple people's

240
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,959
hands so that at the end of the day it's

241
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:28,559
still alive somewhere in colonal

242
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,239
form yeah certainly I um I sometimes I

243
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,639
stay awake at night and think to myself

244
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,600
how many chem dog equivalent plants have

245
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,759
we lost over the years just through not

246
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,360
taking cuting or you know a seed dying

247
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,519
off before it could fully show its

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
potential it um definitely emphasizes

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
the importance of keeping all the

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,360
genetic backups you mentioned I I just

251
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,278
had a a little uh brain at when you

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
mentioned you know how certain cuts are

253
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,559
held tightly recently on the show we've

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,120
been chatting to people like yo Sammy

255
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,559
and even Shanty Barber and we've been

256
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,440
talking about the C5 and the A5 a lot

257
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,039
and lo and behold I was cruising your

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Instagram last night and I saw you had a

259
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,799
post about the C5 many years ago so I

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,160
guess you're very familiar with it tell

261
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,879
me a little bit about your thoughts on

262
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,399
the C5 we're seeing a bit of a haze

263
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,399
Resurgence what do you like about

264
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:18,200
it well what I liked about the C5 was

265
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,200
that it it just had a really euphoric

266
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,800
happy

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,680
buzz and when you consumed it you kind

268
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:27,599
of lost track of time but in

269
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,000
a giddy way you you just very

270
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,720
light-hearted and life just seemed to

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,278
slow down and brighten so it it did have

272
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,680
a really unique effect and I was

273
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:42,000
fortunate that I got I got cuts of it

274
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:45,838
shipped out from the crew out of out of

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,278
England so I got access to the the the

276
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,440
real plant to play with and and so I got

277
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:53,240
to experience it and I like it actually

278
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,600
more than I like the A5 the A5 is a is a

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,039
little more aggressive and it's fun too

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,839
just in a different way but something

281
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,278
about that C5 gave me a really good

282
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,079
euphor and I and I and I'm digging that

283
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,639
there's a Resurgence on these older

284
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,519
older

285
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,200
works because they they got removed from

286
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,480
the system for a while mostly you know

287
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,920
due to time constraints so the world of

288
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,600
commercial herb is so priced driven

289
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,919
visual driven that it's very hard to

290
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,879
show somebody a plant that looks sparse

291
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,799
and open that doesn't have necessarily

292
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,320
color that has low numbers when you

293
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,159
measure them in the way that a lab

294
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,680
measures a plant and has a flowering

295
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,360
time of you know 114 days so that stuff

296
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,559
just got wiped out but in the homeg

297
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,200
grower world you're seeing this killer

298
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,599
Resurgence of it and I and I'm digging

299
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,759
it yeah definitely I feel like there's

300
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,480
been a notable Resurgence in Hayes and

301
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,240
Hayes hybrids I I also feel like we're

302
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,680
starting to see some of you know the

303
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,959
land Racers really start to solidify

304
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,958
themselves back in the mainstream

305
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,799
conversation like your vietnameses and

306
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,879
Colombians definitely seem to be more

307
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,078
commonly discussed do you think these

308
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,360
sort of genetics will truly make a

309
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,319
comeback on the consumer Market or is it

310
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,560
still like a little bit just caded for

311
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,278
the he scene and a little bit of R shade

312
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,518
glasses about it truly making a

313
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,919
widespread

314
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,560
comeback a little of both you're going

315
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,399
to get some people who discover that

316
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,958
those profiles really resonate with them

317
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,480
and they'll say Hey you know I found

318
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,239
something that absolutely uh does what I

319
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,680
want and I'll hold it and I'll grow it

320
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,959
and I'll keep it and I'll deal with the

321
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,679
longer cyclical time and I will that's

322
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,078
that's my definition kind of mean that's

323
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,599
if you take a look at like the piff

324
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,879
phenomenon in New York which is really a

325
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:44,600
you know Haze that group stayed steady

326
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,399
for 25 years so for a really long time

327
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,000
you had enough population base around an

328
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,240
area that sold a product to sustain a

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,679
specific cultivar that was difficult to

330
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,440
grow so if if it can happen in New York

331
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,638
at the level that it did it can happen

332
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,639
here as well it's the the issue is at

333
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,919
the end of the day can you afford to

334
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,079
cultivate it in a legal facility and

335
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,000
then sell it for enough money to offset

336
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,879
the the work so what I see is more of

337
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
hybridization where people will take the

338
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,198
plants that are attractive today and

339
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,839
they'll weave in what we would call land

340
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:21,078
race work you know indigenous work and

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,959
try to bring some of the profiles try to

342
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,239
bring some of the Exotic try to bring

343
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,159
the concept of scarcity and Rarity into

344
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,120
the marketing which is what people are

345
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,879
into too saying that you know never

346
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,879
never had it never experienced it very

347
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,480
limited Supply when you put those words

348
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,600
out it it makes people move so I think

349
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,560
that you're gonna you're definitely

350
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,278
seeing it happen and I don't know if

351
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,799
it's because people are Desiring to go

352
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,240
back into the old genan pool or if we've

353
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,319
just played the current one out so badly

354
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,159
that there's nothing left to work

355
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,079
with because we intensified our work so

356
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,600
heavily and you know in just a small

357
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:00,719
genetic cluster that there's not much

358
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,920
left really for the average individual

359
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,680
the genetic world that we're in even

360
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,599
though you can access genes better than

361
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,319
you ever could there's less to

362
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,199
access well yeah I mean I guess just to

363
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,839
maybe clarify the point you're touching

364
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,519
on there do you feel that there is much

365
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,360
room for say let's just use for example

366
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,198
the current really this the RS 11s and

367
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,560
all these really high you know power shs

368
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,159
stuff like that do you feel like there

369
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,879
is much room to make further or do you

370
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,919
think it will just be a matter of time

371
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,399
before all these breeders realize like

372
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,599
it is in fact a dead end well they're

373
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,720
going to they're going

374
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,199
to you you run down that road until you

375
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
hit the dead end because you're still

376
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:41,838
making sales and it it allows you to

377
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,879
build off the marketing and you're still

378
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,920
working off of the concepts and ideas

379
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,198
that the public has about what is good

380
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:53,198
cannabis what do they expect it to be

381
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:56,240
and the world of visual cannabis

382
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,599
absolutely makes those varieties still

383
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,278
unbelievably relevant because they're

384
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,120
they're

385
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:06,198
aspects of of visual you know Beauty you

386
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,278
can't deny it and it's we've steered and

387
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,919
shaped it and so the thing is when when

388
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,198
Visual and price are your two biggest

389
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,039
indicators of a purchase and then in a

390
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,399
dispensary it's going to be potency in

391
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:21,480
price because you really can't see the

392
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,120
product it makes it really difficult to

393
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,759
to get out of those Lanes it's just that

394
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,679
what'll happen is someone will come up

395
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,000
with something new they'll discover

396
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,000
something old and then you'll see

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,318
everyone pour into that and then that

398
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
plant now becomes the base for

399
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,399
hybridization until they reach that

400
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,360
Pinnacle so we've worked basically a

401
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,600
cookie chassis now for over a decade

402
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,120
because everything that we're talking

403
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,199
about is really uh a Girl Scout cookie

404
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,120
frame covered with a different

405
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,318
paint yeah certainly certainly and and

406
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,399
even while you were talking about that

407
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,240
it click with me that in line with your

408
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,078
prior answer as well you know the Mac

409
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
really fit that mold you spoke about

410
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,120
where it's like you know with the

411
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,399
Colombian injecting a little bit of new

412
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,159
but it had the frost it it had it all

413
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,879
and and to me I I actually really enjoy

414
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,039
well grown mac I know some people don't

415
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,318
but I guess I'd love to ask you then you

416
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,759
know given the amount of cultivar you

417
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,159
see what do you think is going to be the

418
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,240
front runner for

419
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,399
2024 and you know as one of our

420
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,959
listeners put it do you think we're

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,839
going to be stuck with purple candy

422
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,239
gas I think you're going to be stuck

423
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,440
with purple candy gas for a little while

424
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,560
because the market still absorbing it so

425
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,120
if the market was turning its back on it

426
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,719
then you would see people running out of

427
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,560
that market and going somewhere else but

428
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,800
because it's still absorbing it it's

429
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,599
still going to sell and it's hard to

430
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,039
tell what's going to be the next hot cut

431
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,360
because it it doesn't go the way you

432
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,000
think it goes there's hot cuts that hit

433
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,720
the commercial market and there's hot

434
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,759
cuts that hit the street sometimes they

435
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,360
get to

436
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,159
touch you know like the Mac is the mac's

437
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,560
a good example of a plant though that if

438
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:04,159
you look at it it absolutely changed the

439
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,798
game in terms of visual and the the

440
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,240
numbers were insane but because it was a

441
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:14,318
triploid it didn't produce seeds well

442
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:18,558
almost none and so to me it saved the

443
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,759
max life from being this base paint of

444
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,639
every single plant around it because

445
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:26,038
people couldn't generate enough seed

446
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,038
from it to financially make it worth it

447
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,440
so you didn't get the seed yield from

448
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:33,558
the Mac and so because the tripid

449
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,840
potential in it it actually helped the

450
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,079
plant remain as a clone only where to

451
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,558
this day Max still sells as a clone

452
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,000
because you can't deny that it's

453
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,480
stunning and it's raw I mean it could

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,640
use a little flavor if there was a

455
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
downfall to the Mac to me it's it's got

456
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,840
it could use some more flavor but in

457
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,519
every other aspect it's you know it it

458
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:55,678
it pulls it so things like the Mac

459
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,879
because of the it has a a genetic

460
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,400
anomaly compared to other plants you

461
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,360
know it's not a dipl

462
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,080
that allowed it to kind of stand alone

463
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,558
but any other plant that comes out

464
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:11,199
that's hot that that sells people see it

465
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,000
it gets promoted by the right person

466
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,360
someone with the big reach can push it

467
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,038
out you're putting it into into into the

468
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:22,158
Highlight with a lot of with a lot of

469
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,839
attention that moves things more than

470
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,280
the quality so to me you know like the

471
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,839
people that I see who have the best

472
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,079
grass what I would Define as the best

473
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,678
grass are the forite tent Growers that I

474
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,599
meet all over the US and around the

475
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,960
world really people that are absolutely

476
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,240
looking for freak herb that doesn't have

477
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,840
commercial constraints so what you're

478
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,400
getting is the best experience total

479
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,199
with no it didn't trim well under a

480
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,038
trimmer it doesn't hold well on a shelf

481
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
it doesn't like to be moved through drro

482
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,440
because it's fragile the the trikes are

483
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,839
are they break off too easy and but it's

484
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,200
meant to be consumed as flour any of

485
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,119
those things that make it problematic

486
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,919
you won't see those plants move into a

487
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,879
commercial system and so going to the

488
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,520
regenerative conferences going to a lot

489
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,320
of the events I get to go to what I get

490
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,240
to see is what I think is the highest

491
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,399
tier of cannabis I've ever seen across

492
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,919
the board is you know is the production

493
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,360
of 2023 but it's in the small operators

494
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,159
because they get to go do what they want

495
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,158
to do the stores are limited so like for

496
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,400
big push plant numbers and big push

497
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,960
quantities it better have numbers it

498
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,159
better have color and Candy gas still

499
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,480
rules that world

500
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,440
what do you think is the solution to the

501
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,159
issue you know cuz as you just discussed

502
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,759
you know a lot of the stuff commercially

503
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,520
available it's not really what we'd

504
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,599
consider to be the Pinnacle of cannabis

505
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,319
and often you need to experience that

506
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,558
ultra high quality to have that light

507
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,480
bulb moment and really start to go down

508
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,519
the rabbit hole at least in my opinion

509
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,400
so what what do you think is the future

510
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,960
for the the general consumer do you

511
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,640
think it'll get to a point where you

512
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,120
just can't get this sort of herb you're

513
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
talking about so fondly that comes from

514
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,678
the smaller batch

515
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,400
production going to have to get it from

516
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,960
the street the small batch the true

517
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,759
small batch there's no place for you in

518
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,279
the system I mean it's so ex and even

519
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,798
for the bigger operators and if you're

520
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,798
looking at if you look at any any

521
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,200
country that has operations it's in

522
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,519
chaos show me show me a well-run system

523
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,720
anywhere in the world right I don't I'm

524
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:24,079
not looking at any of them so the issue

525
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,600
is that it completely creates a a

526
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,879
ceiling that people can't penetrate to

527
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:32,199
get into that space

528
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,919
and because of it you lock out

529
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,480
diversity and you have to have diversity

530
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,960
you have to have people who are obsessed

531
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,319
with a thing so much that they're

532
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,079
willing to take a risk with it and they

533
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,439
know enough about what they're doing

534
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:50,000
that they produce the quantity that will

535
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,798
sell so they don't produce they don't

536
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,480
put the the plant into the market to

537
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:58,119
produce a million pounds there's only 7

538
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,319
to 10,000 pounds of It produced that now

539
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:03,239
lets you really focus on the group that

540
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,000
has the money and the desire to purchase

541
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,880
it and it allows you now to be able to

542
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,400
justify why you're having to charge

543
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,159
proportionately more to produce it

544
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,600
because it it h it just certain places

545
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,360
can do certain things but if it's indoor

546
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,558
you're just going longer times and it's

547
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,759
going to really impact your entire crop

548
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,200
rotation cycle the nursery I mean the

549
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,440
entire chain of events that occur in an

550
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,278
operation are dictated by that time and

551
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,159
so when you start to throw in rooms that

552
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:35,759
are running on 110 days versus

553
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,600
65s it throws the rotation out so it

554
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,679
becomes problematic for anybody that's

555
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,918
bigger but for small operator I think as

556
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,360
you go forward and you start to see some

557
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,799
of the markets like New York I think

558
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,918
it's a prime place because you have

559
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:51,599
enough consumers with enough

560
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,240
affluence um they'll be the ability to

561
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,000
sell x amount of pounds of really

562
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,640
Exquisite

563
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,440
flour yeah that's a brilliant answer and

564
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,159
got me thinking you know we have fans

565
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,840
all over the globe who live in these

566
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,600
little epicenters of you know cannabis

567
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,558
growth and development you know I know

568
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,678
like the UK is a good example as you

569
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,319
said New York's having its Renaissance I

570
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,880
think even in Australia there's there's

571
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,038
a bunch of people who are really doing

572
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,159
awesome things given your work over the

573
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,798
years in the NorCal area what would be

574
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,400
some advice for people living in these

575
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,400
areas to help Foster a culture where

576
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,798
like you know where it helps the scene

577
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,640
to develop you know how can we help to

578
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,599
let the rising tide raise all

579
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,080
boats you know this is one of the

580
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:40,038
toughest Parts about what we do is that

581
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,158
cannabis culture is so much an

582
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:44,759
independent one because you have the

583
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,679
ability to be autonomous you can for

584
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,480
most you're able to use your own

585
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,720
resources to generate a

586
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,679
living and it allows you to rely on you

587
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,360
and allows you to be in control of you

588
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,080
and I think for many people that you

589
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,038
know it's not that

590
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,079
they devoid of desire to be around

591
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,879
others it's just that being alone

592
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,119
working on a project or working with a

593
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,559
person or so isn't a bad

594
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:14,839
thing that cripples you when you move

595
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,480
forward and it cripples you because what

596
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,839
you don't understand is that the

597
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,759
companies that you're going to have to

598
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,359
face and compete with and deal with and

599
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,960
you will have to compete and deal with

600
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,439
them they're corporations and they're VC

601
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,558
driven and so just like I I use the same

602
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,000
example with the police right when you

603
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,399
when you run in back in the day when you

604
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,519
were running hot operations you had to

605
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,480
be smart because when you got

606
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,400
grabbed your life changed 24 hours a day

607
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,079
but the police who grabbed you went home

608
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,120
and had dinner and took their kid to

609
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,798
play

610
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,558
softball it they they go home at night

611
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,960
uh the judge goes home at night the

612
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,038
prison guard goes home at night

613
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,880
everybody goes home at night but you and

614
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:58,720
that just means that you have a

615
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,320
competition that you can't compete eat

616
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,278
with because at the end of the day they

617
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,879
can they can get rest and you can't and

618
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:09,599
so what you find is that no matter how

619
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,840
clever you might be to go up against a

620
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,558
really funded competitor which is where

621
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,399
you're going to see them come in they're

622
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,158
it's almost impossible because they have

623
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,600
the ability to throw money at a problem

624
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,480
and so what the the smaller cultivators

625
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,439
have to do and which makes it so

626
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,839
difficult for them is they have to first

627
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,000
meet and then they have to be ble to say

628
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,879
out loud to each other I'm a grower

629
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,919
which for many coming out of the Green

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,399
Closet is a terrifying thing so it it

631
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,960
that alone is a is a huge struggle right

632
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:45,079
so now you have to get past that barrier

633
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,720
then you have to get past the barrier of

634
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:49,439
you know do you trust anybody that

635
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
you've just come clean to because now

636
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,919
all these people know who you really are

637
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,000
and what what will that impact what's

638
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,399
the impact to you so you you start to

639
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,240
create all these problems just to create

640
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:02,879
create

641
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,159
unity and you need to get the unity

642
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,480
regardless of the problems because if

643
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,159
you're able to team up as say we're in a

644
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,720
region say we're which is going to use

645
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,000
Brisbane I'm just going to pull the word

646
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,278
out of out of a out of a region where're

647
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,480
cultivators and

648
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:18,679
Brisbane and what we need to be able to

649
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,360
do is recognize how many of us are craft

650
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,919
cultivators in Brisbane how many of us

651
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,319
have an actual chance to survive based

652
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,000
off of what we see currently in Brisbane

653
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,480
and current that would mean do we have

654
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,839
enough Capital to acquire the licenses

655
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,038
do we have the real estate do we have

656
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:37,798
the means to move the product do we have

657
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,839
the relationships with the the the

658
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,240
distribution do we have uh a handle on

659
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,439
the genetics so like there's all these

660
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,399
things that have to be developed and if

661
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,120
you can all get together in a region and

662
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,398
have that conversation then you're

663
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,959
you're able to start to figure out We're

664
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,519
All Growers but you're a a graphic

665
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,798
designer when you're not growing and I'm

666
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:03,038
an electrician when I'm not growing and

667
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,200
this individual is a business manager

668
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,839
when they're not growing and this other

669
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,880
gal is an an incredible product

670
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:13,599
developer when she's not growing and now

671
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,559
what you have is a Consortium of talent

672
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,558
clustered around the common Hub of

673
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:19,240
cultivation of cannabis and we're just

674
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,038
going to say cultivation as the whole

675
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,480
industry when you get everybody in the

676
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,319
room together like that what you have

677
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,399
now is is a Brain

678
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:30,439
Trust And if you're able to understand

679
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:32,519
that you have to subjugate your ego to

680
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,399
where you're only the smartest in the

681
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,278
room in your

682
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:39,519
lane then what it does it allows you to

683
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:42,079
be able to team up and actually work

684
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,599
against the bigger companies that are

685
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,079
coming in because you're able to start

686
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,319
to figure out who of you aren't going to

687
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,278
make it because if once you make that

688
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:54,038
decision you and you can make it

689
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,240
financially then you have to say okay I

690
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:58,440
can't create a license but perhaps I

691
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,919
could work at a facility do I have to to

692
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,759
not be part of the industry for people

693
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,559
who have the money have the ability to

694
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,720
say okay I can do this let us drive

695
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:11,720
forward and get that secured and let the

696
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,880
people around us populate the

697
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,480
operation you got to be honest with this

698
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,799
[ __ ] and it's hard because each person

699
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,960
inherently believes that they're

700
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,398
brilliant by virtue of the fact that

701
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,278
you're not in the system you growing

702
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,879
herb you're having a great life you're

703
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,759
making great money while you're doing it

704
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,520
at your house you're making coin in your

705
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,879
[ __ ] pajamas and for most people

706
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:37,798
that's only for crypto and so crypto is

707
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:41,480
the modern dope grower and it's a real

708
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:43,398
problem trying to get people to see past

709
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,759
their limitations and understand what

710
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,558
they're going to have to do to actually

711
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,960
get to the place they want to

712
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,960
go it's it's

713
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,558
brutal I mean the the the legal industry

714
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,840
is a meat grinder so just because you

715
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,119
get a license doesn't mean you're going

716
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:04,480
to Ed and it there's no there's nothing

717
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,199
in the path that makes you ever feel

718
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,839
safe and and I'm involved heavily in

719
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,200
legal so it's just one every time you

720
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,678
walk you feel like you're on cracken

721
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
ice yeah certainly and I mean on the

722
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,200
other end of the spectrum of that

723
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,159
question what's your advice for some of

724
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,360
the people say stat side who are sort of

725
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,679
the more Legacy farmer type figures and

726
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,158
feel like they're getting pushed out of

727
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,600
the market maybe because they're you

728
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,519
know not a big brand something like that

729
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,959
how do you think these sorts of Veteran

730
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,000
Growers are going to be able to stay

731
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,798
relevant and stay within the industry

732
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,919
not have to find a new

733
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:42,519
career it depends

734
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,200
on your other skill sets because in the

735
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:48,000
end of the day you cannabis might be you

736
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,600
know 30% of your total income it was

737
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,880
100% you might have a small farm that

738
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,879
you run seasonally you might have an

739
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,320
operation that you know you have your

740
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,039
son and your daughter working at you you

741
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,200
have an ability perhaps to you know

742
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:06,398
utilize your land in some manner but

743
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,679
without scale it's very hard because the

744
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,879
tax rates are Savage in every place we

745
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,240
go and so for me it's it's this honest

746
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
and I've helped a lot of people with

747
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,759
this too because it's emotional and I

748
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,359
don't get

749
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,158
emotional it I I I try to save that when

750
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,319
it's needed because otherwise it just

751
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,679
dictates how you see every situation so

752
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,079
I try to look at it robotically as if I

753
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,798
was not connected to it in any

754
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,278
way and what that does is it lets you

755
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,839
have a conversation with somebody and

756
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:40,119
you can honestly ask them do you want to

757
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:43,558
take all your savings and and risk

758
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:46,079
developing something that's a risk or

759
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:49,480
are you better off keeping your

760
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,918
savings and and finding some new venue

761
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,038
an Avenue of employment but still with

762
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,038
your money are you are you really about

763
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,079
cultivating anymore do you really want

764
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,359
the farm do you have kids do your kids

765
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,199
want the farm and and those are the

766
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,000
questions you have to ask you know do we

767
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,440
sell the assets that we've held for time

768
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,240
or do we keep them and how do we keep

769
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,278
them once you get into for anybody

770
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,798
Legacy once you get into legal you get

771
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:22,200
into a a sticky trap it's like the the

772
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,079
traps they put out to catch mice all

773
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,840
it's got to do is touch your finger and

774
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,599
basically it sucks your whole hand into

775
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:31,879
it and now you you're trapped you you

776
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,480
are it's so complex and indepth and it's

777
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,919
such a vacuous hole of

778
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,519
money and you really never know how much

779
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,919
it's going to cost you when you get into

780
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,720
it there almost is no accurate cost

781
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,038
estimates each each district you work

782
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,640
with each Community has their own little

783
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,798
private assault on your wallet and so it

784
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,320
comes down to like I is this really

785
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,278
where you want to go and do you see

786
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,000
yourself coming out at the end success

787
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,599
and you have to Define what successful

788
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,319
means for me like the example is I I

789
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,240
didn't I didn't expect to ever get

790
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:10,839
wealthy from my family

791
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,480
farm because I knew that it was only

792
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:15,278
going to be you know 18,000 foot of of

793
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,639
canopy right so that's that's a little

794
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,000
less than half an acre that's not a lot

795
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,638
of canopy and I know a lot of canopy in

796
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,720
agriculture is 10,000 acres so when

797
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,398
cannabis starts to be you know produced

798
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,360
at a level that's

799
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:32,199
astronomical then how do we compete at

800
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,798
18K I figured we compete at 18K by

801
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,639
having a small enough canopy of

802
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:38,558
something that's Exquisite that can

803
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:40,119
actually support the farm itself so the

804
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,079
land stays

805
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:47,038
solvent so for me a success as the

806
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:50,319
farmer was I have to go do other work to

807
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:53,278
have an existence but if I can succeed I

808
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,960
get to keep my farm as an asset in my in

809
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,119
my family's

810
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,759
life which is weird you know I mean like

811
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,798
you're taking your lucrative weed farm

812
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,119
and you're saying you're probably not

813
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,519
going to make any money on it you're

814
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,398
just going to make enough to keep it

815
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,359
alive because that's what that what you

816
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,000
love is the land and for me I have a

817
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,558
love affair with that

818
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
land yeah certainly while we're on that

819
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,079
topic I wanted to ask you know you're

820
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,319
talking about your farm and and the

821
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,879
passion behind it what genetics have got

822
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,439
you excited at the moment what are you

823
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,720
came to pop yourself that's a good

824
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,360
question um what I've been working on is

825
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,600
I've been working on um I got I got

826
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:32,359
enthralled with this

827
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:34,959
Puck Frost from crickets and cicada

828
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,798
seeds and so he he had done a bunch of

829
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,679
work with this old Skelly hash plant

830
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,638
these old 88 hash plants out of the old

831
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,720
Sensei era and I was alive then growing

832
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:46,759
indoor heavily and so for me it's it was

833
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,480
like a trip back in time to go back into

834
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:53,798
those musky funky skunky type varieties

835
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,880
that you just don't really see and the

836
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:57,918
the the

837
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,320
Lebanese um female that he used just

838
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,759
really brought some crazy profiles into

839
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,960
the flower and so when I smoked some

840
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,558
with them there was a there was a flavor

841
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,000
in it they just blew my mind and I went

842
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,960
digging for it but it's a I found it was

843
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
recessive and so it was a it was a

844
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,919
process I had to go through like a

845
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,120
couple hundred plants to mine what I was

846
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,600
seeking which was that profile in the

847
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,918
female and then the male that matched

848
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:26,398
it and I'm loving it just because

849
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,559
it's it's got a different type of High

850
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,199
where the high feels

851
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:33,398
balanced more than a steered high so

852
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,519
like when you're when you're doing plant

853
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:40,199
development you're using a COA to drive

854
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:42,720
[ __ ] if you just throw that away and you

855
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,440
just drive it off of how you feel from

856
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,480
The

857
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,360
Experience what you're doing is you're

858
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,798
you're seeking the best experience

859
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,158
there's no constraint from COA this it

860
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,839
it doesn't really matter what it's

861
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,559
telling me what what's matters is what

862
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,879
I'm feeling and so what I found was that

863
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:02,119
as I went through those populations that

864
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,200
lebanes dominant side with a little bit

865
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:08,279
of that puck back tone just gave me this

866
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,760
really cool feel so I felt relaxed and

867
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,960
my head was clear and and the flavor was

868
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,240
rich and interesting and cinnamon and

869
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:20,519
rose oil and Cedar and it has zero and

870
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,039
it's nothing against gelato or Skittle

871
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:26,599
or cookie or or Hayes or OG or Cam it's

872
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:28,559
not against any of them it doesn't have

873
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,679
any of that in it

874
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:34,559
so it's just a direction that hasn't

875
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,760
been explored by many ever because it's

876
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,398
from a Time past and for me it was

877
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,440
something I explored heavily and I was

878
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,159
able to go back into it and find

879
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,000
something that I really liked which was

880
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,559
that lebanes side and I've been digging

881
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,039
it man so I've been doing a ton of work

882
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,799
with that and I would I would love to be

883
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,159
able to produce that at the farm as a

884
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,119
product because I think it would make a

885
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,200
A+ hash

886
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,480
that sounds absolutely incredible and

887
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:04,519
got to give a massive shout out to both

888
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,519
Bob and hanbal making some some killer

889
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,358
genetics coincidentally I'm I'm

890
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,719
fortunate enough um he sent me uh some

891
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:15,159
unreleased seeds hashplant 13 cross to

892
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:17,039
the parkma that he made and um you know

893
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:18,879
really lucky to be smoking on a sampler

894
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,079
that it's got the got the hash plant

895
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,838
structure but more of the the puck turps

896
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,839
you know that steak leathery sort of

897
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:30,159
vibe really really beautiful stuff um

898
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,838
I'd love to know what's your long-term

899
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,319
plans with those seeds that you're

900
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,719
making one of our listeners wanted to

901
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,800
know would you ever consider making

902
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,959
those available cuz I know that Mr Bob

903
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,480
is a big Advocate with people making

904
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,838
stuff with the seeds oh totally well the

905
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,599
thing with me with like I do I work with

906
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:49,599
a lot of companies helping them do

907
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,240
breeding but I'm not a breeder and the

908
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,079
reason why I say that is because I have

909
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:58,159
I have a I I produce seed what I'm

910
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,079
really good at is selecting plants but

911
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,960
breeders have a different strategy and

912
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,480
an approach and my mom was a research

913
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,679
geneticist and so I have a pretty clear

914
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,000
idea of what that looks like when you're

915
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:11,318
laying out a project from that

916
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,159
perspective and so I'm fortunate that I

917
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:16,440
get to work with some brilliant

918
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:19,199
breeders that they help you really

919
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,920
understand how to refine your practice

920
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,118
and so what what I get to do really is I

921
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,200
I get to for me my personal stuff I get

922
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,240
to work directions that I dig because

923
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,679
I'm not constrained so I'm not worrying

924
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:33,959
about does it mechanically trim does it

925
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,919
have an ability to to do this what what

926
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm focusing on is does it do what I

927
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,680
wanted to do as a drug

928
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,440
product and the ability to do that then

929
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,118
kind of frees you up to be able to just

930
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,880
look through populations and start to

931
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,599
put together parental combinations to

932
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,640
find out what works but for me when I'm

933
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,880
working with anybody's work I've I've

934
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:58,358
never taken someone's work and use their

935
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,480
work to make money off that work quickly

936
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:02,519
what I do is I take people's work and

937
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,639
then I contact you say say you made the

938
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,559
work and I say hey you did a limited

939
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,440
release I did an F2 on it so that I

940
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,639
could have a population to hunt through

941
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,200
would you be cool if I gave out the F2

942
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,000
at conferences so people could get

943
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:17,078
access to your work because you only

944
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,159
sold a th000 packs and there's really

945
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,839
desire for 5,000 more but instead of me

946
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,879
knocking off your work as an F2 let me

947
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:28,759
just give them out and I've done that

948
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,480
for years because it it's uh

949
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,880
it's a it's a way that you get really

950
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,920
good jeans into many people's

951
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,960
hands and so I gave the F2 out all over

952
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,720
the globe so I mean I made a shitload I

953
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,920
did an open population F2 out of uh 56

954
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:46,318
plants so 30 females 26 males I put them

955
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,639
all together at once so I could get a

956
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,199
good Jean

957
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,400
collection and then I gave those out

958
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:55,078
everywhere I gave out thousands of those

959
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,760
seeds because the quality of that that

960
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,359
hybrid was excellent and what I wanted

961
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,440
to do too was me and Boba friends I

962
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,199
wanted to bring attention back to him

963
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,639
and even though you know he was sold out

964
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,399
of that work it doesn't matter it gets

965
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,639
people to say hey wait a second you guys

966
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,880
are good breeders and I I want to mess

967
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:16,159
with your company so it's just a really

968
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,280
good way to do um marketing and it

969
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,920
allows me to to share things with people

970
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,240
that I think are cool but I want to do

971
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,000
the first like release on seed that I'll

972
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:29,479
put onto the market and I'll do that F3

973
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,760
from the the male and the female that I

974
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,039
did that big selection from because I

975
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,760
just think they're stellar and then I'll

976
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:40,480
lay that same

977
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,359
male into my lap PK because the lap PK

978
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,440
because that's super rare and I think

979
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,519
that it has some of the the the best

980
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,760
qualities of of cannabis that you can

981
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,800
ask for where it has really like no

982
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,400
sealing and if you smoke it every day no

983
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,200
tolerance so you get equally as high

984
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,160
every day and you get equally High every

985
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,719
time you smoke it after one after

986
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,799
another so it just has these penetrating

987
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:09,318
resonating impacts and I just think that

988
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,800
that plant with that really sexy coffee

989
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:15,039
chocolate Earth back with that level of

990
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,640
potency mixed in with that cedar rose

991
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,400
oil cinnamon from the mail that I'm

992
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,838
throwing is just going to produce some

993
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:26,358
heat so I bet by let's see we're we're

994
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:28,358
we're into the veg right now so

995
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:29,880
springtime Springtime I'll be throwing

996
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:31,920
some seed out to the public from that

997
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,440
work because I just think that

998
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,720
that's it it got me excited cuz I just

999
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,440
got I've been playing with so many

1000
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,959
things for so long that I got bored it's

1001
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,599
nothing against any of the Breeders or

1002
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,519
any of the plants I think they're all

1003
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:45,400
Epic in their own way but the problem is

1004
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,559
you start smoking the same hybrids for

1005
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,000
so long they all feel the same the high

1006
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:52,838
is the same there's very little

1007
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,039
difference in how it impacts me and you

1008
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:58,759
become kind of bored it it's it just

1009
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,599
loses its luster

1010
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,839
yeah certainly I think we can all relate

1011
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,559
to you know something that initially was

1012
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:06,679
really interesting quickly becomes quite

1013
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,400
Bland especially if you're overindulge

1014
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:09,679
but that's really exciting to hear that

1015
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
you know there's some genetics in the

1016
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,679
Woodworks and everyone needs to keep

1017
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,399
their eyes and ears out I was uh you

1018
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,960
know trolling through your Instagram and

1019
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,280
I I knew I had to ask you about you've

1020
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,079
it sounds like you know I wouldn't call

1021
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,720
it necessarily a sister line but you

1022
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,480
know there's there's another sort of

1023
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,679
line in that realm that caught my eye

1024
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,880
from you which was the the sensey star

1025
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,199
lemon tree

1026
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,599
mix with the same genetics can you tell

1027
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,239
us a bit about that yeah totally I got I

1028
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,838
went into the sensey

1029
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:39,439
star work that he did too because I I

1030
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,639
used to like Sensei star a lot way back

1031
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,720
in the day and I ran it outside first

1032
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:46,199
and it was funny because it took me

1033
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,000
right back to the 90s because everything

1034
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,639
we ran in the 90s was indoor built so

1035
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,400
when you took it outdoor it rotted and

1036
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,879
it just didn't have the the resistance

1037
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,519
right but I found one of them number 18

1038
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,160
that resisted really well and was just

1039
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:01,318
the stellar PL so then I took it indoor

1040
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,719
and I had my partner run it in a steered

1041
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,759
system so I could see what it looked

1042
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:10,199
like in um crop steered rock wall under

1043
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,480
leads and it was gorgeous but it didn't

1044
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,639
have that

1045
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,519
metallic lemony byy flavor that I wanted

1046
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,118
from the Sensei star it was more Puck

1047
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:20,199
dominant and I didn't really find any

1048
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,039
that had that what I though I was

1049
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:24,960
seeking but it was gorgeous it the smoke

1050
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,880
was good the high was good like every

1051
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,400
single thing about it was a was an a but

1052
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,760
it it lacked a little flavor so what I

1053
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,440
did is I took a a red Leb Puck mail

1054
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,520
because I didn't I I just wanted to

1055
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,480
bring some of the red Leb Puck profile

1056
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,960
in but I took a red Leb Puck mail into a

1057
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,559
lemon tree and then I did a a hunt

1058
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,480
through that for a maale that would give

1059
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,559
me a combination of traits where it

1060
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,800
wasn't all lemon and it wasn't all Puck

1061
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,440
and it it had enough of the red Leb to

1062
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,160
add some new want to the lemon tree and

1063
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,639
so I took that mail and then went into

1064
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:05,279
that sensey

1065
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:07,239
18 and then from there I was able to uh

1066
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,960
give what I would say like a an improved

1067
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,279
flavor profile so I just have to go

1068
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,440
through a little more of the population

1069
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,400
I think the 18 was visually a little

1070
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,440
better than the one that I was playing

1071
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,639
with but I just have to go open up to

1072
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,358
population to 100 and that'll let me see

1073
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,480
something that had what I wanted from

1074
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:28,480
the 18 mother but with the the traits of

1075
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,679
that lemon tree red Le pop put on it but

1076
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,199
woven together nicely I don't you know

1077
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,960
that's the problem when you play with

1078
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:37,558
lemon lemon can

1079
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,559
Dominate and it just becomes too much of

1080
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,280
it and the thing is when it comes to

1081
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,960
like consumer preference human

1082
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,359
preference we we like things that we

1083
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,720
like but we like some complexity so we

1084
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,960
feel interested when we play with it you

1085
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,879
never fully understand it you're always

1086
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,480
like oo oh there it is like woo but when

1087
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,480
it's just lemon or just grape or just

1088
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,358
orange or just lime or just apple or

1089
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,480
just peach or just pear or just

1090
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:09,679
watermel you get bored quick and so when

1091
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,358
you lay some of these profiles together

1092
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,358
if you look at enough populations them

1093
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,440
you just realize that it comes down to

1094
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,400
numbers where you're hunting through

1095
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,358
populations to find the ones that have

1096
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,838
the traits you want with those flavors

1097
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,000
that mesh and it's it's solid I got some

1098
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,799
in the other room I grew a bush of it

1099
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,199
outdoor and it it's

1100
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,400
killer that's awesome is that one maybe

1101
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,639
going to be off it as well or is that

1102
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,880
more a personal

1103
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:33,318
project no that was more personal

1104
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,599
project I was

1105
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:38,318
just sometimes you know you just Chase

1106
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,160
things because you want to explore and

1107
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,880
if you if you get to work with a line

1108
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,480
like say we're using Puck as the back

1109
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,200
right so Puck is the base for all these

1110
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,960
things and so like I got to look at some

1111
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:52,000
of the nap Le into the puck too and the

1112
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,920
Naple E I knew well because I provided

1113
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,719
it to Bob so the Naple e was a cut I got

1114
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,240
out of Grass Valley and it was just this

1115
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:04,598
incred in hash plant gorgeous and I gave

1116
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:07,078
it to him to use in the project and then

1117
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:09,640
I so I knew what that plant looked like

1118
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,599
so when I got to see what his Puck mail

1119
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:15,960
did against it it let me kind of better

1120
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:18,400
understand what the male's impact was on

1121
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,679
anything else I'm using so I see the

1122
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,358
impact of the the puck on the N police I

1123
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,358
see the impact of the maale on the

1124
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,000
Sensei star I see the impact on the male

1125
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:29,920
on the red left

1126
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,519
and it just helps me kind of understand

1127
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,960
better how deep am I going to have to go

1128
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,880
to find what I'm seeking because the the

1129
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,838
sometimes it's just you're just hunting

1130
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,760
but with the red lab the problem was I

1131
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:44,679
had smoked some with Bob and the sample

1132
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,880
that he had

1133
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:50,639
brought had that

1134
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,680
flavor and he cursed me because once he

1135
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,239
once he exposed me to that [ __ ] I was on

1136
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:57,639
a tirade man I was going for that flavor

1137
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,959
and it took me a minute to find it

1138
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,519
because it was really a recessive trait

1139
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,800
so you know one out of 100 frequency and

1140
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,440
so if you know you're not going through

1141
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,440
100 plants you're not going to find it

1142
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,480
or you might find five in a single pack

1143
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,679
but like we're talking I had to go

1144
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,480
through 100 of the F2 I didn't find it

1145
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,159
in the F1 at all not to the same degree

1146
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,838
I

1147
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,358
wanted so what I did is when I went into

1148
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:25,558
that F2 work I took the nine females

1149
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:29,440
that had the most close to what I wanted

1150
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:33,160
traits and I Ed that nine female

1151
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,000
pollination from the from the 26 males

1152
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:38,639
into that so at least it started

1153
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,880
bringing down my selection traits from

1154
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,519
the female side and then from there I

1155
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,519
was able to go okay now what do we have

1156
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,838
and what's going to come from it and

1157
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,679
then as I started to open up the

1158
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:50,639
populations I could find the males that

1159
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:53,159
took the traits that I was seeking and

1160
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:56,519
you start to if you're not using lab

1161
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,159
analysis you're having to go through

1162
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:59,838
your your intuition you're having to

1163
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,239
take a look at what are the traits of

1164
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:02,759
that the plants are displaying and then

1165
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,039
you got to lay it into them and figure

1166
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,880
out what's coming

1167
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:08,440
out but you got to kind of steer first

1168
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,318
to at least neck it out and then you

1169
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,280
have to take the the the plants you're

1170
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,920
working with to full fruition to make

1171
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,880
sure there's no inex because a lot of

1172
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,519
the plants from the past had interex so

1173
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,358
that you see it pop up male and female

1174
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,960
so you know you you have this beautiful

1175
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,838
female and you're at the end of the

1176
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,039
cycle it starts to it starts to come

1177
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,880
apart I don't want that propensity for

1178
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:32,920
interx in at all I don't want the male

1179
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,519
to to suddenly reverse at the end of its

1180
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,599
life cycle I don't want the female to

1181
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,719
display anything thing what I want is as

1182
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:44,000
much sexual St stability as possible and

1183
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,679
then from here now we're able to create

1184
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
some stable work when you're working

1185
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,759
with companies like if I get brought

1186
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,480
into a Scientific Company it's different

1187
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,839
because I'm helping them understand the

1188
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,079
traits of Desire I'm helping them

1189
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,679
understand that this smell right here

1190
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,240
smells like [ __ ] nobody would buy it

1191
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:00,118
right so the person that's saying they

1192
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,159
like it they not person to say that

1193
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,599
they're they're somebody who's an

1194
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:05,358
anomaly and they shouldn't choose things

1195
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:08,800
for the public it it just kind of helps

1196
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,400
companies fine-tune the work but with

1197
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,559
scientific companies meaning that they

1198
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,920
have the ability to utilize scientific

1199
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,440
resources their toolbox is massive so

1200
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,000
they're able to do this all through

1201
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,838
analysis but for me and and for people

1202
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,920
who do you know breeding at home in

1203
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:28,078
their own world you have to be able to

1204
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,200
utilize convention breeding

1205
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,039
methodology and just be kind of really

1206
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,480
diligent about what it is you're trying

1207
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,440
to get and make sure that the work

1208
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,559
you're doing is the direction you

1209
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,318
want yeah incredible answer definitely

1210
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,519
can appreciate the sentiment of as you

1211
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,318
said that distinction between like doing

1212
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:47,880
stuff at home versus say working with a

1213
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,440
big company definitely two different

1214
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,200
approaches there radically different on

1215
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,920
that line of thinking just for our

1216
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:56,199
listeners at home who for the most part

1217
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,720
are not working with companies what sort

1218
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:00,759
of traits do you look for in males do

1219
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,519
you have any tips for our listeners and

1220
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,599
as a followup do you think it's an art

1221
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:06,679
or more of a science or a mixture of

1222
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:10,039
both it's correct it's a role of the

1223
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:13,078
dice it's about population numbers and

1224
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:15,279
at the end of the day the males that you

1225
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,359
choose sometimes really weren't the ones

1226
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,359
that pushed the traits that you desired

1227
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,799
forward so if you like I always use

1228
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:23,838
myself as an example where the children

1229
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,640
that I

1230
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:32,558
have take far after their mother's side

1231
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:34,519
than me which is a good thing and it

1232
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,640
just means that I'm a male that lets the

1233
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,280
female traits pass through so I would be

1234
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,279
a good breeder male if you were trying

1235
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,640
to allow the female to come forward but

1236
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,280
when I look at populations if I can go

1237
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,558
play with it for a while it's the play

1238
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,160
with it for a while part that matters is

1239
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,280
to figure out what are you seeing coming

1240
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:56,960
out and when you put together the plants

1241
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,480
what seems to come out in traits in

1242
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,119
clusters what's the most number of

1243
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,400
traits you see

1244
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,280
consistently and which males are

1245
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,119
producing that many of them at one time

1246
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,798
so that you know that you're able to

1247
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,039
start steering and necking a population

1248
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:16,440
down outliers are tough you don't really

1249
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,558
know how many you're going to have to go

1250
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,838
through to find but what I what I want

1251
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:24,000
is I want males that I would say are are

1252
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,558
you know not the first flowering

1253
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,719
necessarily or the last flowering but in

1254
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,400
in the in the medium medium cycle plant

1255
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:32,959
so I'm not looking for the outliers on

1256
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,440
flowering time I'm looking for normal

1257
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,199
mid-range flowering time what I'm

1258
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,358
seeking is and it's rare and I only I

1259
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,598
only play with a couple males ever

1260
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,000
because of it like like I'll do open pop

1261
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,519
work to get populations but once I go

1262
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,400
and dig for mail it's a dig because what

1263
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:53,318
I want is I want some really freaky

1264
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,280
resin development I want to see a male

1265
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:57,239
that's

1266
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,798
absolutely covered in trikes

1267
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:03,519
and I want to see it with a a very

1268
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:06,079
powerful pungent odor I want to be able

1269
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,960
to feel uh natural essential oil

1270
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,760
production on it I want to be as

1271
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,960
impressed by the

1272
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,720
male in its traits more than its

1273
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,079
structure than the female the

1274
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:19,558
female is we can see what we have

1275
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,119
because we can consume it but the male

1276
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,119
doesn't always tell us this we have to

1277
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,920
run it but if I can get the profile in

1278
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:28,880
the mail which is rare if I can get the

1279
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,519
resin content in the mail which is rare

1280
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,400
if I can get the oil production in the

1281
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,000
mail which is rare and I get it in a

1282
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,400
good frame that I like in a medium

1283
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,119
finish I have a mail that I can play

1284
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,000
with and then when I run it it lets me

1285
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,400
see what comes out of the

1286
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,519
progyny and if I know it's good then

1287
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,200
what I can do now is I can take a

1288
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:53,000
collection of plants and run it into

1289
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:54,519
it and and preserve them in that manner

1290
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,679
so like what's a good example I went

1291
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:59,960
maybe 10 11 years ago we were at at the

1292
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,960
what I would call like the peak of the

1293
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,559
medical world in in cannabis in

1294
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,798
California the Zenith of the industry

1295
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,960
right and it fuel was taking over

1296
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,798
everything fuel was just wreaking havoc

1297
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,519
and in another couple years we were

1298
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:16,519
going to go into candy

1299
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,079
gas and I just I and I've been doing

1300
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:19,480
this for so long you see the trait so

1301
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,480
what I did is I took everything that we

1302
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,599
would consider more uplifting like so

1303
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,719
stuff like you know Green cracks and um

1304
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,920
different Haze C

1305
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,239
um blue

1306
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:35,480
dream uh all these other plants of that

1307
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:37,239
era that fit into that narrow Leaf

1308
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,240
ethereal type

1309
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:41,759
High I knew that I was gonna have to sit

1310
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,039
on them for a decade because it was

1311
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,920
going to be no market for him so what I

1312
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,039
did is I took all of those plants that

1313
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,079
had those characteristics that were so

1314
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,440
valuable in the market and remember this

1315
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,798
is before tisue culture right so you're

1316
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,720
not banking [ __ ] you're having a hold to

1317
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:58,318
living plant which is difficult so what

1318
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:00,759
I did is I I went through a population

1319
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:04,199
IID worked on that I got from Bodi which

1320
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,839
was a a Sensei star Malawi and I took

1321
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:09,199
that and went into it another generation

1322
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:12,838
or two hunting for a maale that I could

1323
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:16,239
use that gave me that that ethereal

1324
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:19,599
maloi Edge that nasty sharp riing high

1325
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:21,759
that loud super loud sharp odor but

1326
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,720
brought down a little bit in stature so

1327
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,440
it was more workable because where I

1328
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,358
live in Humble County it has to be some

1329
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,838
reasonable time you know Halloween is

1330
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:32,440
pretty much the limit of what I want to

1331
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:35,358
play with out here really if if it's if

1332
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,200
it's a a traditional humble wet Winter

1333
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,598
by the time you get into early November

1334
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,159
it's wet so I want it to be able to

1335
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,798
finish so I need to bring the African

1336
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:46,798
down a little bit his sensey star was

1337
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:48,798
choice and so I selected a maale from

1338
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:51,519
that and then I used it against all

1339
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,199
those plants and then banked the seed

1340
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:56,599
and I just broke them out like six

1341
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:59,719
months ago and pulled out a blue dream

1342
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:02,160
Malawi Sensei star so that I can use as

1343
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:04,838
something that fits the need of today

1344
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,598
which is something ethereal something

1345
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:10,838
clearheaded but sharpened up from Blue

1346
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:13,680
Dream so the high is similar but the the

1347
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:17,119
odor profile is a little edgier not as

1348
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,719
soft and the resin contents increased so

1349
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,440
like once you know you have a mail that

1350
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,558
you can use what people do is they bang

1351
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,000
it into everything they can touch but

1352
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:28,000
really what you want to do is put it

1353
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,079
into plants that you think will combine

1354
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,679
ideally and it lets you at least know

1355
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,480
that you know the mother plant well the

1356
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,279
father you've selected and developed and

1357
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,318
it allow you now to be able to go

1358
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,040
through the population and you're you're

1359
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,400
able to say look I can't hold it in pure

1360
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:47,119
form unless I self it but if I go this

1361
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,519
route what it'll do is it'll allow me to

1362
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,318
start combining the effects of both so I

1363
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,920
had to I said do Fu mails for people I

1364
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,519
would build Fu mails that when you put

1365
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,760
it on a plant it would increase the gas

1366
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,719
and increase the numbers and then I

1367
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,160
would give that mail to people I knew

1368
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:06,000
that were breeders that wanted to do

1369
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,960
their own breeding and say look this is

1370
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,318
a male that when we put it on other

1371
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,720
plants these are the results from the

1372
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,759
lab and this is what it's given us it's

1373
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,598
giv us good resistance it's giv us a

1374
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,400
good a good finish the meaning the

1375
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,960
flowers is pretty so when you when you

1376
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,920
go and put the work in a mail is

1377
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,199
priceless that's why everybody selfs

1378
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,079
because it it allows you to lock the

1379
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,759
genes into an internal

1380
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,720
pool but to me man a good breeder maale

1381
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,480
is

1382
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,679
priceless yeah hugely hugely there's a

1383
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,599
there's a lot of great knowledge there

1384
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:40,960
we'll all have to listen to that little

1385
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,680
bit again and and extract some ideas out

1386
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,159
of it I I wanted to ask you you know

1387
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,279
while we're sort of on this topic what

1388
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,920
would your advice be for someone who is

1389
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,359
maybe say an aspiring breeder and they

1390
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,159
feel like you know the Market's

1391
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,679
saturated you know they probably I guess

1392
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:57,199
the sentiment I sort of put forward is

1393
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:59,239
there's no point doing you know asro pop

1394
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,039
cross Kush mins you know someone else

1395
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:03,919
has probably already done it what advice

1396
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,798
would you give to someone about how they

1397
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,519
could try to you know carve their own

1398
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:10,599
path out without further going down the

1399
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:12,838
genetic dead end we've

1400
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,880
discussed [ __ ] if if you want to you

1401
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:17,558
know do it easily

1402
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,720
and you have a lot of nice plants to

1403
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:24,200
work with today that provide like your

1404
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:26,639
base Chassy so let's say Oreos so Oreos

1405
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:30,078
is a plant that is an A+ and every

1406
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,838
category except um the I would say the

1407
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,880
flavor smells a little off but like in

1408
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:36,400
terms of resistance and I mean it's

1409
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,920
bulletproof gorgeous gorgeous plant if

1410
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,720
we could take that as the chassis and

1411
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,400
then put a better paint job on it and

1412
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:46,759
and throw some flavor in it then what

1413
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,280
you have now is is something that's

1414
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,559
pretty pretty workable and so I think

1415
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,400
that the advice for anybody that wants

1416
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:57,119
to do something is first do it because

1417
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,200
you like it do it do it because you're

1418
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,440
into it don't worry about and if you

1419
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,480
like

1420
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,798
gastropa you know uh Z crosses then

1421
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,519
that's what you like it's okay it it

1422
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,159
doesn't matter where you begin what

1423
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:13,798
matters is you begin it's just that when

1424
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:16,318
you go to work with lines that are

1425
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:18,318
extremely clustered where you have many

1426
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:21,440
poly hybrids that got put together to

1427
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:24,119
create the hybrid what you have is this

1428
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,760
wicked population that pops out and it

1429
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,358
makes it very unpredictable so I think

1430
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,240
that if you're trying to really

1431
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:31,679
understand you know better breeding you

1432
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,798
work with things that are a little more

1433
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,960
necked up so like that's why you got to

1434
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:37,759
see so much skunk one and and Northern

1435
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,440
Lights type work because it were pretty

1436
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,880
consistent in what came out from seed

1437
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,920
form so it allows you to play around and

1438
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,358
say okay what happens when I do this and

1439
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,000
it lets you find subtleties but if

1440
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:51,000
you're taking a poly hybrid and you're

1441
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
hitting with another poly hybrid you

1442
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,798
might have to open up the population to

1443
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,960
a couple hundred to really find the one

1444
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:00,679
you were hoping to get because there's

1445
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,280
so many genetic combinations possible

1446
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:05,719
due to the

1447
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,599
incredible uh heteros of the gene pool

1448
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:09,279
present there's just so much [ __ ] going

1449
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,680
on so I think for anybody that was

1450
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,160
starting just make it easy on yourself

1451
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,159
and just do it because you like it you

1452
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:19,199
know Chase the flavor profile or chase

1453
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,318
it could be resistance for some people

1454
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,798
it's finishing time you need something

1455
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,519
to finish in your environment for some

1456
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:27,199
people they need it very short because

1457
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,639
they have uh

1458
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,358
low ceilings in their grow I mean it

1459
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,838
doesn't have to be profound why you're

1460
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:37,279
choosing and working with something just

1461
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:41,119
let that be the constraint so that you

1462
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,720
learn how to breed towards a constraint

1463
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,519
I call it like intentional breeding

1464
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:47,439
you're you're conscious of what you're

1465
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:50,798
trying to do otherwise I used use the

1466
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,159
same analogy it you and I both have dogs

1467
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,119
and we're neighbors your dog jumps the

1468
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:57,519
fence and screws my dog that doesn't

1469
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:01,480
make me a dog breeder

1470
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:03,759
right not a dog breeder two dogs had sex

1471
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,880
it it's there's no intention to that yes

1472
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,119
my my female is going to produce puppies

1473
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,400
now but does that mean that I had any

1474
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:13,559
idea of this and and do I have any idea

1475
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,960
the outcome so I think for for people

1476
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,640
who are getting into breeding you can

1477
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,400
play with anything and open it up

1478
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,480
because it's always good to see diverse

1479
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,318
gene pool because it lets you understand

1480
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,798
the issue in cannabis today and then

1481
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,079
work with things that you know have been

1482
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:31,838
worked repetitively enough to where if

1483
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:33,400
you use it you can expect some form of

1484
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,639
consistent result and there's a ton of

1485
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,358
it there's no shortage of it online you

1486
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:40,719
you just have to go to craft breeders

1487
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:43,358
and and look for the words F4 F5 F6 like

1488
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,399
coffee from Kaa right everybody uses

1489
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:48,558
coffee and well not everybody but it's

1490
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,798
pretty popular as a base because K did a

1491
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,519
really good job stabilizing that work

1492
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,519
initially and then all the people who

1493
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:56,639
got it from them they in they took it

1494
00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:58,159
their own route individually

1495
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,639
so you got some of this stuff I'm

1496
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,480
looking at like you know F9

1497
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:06,358
F10 so you're in your 10th Generation of

1498
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,519
refinement breeding that plant should

1499
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:12,358
give you some stability in the outcome

1500
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,639
predictability is the word really and

1501
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:15,519
that's something that the the small

1502
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:16,879
breeder needs to see too so you work

1503
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,079
with something that's extremely

1504
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,240
predictable and then you work with some

1505
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,960
[ __ ] that's out of control so you get to

1506
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:26,118
experience the two Realms and you'll

1507
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,280
find who you are because for some people

1508
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,519
people experiencing the unpredictable is

1509
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,640
really what they need that's that's

1510
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:35,119
their Adventure that's their hunt you

1511
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,078
know what a brilliant and practical

1512
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,079
answer you know I like that example you

1513
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:41,240
gave about the chassis and making it

1514
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,880
your own from there I I really do love

1515
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:45,078
that and you spoke about you know maybe

1516
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,599
flavors your thing chase that well I'm

1517
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:48,280
going to I'm going to chase that up

1518
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,280
because I know that you probably know

1519
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,480
the backstory and the history on a lot

1520
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,000
of strin from gr

1521
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,079
Valley I used to I used to I used to

1522
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,079
think I did but at the end of the day

1523
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:01,640
what I know is like what I touch and

1524
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,480
sometimes we can there's many of us that

1525
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:07,639
can agree okay this seems to be the

1526
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,079
most possible story but you know with

1527
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:12,199
cannabis because of the nature of it

1528
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,839
illicitly there was always secret and

1529
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:17,639
then once you get into the game of

1530
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:19,838
whatever is hot it becomes that so DNA

1531
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:21,519
analysis lets us really take a look at

1532
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,719
this picture a lot differently you start

1533
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,960
to realize like wow um do we really know

1534
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:28,480
what we have at all so that's why like

1535
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,720
when you keep a clone or you keep

1536
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,880
something that really resonates with you

1537
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,798
it's best to keep it if at all possible

1538
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,280
keep the plant that resonated with you

1539
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,440
because you do not know if you can

1540
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,680
actually get back there because someone

1541
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,960
told you it was granddaddy per and

1542
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:48,440
really it was a Naple Kush and when you

1543
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,079
go buy granddaddy per seeds to go find

1544
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,639
that plant that you love so much you'll

1545
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,119
never find it because you don't really

1546
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:55,558
understand it's not that family at all

1547
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,039
certainly that's that's a valid point

1548
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,559
and I feel like you're reading my mind

1549
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,480
cuz you know exactly where I'm going to

1550
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,798
take this conversation but the first

1551
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,519
thing I wanted to ask you is do you know

1552
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:07,280
or do you have any idea on the backstory

1553
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,798
of Skittles because I feel like for a

1554
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,079
strain that's made such an impact in the

1555
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:13,000
community the the backstory is still

1556
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,798
relatively unknown I'm I'm wondering do

1557
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,199
you know anything about the infamous gas

1558
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:22,679
station Bob I do I do when that God this

1559
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:26,159
is a a controversial topic holy [ __ ]

1560
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,038
um so I get I get exposed to Skittle

1561
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,399
from fields at the emerald

1562
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:32,520
cup and it wasn't Skittles they wanted

1563
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,000
to call it sherbet and it was incredible

1564
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:36,159
I was like holy [ __ ] this shit's

1565
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,079
phenomenal and he's like yeah me and the

1566
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,558
boys you know uh we got this plant and

1567
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,720
so I didn't get a story from him I

1568
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:42,359
didn't know anything about it I just

1569
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:43,719
knew that it was it was cracking and

1570
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:46,358
this was I mean this was the moment it

1571
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:49,279
came out it wasn't called Skittle yet

1572
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:50,880
that name appeared then they created it

1573
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:55,160
they did an incredible job marketing and

1574
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,559
branding it but um one day I'm at my

1575
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:59,038
shop

1576
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:02,039
and uh this dude comes in to buy some

1577
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:04,000
clones and we're talking and he's like

1578
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:06,400
you want to smoke a joint I got some

1579
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,278
Skittle and I said yeah I said I'll burn

1580
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:12,440
with you I said you get that from Fieldy

1581
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:15,318
and he was like no he goes [ __ ] him I'm

1582
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,000
his father-in-law I provided the cut to

1583
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:20,880
him that's

1584
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,599
Bob and so his story was that he went

1585
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:28,920
down to velia to get a tray of clones

1586
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:32,798
and clone was a mistake in the

1587
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,798
tray and so

1588
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,359
when when so that and and so I had I got

1589
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:39,038
so I end up grabbing the cut I didn't

1590
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:42,318
get the cut from Fields I grab a copy of

1591
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:47,760
the skittle so I had it the whole time

1592
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:49,719
too from them but what what what I got

1593
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,000
was I got to hang out with

1594
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:54,759
[ __ ] and we were talking about he said

1595
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,798
hey I got a question he said I saw that

1596
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,119
you DNA your green sherbet and the

1597
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:02,199
skittle and they're

1598
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,599
connected and I said they are I said I

1599
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:06,199
had the green sherbet before the skittle

1600
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:07,559
or around that time and when I got a

1601
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,159
hold of it I said these things have to

1602
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:13,000
be related this flavor is too unique so

1603
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:16,759
I DNA them and they were

1604
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,278
related and that that relationship was

1605
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:22,079
just was posted and so when when [ __ ]

1606
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:26,599
and I hook

1607
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,920
up he has the same plants

1608
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:30,200
DNA and and so he's talking to me and

1609
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,639
and he's like what's the story and I

1610
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:32,838
said look I said I got it from a guy

1611
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:35,078
that got it from someone down in

1612
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:36,400
Southern California and he was like

1613
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:39,039
that's what we

1614
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,639
figured he had an employee that worked

1615
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:46,599
for him that he beli stole plants and

1616
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:49,358
went down to his mom's Spot which was in

1617
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:51,318
velia so does that mean all these

1618
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:53,440
stories are real no I mean Bob could be

1619
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:56,719
telling me a [ __ ] story and so too

1620
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,639
could Jac it's just that

1621
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:02,078
what I know is I'm acquiring plants from

1622
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:03,838
groups that are related so when I'm

1623
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,760
getting the green sherbet out of the out

1624
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,759
of the Bay Area sherbet

1625
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:12,200
crew that's in that cluster right how

1626
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,920
would that plant from them have Skittles

1627
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:15,480
in

1628
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,480
it because the DNA doesn't lie that

1629
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,278
they're connected does that mean we know

1630
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,798
how it happened no but what we know is

1631
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:24,239
that there's

1632
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:26,000
jeans and and that that green sherbet

1633
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:27,679
that I kicked out is still doing really

1634
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,639
well in the in the extraction circuit

1635
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,759
people still killing it with that

1636
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:33,199
plant but at the end of the day that's

1637
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,640
why I'm saying do you ever really know

1638
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,439
the real story and so what I know is

1639
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:39,920
that the skittle and that green sherbet

1640
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:44,318
are most definitely related what I know

1641
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:46,159
is that um it's not what the lineage

1642
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,599
says it is there's no it's not a

1643
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:49,879
grapefruit or whatever the [ __ ] it is

1644
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,000
that's listed on there but the problem

1645
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,720
is it's almost like we're going to get

1646
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,519
into cookie right so years before cookie

1647
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:57,759
gets released

1648
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:00,318
right like before the public gets to

1649
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,200
touch it Allan Atkinson out of Mendo

1650
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:05,519
says to

1651
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:08,919
me a cherry pie pollinated a Pakistani

1652
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,880
citral Kush the herb goes down to the

1653
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,920
Bay

1654
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:15,599
Area and [ __ ] gets that weed and gets a

1655
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,680
seed out of it and grows it and that's

1656
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:22,200
the cookie and he goes and when the day

1657
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:24,719
DNA comes out it'll it'll back that up

1658
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:27,519
and I laughed and said okay and years

1659
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,959
later when we got DNA we're like whoa

1660
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,400
It's cherry pie so you kind of go wait a

1661
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,400
second

1662
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,599
um these accidental pollinations that

1663
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,720
occur and then someone's fortuitous

1664
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:42,720
enough to recognize what they

1665
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:45,519
have right so the the the it isn't that

1666
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:46,959
you the problem is people claim to breed

1667
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,000
it which then [ __ ] them because they

1668
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,480
can't go back on that they can't say I

1669
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,400
didn't create this because they have to

1670
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,159
say I created it because it allows there

1671
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,559
to be exclusiveness which lets the

1672
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:58,078
public believe they're the only ones

1673
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,519
that are going to get it from that

1674
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,720
Source but down the road when the truth

1675
01:06:00,519 --> 01:06:04,159
comes out you can't back up from it

1676
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:08,078
because you've already set out loud

1677
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,960
10,000 times I made it and to me it

1678
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:16,079
would be better if you just said I found

1679
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:18,440
it and my skill was in recognizing its

1680
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,079
value so I think that when you really go

1681
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,119
through and start to look at a lot of

1682
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:25,079
the the foundation work that people have

1683
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:27,720
done a lot of the stories that go along

1684
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:29,839
when I get into the world of Hayes and

1685
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:32,078
you're talking to Neville's crew or

1686
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:34,318
you're talking to Sam's crew you like

1687
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,798
each crew has their own unique story on

1688
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:40,558
that and they don't Jive at all I'm

1689
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:42,318
talking [ __ ] not at all so who do you

1690
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,880
believe really you know what I mean you

1691
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:45,558
have to kind of choose who you believe

1692
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,358
and it's like no no he's right they're

1693
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:48,559
all right in their own regard but the

1694
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,960
problem is they're all they're all

1695
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,798
legendary figures and at the end of the

1696
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,159
day I've talked to all of them and no

1697
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:59,079
story ever really

1698
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:01,318
balances itself evenly throughout so

1699
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:05,200
what I just know is that it's incredible

1700
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:07,000
herb and we have a great story behind it

1701
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:08,598
and that way what it does it lets you it

1702
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,838
lets you get away

1703
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:12,920
from where it came from because at the

1704
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:15,119
end of the day it's opinion unless you

1705
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,838
bred that [ __ ] yourself if you [ __ ]

1706
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,559
went to Colombia and returned with those

1707
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:22,000
seeds in your pocket you can tell me

1708
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:23,960
that that shit's Colombian that from

1709
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,880
this region and it did this but

1710
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,760
otherwise it could it could you could

1711
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,720
have bought those seeds off of any land

1712
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,960
race group and so and sold them to me I

1713
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:32,519
collected these myself you know you got

1714
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,679
them in a mixed pack from

1715
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:37,119
somebody you don't

1716
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:39,000
know some really interesting talking

1717
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,519
points you touched on there and as you

1718
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,159
said sometimes you just got to take all

1719
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:44,199
the stories and just take them all on

1720
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:46,278
board instead of committing hard to one

1721
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:48,078
or the other and you know what a great

1722
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:50,239
answer about the Skittles you know so

1723
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,079
much info there I guess I'd love to ask

1724
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:53,838
two quick follow-ups the first one is do

1725
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,640
you think that the green sherb and the

1726
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,558
Skittles are like sisters from the same

1727
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,639
seed stock or more likely to be like

1728
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,519
ones an S one of the other and as a

1729
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,719
quick followup to that does this not

1730
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:07,119
speak huge volumes about like the

1731
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:08,480
monolith that is cookies in the sense of

1732
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,278
what they've been able to bring to the

1733
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,599
industry both cookies and possibly

1734
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:15,358
Skittles oh yeah they're they're

1735
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:19,600
definitely related and we can't you

1736
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:21,439
can't tell if it's um parent or child

1737
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,838
you just you just know that they're

1738
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:27,559
they're definitely

1739
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:29,399
linked um now cookies what cookies was

1740
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,880
able to do was cookies cookies was able

1741
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:34,479
to take the

1742
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,039
Cannabis lifestyle of the future they

1743
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:39,838
recognized the people in the Bay Area

1744
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:43,278
wanted their own Vibe they they build

1745
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,679
this machine of culture that and it's

1746
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,880
funny because people from the past in

1747
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:47,440
cannabis culture you know they don't

1748
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,079
like the culture but it's not their

1749
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:52,158
culture it's a culture for people that

1750
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:53,798
are 22 years old which just like us at

1751
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,479
one point in time that was our culture

1752
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:59,399
we were 22 and what they were able to do

1753
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:01,318
was capture that lifestyle imagery and

1754
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:03,639
then you got some crazy circumstances

1755
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,960
you know you got you got you got jigo

1756
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:09,199
who digs up the cookie cut approaches

1757
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:11,640
burner who's a musician who moves

1758
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,678
packs that they're able to create this

1759
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,520
pipeline of this really beautiful plant

1760
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:19,679
that is absolutely polar to OG so OG had

1761
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,600
owned it but the bay is a purple region

1762
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,079
right so the ber has always been really

1763
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,640
per dominant and per more than a color

1764
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:29,079
is a flavor too it's it's it's a feel

1765
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,960
it's it's it's more complicated than

1766
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:33,359
what people give it it's not just anthos

1767
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,920
and it's a it's a mental connection to a

1768
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,319
thing purple is the color of royalty

1769
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,600
there's all these little things that

1770
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:42,159
just people go for

1771
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,359
it and he was able to take this

1772
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:47,960
radically different thing than OG and

1773
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,719
highlight it and pushed it the internet

1774
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,198
takes it the internet's blown up at this

1775
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:53,520
time and so now you're like you've had

1776
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,759
you had forums before but the marketing

1777
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,000
on the internet for cookies was

1778
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:02,600
Supernatural that stuff was flying and

1779
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:06,158
lo and behold who is burner's next door

1780
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,760
neighbor shabinsky so shabinsky lives

1781
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,759
next door to him so shabinsky is like

1782
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,119
hey I got this maale I want to use let

1783
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,880
me use your cut and then next thing you

1784
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,238
know you got you got sherbet coming out

1785
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,400
then they go back into it and then you

1786
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:20,599
got you got gelato coming out and so

1787
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,599
they're just swirling some plants around

1788
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,440
but what they're doing is they're

1789
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,760
putting together some really incredible

1790
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:28,319
work because you can't deny the fact

1791
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,320
that billions and billions and billions

1792
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,759
of dollars of that flow sold and still

1793
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:34,840
sell which means people must have liked

1794
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,719
it they must have like the appearance

1795
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:39,679
and they must have like the the flavor

1796
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,880
and the effect so sherb hits you know he

1797
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,440
hits a ball clear out of the planet with

1798
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,400
this first

1799
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:49,399
work and it's just this Coincidence of

1800
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:51,439
you're in the Bay Area at the right time

1801
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:54,079
with the right guy and sher's a smart

1802
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:56,000
dude they knew how to brand and push

1803
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,079
they were able to do the hype same thing

1804
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,359
with the Skittles if you look at

1805
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:03,279
Skittles I

1806
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:05,839
think Pace The Strain bro is about as

1807
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:08,000
funny as it gets like their whole the

1808
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,840
whole Z thing and the I mean they just

1809
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,000
basically stole the whole brand from

1810
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,840
from uh was it Wrigley but they did such

1811
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,359
a good job it was just so funny just

1812
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,520
excellent imagery and if you look at

1813
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:25,519
Skittle you know anything that's that

1814
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,600
has Skittle in it is worth 18% more in

1815
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,760
the

1816
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,560
market and that was data that the

1817
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,840
company that sued him dug up I read the

1818
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,600
whole lawsuit because I was just so

1819
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,440
fascinated with it and the claims on

1820
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,079
financial damage were there because they

1821
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:43,638
said hey if Skittles in weed it sells

1822
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:46,319
for an average of 18% more than herb

1823
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:48,719
that doesn't have Skittles so Skittles

1824
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,559
has a flavor that's absolutely hyper

1825
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:53,000
addictive to

1826
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,600
people show me something right now

1827
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,960
that's not that's hot that doesn't have

1828
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:00,639
it in it holy [ __ ] it's it's it's got to

1829
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,039
be 50% of the market and and if you add

1830
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:04,960
gelato now you're up to 80% of the

1831
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,920
market and then you had triangle cush

1832
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,920
and you finished the [ __ ]

1833
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:12,399
job you're basically covering the

1834
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,080
[ __ ] whole thing right so it's just

1835
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:16,519
some brilliant marketing but you can't

1836
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:19,399
deny that people must have loved it or

1837
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:21,880
they wouldn't buy it and use it and so

1838
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:24,399
you know cookies cookies Brilliance was

1839
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:27,920
that they just I look at I look at

1840
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:30,079
cookies like I look at like DC Shoes

1841
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,760
like I look at other like skate Brands

1842
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,000
lifestyle Brands I look at them like Red

1843
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,679
Bull where Red Bull is they're yeah

1844
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,279
they're an energy drink but really

1845
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,679
they're a media company that what they

1846
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:43,000
Market is

1847
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,600
adrenaline and what what cookies markets

1848
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,079
is is this you know urban

1849
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,679
lifestyle where you're wearing flashy

1850
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:53,439
[ __ ] and you got cool trendy clothes

1851
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,760
every store has it like [ __ ] I have a

1852
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:58,799
cookie store right so every

1853
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,320
every store has its own clothing line so

1854
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,840
if you want to get something from the

1855
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:05,920
One log you got to buy it from us so

1856
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,560
it's some really brilliant [ __ ] when it

1857
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,639
comes down to addressing how people

1858
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,360
behave in the in the current world and I

1859
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:15,920
think that the issue so many have is

1860
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:20,079
it's so contrary to the way we behaved

1861
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:23,359
prior because we weren't flashy we were

1862
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:26,279
far more subdued we lived in much more

1863
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:29,719
um obscurity we were trying not to be

1864
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:31,639
seen we were trying not to yell loud we

1865
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:34,520
were we were moving our herb because the

1866
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:37,639
market had not enough herb so it was

1867
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:39,600
sucking out of your hands and what he

1868
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:41,560
did was created a marketing machine

1869
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,719
that's absolutely unparalleled in

1870
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,840
cannabis today I don't see anybody in

1871
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:48,279
any

1872
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:51,279
country that's really doing what he's

1873
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:54,238
doing in promoting the

1874
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:57,599
product there's bigger Brands but I

1875
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:59,678
don't think anybody is is is he's done a

1876
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,800
better job there's no celebrity brands

1877
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:05,920
that work that don't connect to

1878
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:08,400
him yeah hugely he's he's definitely

1879
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,639
paved the way for a lot of people a lot

1880
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,799
of jobs um put food on table for a lot

1881
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:13,480
of people that's something that I always

1882
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,000
think about whenever I read criticisms

1883
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:18,638
of burner it's um it's kind of

1884
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,760
undeniable the uh the success and the uh

1885
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:23,199
the influence he's had on the industry

1886
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,400
um to to quickly loop back though to the

1887
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:27,479
the Skittles we were talking about was

1888
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:28,920
it was the phos testing which revealed

1889
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:31,238
that link initially between the Green

1890
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,679
Sher and the Skittles and obviously a

1891
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:36,238
few years ago the whole catastrophic

1892
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,399
burndown of phos was was quite a sort of

1893
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:40,198
prominent discussion point when some of

1894
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:41,638
their future plans came to light and

1895
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:44,519
some of the issues around the storage

1896
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:46,039
and selling of data I'd love to ask how

1897
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,760
do you feel about it all now that the

1898
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,319
dust is settled and you know how how do

1899
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,039
you feel in the context of how the story

1900
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:52,559
all

1901
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:55,639
unfolded well [ __ ] I feel I I feel the

1902
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,120
same now as I did then the the the truth

1903
01:14:55,639 --> 01:15:00,359
of it is is when like I'm like I'm I'm

1904
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,920
I'm I've been working with phos for a

1905
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:04,079
decade right I met him when they were in

1906
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,880
a laboratory in the basement of an a

1907
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,319
university in Oregon and they asked me

1908
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,319
to come in to speak to them about um the

1909
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:13,679
world of of cannabis genetics and I

1910
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:16,079
asked them what do you guys do and they

1911
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:20,880
said what we want to do is we want to be

1912
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:22,238
able to do the research for breeders so

1913
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,840
I said you don't you don't want to get

1914
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:26,718
involved in breeding yourself they said

1915
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,520
no what we want is we want the ability

1916
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,119
to just do the research because then we

1917
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,239
don't have to go raise the money for

1918
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:35,920
infrastructure for cultivation and all

1919
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:39,158
the other Associated pieces we're all um

1920
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,480
PhD level geneticists what we want to be

1921
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:44,119
able to do is take the information from

1922
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:47,279
the farmers go through it and then go to

1923
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:49,679
their farms and help them do the actual

1924
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:50,800
project but where from the the the

1925
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,960
science end of it they're the

1926
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,159
cultivation end of it and I said hey I

1927
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,960
said I like that because what I was

1928
01:15:55,158 --> 01:15:58,238
trying to do at the same time was when

1929
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,960
we did it we were able to put the

1930
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:02,319
Appalachians into Humble County and so

1931
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,039
even though they're not technically true

1932
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,279
Appalachians because cannabis is an

1933
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:08,679
indigenous to Humble County we were able

1934
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:11,119
to take the ideas of Appalachians and

1935
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:14,279
then how they modified them for American

1936
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:15,920
grape as amended viticultural agreements

1937
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:18,000
and at the end of the day what the point

1938
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,319
of it is is that I wanted to be able to

1939
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,679
start having a relationship with a

1940
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:24,679
genetic company that would allow us to

1941
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:27,520
start developing and Building Things

1942
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:30,359
That fit our Farms

1943
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:33,840
optimally that we would then be able to

1944
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:37,719
license or or protect and have the

1945
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:39,679
ability to operate in in a scarce model

1946
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:41,359
so that the small farms that were

1947
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:44,079
getting the appalation that's a

1948
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:46,158
distinction if the appalation is is is

1949
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,399
really in effect it means that the genes

1950
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:51,238
and the place merge and create a very

1951
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:53,399
unique impact the ability to have a gene

1952
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:56,479
company and to develop these plants that

1953
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:59,920
you own so now the only person that has

1954
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:01,959
this product is your farm to me allows

1955
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,920
small operators to be able to fight in

1956
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:07,960
the future because it it's it's only way

1957
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,359
you can you have to have better plants

1958
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,039
and you have to have unique plants so we

1959
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:15,679
get together and

1960
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:17,600
work and this [ __ ] started going south

1961
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:20,880
for

1962
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,440
them and it it it's funny because like I

1963
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,000
don't talk about it too much but what

1964
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:27,399
took place was the industry wasn't at

1965
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,600
the level it needed to be to work with

1966
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:32,198
scientists and so what happened was they

1967
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,920
made an assumption which was wrong that

1968
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:37,279
cannabis farmers were going to be able

1969
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:39,800
to operate on a very consistent level

1970
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:42,279
that a scientific project

1971
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,400
requires and science requires a lot more

1972
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:45,198
than you think it does like we're

1973
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:46,599
talking multi-year projects right so

1974
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:48,479
like I'm not a scientist so I don't

1975
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,800
pretend to be one either I just work

1976
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:52,718
with shitloads of them for decades and

1977
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,920
what I know is that it's a tension to

1978
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,239
[ __ ] detail that really separates

1979
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:00,480
good science where you are absolutely

1980
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:02,879
myopic on the [ __ ] data and there can

1981
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:06,638
be no deviation or there's chance that

1982
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,480
it won't work and so I was putting him

1983
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:12,639
in contact with

1984
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:16,399
Farms large Farms large operations to do

1985
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:18,480
the work and it was failing because the

1986
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:19,679
Growers didn't want to show up they

1987
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,439
didn't need to show up everybody was

1988
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,440
still making money you're you're not

1989
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,599
making the 4,000 a pound you made but

1990
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:27,719
you're making 2,000 a pound you didn't

1991
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,920
really realize you're about to make 300

1992
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:31,600
a pound but in your mind you're still

1993
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,480
balling out of control so you're showing

1994
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,960
up when you want to show up and you're

1995
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:39,198
you're not really having any any kind of

1996
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,198
inspections from the state so you're

1997
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,638
still using all kinds of crazy [ __ ]

1998
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:45,879
secretly in your facilities you're not

1999
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:48,760
following protocol in any way shape or

2000
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,520
form because you didn't need to because

2001
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,320
herb had always been like that herb

2002
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,280
wasn't a well-oiled machine it was a

2003
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:57,079
bunch of clanky [ __ ] gears that

2004
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:59,519
worked because there was a market that

2005
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:01,000
wanted so much herb You couldn't

2006
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:05,080
possibly fill

2007
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,198
it it was a shortage of product that

2008
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:11,039
made all of us feel like we were smart

2009
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:12,919
well once the [ __ ] products filled in

2010
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:14,238
does everybody feel so smart now are you

2011
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,158
like you know like you can you can be

2012
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,799
swarmy about it like you know my my

2013
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:19,238
pot's better than the big person but

2014
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,800
you're having to work at the at the

2015
01:19:19,238 --> 01:19:22,359
[ __ ] coffee shop just to pay your

2016
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,000
rent because you're getting the [ __ ]

2017
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:27,719
kicked out of you in your weed game none

2018
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,238
of us knew this and I had a feeling I

2019
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:30,760
did I had a premonition that this [ __ ]

2020
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:33,359
was going to occur and I was trying to

2021
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:36,239
develop all my relationships so that

2022
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:38,000
when the dust settled we would still be

2023
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,718
able to function in Humble County we

2024
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,079
would still be able to have an ability

2025
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:43,639
to create a value and and a lot of it

2026
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,198
was land preservation I knew we were G

2027
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:47,400
to get butchered but I didn't want to

2028
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,678
have to sell my property it was

2029
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:52,719
something I wanted to give to my

2030
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:54,279
kids so I get this like this that that's

2031
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,520
an emotional piece of me but I'm hanging

2032
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:59,079
on to this land I get involved with them

2033
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,239
to develop I tie them into all these

2034
01:19:59,079 --> 01:20:01,719
people and I'm not going to name who

2035
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,879
they worked with but Jesus Christ these

2036
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:05,840
are people that are [ __ ] big today

2037
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,880
and absolutely dropped the ball and they

2038
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,760
said hey this isn't working we're gonna

2039
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,880
have to go raise money because we can't

2040
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,119
and they already raised money to to get

2041
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,840
to that point they already had to buy

2042
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,279
all the sequencers they had to go buy

2043
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,039
the tools they had to hire the scientist

2044
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:23,759
so they got this entire [ __ ] company

2045
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,519
they're building with with expectation

2046
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,480
of payment of that money somebody

2047
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,639
[ __ ] loaned them the cash and now

2048
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:31,839
they can't pay it back because they

2049
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:34,199
can't actually do the job that they set

2050
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,679
out to do because the people they were

2051
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:39,919
working with weren't ready so it isn't

2052
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,079
that cannabis people are too stupid it's

2053
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,399
just they weren't ready for the

2054
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:44,119
realization that they were going to have

2055
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,158
to get the [ __ ] up in the morning early

2056
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:49,158
and be there on time in a facility

2057
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:51,039
that's clean and normal because that's

2058
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:53,519
not what the norm

2059
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:55,439
was right it like I mean I've been to a

2060
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,320
milli I've been a milli but I've been as

2061
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,119
many grows as anybody I know I've seen

2062
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:00,639
grows all over the place they look

2063
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:01,760
radically different now than they did in

2064
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,159
the

2065
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,920
past the cleanliness the just the just

2066
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:08,319
the overall like the Improvement of

2067
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,880
cultivation practices is Inc

2068
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:13,279
tremendously

2069
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:15,760
so they have to go raise the money right

2070
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:17,679
and so I always say the same thing I'm

2071
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,600
like they send the CEO out there to go

2072
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,560
raise the loop he goes to a conference

2073
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:25,000
somebody films it and they say oh look

2074
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,920
at this [ __ ] guy he's saying we have

2075
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,238
all the data which doesn't do [ __ ] you

2076
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,560
could have all the data you wanted but

2077
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:32,319
until you go run it through a [ __ ]

2078
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:35,679
sequencer for 10 years there's there's

2079
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:37,158
very little value but for people who are

2080
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,960
investment it's

2081
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:42,679
sexy and then he says you know cannabis

2082
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,239
people can't breed and in terms of like

2083
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:46,000
scientific breeding they can't because

2084
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,799
they don't have the tools they're not

2085
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,079
corn

2086
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,520
breeders and so they took it personal

2087
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:52,920
and I would too because you know the

2088
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,199
words coming out of his mouth are bad

2089
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,639
but you got to remember the guy was

2090
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:59,119
pitching for money and I always use the

2091
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:01,359
same analogy you went out on a date and

2092
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:03,760
somebody filmed you talking to this girl

2093
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,719
that you're trying to hang out with and

2094
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,920
they filmed all your words and no one

2095
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:09,520
knew but but the [ __ ] cameraman that

2096
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,719
you were speaking and so therefore your

2097
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,280
honest [ __ ] was coming out your mouth

2098
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:16,719
how [ __ ] well do you paint yourself

2099
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:19,158
when you're trying to pitch for a date

2100
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,399
when you're pitching for an investor

2101
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:23,198
that shit's even worse you are trying to

2102
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:25,638
make it look like you are just

2103
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,719
absolutely are the greatest shest bet in

2104
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:30,119
human history because you're asking them

2105
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:32,960
to give us money to stay

2106
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:35,000
alive and so my and it's funny I never

2107
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,039
really hung out with mowley much mowley

2108
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,198
was the CEO my connections were the COO

2109
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:41,560
and one of the founders so Ralph and nwn

2110
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:43,919
were the guys I had dealt with and all

2111
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,600
their scientists and I knew mowgly but

2112
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,158
we really never spent much time together

2113
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,679
and he was always hella nice and he was

2114
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:51,759
definitely a brilliant dude I mean in in

2115
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,119
terms of like intellectual capacity for

2116
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:58,880
being a breeder I mean holy [ __ ] he was

2117
01:22:54,119 --> 01:23:00,039
Absol absolutely razor sharp but mowley

2118
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,920
made the

2119
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:05,319
mistake

2120
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,960
of insulting an industry that was on

2121
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:09,079
their hands and knees getting the [ __ ]

2122
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,439
kicked out of them by the money

2123
01:23:09,079 --> 01:23:14,639
already and they were just getting

2124
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:16,599
shelled and so what they said was the

2125
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,279
only thing we have is our genetics and

2126
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,679
that we know this plant better than

2127
01:23:18,279 --> 01:23:23,000
these people and when he says hey I

2128
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:25,679
already have your data and I don't need

2129
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,719
you everyone felt in validated and so

2130
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,359
because I and it's funny because I get

2131
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:31,719
jammed into it too because I had the

2132
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:34,679
largest data collection on the on the

2133
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:36,920
the Galaxy but what I was doing and that

2134
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:38,158
was through the future cannabis uh uh

2135
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,480
what was that called at the time not

2136
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,599
future cannabis project but it was with

2137
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,119
Rob Clark and a bunch of them they came

2138
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,760
to me and said hey there's a group

2139
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:49,119
that's putting genetics into a system if

2140
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:52,239
you put your genes in it'll open source

2141
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:54,119
it in a sense that nobody can claim it

2142
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,839
as theirs because you've stated that

2143
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:58,719
it's been been in Prior use so what I

2144
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,360
did is I took the entire collection I

2145
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,600
had amassed and I put it into public

2146
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:05,359
domain so that anybody that I'd ever

2147
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,960
sold a clone to that was making money

2148
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:09,198
with it would be able to make money

2149
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,719
forever using it because nobody owned it

2150
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:13,399
but them or me or anybody it had no

2151
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:16,560
ownership because I'm the one that put

2152
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:18,599
it on the Galaxy and I'm not claiming it

2153
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,920
and so the the funny thing is is I start

2154
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:25,320
getting hit by people screaming at me

2155
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:26,960
about how I um fck on the data and the

2156
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:29,439
genetics and I'm laughing I'm like I'm

2157
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,560
the one that gave you the

2158
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:34,678
plant they didn't steal your genes

2159
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,520
you're saying that the sfv cut that

2160
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:38,960
that's on the Galaxy that they have the

2161
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,800
data from and that's stamped is somehow

2162
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,399
directly [ __ ] you and you're mad at

2163
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,279
me because I'm part of it but I'm the

2164
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:47,879
one that gave you the plant so it's not

2165
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:51,599
your plant really it's just you don't

2166
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,600
have an ability to own it either so I

2167
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,800
took my whole collection and opened it

2168
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,679
up to the public

2169
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,400
in a way and this was like from Robin so

2170
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,520
then Rob and then have fallen out with

2171
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:03,920
mowgly and I don't even know the story

2172
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:07,639
on that [ __ ] I don't even care I just

2173
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:10,719
know that when you put plants that are

2174
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:12,719
sequenced into the open air it means

2175
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,319
that there's a prior knowledge that plan

2176
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,239
existed which means that for the rest of

2177
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:17,559
my career I can grow OG Kush and never

2178
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:21,678
have to listen to one [ __ ] person

2179
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:23,920
tell me I can't or anyone else so I knew

2180
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,960
what I was trying to do because those

2181
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,880
are the plants that and and it was it

2182
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,760
was the idea that these plants are the

2183
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:33,079
ones that I had used to build my world

2184
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:36,480
that we had collected and and held and

2185
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:39,079
stored and moved and bred and created

2186
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,959
and to me this this population of plants

2187
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:44,519
was our Lifeline that we had all worked

2188
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,840
years people I had received them from

2189
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,119
some of them people were dead so like

2190
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,520
I'm somebody who's been holding plants

2191
01:25:48,118 --> 01:25:53,439
in quantity for

2192
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:55,800
decades constantly moving plants

2193
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,118
millions of [ __ ] plants through my hands

2194
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,079
for

2195
01:25:57,118 --> 01:26:03,238
years to me what I wanted was that base

2196
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:05,000
population to be everybody's and then

2197
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:07,399
from this point forward you would go and

2198
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,600
develop your own work and license it

2199
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:10,879
because that's the only way you're going

2200
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,960
to compete as a small operator you

2201
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,679
cannot run the same plant that a big

2202
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,800
brand has it's insane because they're

2203
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,118
going to kick your ass in price they're

2204
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,800
going to drop the price seven bucks and

2205
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:21,759
you're done they're not going to buy you

2206
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,760
better weed they're going to buy $7

2207
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,239
cheaper weed and when people argue with

2208
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,280
me I laugh I'm like and you own a store

2209
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:28,799
and have a cash register trust me on

2210
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:30,158
this one drop the price seven bucks and

2211
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,560
watch that [ __ ] walk out the door like

2212
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:36,238
it's got three legs

2213
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:40,600
so this whole thing was this war over

2214
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:43,279
what took place and the idea that philos

2215
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:46,679
had a gene gun that they could use to

2216
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:49,079
shoot the DNA code from the sample that

2217
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:50,520
was sent and recreate new material and

2218
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,399
I'm like so let me get this straight

2219
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:54,679
somebody's got a [ __ ] Gene gun that

2220
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:57,158
they can recreate [ __ ] from the past and

2221
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:59,118
they're using it to create your [ __ ]

2222
01:26:57,158 --> 01:27:00,118
plant of all the things in the world

2223
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:04,118
that I could

2224
01:27:00,118 --> 01:27:07,839
restore I I need your weed cut the [ __ ]

2225
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:10,639
got nuts and it got so out of control

2226
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,600
because it became This Witch Hunt and

2227
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,960
anybody who had ever worked with the

2228
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,920
company had to basically tell them to

2229
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,319
[ __ ] off so that they didn't get

2230
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:21,239
attacked but as soon as they did the

2231
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:22,719
public had crucified him anyways and so

2232
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:24,519
I'm I'm involved in this [ __ ] and I'm

2233
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:27,520
watching it go down and I'm like what a

2234
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:28,920
[ __ ] debacle and the company hits me

2235
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,480
up and says

2236
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,960
hey you're getting hammered on this [ __ ]

2237
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:34,879
man people are like losing their mind

2238
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,880
over this because you're not you're not

2239
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,840
saying that we lied to you and like I'm

2240
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,679
saying no you didn't lie to me you

2241
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,840
weren't I know you're not trying to

2242
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:45,920
steal anyone's [ __ ] I understand what

2243
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:49,400
you're trying to do and I know how it

2244
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:51,800
panned out but what you're saying to me

2245
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:54,359
is that if I need to throw you under the

2246
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,760
bus you're okay with that to save mine

2247
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:58,639
neck and they're like yeah we would

2248
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,600
rather you say that like we lied to you

2249
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,279
and screwed you because we feel bad that

2250
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,400
you're getting so attacked in the public

2251
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:07,639
and I said listen I said anytime anybody

2252
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:11,000
says that they'll take the beaten for

2253
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:13,600
you that's who I stick with because the

2254
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,679
public who the [ __ ] is the public like

2255
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,440
honestly like where is this what is this

2256
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,039
thing is it a [ __ ] entity that floats

2257
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:22,759
around in the room it varies daytoday

2258
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:25,359
minute by minute and what I know is I'm

2259
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:28,000
not an internet entity I'm on the net a

2260
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:30,158
lot because I spend time doing stuff

2261
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,359
like this but my whole world was built

2262
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:33,759
off of

2263
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:35,880
work and so I'm just like [ __ ] you if

2264
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,560
you know me you know me and if you don't

2265
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,760
like me you don't like me but over the

2266
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,000
years it's been pretty stable and solid

2267
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,239
and I'm just going to stick with the

2268
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,158
group that knows me and if the internet

2269
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:47,279
World decides that they just can't deal

2270
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:49,920
with me then so be it I go into

2271
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:52,920
purgatory on in the web but I'm not

2272
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,359
going to dump you as a as a as a friend

2273
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,719
because you're telling me hey you can

2274
01:28:54,359 --> 01:29:00,319
make you can make it look like we

2275
01:28:55,719 --> 01:29:03,319
screwed you so at the end of the day it

2276
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,719
all dies down and what they end up doing

2277
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:06,519
is they end up spending you know the

2278
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,679
next six seven years developing

2279
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:11,400
incredible CBD lines and then all these

2280
01:29:08,679 --> 01:29:15,359
seed lines and they went into the almost

2281
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:18,198
20% thcv Gene so now you're seeing a 20%

2282
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:20,158
thcv release from them so all the stuff

2283
01:29:18,198 --> 01:29:23,519
that they wanted to do which was create

2284
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:26,319
seed lines do plant development all of

2285
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,840
that had happen in a way they never

2286
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,599
intended it to happen which really cost

2287
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,920
them a lot of money they had to raise

2288
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,560
and get delution because at the end of

2289
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,079
the day what they wanted to do was just

2290
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,520
be data scientists and play with your

2291
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:41,158
toys and so it's a good lesson because

2292
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,080
at the end of the day a team of

2293
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:45,399
brilliant people that could gather money

2294
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:47,079
still went down the wrong road because

2295
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:48,599
of the assumption that the people they

2296
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:50,679
were going to work with would be able to

2297
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:53,280
play at that level

2298
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:55,158
currently so now you're seeing this [ __ ]

2299
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:56,920
everywhere this there's there's no

2300
01:29:55,158 --> 01:29:58,359
shortage of DNA people there's no

2301
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:01,239
shortage of this and everybody's

2302
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:05,198
screaming and yelling about it but they

2303
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:08,879
were the first and when you filmed that

2304
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:11,439
raise and you get them on tape saying

2305
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:15,520
cannabis people don't know how to breed

2306
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:16,638
and we have the data holy [ __ ] it was a

2307
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,760
it it was

2308
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:22,840
done and if you really spend time around

2309
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,360
breeders real breeders then you realize

2310
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:27,960
that you you you're a hobbyist in that

2311
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:30,479
regard spend time with someone who

2312
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,198
invented like you know GMO corn where

2313
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:34,158
they're like you know no what I did is I

2314
01:30:32,198 --> 01:30:36,678
I modified a genome so now we can

2315
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:40,279
produce enough corn to feed 1.2 billion

2316
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:43,319
people um there there's there's levels

2317
01:30:40,279 --> 01:30:45,198
to the game and when you start to play

2318
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:46,679
with these people at that level you

2319
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:49,118
understand oh I got you you're not a I'm

2320
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:50,800
not a real breeder and like I said my

2321
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:52,479
mom was a research geneticist I grew up

2322
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,960
in a house with a woman doing fruit fly

2323
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:58,959
experiments what I is that if you're not

2324
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:01,359
that you're not the that title and

2325
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,920
that's why I never call myself I get

2326
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,799
called constantly but I'm not I'm a

2327
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,960
selector I work with breeders helping

2328
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:11,039
them understand what it is the market

2329
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,480
wants and needs and what the cultivator

2330
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,279
wants and needs and what the processing

2331
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:18,718
manufacturing supply chain wants and

2332
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:20,679
needs and then it lets me come in and

2333
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:22,560
work with them in huge populations so we

2334
01:31:20,679 --> 01:31:23,960
can say okay let's look for the outliers

2335
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,199
and mark them and now look for those

2336
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:28,480
those traits on the on the tree and

2337
01:31:26,198 --> 01:31:30,319
start to figure out how do we identify

2338
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:34,238
those traits in the progyny so that we

2339
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:36,359
can do more selective work and so at the

2340
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:37,879
end of the day you know it's it's it's

2341
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:41,479
was probably the most controversial

2342
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:45,239
thing I've ever been involved in and it

2343
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:48,000
was this idea that I was like nefarious

2344
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:49,599
where I had sold all these jeans to him

2345
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,158
and I didn't they were all genes that I

2346
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:55,280
open sourced so that never in history

2347
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:58,079
could anybody take your OG Kush cut a

2348
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,840
sour any of that [ __ ] you can't own it

2349
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,679
either and say to someone else they

2350
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,239
can't have it and that's really what

2351
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,000
pissed people off is because people

2352
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:09,599
started to think that this is

2353
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,439
mine and I'm like how can it be yours if

2354
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,840
I gave it to you yeah exactly that

2355
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:16,439
that's that's a really awesome recount

2356
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,480
of the whole series of events from your

2357
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:20,039
perspective you know I certainly

2358
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:21,839
certainly can appreciate it from your

2359
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:24,279
point of view much more than before

2360
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,239
hearing that so you know I'm in your

2361
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:28,198
school of thought you know I um I don't

2362
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:29,959
think anyone was really expecting it in

2363
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:32,319
that sense but it's cool to hear they're

2364
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,840
still producing some work as a as a

2365
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:36,639
quick followup I'd love to know um do

2366
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,360
you think we will get to the point where

2367
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,279
the genomic testing does what everyone

2368
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,880
dreams of it doing where you can test

2369
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:46,118
any random plant and it'll tell you

2370
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,639
exactly where it's all coming from

2371
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:50,439
no yeah no no it can't because you have

2372
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:53,520
to have something to compare it

2373
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:58,079
to if I don't have uh if I don't have a

2374
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:59,920
DNA a tree a frail it's just it just you

2375
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:01,679
get to sequence it but if there's

2376
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,319
nothing that you can compare it to from

2377
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,359
that place then you don't know that it

2378
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:06,920
came from that place until you go to

2379
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:08,920
that place and find something that you

2380
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:11,480
can Mark and say oh look this is

2381
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:14,480
indicative of Pakistan this is

2382
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:16,079
indicative to the Milana Valley in India

2383
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:17,439
it'll never give us that info but it

2384
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:18,439
doesn't have to that's not what it's

2385
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:23,359
really

2386
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:26,118
for it's it's to allow you to use a a a

2387
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:30,039
tool that helps really speed up

2388
01:33:26,118 --> 01:33:33,238
populations if you're trying to get to a

2389
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:35,800
a result speed is kind of

2390
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:37,799
important so without using genomics it's

2391
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,880
kind of like AI right so like what's a

2392
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,800
good example an AI group speaks to me

2393
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,920
and we're we've been talking about a

2394
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:48,719
project and so they they're not cannabis

2395
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,639
AI they're just big a AI which is what

2396
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,960
they provide is they provide the AI to

2397
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,000
Big A and so they reach out to me and

2398
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,920
say hey we want to talk to you about

2399
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,399
using AI in the development of

2400
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:03,840
cannabis and you know how do you and how

2401
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:07,319
do we speak to the the computer what's

2402
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:10,039
the questions we ask what do we do and

2403
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:11,679
so I started to doing my own research on

2404
01:34:10,039 --> 01:34:13,880
it so I could kind of better understand

2405
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:16,199
the tool but when I sat down with some

2406
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:19,600
of their lead breeders it was that an

2407
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:22,439
individual can look at maybe 2,000

2408
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:24,880
things using genomics you can look at

2409
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:27,158
900,000 things

2410
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:30,560
using AI on top of genomics you can look

2411
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:32,719
at 900 million different things so when

2412
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:36,039
you start when you start to get up into

2413
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:38,158
this idea that we can like explode this

2414
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:40,399
we can start to look for things that are

2415
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:41,879
patterns that we just can't look at and

2416
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:44,719
the computer says hey this is some

2417
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:47,760
interesting [ __ ] over here let's explore

2418
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:49,800
it and the computer allows you to choose

2419
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,000
plants you would have a million years

2420
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,760
chose and when you put them together

2421
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,679
what you get is unbelievably unique

2422
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:59,400
combinations that we just don't have the

2423
01:34:56,679 --> 01:35:00,560
ability to understand at this time and

2424
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:03,079
so to

2425
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,360
me that's why I've always been involved

2426
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:09,079
in all these different operations of

2427
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:10,479
this of this type is that I need to

2428
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:12,960
understand where I'm going to land I'm

2429
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:14,799
not worrying about where I am today I'm

2430
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,480
always worrying about where I'm G to end

2431
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,480
up and so what I know is that I have to

2432
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:21,759
look down the road and say okay if we're

2433
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:24,439
going to go and get heavy into something

2434
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:27,079
when does it coincide when that connect

2435
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:28,399
tie and intersect with someone who has

2436
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:31,118
better

2437
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:33,198
resources and with the genes it's

2438
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:36,039
critical to understand it because the

2439
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:38,118
minute you have schedule three you what

2440
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:41,238
you have in the United States now is the

2441
01:35:38,118 --> 01:35:43,279
ability for real companies to come in

2442
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:45,839
that can take Financial Risk because of

2443
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:48,960
this because of the the schedule one if

2444
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:51,560
a real company one that's Global was to

2445
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:53,679
put an operation in the US they could

2446
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,239
theoretically lose it to the Federal

2447
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:57,639
government because it's

2448
01:35:55,238 --> 01:36:00,118
illegal right so the state so there's a

2449
01:35:57,639 --> 01:36:02,000
state law and there's a defense and and

2450
01:36:00,118 --> 01:36:04,599
I had this conversation with with enough

2451
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,359
of these people to understand that

2452
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,039
they're at a level financially that they

2453
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:10,399
don't really care if they're in cannabis

2454
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:12,198
right now the day they get in cannabis

2455
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:14,479
is when it's right for them and the

2456
01:36:12,198 --> 01:36:17,000
minute they're here they will change it

2457
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:20,559
at a pace that'll be frightening because

2458
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,039
they can spend $2 million a day on R&amp;D

2459
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,320
only so what I know is that that

2460
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:30,158
combined with marketing combined with

2461
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:32,359
license combined with with what happens

2462
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,679
when you put enough money into Political

2463
01:36:32,359 --> 01:36:35,599
systems all of a sudden like where where

2464
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,880
do we

2465
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:42,440
exist and so the the existence is really

2466
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,359
as a small craft operator to me is to go

2467
01:36:42,439 --> 01:36:47,198
and

2468
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:50,880
find an ability to to to find a lane

2469
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:54,158
where this profile is attractive and you

2470
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,719
only sell 1,00 pounds of it you know

2471
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:58,238
that the world can accept 1100 pounds of

2472
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:01,039
your unique

2473
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:04,718
profile and you're able to stay within a

2474
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:06,479
very specific situation that plant and

2475
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,520
if and if the plant's lucrative enough

2476
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:11,000
you can be approached by a larger brand

2477
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:14,239
to say hey we want to produce another

2478
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,719
5,000 pounds of it under these

2479
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,319
constraints meaning we'll do it in

2480
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:19,319
living soil as well we'll we'll do it as

2481
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:21,639
how you

2482
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:24,399
say and to me that's like the cotton

2483
01:37:21,639 --> 01:37:26,359
candy grape so you got a grape in the US

2484
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,198
that's just it took me a year to find a

2485
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:30,079
batch of that [ __ ] I don't care where I

2486
01:37:28,198 --> 01:37:32,719
went it was sold out when I got there I

2487
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:34,920
finally caught it from a grape dealer

2488
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:37,158
who had a bunch of different grapes on a

2489
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,679
stand and I was able to experience it

2490
01:37:37,158 --> 01:37:42,238
firsthand because it's so hot they can't

2491
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:45,279
hold it in the store and it sells for

2492
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:47,559
twice the price and so the individual

2493
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:50,639
that bred it they produce it but they

2494
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:53,560
also licensed that grape to other

2495
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,159
individuals and and to me that's that's

2496
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,880
how this world will

2497
01:37:55,158 --> 01:38:00,638
work and we just have to understand that

2498
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:03,319
that when we get into the future it's

2499
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,960
it'll be like every other industry you

2500
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:06,840
won't have a choice it there's there's

2501
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,158
Samsonite Samsonite makes a lot more

2502
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,520
luggage than Louis

2503
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,319
Vuitton but Louie holds a really good

2504
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:15,599
place and but Louie was real Louie Louie

2505
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:17,519
sold you know luggage to the Zarina he

2506
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:20,520
he sold it to the the the elite he was

2507
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,880
an incredible s he did something unique

2508
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:25,960
it wasn't just hype and he launched a

2509
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:28,960
reputation that they maintained with

2510
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:31,480
meticulous quality so why can't why

2511
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:34,118
can't we copy those luxury brand models

2512
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:35,879
the same way and allow the larger

2513
01:38:34,118 --> 01:38:38,319
corporations to do what they do because

2514
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:40,199
you don't have any control of them you

2515
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:41,359
can't really tell them what they can and

2516
01:38:40,198 --> 01:38:44,158
can't

2517
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:46,000
do yeah hugely and and this is actually

2518
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,920
an idea I've been really trying to push

2519
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,399
for a number of years now because there

2520
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,239
are some people in the community who get

2521
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:54,799
quite upset when someone tries to

2522
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:56,399
produce a really high-end product and I

2523
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,320
try to point out at the same time that a

2524
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:00,479
lot of these people probably aspire to

2525
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:02,479
have a nice Mercedes or something like

2526
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,439
that and it's like why can't we have

2527
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:07,118
luxury items within our field why can't

2528
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:10,000
people be allowed to strive to produce a

2529
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:12,079
really high-end product Oh without

2530
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,479
without doubt what we have now is

2531
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:15,880
high-end branding and there's some and

2532
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:17,439
there's some Farms that produce some

2533
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,118
good herb there no no question there's

2534
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:24,000
some really good grass floating around

2535
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:26,359
the world it's just that the the cost of

2536
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,760
pushing the marketing the cost of

2537
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:30,158
getting all that hype how do you do it

2538
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,280
you have to give up a chunk of your

2539
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:34,559
company when you give up a chunk of your

2540
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:36,880
company now you're having to satisfy

2541
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:40,119
someone else's desires and needs so now

2542
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,039
you start to lose control and at the end

2543
01:39:40,118 --> 01:39:44,519
of the

2544
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:47,198
day it's it's it's a frightening thing

2545
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:49,480
for many people because they got into

2546
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:51,399
cannabis because they were in control it

2547
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:53,959
let you have control of your basic

2548
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:56,198
day-to-day function where you went to

2549
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:59,118
work it was under

2550
01:39:56,198 --> 01:40:00,839
your direction you made the choice I

2551
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:02,598
used I used to work around the clock I

2552
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:04,360
had operations all over the place right

2553
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:07,000
I was a nut so I mean I'm running

2554
01:40:04,359 --> 01:40:09,519
operations that that it made sense for

2555
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,439
me to go there at midnight it made sense

2556
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,840
for me to pull in the driveway at 6: in

2557
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:16,559
the morning every spot I created and

2558
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,960
built and lit up I would enter and exit

2559
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,039
that place at the appropriate times

2560
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:24,359
because I could because I didn't have a

2561
01:40:22,039 --> 01:40:25,760
normal life I was I'm a I'm a create

2562
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:28,719
dope grower right so I'm jumping from

2563
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:32,679
scene to scene lighting these things up

2564
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:35,118
and it allowed me to be me so like I had

2565
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:37,359
the when I wanted when I realized this

2566
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:39,759
world was going to change I had to take

2567
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:42,639
a job at a dispensary and mind you was

2568
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:46,119
running it but I hadn't had a job in

2569
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:48,000
like 25 years I had to go take a job so

2570
01:40:46,118 --> 01:40:51,359
that I could learn how to be normal

2571
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,760
again and show up on a schedule that

2572
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:57,479
wasn't the one that I lived on which was

2573
01:40:54,760 --> 01:41:00,679
247 so like there's a period of time it

2574
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:03,158
takes you to acclimate from what we used

2575
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:04,719
to do and how we did it but what you're

2576
01:41:03,158 --> 01:41:07,920
going to be currently

2577
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:10,399
doing and you got to practice before you

2578
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,199
get there or it's just a shock you don't

2579
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,279
just transition like this you know it's

2580
01:41:12,198 --> 01:41:17,399
like for me I'm white maybe I I go out

2581
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:18,960
in the sun I get a bad burn I have to

2582
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:21,238
condition myself and I work outside in

2583
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,599
the summer so if I'm not wearing a and

2584
01:41:21,238 --> 01:41:26,319
putting on some [ __ ] I'm looking like a

2585
01:41:23,599 --> 01:41:28,400
barbecue potato chip and I don't care

2586
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:30,158
how many years I've been doing this

2587
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:32,638
right so every season I have to

2588
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:35,799
acclimate slowly to the intensity of the

2589
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:37,800
Sun or I just get horrifically burned

2590
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:39,560
and to me that's the same process you

2591
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:42,239
have to go through to go from where we

2592
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:43,800
were who we are were to where we want to

2593
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:47,158
be and who we

2594
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:50,159
are you you have to give up the

2595
01:41:47,158 --> 01:41:51,559
control yeah hugely I can definitely um

2596
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:53,319
appreciate the point you're making about

2597
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,599
people who being so used to the autonomy

2598
01:41:53,319 --> 01:41:57,840
and having to just relax a little bit I

2599
01:41:55,599 --> 01:41:59,639
think being a good grower sort of makes

2600
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,039
you a bit of a control freak in certain

2601
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:03,719
regards but um in in your last answer

2602
01:42:02,039 --> 01:42:05,960
you know you're talking about defining

2603
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:08,079
your own path with unique and I wanted

2604
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,439
to ask you about a plant that I saw from

2605
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,359
your Instagram page that seemed

2606
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:14,118
incredibly unique I remember the post

2607
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:16,719
basically spoke about how you have a

2608
01:42:14,118 --> 01:42:20,960
skunk plant that is essentially the same

2609
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:22,239
skunk that Sam the skunk man had used to

2610
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,840
genetically map it or something

2611
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:26,519
somewhere do you know did I read that

2612
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,880
correctly I do I do it I got a now I

2613
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:31,239
didn't it it it it was from uh Salmon

2614
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:34,159
Creek so it was in the Salmon Creek area

2615
01:42:31,238 --> 01:42:35,799
since the early 80s and then I got it

2616
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:38,399
when Lawrence passed away so me and

2617
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:41,440
Lawrence Ringo were friends and when he

2618
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:43,638
passed away there was just uh anytime

2619
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:46,279
you lose the patriarch of a family

2620
01:42:43,639 --> 01:42:49,480
there's some chaos and some plants

2621
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:51,238
started uh dying off and so the person

2622
01:42:49,479 --> 01:42:54,000
that was the librarian said hey could

2623
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:56,638
you could you take this plant

2624
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,880
and and hang on to it and it was and I

2625
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,239
said what's the story on it they said

2626
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:02,039
it's an old skunk out from 1981 out of

2627
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:03,799
Salmon Creek which is a a huge

2628
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:05,880
production Watershed directly across

2629
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:09,679
from my Hill I'm in Miranda s Creeks

2630
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:13,319
across the river and so I said sure So I

2631
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:16,800
I have it DNA and it matches up with uh

2632
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:18,519
the one that Sam had entered right so

2633
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,840
for whatever reason it it ties in

2634
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:23,159
genetically but it was uh it was

2635
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:25,079
stunning in the sense that it was the

2636
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:26,839
old it wasn't the skunk that I was

2637
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:30,079
seeking which is what we're all seeking

2638
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:31,920
like that the urine skunk it was this

2639
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:34,719
musky

2640
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,520
floral rich but I mean to the level that

2641
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:40,079
when you cut some clones from it it

2642
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:42,599
would fill a building like you didn't

2643
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:44,599
have to flow the plant to release the

2644
01:43:42,599 --> 01:43:47,840
volatile sulfurs you could just cut the

2645
01:43:44,599 --> 01:43:50,119
plant as a plant and it literally filled

2646
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,599
the build and it was incredibly

2647
01:43:50,118 --> 01:43:57,198
incredibly volatile and pungent

2648
01:43:53,599 --> 01:43:58,840
and it it was fascinated because it it

2649
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:01,638
it started really making me want to go

2650
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:03,719
back to the the times prior when I had a

2651
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:06,760
lot of these type of plants and it kind

2652
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:08,800
of lit a spark to go on that skunk hunt

2653
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:11,360
and I I dove into that pool I I was

2654
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:14,239
ended up getting a an 88 cut out of

2655
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:16,118
Spain shipped in and so a company in

2656
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:18,839
Spain had held it since 88 and they had

2657
01:44:16,118 --> 01:44:20,839
used it as a foundation line and a lot

2658
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,560
of their work so I had these two cuts

2659
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:25,719
that were really pretty unique in their

2660
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:27,679
own regard but even when I went into

2661
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:30,359
them and I went into other populations I

2662
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:32,000
never pulled up what I found and and I

2663
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:34,639
know I know it I know it's there

2664
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,960
somewhere there's no there's no mystery

2665
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:39,079
or Miracle it's just a matter of when

2666
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,158
you you're G to see it with the ogs

2667
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:43,079
right now where right now everybody's

2668
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:46,238
starting to release gas seeds again and

2669
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:49,719
everybody's trying to buy gas seeds aici

2670
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:52,000
a just did a nice release so they did um

2671
01:44:49,719 --> 01:44:55,319
the Larry to the sky which they got from

2672
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:58,520
me back in 20 0 from the

2673
01:44:55,319 --> 01:45:00,238
hprc so those things that were just

2674
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:04,159
being sold normally are you can't find

2675
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:06,000
at all anymore and so he he he releases

2676
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:08,479
gas into the world

2677
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,880
again and it's because nobody kept the

2678
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:12,718
cut everybody went candy gas and if you

2679
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,159
give it 10 years I'd like to see how

2680
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:17,399
many gelato 41s are floating

2681
01:45:15,158 --> 01:45:20,479
around because it's same thing once it

2682
01:45:17,399 --> 01:45:23,039
gets out of Vogue you don't keep

2683
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:24,718
it yeah definitely that's an interesting

2684
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,158
point 10 years from now where will the

2685
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,760
gelato be I I like that a lot and you're

2686
01:45:27,158 --> 01:45:31,559
right it's very circular it's like

2687
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:33,440
fashion things come and go there's a

2688
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,480
quick followup that old skunk cutting

2689
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:37,479
the one that's the same as Sam's what's

2690
01:45:35,479 --> 01:45:39,399
the effect like and and do you think

2691
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:41,799
it's got one of those old world highs

2692
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:44,238
where it's it doesn't have a ceiling or

2693
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,560
what how would you describe it no it had

2694
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:49,879
a ceiling it was just really nice it was

2695
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:52,000
good feel weed most of the Dutch skunks

2696
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:54,159
you know the the only the only skunks

2697
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,800
that had like a really

2698
01:45:54,158 --> 01:45:59,559
brutal Grizzly effect with the super

2699
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:02,880
acrid ones and they were almost a little

2700
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:05,360
rough so for people who uh you know they

2701
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,239
didn't want that beating they didn't

2702
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:10,118
smoke it they went for the more lighter

2703
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:11,919
profiled ones but for for me you know I

2704
01:46:10,118 --> 01:46:14,158
I I didn't mind the fact that it made my

2705
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,760
eyes bloodshot and I didn't mind that it

2706
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:16,679
made my tongue feel like it was coated

2707
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:20,320
and that

2708
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:22,599
I I had a you know swamp breath I didn't

2709
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:24,519
mind that it just it took control of me

2710
01:46:22,599 --> 01:46:27,159
like wow like you're reeling under the

2711
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:30,599
weight of the high I enjoyed

2712
01:46:27,158 --> 01:46:34,359
that but you know many didn't and so

2713
01:46:30,599 --> 01:46:36,679
that that's the thing it uh the the one

2714
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:39,158
the 81 and the 88 the 88 was more like a

2715
01:46:36,679 --> 01:46:41,480
burnt rubber and that had a sharper

2716
01:46:39,158 --> 01:46:44,319
edged High I want to say almost reminds

2717
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:47,638
me more like of a Mexican effect but the

2718
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:50,880
the 81 was was more like a warm blanket

2719
01:46:47,639 --> 01:46:53,840
enveloping relaxing you know big thick

2720
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,639
full smoke but it would be it would be

2721
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,760
tough to sell that today you couldn't

2722
01:46:55,639 --> 01:47:01,039
sell that [ __ ] you you'd have to rename

2723
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:03,800
it completely and you'd have to rely on

2724
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:06,039
the odor because the numbers The Numbers

2725
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:08,960
Never lined up probably you know maybe

2726
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:11,238
16 maybe 16 I think the numbers came out

2727
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:13,920
at so you put that on a on a on a label

2728
01:47:11,238 --> 01:47:16,479
that shit's not going and it was you

2729
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:19,800
know really hairy and and and kind of

2730
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:23,039
fluffy red you know beautiful herb but

2731
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:25,079
not the not the the Nuggie hand grenade

2732
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,399
people want to see today and definitely

2733
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:29,399
wasn't

2734
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:31,479
purple so it's tough you know and and

2735
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:34,000
you put skunk one it's a everybody's got

2736
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:36,439
skunk well nobody wants it they they you

2737
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,079
need to say you know the piss skunk or

2738
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:43,238
or something that and then prove it so

2739
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:45,960
that's the issue with some of those is

2740
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:48,678
that they don't have a place except in

2741
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:50,679
your heart and they they they have a

2742
01:47:48,679 --> 01:47:54,079
place in terms of they let you mark

2743
01:47:50,679 --> 01:47:56,359
things in a a timeline so when you touch

2744
01:47:54,079 --> 01:47:58,238
that you get to see to me when I look at

2745
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:00,960
plants what I look at

2746
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:05,479
is the world that you're

2747
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:08,198
in shapes what's sold so your so your

2748
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:10,959
sociological conditions influence what

2749
01:48:08,198 --> 01:48:14,279
people consume and why they consume it

2750
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:16,439
the world around you shaping your desire

2751
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:19,039
and when I can look at 30 40 years where

2752
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:21,839
at the plants it lets me look at the

2753
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:24,800
populations that consumed it differently

2754
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:27,279
because the plants were

2755
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,079
unbelievably um valuable at that time

2756
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:31,198
they sold a tremendous amount of flower

2757
01:48:29,079 --> 01:48:34,039
that means many many many people enjoyed

2758
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:36,039
consuming it it lets me get a window

2759
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:37,479
into what the people of the world were

2760
01:48:36,039 --> 01:48:40,960
doing at that

2761
01:48:37,479 --> 01:48:44,279
time and so when you get into our era

2762
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:46,679
it'll be easy to say hey look at these

2763
01:48:44,279 --> 01:48:48,800
plants and look at how the focus went to

2764
01:48:46,679 --> 01:48:50,560
visual because what do we do we spend

2765
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,079
most of our time looking at visuals on

2766
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,080
phones what's the next one so once we

2767
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:58,118
get past this one what's the next

2768
01:48:55,079 --> 01:49:01,439
technical sociological Revolution that

2769
01:48:58,118 --> 01:49:04,559
occurs that absolutely impacts how we

2770
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:06,559
see a thing and that'll that that's like

2771
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,440
that's the question and that's the one I

2772
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:10,039
really can't answer because what's going

2773
01:49:08,439 --> 01:49:11,359
to be the Breakthrough that changes it

2774
01:49:10,039 --> 01:49:13,198
because we can't smell herb in the

2775
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:14,479
stores anymore you can't look at the

2776
01:49:13,198 --> 01:49:15,879
[ __ ] if you can look at it it means it's

2777
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:18,079
getting light degradation through the

2778
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:19,920
package so you're damage in the weed so

2779
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:23,519
you got to seal the weed so you can't

2780
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:25,840
see it you can't open it smell it so you

2781
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:28,320
have no idea what you're getting so how

2782
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:31,319
do you sell it you're selling it off of

2783
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:35,079
the bud tenders steering people into

2784
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:37,000
choices and the idea that somebody and

2785
01:49:35,079 --> 01:49:38,920
it's not a knock the bud tenders because

2786
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,719
I've met some brilliant ones it's just

2787
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,760
that for so many it's an introductory

2788
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,000
level

2789
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:47,039
job and they don't haven't they haven't

2790
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,279
had enough time to be able to really

2791
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,639
work with a population or many

2792
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:54,079
populations long enough to kind of see

2793
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:56,719
patterns and so it makes it it makes it

2794
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:58,000
kind of hard to get accurate assistance

2795
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:01,599
you know that was like that was the

2796
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,679
whole point of you know the ganier where

2797
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:07,159
to develop a Common Language common

2798
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:09,560
rating systems common terminology so

2799
01:50:07,158 --> 01:50:12,598
that when someone went into a store they

2800
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:14,320
could say the same thing in every store

2801
01:50:12,599 --> 01:50:16,000
and almost every person that worked at a

2802
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:18,039
store could say the same thing when you

2803
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,319
go to a butcher shop they don't call

2804
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:23,519
Hamburger Fame Monon they call it

2805
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:24,759
hamburger right so you don't have to go

2806
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,920
I need the meat that's that's run

2807
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:28,039
through the machine that they go

2808
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:30,840
hamburger everybody says the same thing

2809
01:50:28,039 --> 01:50:33,599
hamburger it allows you to go I need

2810
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:36,039
hamburger and it it makes it easy and

2811
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:38,360
that's our issue is that we're we're

2812
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:40,238
we're so confused in terminology that no

2813
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:42,039
one has an idea I think the statistics

2814
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:44,279
are something like 85% of the people

2815
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:46,399
that come out of a store couldn't tell

2816
01:50:44,279 --> 01:50:49,000
you the name of the brand when they get

2817
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:52,439
home wow they don't know the name of the

2818
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,158
brand 85% right 15% are going yeah so

2819
01:50:52,439 --> 01:50:56,158
what why does cookies work because you

2820
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:58,439
go into a cookie

2821
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:00,319
store but if you go into any and and

2822
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:02,678
cookie sells other products as well but

2823
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:05,118
you're getting a cookie collection of

2824
01:51:02,679 --> 01:51:08,440
products which then lets them monitor

2825
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:11,359
the velocity of those products and it

2826
01:51:08,439 --> 01:51:13,279
lets them know are the sales declining

2827
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:15,639
in a thing or increasing or staying the

2828
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:18,039
same and that lets us at the R&amp;D

2829
01:51:15,639 --> 01:51:19,880
facility know do we need to produce more

2830
01:51:18,039 --> 01:51:21,359
things do we need to create more things

2831
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:23,239
do we have enough things is this

2832
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,319
something that should be run for another

2833
01:51:23,238 --> 01:51:27,598
six months is this something that should

2834
01:51:25,319 --> 01:51:30,679
be retired because you're able to

2835
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:33,400
monitor the data and then you're able to

2836
01:51:30,679 --> 01:51:35,800
understand the consumers buying patterns

2837
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:38,719
but it's miserable for small operators

2838
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:40,920
because you're competing against bigger

2839
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:44,399
brands that can come in and

2840
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:47,078
and kind of overwhelm the the storefront

2841
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:49,879
so to speak with choices and selections

2842
01:51:47,078 --> 01:51:51,399
and so you know it's it it becomes a a

2843
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:52,920
huge amount of effort for the small

2844
01:51:51,399 --> 01:51:54,799
operator they have to basically Bally go

2845
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:57,440
to Every dispensary that sells their

2846
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:59,480
product and spend some time with the the

2847
01:51:57,439 --> 01:52:01,678
sales team in a perfect world they'd

2848
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:03,439
actually bring them out to the farm so

2849
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:06,118
they could see what products were being

2850
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:08,799
created and then understand why you

2851
01:52:06,118 --> 01:52:10,359
choose it and what you're doing so this

2852
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,599
way when the tender has someone come in

2853
01:52:10,359 --> 01:52:15,319
that says hey what I really like is um

2854
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:18,078
you know organic Sun grown herb just

2855
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:19,639
seems to Vibe with me better as a person

2856
01:52:18,078 --> 01:52:22,000
and I would like it to have a great

2857
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:24,078
flavor then the person says oh I got you

2858
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,039
I know some Organic sungrown Farms that

2859
01:52:24,078 --> 01:52:27,519
we sell from the store then they can

2860
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:29,000
quickly look and say okay there's a

2861
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:32,040
couple here that have some flavor

2862
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:34,880
profiles that say perp that say great

2863
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:37,078
that whole thing took us 15

2864
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:39,840
seconds but and that's what you need is

2865
01:52:37,078 --> 01:52:42,559
these quick quick transitions of

2866
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,159
customer to purchase to leave because no

2867
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,679
customer wants to spend three hours in

2868
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:49,118
the store trying to buy a bag of

2869
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:50,920
grass it's they just don't you know it's

2870
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:53,399
a social thing for some but let's say

2871
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:55,158
95% just want to go in buy when I go buy

2872
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:57,879
milk I don't want to spend three hours

2873
01:52:55,158 --> 01:52:59,920
getting a backstory on the cow that they

2874
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:01,800
squeeze the milk from I just want the

2875
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,480
damn

2876
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:06,679
milk yeah brilliant and you know it's

2877
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:08,598
it's so true right A lot of people are

2878
01:53:06,679 --> 01:53:11,039
really sort of going in with limited

2879
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:13,159
background knowledge and as you said 80%

2880
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:14,840
of the time that's a staggering

2881
01:53:13,158 --> 01:53:16,638
statistic I'm going to jump on you

2882
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:18,400
mentioned G definitely wanted to chat

2883
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:20,880
about that and I know that you're

2884
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:22,638
credited as the co-founder founder of

2885
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,560
that so the first thing to talk about

2886
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:27,679
what was the Genesis of it like how did

2887
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:31,320
this idea come about oh [ __ ] well

2888
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:34,158
originally the the Genesis was

2889
01:53:31,319 --> 01:53:37,639
I was in the kitchen at my house with my

2890
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:41,638
son my teenage son so my son's he's uh

2891
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:44,039
20 sh 20 28 be 29 but he was probably

2892
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:46,239
you know like 15 16 at the

2893
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:48,078
time and so we're hanging out and I'm

2894
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:49,198
talking to him and I'm like what do I

2895
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:51,479
call

2896
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,078
myself because I'd always been a dope

2897
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:56,839
grower but right but but I was running a

2898
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:59,078
nursery and I was doing storefront work

2899
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:01,599
and I was like I was doing so much

2900
01:53:59,078 --> 01:54:03,960
different stuff that I didn't really

2901
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:06,880
know my job title and we were laughing

2902
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,439
it was like it was like I'm like who am

2903
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,400
I like like when when someone says to

2904
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:13,960
you you have to answer it in a one word

2905
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:15,839
you know you know one sentence answer

2906
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:19,000
how do you give someone one sentence

2907
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:21,078
when you're doing 10 different jobs at

2908
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,439
scale like because I was hitting it at

2909
01:54:21,078 --> 01:54:25,920
that time and I was like who am I and my

2910
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:29,238
son looked at me and he goes Dad you're

2911
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:31,399
a gan you're a cannabis

2912
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:33,598
culturalist and I said whoa that's heavy

2913
01:54:31,399 --> 01:54:36,839
he said yeah he goes you do all things

2914
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,400
herb like that's your life and so it was

2915
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:41,360
just this killer name and I went back to

2916
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:43,198
my business with my team and said hey my

2917
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:45,759
son came up with a cool name we should

2918
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:47,919
do like a Blog and they said no let's

2919
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,760
create an entertainment company so we

2920
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,760
created a platform called the ganier

2921
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:54,320
when it was a website and it was the

2922
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:56,599
first place that a lot of different

2923
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:58,399
individuals got to write on because what

2924
01:54:56,599 --> 01:55:01,078
we did we got to

2925
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:03,799
seek people that I thought were were

2926
01:55:01,078 --> 01:55:06,039
competent in their respect of craft and

2927
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:09,760
allowed them a place to to

2928
01:55:06,039 --> 01:55:11,639
speak and it it was meant so that when

2929
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,840
individuals that were were looking in

2930
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:15,159
the world of cannabis for answers there

2931
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:17,319
was a place where the people that were

2932
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:18,479
on a platform actually should be

2933
01:55:17,319 --> 01:55:21,679
answering

2934
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,399
questions and then we turned it into the

2935
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:25,760
golden tarp Awards which was the

2936
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:27,879
Cannabis competition I created and then

2937
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,719
we used it for all our spring seed

2938
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:33,639
events so we used it as this this

2939
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:36,880
incredible entertainment education

2940
01:55:33,639 --> 01:55:38,279
platform locally that just killed it for

2941
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,359
what we did with it you know I mean we

2942
01:55:38,279 --> 01:55:43,118
were absolutely bringing bodies into the

2943
01:55:40,359 --> 01:55:44,799
seats at all these venues and the

2944
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:47,319
Cannabis Cup we created was the second

2945
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:49,480
largest in America to this day outside

2946
01:55:47,319 --> 01:55:50,960
of Tim Blake's Emerald cup so I mean we

2947
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:52,919
were bigger than any High Times cup we

2948
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:55,960
were bigger than any dope cup

2949
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:57,760
like we nailed it right out the gate and

2950
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:01,000
and it was because we were trying to

2951
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:04,039
really build an awareness of the

2952
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,198
future it it was I wasn't trying to pay

2953
01:56:04,039 --> 01:56:08,078
homage to the Past continuously I I've

2954
01:56:06,198 --> 01:56:09,799
been there I me I'm I'm living at real

2955
01:56:08,078 --> 01:56:11,359
time I'm like we need to focus on the

2956
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:14,239
future otherwise we're going to be

2957
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:15,759
living in the past and that's not where

2958
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:17,879
you really live you live in the past

2959
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:19,960
when you're 90 but you young and you're

2960
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:23,560
living in the past you have a problem

2961
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:25,960
and so we used it to drive a moment them

2962
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:27,960
and it was it was a really a successful

2963
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:30,279
situation but the world of cannabis cups

2964
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:32,158
came to a close just because it becomes

2965
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:34,319
such a a

2966
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:37,399
unbelievably

2967
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:39,399
financially burdensome type Vue like

2968
01:56:37,399 --> 01:56:41,719
most of these are basically you ride and

2969
01:56:39,399 --> 01:56:43,000
sponsors and so the world ended for that

2970
01:56:41,719 --> 01:56:45,039
and I just said it doesn't make any

2971
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,439
sense and I had been doing a bunch of

2972
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:48,920
education for green

2973
01:56:46,439 --> 01:56:51,118
flow and they approached me and said hey

2974
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,840
we'd like to buy the the name and the

2975
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:55,000
brand from you

2976
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:57,119
and then we had this idea about taking

2977
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,840
what you're doing and creating a

2978
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:02,319
certification and I had been asked to do

2979
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:04,880
one prior but I didn't think that I was

2980
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:06,439
smart enough to do one I didn't think

2981
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,039
that I didn't think anybody was I didn't

2982
01:57:06,439 --> 01:57:10,279
think any one person was bright enough

2983
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:13,519
to cover the world of weed it's like to

2984
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:15,118
me weed was so huge that just to say you

2985
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:18,679
think you had your hand around it meant

2986
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:20,078
you didn't and so I said to them same

2987
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:22,199
thing I don't think we can do it and

2988
01:57:20,078 --> 01:57:24,279
they said no no Kev we were we we

2989
01:57:22,198 --> 01:57:26,799
reached out and created a team and we

2990
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:29,238
want to let you see who the team is and

2991
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:32,039
I took a look at the team and it was

2992
01:57:29,238 --> 01:57:34,919
such a well-rounded group it was you

2993
01:57:32,039 --> 01:57:37,960
know 17 other people from every facet of

2994
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:41,399
the industry and to me that was enough

2995
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:43,359
people to have a pretty good perspective

2996
01:57:41,399 --> 01:57:46,439
on this industry and I said hey I can

2997
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:49,279
support that so I'm down let's let let

2998
01:57:46,439 --> 01:57:52,319
me let me um I'll become a a partner in

2999
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:56,840
green flower you guys can take the ganji

3000
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:58,639
a I'll come in and and help do whatever

3001
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:01,960
I can to steer and

3002
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:04,679
build this 100-year Vision you have

3003
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,039
which is standardizing language and

3004
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:09,520
creating an ability for the customer any

3005
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:11,519
customer consumer to have a full

3006
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:14,199
awareness and of understanding on how to

3007
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:17,159
look at a very complex Topic in a manner

3008
01:58:14,198 --> 01:58:19,519
that benefits them it wasn't meant for

3009
01:58:17,158 --> 01:58:21,638
the the the sale it was really at the

3010
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:23,520
end of the day how do people who were

3011
01:58:21,639 --> 01:58:25,679
coming into weed how do they get an

3012
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:28,520
education that allows them to actually

3013
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:30,440
maximize their value and their

3014
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:32,079
experience yeah definitely that's cool

3015
01:58:30,439 --> 01:58:33,839
to hear I didn't know that it it had

3016
01:58:32,078 --> 01:58:35,198
like such a long-standing organic

3017
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,039
development that's really awesome to

3018
01:58:35,198 --> 01:58:39,078
hear the way it progressed and I guess

3019
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:41,078
my first question is do you like you

3020
01:58:39,078 --> 01:58:43,880
know hope that one day it becomes the

3021
01:58:41,078 --> 01:58:45,799
Cannabis equivalent of like the W set

3022
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:47,000
wine and spirit qualification like

3023
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:49,480
something like that where it's maybe

3024
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,118
going to get people like certain jobs

3025
01:58:49,479 --> 01:58:54,519
might open up with that or what's sort

3026
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:57,359
of your long-term vision with it I do

3027
01:58:54,520 --> 01:59:00,719
it's doing that right now my long-term

3028
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:01,920
vision is the ability to be able to

3029
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:05,639
create an

3030
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:08,158
awareness of product quality there's two

3031
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:10,400
points on the data line you need to know

3032
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:14,238
what's the absolute best regardless of

3033
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:16,198
price and what's the best for the price

3034
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:18,158
and those two points give us the two

3035
01:59:16,198 --> 01:59:20,678
places we need to exist in the world of

3036
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:23,399
weed 90% of the people are going to want

3037
01:59:20,679 --> 01:59:25,039
what's best at a price 10 want want

3038
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:27,839
what's best at any

3039
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:29,439
price so how do we differentiate them it

3040
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:32,039
has to be through a grading

3041
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:34,000
system has to be and it has to be a

3042
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:36,039
defensible system it has to be one just

3043
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:39,279
like with wine you have to be able to

3044
01:59:36,039 --> 01:59:41,000
say hey I evaluated it and these are the

3045
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:42,599
things that I noticed and these are the

3046
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,158
things I liked and these are the things

3047
01:59:42,599 --> 01:59:46,800
I did not and you have to be able to

3048
01:59:45,158 --> 01:59:47,839
communicate it to somebody in a way that

3049
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:51,480
they can

3050
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:53,800
believe both producer and consumer and

3051
01:59:51,479 --> 01:59:56,319
so we we spent like I swear to God we

3052
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:59,679
spent something like 7,000 man hours

3053
01:59:56,319 --> 02:00:02,599
over two years developing that program

3054
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:04,960
oh the fights were unreal until you're

3055
02:00:02,599 --> 02:00:07,039
brawling it out with Frenchie and he's

3056
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,198
yelling at you in that accent you

3057
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:10,960
haven't had a good time because we're

3058
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:14,879
all fighting

3059
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:15,760
over not who's right but what's best

3060
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:18,118
what

3061
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:19,480
matters and it was the first time I

3062
02:00:18,118 --> 02:00:22,399
think I'd ever been involved in a

3063
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:25,158
cannabis Endeavor where the particip

3064
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:27,000
really for the absolute most part were

3065
02:00:25,158 --> 02:00:29,479
really trying to work together

3066
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,800
collaboratively to figure out what is a

3067
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:33,759
well-rounded education and then what is

3068
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,199
an

3069
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:40,880
assessment and what was nice was that

3070
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:42,598
Derek Gilman's desire was really he had

3071
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:46,560
an affinity for small

3072
02:00:42,599 --> 02:00:48,199
farms and so he wanted it to be able to

3073
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,840
really highlight the fact that these

3074
02:00:48,198 --> 02:00:53,279
small farms had products that were

3075
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:56,319
rating in the high 9s s but they had

3076
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:58,439
like you know low 30s on their marketing

3077
02:00:56,319 --> 02:01:00,960
the high 90 on the package should really

3078
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:02,919
help with the marketing and so Derek

3079
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:05,480
which was awesome because like you know

3080
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:07,520
I'm a I'm a small farmer but you need to

3081
02:01:05,479 --> 02:01:09,638
have the people that are like managing

3082
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:12,079
Partners also have that same vision or

3083
02:01:09,639 --> 02:01:13,800
it just isn't the same thing so having

3084
02:01:12,078 --> 02:01:15,759
Derek as the managing partner was

3085
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:18,920
excellent and Derek is a really really

3086
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:21,639
talented cultivator and he's a extremely

3087
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:23,920
knowledgeable person in the history of

3088
02:01:21,639 --> 02:01:26,239
can abis consumption all the devices and

3089
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,359
the gear and the details and the history

3090
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:31,039
like he's a [ __ ] true cannabis

3091
02:01:28,359 --> 02:01:33,479
officient a he's a

3092
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:35,479
ganier and so getting to work with him

3093
02:01:33,479 --> 02:01:38,559
as the managing partner was killer

3094
02:01:35,479 --> 02:01:42,078
because it it allowed there to be a

3095
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:45,440
genuine nature of we want to help the

3096
02:01:42,078 --> 02:01:47,000
small person out but it has to be fair

3097
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:49,759
because at the end of the day it can't

3098
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:52,479
favor them but typically when you create

3099
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:55,320
programs the small farmers actually

3100
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:58,759
excluded and in this case it was he was

3101
02:01:55,319 --> 02:02:01,880
the focus and the bigger farmer wasn't

3102
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:05,280
um excluded so it it it changed the

3103
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:06,840
focus on quality not scale and what it

3104
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:08,840
did is it allowed a lot of the people

3105
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:10,560
that came through what what I say is the

3106
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:12,360
impact of the ganier is there's over two

3107
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,480
billion dollars in cannabis sold around

3108
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:16,559
the world under ganier

3109
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:18,479
graduates so the people that have come

3110
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:21,159
through the program I mean name a big

3111
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:22,759
business their their lead buyers have

3112
02:02:21,158 --> 02:02:25,319
come through their teams have come

3113
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:27,199
through International Teams because at

3114
02:02:25,319 --> 02:02:30,439
the end of the day they started to

3115
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:34,198
really understand that they needed a

3116
02:02:30,439 --> 02:02:35,839
more in-depth education on what is the

3117
02:02:34,198 --> 02:02:38,439
quality of cannabis and they weren't

3118
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:41,039
getting it from inside their own

3119
02:02:38,439 --> 02:02:43,719
business they and and having it you know

3120
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:46,399
focused in Humble County allows us to be

3121
02:02:43,719 --> 02:02:49,000
able to Showcase many small farms many

3122
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:51,920
craft operators and it allows people to

3123
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,840
be able to see different levels of

3124
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:57,520
production and the quality that results

3125
02:02:53,840 --> 02:03:00,560
from it and the byproduct of that is it

3126
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:02,679
started to create the desire for some of

3127
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,599
these larger companies to create better

3128
02:03:02,679 --> 02:03:07,078
relationships with the small farmers

3129
02:03:04,599 --> 02:03:08,679
around them because they started to

3130
02:03:07,078 --> 02:03:12,198
understand that when you're constrained

3131
02:03:08,679 --> 02:03:15,520
by investment on a brand the only way

3132
02:03:12,198 --> 02:03:18,479
you can bring in new product outside of

3133
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:21,320
your line that fits your 62 day cycle

3134
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:24,039
you're mandated to follow is to do it in

3135
02:03:21,319 --> 02:03:25,719
collaborate with the small farmer so

3136
02:03:24,039 --> 02:03:27,960
what you do is you get to work on these

3137
02:03:25,719 --> 02:03:30,639
projects and every project that was set

3138
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:32,639
up worked everything that we helped them

3139
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:35,118
understand function for the business and

3140
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:38,840
the farmer the farmer got paid the

3141
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:40,960
business got paid so once you start

3142
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:42,440
getting people to make money they'll

3143
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,960
listen to you I mean that's just the

3144
02:03:42,439 --> 02:03:46,198
truth like you don't have to like me but

3145
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:47,960
if I steered you into a wealth you'll

3146
02:03:46,198 --> 02:03:50,638
you'll listen to me pretty much when

3147
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:52,719
when when the phone rings and and that's

3148
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:56,679
what we try to do here was we tried to

3149
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:58,880
help the the people that came through

3150
02:03:56,679 --> 02:04:01,118
understand that this is the world of

3151
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:03,199
cannabis today and because you have so

3152
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:05,759
many diverse people that you can you can

3153
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:07,759
function with within in the ganier it

3154
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:11,159
should help you really be able to refine

3155
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:13,679
your direction so so many people are you

3156
02:04:11,158 --> 02:04:14,960
know I noticed burned out in their jobs

3157
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:17,559
and they they have you know they're

3158
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:20,039
brilliant and successful but they really

3159
02:04:17,559 --> 02:04:21,920
don't feel positive about their

3160
02:04:20,039 --> 02:04:24,559
day-to-day job and they want to get into

3161
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:27,000
cannabis the ganier helps them get an

3162
02:04:24,559 --> 02:04:30,960
education and then it also lets them get

3163
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:33,359
part of a of a a group and start to

3164
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:35,078
understand better where do I fit in how

3165
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:37,158
do I make the best

3166
02:04:35,078 --> 02:04:39,399
choices I mean it's

3167
02:04:37,158 --> 02:04:41,799
just I think it's the best part of the

3168
02:04:39,399 --> 02:04:44,598
ganier is the community I didn't expect

3169
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:46,199
it to be so kind and supportive you know

3170
02:04:44,599 --> 02:04:47,239
I figured that we put this program

3171
02:04:46,198 --> 02:04:49,158
together we're going to get some cool

3172
02:04:47,238 --> 02:04:51,718
people coming through and the end result

3173
02:04:49,158 --> 02:04:54,399
will be really positive I just didn't

3174
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:57,239
expect to see how many people wanted to

3175
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:59,679
come in and actually maintain the

3176
02:04:57,238 --> 02:05:01,799
relationships between the students the

3177
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:05,599
support groups the help groups the study

3178
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:07,119
groups the networking the affiliations

3179
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:09,480
it it was incredible there was a woman

3180
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:12,759
named Elizabeth Sage who put together a

3181
02:05:09,479 --> 02:05:15,359
student group that in in life in if if

3182
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,880
one could have a student like Liz Sage

3183
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:19,880
come through your world you'd be

3184
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:22,279
grateful because they're masters of

3185
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:23,559
connection and coordination and they

3186
02:05:22,279 --> 02:05:25,238
come through and they become very

3187
02:05:23,559 --> 02:05:28,159
impressed with the program and they say

3188
02:05:25,238 --> 02:05:30,558
hey I feel so good about it I want to

3189
02:05:28,158 --> 02:05:32,078
bring my talent into it and the next

3190
02:05:30,559 --> 02:05:34,760
thing you know you're having rivers of

3191
02:05:32,078 --> 02:05:38,719
people getting together to work together

3192
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:41,000
practice refine and develop so that then

3193
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:42,800
that's it's it's really a beautiful

3194
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,960
program for me as an

3195
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,559
instructor it's um it's humbling to be

3196
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:49,760
able to be in the presence of so many

3197
02:05:47,559 --> 02:05:52,480
beautiful people I mean I not some corny

3198
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:54,880
[ __ ] but it's real I just never

3199
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:56,959
I never get tired of the students you

3200
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,520
know it's it's a gift to be able to have

3201
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:00,960
them come through Humble County and it's

3202
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:03,880
a incredible experience because so many

3203
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,118
of them are so incredibly intelligent so

3204
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:06,920
when you're getting people that are

3205
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:09,479
brilliant in their respective worlds and

3206
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:13,840
they're coming in if your game's not on

3207
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:17,479
point it won't work so it it forces us

3208
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:20,078
as the instructors to stay on top of

3209
02:06:17,479 --> 02:06:21,718
what's taking place and to always make

3210
02:06:20,078 --> 02:06:24,078
sure that we're refining what we're

3211
02:06:21,719 --> 02:06:26,719
doing and developing along with the

3212
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:29,799
program and acknowledging that you know

3213
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:31,239
we're only us so that way what people

3214
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:33,559
understand is that there really is no

3215
02:06:31,238 --> 02:06:35,399
top to this ladder it's it's a new

3216
02:06:33,559 --> 02:06:38,320
industry we haven't even scratched the

3217
02:06:35,399 --> 02:06:42,158
surface none of us know where it's G to

3218
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:44,118
go and because of that that humility

3219
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:48,158
allows people to be able to approach it

3220
02:06:44,118 --> 02:06:50,319
from a much much more like say gentle

3221
02:06:48,158 --> 02:06:51,759
perspective what a beautiful sentiment I

3222
02:06:50,319 --> 02:06:53,840
love it that's awesome that you feel

3223
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,599
such a deep connection to it all and

3224
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,078
great to hear some of the the inner

3225
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:59,719
workings behind how it all goes down I

3226
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:01,238
wanted to ask you this is like a sort of

3227
02:06:59,719 --> 02:07:02,880
a personal curiosity but I think your

3228
02:07:01,238 --> 02:07:05,439
experience with the program will help

3229
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,800
you I found that I was personally able

3230
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:09,839
to get really deeply passionate about

3231
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:12,599
cannabis when I started to develop a bit

3232
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:15,078
of a palette and then as Times Gone by

3233
02:07:12,599 --> 02:07:17,279
I've started to wonder sometimes I feel

3234
02:07:15,078 --> 02:07:19,158
like I'm not sure whether you develop a

3235
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:21,000
palette over time or whether some people

3236
02:07:19,158 --> 02:07:23,000
are just inclined to sort of have it and

3237
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,800
others it may never really come in to

3238
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,279
the same degree as certain other people

3239
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,960
what's your experience do you feel that

3240
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:30,960
you can get better at picking up on the

3241
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:33,880
Nuance of things over time or is it sort

3242
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:36,158
of a a bit more random and Universal so

3243
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:39,239
to speak I think it's a little bit of

3244
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:42,799
both I think you have to have the the

3245
02:07:39,238 --> 02:07:44,959
Ola Factory senses some people like my

3246
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:47,239
father for example has no sense of

3247
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:48,319
smell so my dad you know you could smoke

3248
02:07:47,238 --> 02:07:49,158
weed in the house my father wouldn't

3249
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:52,599
know because he couldn't smell you could

3250
02:07:49,158 --> 02:07:55,279
see the smoke but he couldn't smell and

3251
02:07:52,599 --> 02:07:57,520
so people like that will they'll never

3252
02:07:55,279 --> 02:08:00,000
be able to do that and then it also

3253
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:02,000
impacted his taste so food didn't have

3254
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,158
the same flavor a lot of things just

3255
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,920
were very

3256
02:08:03,158 --> 02:08:09,558
Bland so someone like that well you're

3257
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:12,078
kind of stuck but with most it's about

3258
02:08:09,559 --> 02:08:14,480
exposure and so what I did is I really

3259
02:08:12,078 --> 02:08:17,238
took a look at people who use their

3260
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:19,759
olfactory abilities to a high level and

3261
02:08:17,238 --> 02:08:21,598
we would say people from perfume people

3262
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,039
from wine

3263
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:26,319
the people who were best at it the ones

3264
02:08:24,039 --> 02:08:27,840
that they really consider like prodigies

3265
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:29,279
all of them have one thing in common

3266
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:31,480
they all came from an area where there

3267
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:33,679
was an incredible amount of diversity of

3268
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:35,439
scent so they weren't from Urban

3269
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:37,760
environments they were from the

3270
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:40,238
country and they were able to pick up

3271
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:43,840
all the nuances that impact the thing

3272
02:08:40,238 --> 02:08:46,158
that they're judging and so what what

3273
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:49,920
you do is you start to teach yourself

3274
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:52,078
how to identify odor and the a good way

3275
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:55,639
to highlight this is that when gas was

3276
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:58,319
red hot there was a fuel Depot near my

3277
02:08:55,639 --> 02:09:01,279
shop and my friend was the manager of it

3278
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:03,519
and so I would go over there after work

3279
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:05,479
and I could go and sniff all the

3280
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:07,079
different types of petroleum products

3281
02:09:05,479 --> 02:09:08,678
gear oil

3282
02:09:07,078 --> 02:09:13,719
kerosene

3283
02:09:08,679 --> 02:09:16,158
diesel um uh gasoline cut with uh with

3284
02:09:13,719 --> 02:09:19,559
alcohol race

3285
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:22,879
fuel you know jp5 if they had jet fuel

3286
02:09:19,559 --> 02:09:25,440
barrels coming in so what it did is it

3287
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:28,719
it let me develop this incredible

3288
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:30,879
knowledge of petroleum odor so that when

3289
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:33,239
I was looking at plants I would be able

3290
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,520
to say okay it's gas but what kind of

3291
02:09:33,238 --> 02:09:38,359
gas and I started to

3292
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:40,360
notice certain preferences in the public

3293
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:42,799
for certain types of gas in certain

3294
02:09:40,359 --> 02:09:44,558
places and so you start to see these

3295
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,159
patterns of consumption and what people

3296
02:09:44,559 --> 02:09:49,800
choose and what they like but by me

3297
02:09:47,158 --> 02:09:51,839
spending time at the Fuel Depot sniffing

3298
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:54,239
fuel I was able to

3299
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:58,400
understand it and then I needed to get a

3300
02:09:54,238 --> 02:10:02,678
development in fruit and floral so I go

3301
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:05,759
into um fruit stands and I go into spice

3302
02:10:02,679 --> 02:10:08,520
shops and I just go through and spend an

3303
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:10,840
hour just smelling and looking at the

3304
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:12,920
product and sniffing it and just trying

3305
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:16,599
to start to understand the differences

3306
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:18,920
between some of them and you know what

3307
02:10:16,599 --> 02:10:20,840
are they so that I have an ability to

3308
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:22,920
recognize it and at least say hey this

3309
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:24,319
this has an order of cardamon this is

3310
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,399
more like

3311
02:10:24,319 --> 02:10:28,920
Cedar so that when someone smells it you

3312
02:10:27,399 --> 02:10:31,158
can you can say to them what what do you

3313
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,880
like and they say I like I like Woody

3314
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:35,238
things and you're like Woody like oak or

3315
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:37,559
Woody like Cedar oh I like Cedar better

3316
02:10:35,238 --> 02:10:40,399
than oak and now what we're doing is

3317
02:10:37,559 --> 02:10:43,880
we're steering people into their desires

3318
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:46,638
by using readily available terms that we

3319
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:48,319
can both agree on and so the only way

3320
02:10:46,639 --> 02:10:50,840
that you can really develop this is

3321
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:52,880
through practice and then what you what

3322
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:56,480
you start to be able to pick up is the

3323
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:59,000
tawa and the the tawa is different than

3324
02:10:56,479 --> 02:11:00,919
the French because theirs is so much or

3325
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,279
Italians in in grape form because the

3326
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:06,279
grape was developed there but for us in

3327
02:11:03,279 --> 02:11:08,880
Humble County our air quality and our

3328
02:11:06,279 --> 02:11:10,198
water quality and the microbiome that's

3329
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:13,199
floating

3330
02:11:10,198 --> 02:11:15,919
around the plant itself because of the

3331
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:18,319
forest impacts a flavor that when people

3332
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,719
come from out of the area and they're

3333
02:11:18,319 --> 02:11:23,759
evaluating we've just noticed over

3334
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:26,639
thousand people the flavor of Humbolt is

3335
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:29,039
what comes out all the time like I know

3336
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:31,559
this plant but this flavor is different

3337
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:34,198
and when they describe it we realize wow

3338
02:11:31,559 --> 02:11:37,880
that's the flavor of humble it's the

3339
02:11:34,198 --> 02:11:39,519
impact of the air the the biology and

3340
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:41,880
the water

3341
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:44,440
shaping and so for the ability for them

3342
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:46,199
to come and see that allows them to

3343
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:48,598
understand that they can also have

3344
02:11:46,198 --> 02:11:50,960
Regional impact in in their locations

3345
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:53,639
and if we were in Pakistan Afghanistan

3346
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:56,198
IND IND we'd be able to say hey we have

3347
02:11:53,639 --> 02:11:59,000
true tewa because the plant was here

3348
02:11:56,198 --> 02:12:01,000
before we were when we showed up 1500

3349
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,920
years ago in the valley the plants were

3350
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,880
already here and so now that plant

3351
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:07,639
expresses itself fully in that

3352
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:10,559
environment because that's the natural

3353
02:12:07,639 --> 02:12:12,840
relationship that occurred that allow

3354
02:12:10,559 --> 02:12:16,520
Nows you that that now allows you to be

3355
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:18,319
able to take that and and Market it

3356
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:21,440
correctly so that people say oh I got

3357
02:12:18,319 --> 02:12:24,118
you I really liked it but the only place

3358
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:26,039
I can get that is there and then the

3359
02:12:24,118 --> 02:12:28,839
ability for you to say these are the

3360
02:12:26,039 --> 02:12:31,760
flavors that you should find these are

3361
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:34,639
the oders that we noticed and then the

3362
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:36,159
high you describe how it affects you but

3363
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:38,639
that's one that's

3364
02:12:36,158 --> 02:12:41,078
pretty I say we're not snowflakes but we

3365
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:43,559
would say that everyone has their own

3366
02:12:41,078 --> 02:12:46,359
Edge on how things affect but we can at

3367
02:12:43,559 --> 02:12:48,880
least talk about the delivery and how it

3368
02:12:46,359 --> 02:12:52,920
affected you and then then the drop off

3369
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:55,239
afterwards but being able to to do that

3370
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:57,118
is just it's it's an incredible feeling

3371
02:12:55,238 --> 02:12:58,519
and so it gets it's kind of fun to play

3372
02:12:57,118 --> 02:13:00,960
it's fun to go to your friend's house

3373
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:03,239
and smell the spice straw it's cool to

3374
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:05,279
go to a I I like to look at you know

3375
02:13:03,238 --> 02:13:06,759
solvents I go to like earthy related

3376
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:08,118
stuff where I want to go smell different

3377
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:10,599
types of Leather So you go to the

3378
02:13:08,118 --> 02:13:12,039
leather shop then you go and you go

3379
02:13:10,599 --> 02:13:14,119
through the backyard and you look for

3380
02:13:12,039 --> 02:13:17,158
all the decaying wood you move the

3381
02:13:14,118 --> 02:13:19,558
leaves and you smell the mycelium you go

3382
02:13:17,158 --> 02:13:21,279
into tobacco and you start to you start

3383
02:13:19,559 --> 02:13:22,800
to get an idea of different aging of

3384
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:24,759
tobacco kind of like tea the

3385
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:27,279
fermentation of it changes the scent

3386
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:29,520
profile all those things impact what we

3387
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:31,198
do and I think those are the things that

3388
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,599
they're the most fun with cannabis

3389
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:33,479
because you can do them with people that

3390
02:13:32,599 --> 02:13:36,599
don't

3391
02:13:33,479 --> 02:13:38,919
smoke yeah hugely hugely the most fun

3392
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:40,719
and you know as you just ran through you

3393
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:42,319
know the Myriad of different smells

3394
02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:44,920
there I just had so many memories come

3395
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:46,840
to mind and you you get taken back with

3396
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:48,920
certain smells it's a cool thing right

3397
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:51,520
and while we're on the topic of uh

3398
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:53,719
smells and flavors one of our listeners

3399
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:56,280
wanted to ask specifically can you give

3400
02:13:53,719 --> 02:13:57,760
us a bit of your breakdown on your

3401
02:13:56,279 --> 02:14:00,559
different flavors you know they'd heard

3402
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:02,679
that you've got your fuel fruit floral

3403
02:14:00,559 --> 02:14:04,880
Earth sort of system can you yeah

3404
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:08,000
totally can you give us some more info

3405
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:12,239
yeah the what I noticed was I had just

3406
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:14,679
noticed a pattern that when I was

3407
02:14:12,238 --> 02:14:18,558
quantifying plants in libraries like

3408
02:14:14,679 --> 02:14:21,239
where do you place them I said you know

3409
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:22,360
I can basically put any plant I find in

3410
02:14:21,238 --> 02:14:24,839
one of four

3411
02:14:22,359 --> 02:14:27,479
categories and it was Earth fruit Fuel

3412
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,599
and floral and fuel at the time was

3413
02:14:27,479 --> 02:14:31,638
chemical because chemical solvent and

3414
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:33,480
fuel go together to me but I used to

3415
02:14:31,639 --> 02:14:34,279
call it chemical until gas really came

3416
02:14:33,479 --> 02:14:37,638
on

3417
02:14:34,279 --> 02:14:40,000
heavy and it worked it let me have like

3418
02:14:37,639 --> 02:14:42,319
very different profiles in my libraries

3419
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,238
and it it allowed me to build nurseries

3420
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:48,118
for people that gave them diversity and

3421
02:14:45,238 --> 02:14:49,759
I started to notice um who consumed

3422
02:14:48,118 --> 02:14:51,759
those profiles so I started to see

3423
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,000
patterns of consumption based off of

3424
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:55,520
those odor

3425
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:58,319
profiles and as the years go by it's a

3426
02:14:55,520 --> 02:15:00,079
tool that I use frequently and we get

3427
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:03,000
into the golden tarp era and when I

3428
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:06,078
create the golden tarp judging I said

3429
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:09,238
hey let's use a lab to do our analytics

3430
02:15:06,078 --> 02:15:10,279
so that we connect down the cup to 16

3431
02:15:09,238 --> 02:15:14,158
instead of

3432
02:15:10,279 --> 02:15:17,000
250 but if we don't put it in categories

3433
02:15:14,158 --> 02:15:19,198
it'll be in numbers cup so let me use

3434
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,439
the categories and what that'll do is

3435
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:23,558
that'll let us have the the four best of

3436
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:25,839
each category go against each other and

3437
02:15:23,559 --> 02:15:29,320
each one of those categories will be

3438
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:30,840
combined metabolites and cannabinoids

3439
02:15:29,319 --> 02:15:34,599
and so what it did is it allowed us to

3440
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:37,679
have 32% THC fuels going head-to-head

3441
02:15:34,599 --> 02:15:40,679
with 11%

3442
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:44,359
Earths so it it allowed me to get a

3443
02:15:40,679 --> 02:15:46,480
really good Diversified numbers Cup in a

3444
02:15:44,359 --> 02:15:48,359
way that the cultivators could

3445
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:50,399
understand and that's what allowed that

3446
02:15:48,359 --> 02:15:52,598
cup to be so successful because I create

3447
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:54,000
the judging criteria before I actually

3448
02:15:52,599 --> 02:15:57,199
start the

3449
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:00,078
cup and it was accepted and but what it

3450
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:01,719
did was it gave me this massive data set

3451
02:16:00,078 --> 02:16:05,479
and so in the like the fourth year of

3452
02:16:01,719 --> 02:16:08,399
the cup I have a scientist from UCLA

3453
02:16:05,479 --> 02:16:09,638
come and speak to me and and there's

3454
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:12,158
there's some other work I'm doing

3455
02:16:09,639 --> 02:16:13,559
simultaneously so like we'll say that in

3456
02:16:12,158 --> 02:16:15,078
the fourth year of the cup I have a

3457
02:16:13,559 --> 02:16:17,719
scientist come and speak to me about my

3458
02:16:15,078 --> 02:16:22,639
data sets what was happening in the

3459
02:16:17,719 --> 02:16:25,198
interim was DNA hadn't come out yet and

3460
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:26,599
so you didn't really have when I first

3461
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:29,558
came up with this you didn't have an

3462
02:16:26,599 --> 02:16:31,840
ability to map from DNA and so what I

3463
02:16:29,559 --> 02:16:34,639
did is I said can I map by secondary

3464
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:37,359
metabolite profile can I map by the

3465
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:39,438
volatile profile so I went and hired

3466
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:40,599
some scientists some PhD scientists from

3467
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:42,960
the local

3468
02:16:40,599 --> 02:16:45,398
University and we went on a project to

3469
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:48,478
figure out could we map cannabis by its

3470
02:16:45,398 --> 02:16:50,239
secondary metabolite profile and after

3471
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:51,799
diving down that rabbit hole and

3472
02:16:50,239 --> 02:16:54,799
spending the money as the person funding

3473
02:16:51,799 --> 02:16:57,920
the project I realized that we couldn't

3474
02:16:54,799 --> 02:17:00,638
because they were too variable and that

3475
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:03,159
Tans were only a very small portion of

3476
02:17:00,638 --> 02:17:05,438
how we perceived the total and it was

3477
02:17:03,159 --> 02:17:09,079
these thol and these Esters and these

3478
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:11,359
volatile sulfurs and ketones and all

3479
02:17:09,079 --> 02:17:15,280
these other components and so I said

3480
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:17,519
okay and the scientist said your your

3481
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:20,280
your the way you're doing it right now

3482
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:22,398
works perfectly it's just perception by

3483
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:24,639
odor in the four categories so I already

3484
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:27,398
had scientists from the University I'm

3485
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:30,478
working with trying to map we failed in

3486
02:17:27,398 --> 02:17:32,718
the mapping but it substantiated better

3487
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:36,119
why my system worked so I felt

3488
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:38,000
comfortable with it as a tool but when

3489
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:39,880
when a scientist named John Abrams

3490
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,879
approached me he was a he still is he's

3491
02:17:39,879 --> 02:17:43,598
a brilliant scientist and at the time he

3492
02:17:41,879 --> 02:17:44,839
was involved with UCLA University of

3493
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:47,000
California Los

3494
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:49,000
Angeles and so he approaches me and he

3495
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,840
says hey um I'd love to look at the data

3496
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,959
on your work I'd like to you know take

3497
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:54,920
take a look at your

3498
02:17:51,959 --> 02:17:56,879
hypothesis and I said sure and I didn't

3499
02:17:54,920 --> 02:18:00,960
know that he was working on his own

3500
02:17:56,879 --> 02:18:04,079
scent categorization as well and so he

3501
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:06,518
was coming to look at mine and he was

3502
02:18:04,079 --> 02:18:08,638
challenging mine because I'm not a

3503
02:18:06,519 --> 02:18:10,239
scientist and so I come up with this at

3504
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:12,438
the time it was revolutionary no one

3505
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:15,119
have no no one broke can't still hav it

3506
02:18:12,439 --> 02:18:16,599
nobody's broke it down to this degree

3507
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:18,160
and so I said well check it out I said I

3508
02:18:16,599 --> 02:18:20,920
feel pretty comfortable with it as a

3509
02:18:18,159 --> 02:18:22,638
tool but I don't have any real proof

3510
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:24,920
that everything fits into this because

3511
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:27,518
we really don't have the tools but I'll

3512
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:29,679
give you all the data from four years of

3513
02:18:27,519 --> 02:18:31,079
competitions and you can take it and

3514
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:33,840
then you can take a look at it back at

3515
02:18:31,079 --> 02:18:35,398
the University with your team and so

3516
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:38,359
then he drives down and meets me at an

3517
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:39,879
event in Carpenteria that I'm working on

3518
02:18:38,359 --> 02:18:41,159
and he says Kev he goes you got to see

3519
02:18:39,879 --> 02:18:43,000
this I he drove all the way to

3520
02:18:41,159 --> 02:18:44,879
Carpenteria to talk to me and he

3521
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,599
unrolled the documents and he's like

3522
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:50,239
look at this he said we've been working

3523
02:18:47,599 --> 02:18:51,799
on this for years and we couldn't figure

3524
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:54,398
this out

3525
02:18:51,799 --> 02:18:55,879
and what they didn't understand was they

3526
02:18:54,398 --> 02:18:58,239
they were able to say that they can

3527
02:18:55,879 --> 02:19:00,718
clearly see a floral cluster they could

3528
02:18:58,239 --> 02:19:03,199
clearly see a fuel cluster they could

3529
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:05,318
see clearly see a fruit cluster but

3530
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:07,120
Earth to them was degraded cannabis

3531
02:19:05,318 --> 02:19:09,920
because the numbers were low and the

3532
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:11,639
measurable metabolites were low and what

3533
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,719
they didn't understand because they

3534
02:19:11,638 --> 02:19:15,920
weren't

3535
02:19:12,718 --> 02:19:19,079
Growers was that those plants produce

3536
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:20,519
less metabolites that we measure not in

3537
02:19:19,079 --> 02:19:22,760
total because we're not measuring the

3538
02:19:20,519 --> 02:19:26,239
toal total package but immeasurable

3539
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:29,200
under under the current level of lab

3540
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:31,439
analysis but the plants produce those

3541
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,960
because they don't need to produce

3542
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:35,840
anymore the metabolites are produced as

3543
02:19:33,959 --> 02:19:38,959
a stress response they're produced

3544
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:40,439
either tractor repel so the idea that

3545
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:42,518
something like Gorilla Glue which we

3546
02:19:40,439 --> 02:19:45,639
would call earthy or Bubba Kush as

3547
02:19:42,519 --> 02:19:47,478
faulty is completely wrong it's just

3548
02:19:45,638 --> 02:19:49,759
that they couldn't mentally wrap their

3549
02:19:47,478 --> 02:19:52,879
heads around it and I was able to say

3550
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:56,280
hey this is you have to see it because

3551
02:19:52,879 --> 02:19:58,239
what I had really discovered was that if

3552
02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:00,600
we look at the earth the earth the

3553
02:19:58,239 --> 02:20:03,879
latitude is dictating these

3554
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:07,680
profiles and so zero to 25 you're really

3555
02:20:03,879 --> 02:20:10,318
into the floral fruits and 25 to 40 you

3556
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:13,600
start going into Earth's and

3557
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:16,519
gases and gas is a primary Earth's a

3558
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:19,439
subset floral is a primary fruits a

3559
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:22,520
subset and what it's based off of is

3560
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:24,760
location on the latit ude that said

3561
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:27,680
these plants can only exist here if they

3562
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:31,520
have these profiles due to due to

3563
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:34,680
necessity and then people steered the

3564
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:37,040
outcome by selection so I started to be

3565
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:40,079
able to say look if we look at floral

3566
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:42,160
profiles we should be able to say that

3567
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:44,680
people who want uplifting cannabis will

3568
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:46,680
buy that mostly when I started doing the

3569
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:51,079
data analysis what was the number one

3570
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:52,720
seller in any Tech area floral varieties

3571
02:20:51,079 --> 02:20:56,439
and so you start to be able to quickly

3572
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:58,840
say okay people on the equator to 25 had

3573
02:20:56,439 --> 02:21:01,239
abundant food abundant water plenty of

3574
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:03,520
plenty of uh living conditions where

3575
02:21:01,239 --> 02:21:06,359
does all the the the the

3576
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:08,520
thought-provoking drugs come from there

3577
02:21:06,359 --> 02:21:10,960
because they're not worrying about

3578
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:14,840
trying to survive a brutal winter where

3579
02:21:10,959 --> 02:21:17,279
do the narcotics come from 25 to 40 and

3580
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:20,079
why is that for those individuals

3581
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:22,439
because they're having to deal with very

3582
02:21:20,079 --> 02:21:24,039
hard life less water less food high

3583
02:21:22,439 --> 02:21:27,000
mountain deserts you know 10 inches of

3584
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:29,000
rain freezing cold so you need to be

3585
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,478
able to be

3586
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:34,478
narcotic theed dat through the cold

3587
02:21:31,478 --> 02:21:37,799
winter and the very thing you do is

3588
02:21:34,478 --> 02:21:40,760
difficult and so the region latitude

3589
02:21:37,799 --> 02:21:42,719
dictates the profiles the people steer

3590
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:44,398
the populations to fit what they need

3591
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:47,639
and so what it does it allows us to be

3592
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:49,799
able to say where the gas profile sell

3593
02:21:47,639 --> 02:21:53,478
most people who want to get most high

3594
02:21:49,799 --> 02:21:56,039
where else pain what about fruit lighter

3595
02:21:53,478 --> 02:21:58,719
brighter High newer users fruit was

3596
02:21:56,040 --> 02:22:00,760
never that popular really until Vape

3597
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:02,799
once Vape comes in everybody wants fruit

3598
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:05,239
because they're hitting the Vape and so

3599
02:22:02,799 --> 02:22:06,840
I did a shitload of tobacco research so

3600
02:22:05,239 --> 02:22:08,760
I could understand the patterns of

3601
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:11,719
consumption that the tobacco companies

3602
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:13,760
had figured out and then I just overlaid

3603
02:22:11,719 --> 02:22:15,239
all of this overall my own research and

3604
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:19,359
my own

3605
02:22:15,239 --> 02:22:21,359
intuition and out comes this this four

3606
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:23,640
categories of perception

3607
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:25,520
they just kill it because they actually

3608
02:22:23,639 --> 02:22:28,039
really do work well because I didn't

3609
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:30,399
really invent anything I just saw the

3610
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:31,600
patterns and I put all the pieces

3611
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:34,159
together in

3612
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:36,559
synthesis so invention to me is you know

3613
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:39,318
came out of thin air with it I had seen

3614
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:41,199
the pattern I recognized that these

3615
02:22:39,318 --> 02:22:43,920
things from these places had these

3616
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,840
effects I knew it couldn't be random and

3617
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,760
I knew that if I looked at as many

3618
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:50,239
plants as I had seen over the course of

3619
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:52,398
my life there wasn't any of them that I

3620
02:22:50,239 --> 02:22:54,159
couldn't put in one of those categories

3621
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:56,840
and so it just created this really

3622
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:59,079
powerful simple tool that when we

3623
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:02,439
started using with the data collection

3624
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:04,840
it worked perfectly and if you look at

3625
02:23:02,439 --> 02:23:07,639
the data from the United States

3626
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:13,000
specifically California California goes

3627
02:23:07,639 --> 02:23:18,199
into Medical in the 96 so from 96 to say

3628
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:21,000
2018 you got 22 years 22 years of data

3629
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:23,520
from the largest medical recommend a

3630
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:25,040
provider in the state you can imagine

3631
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:29,520
the size of that data

3632
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:31,800
set what you find is 95% of the people

3633
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:34,079
came in to those offices to get a

3634
02:23:31,799 --> 02:23:37,559
recommendation for one of four issues

3635
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:39,879
sleep pain appetite or

3636
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:42,478
mood and we can lay each one of those

3637
02:23:39,879 --> 02:23:44,679
into a category cleanly and so there's

3638
02:23:42,478 --> 02:23:47,478
these weird anomalies where you just see

3639
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:49,279
these clusters of patterns and when you

3640
02:23:47,478 --> 02:23:52,519
really start to step back and look at it

3641
02:23:49,279 --> 02:23:54,800
you go wow it's that simple because

3642
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:56,960
cannabis isn't multiple species it's a

3643
02:23:54,799 --> 02:23:58,199
single species that was dispersed around

3644
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:01,478
the earth and

3645
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:03,640
spread so we know from what we know the

3646
02:24:01,478 --> 02:24:06,519
history that we know is that cannabis

3647
02:24:03,639 --> 02:24:09,039
comes from Mongolia Plains of the region

3648
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:11,800
moves down into Asia stits around for a

3649
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:16,080
couple thousand years shifts into Europe

3650
02:24:11,799 --> 02:24:18,679
shifts down goes into Africa goes into

3651
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:20,600
the Americas five or 600 years ago moves

3652
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:21,359
up we're the last ones really to have

3653
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:23,760
North

3654
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:25,318
Americans so we're the we're the least

3655
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:27,559
familiar with the product but we're you

3656
02:24:25,318 --> 02:24:30,639
know 80% of the herbs world's herb

3657
02:24:27,559 --> 02:24:33,278
consumption so if you really take a look

3658
02:24:30,639 --> 02:24:36,199
at the the pattern it lays out really

3659
02:24:33,279 --> 02:24:38,640
well and once the scientists started to

3660
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:41,760
really attack it and then prove it right

3661
02:24:38,639 --> 02:24:44,358
they adopted it and so Abrams adopts it

3662
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,200
as a tool he brings it forth through the

3663
02:24:44,359 --> 02:24:48,040
emerald scientific conference which he's

3664
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:50,600
the chair of I get introduced as the

3665
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:52,319
person who found it what really kind of

3666
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:54,520
laid it in place was there was a guy

3667
02:24:52,318 --> 02:24:57,199
named Dr Nasha who's doing brain wave

3668
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:58,680
analysis of cannabis and he said if you

3669
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:59,800
consume different types of cannabis we

3670
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:02,559
should get a different brain wave

3671
02:24:59,799 --> 02:25:04,159
readout that was his hypothesis so he

3672
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:06,398
goes and buys different kinds of

3673
02:25:04,159 --> 02:25:08,478
cannabis has people smoke it and and

3674
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:11,519
they have the same exact result and he

3675
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:13,519
said wow all herb is the same and Abrams

3676
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:15,159
reads the study and says no I don't

3677
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:17,560
think so I think you did the experiment

3678
02:25:15,159 --> 02:25:19,680
wrong and nasha's like no I did

3679
02:25:17,559 --> 02:25:21,000
everything right I went to the store and

3680
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,639
I bought four different kinds of

3681
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,840
cannabis different names all this stuff

3682
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:27,239
and he goes no no let me provide the

3683
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:29,520
Cannabis based off of these categories

3684
02:25:27,239 --> 02:25:31,719
and let's redo the experiment and when

3685
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:36,000
they did Bam four radically different

3686
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:38,000
brain waves appeared wow so it it it's

3687
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,799
been substantiated enough times and then

3688
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,478
it's been used over and over and over

3689
02:25:39,799 --> 02:25:43,000
again by companies all over the world

3690
02:25:41,478 --> 02:25:45,639
that reached out to me privately and

3691
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,760
said hey we heard about the the

3692
02:25:45,639 --> 02:25:50,879
categories could we use them and I'm

3693
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:52,398
like totally it's a tool that I I'd love

3694
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:55,478
to see people use because it makes it

3695
02:25:52,398 --> 02:25:57,318
easy to really neck down these massive

3696
02:25:55,478 --> 02:25:59,959
populations and understand the

3697
02:25:57,318 --> 02:26:02,519
demographics who buys Earth older people

3698
02:25:59,959 --> 02:26:05,079
typically who's buying floral people

3699
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:06,800
that are in in Tech who's buying fuel

3700
02:26:05,079 --> 02:26:09,039
people who want to get really high

3701
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:11,599
people who want pain relief appetite and

3702
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:15,359
people who are on a budget because you

3703
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:17,120
can consume less Fuel and be high longer

3704
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:19,318
more because of the the canabo

3705
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:21,800
concentration so you don't get higher

3706
02:26:19,318 --> 02:26:24,840
but you have more canabo circulating in

3707
02:26:21,799 --> 02:26:27,639
your system so you should stay high

3708
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:30,600
longer it's a price function so people

3709
02:26:27,639 --> 02:26:32,719
that are poorer almost always go to fuel

3710
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:34,920
you it's rare that you go into a a store

3711
02:26:32,719 --> 02:26:36,119
with less money and say I want to enjoy

3712
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:38,960
the experience you're like no I want to

3713
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:41,600
get high I want gas wow that's a that's

3714
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:43,519
a really sort of keen observation I

3715
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,800
hadn't heard sort of articulated before

3716
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:46,520
I really like that and you know what

3717
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:51,199
when I think about it sort of makes

3718
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:51,200
