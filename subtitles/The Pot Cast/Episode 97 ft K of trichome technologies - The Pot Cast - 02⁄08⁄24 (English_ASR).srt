00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,079
cannabis company and he grows all

169
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,000
organic outdoor cannabis and

170
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,839
so I enjoy getting pot from him so

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,240
that's what I'm smoking at the

172
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,839
moment Ah that's incredible are you more

173
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,000
of an indo or is Tava

174
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,560
guy um depends on the time of day you

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,079
know what I mean is uh uh more than

176
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,399
sativa or indicia normac clature

177
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:54,439
classifications uh I I have uh uh you

178
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,598
know uh I like high cannab uh cannaboid

179
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,598
contents at night low cannaboids in the

180
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,478
middle of the day in the in in the early

181
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,439
parts of the morning and um then you

182
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,918
know getting into my favorite uh tpine

183
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,399
so to speak I like beta careline I love

184
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,318
black pepper and there's certain Tarpin

185
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,560
that I kind of seek out in the cultivar

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,840
so more so than the sativa indicia

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,199
references I I I look for chemical

188
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,399
ratios you know that's incredible I I

189
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,800
love the the breakdown even just as you

190
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,959
said you know high cannaboid in the

191
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,639
evening lower in the day I just want to

192
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,279
quickly follow up that comment about the

193
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,199
turpins first do you feel like you

194
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,799
gravitate more towards W tpine profiles

195
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,598
than say any other individual

196
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,439
aspect um yeah because the flavor and

197
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,959
the smell is uh

198
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,199
probably I'll even say 50% of the

199
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,799
pleasure I gain from Cannabis or hashish

200
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,560
either one um so I've always you know

201
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,960
besides just the high I enjoyed the

202
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,759
different flavors and nuances and smells

203
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,638
and that that part of it fascinates me

204
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,639
and that gets into the chemical ratios

205
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,158
and differences of Tarpin that's really

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,439
what differentiates one from another as

207
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:02,918
well as you know sulfur based thols and

208
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,478
a few other

209
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,519
chemicals yeah certainly and look let's

210
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:08,758
let's uh pause the th there for a second

211
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,478
cuz I want to come back but I want to

212
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,840
quickly ask you first cuz I was talking

213
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,318
to a few grower friends the other day

214
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,359
and they asked me they were like you

215
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,080
know you hear people talking about tpin

216
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,280
bit of caropine you know smells like

217
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,878
Peppers you mentioned things like that

218
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,679
and they sort of said I don't know if

219
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,680
I've got like my base palette down in a

220
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,158
sense they were like people talk about

221
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,240
mirene for example and you can often

222
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,519
hear quite widely varying descriptions

223
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,519
of what it smells like and you know I

224
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,278
think in a sense it sort of for some

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
people it can just come down to you need

226
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,038
someone to like put a plant in front of

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,519
your face and say this is what a merine

228
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,639
dominant plant smells like or something

229
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,240
like that so my question to you is how

230
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,240
would you advise people to try to

231
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,799
develop their nose if for example they

232
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,639
don't have someone who can be like

233
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,879
here's this PL and it smells exactly

234
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,000
like talene or you know how can people

235
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,799
start to get that reference

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,360
down so I recently wrote an article that

237
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,519
basically addressed that subject and and

238
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,399
so more so than you know saying buy

239
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,320
buying a a bottle of pure uh pinene

240
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,200
limine or whatever have you um you know

241
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,600
what is your favorite cannabis and and

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,600
go Analyze That send that to a lab or

243
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
you know there's there's so many um um

244
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,320
lab reports available in other countries

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
where it's legalized that that try to

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,440
find a lab report that tells you what

247
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,199
what is the turpine ratio in your

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,160
favorite cultivar and you might find

249
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,320
that that there is dominant tpine and or

250
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:37,240
a few and and that would be a good place

251
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,000
to start I I explained to people that

252
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,399
you know there's something called like a

253
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,480
wine journal or a wine diary if you were

254
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,480
to go to a famous wine region and buy a

255
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,519
given bottle of wine you know maybe

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,920
there was uh uh something that

257
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,519
fascinated you or or or or made you

258
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,000
prefer that and and you would write it

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,039
in your journal and then when you got

260
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,839
home after a while you would start

261
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,679
seeing some similarities you know maybe

262
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,040
it was a certain mixture of Mero and

263
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,958
Cabernet or maybe it was French Oak

264
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,278
maybe it was American oak or those

265
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,919
outside influences that really make up

266
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,519
the totality of that wine after a while

267
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,039
you'll find a preference you know what I

268
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,360
mean something that you prefer uh uh you

269
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,480
know a 6040 ratio of a Cabernet to Mero

270
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,600
or again French oak versus American oak

271
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
or you know you you'll you'll probably

272
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,360
find that there's characteristics that

273
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
you prefer and I believe that's to be

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,200
the same in cannabis uh you know so so

275
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,679
so find the Cannabis that you find the

276
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,800
most appealing and then try to find the

277
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,399
characteristics that are in the contents

278
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,199
of that cannabis what's the dominant

279
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,679
tpine and what's the T the the the the

280
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,600
can cannaboid ratios does it have CBC or

281
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,559
thcv or you know what what what are the

282
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,278
nuances figure out the nuances and then

283
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,239
try to find similar and like strains or

284
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,439
cultivars if you will and and and

285
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,480
perhaps that's that's the path

286
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
yeah that sounds fantastic you know like

287
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,720
follow what you're interested in and

288
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,799
that's going to give you some answers

289
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
and there's so many little Avenues you

290
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,199
just you spoke about that we need to

291
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
follow up on but I guess the one that

292
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm most interested in talking to you

293
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,759
about is you referenced wine a few times

294
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,720
in that answer and I wanted to ask you

295
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,879
to what degree do you think we will see

296
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,480
a mirroring of say elements of the wine

297
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,679
industry and the Cannabis industry you

298
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,639
know people often talk about they want

299
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,759
to establish these production appalaches

300
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,399
and um really promoting the Terre of

301
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,200
certain regions I think at this point we

302
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,639
sadly aren't there yet you know like the

303
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
majority of a lot of uh the highest

304
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,959
quality production is generally

305
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,240
considered indoors though there are a

306
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,479
vocal group of people who is very you

307
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,720
know um big about supporting outdoor

308
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,839
what do you think we'll come to see in

309
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,320
uh the coming 15 to 20 years that will

310
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,279
mirror the wine industry in

311
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,600
cannabis um well there's there's a lot

312
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,799
of misconceptions there and and you know

313
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,639
where will where will it end up up I I

314
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,159
believe it'll end up just where I said

315
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,079
uh people will have preferential uh

316
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:12,240
cultivars ratios be it you know similar

317
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:15,120
to CBD and THC ratios akin to Cabernet

318
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,198
and Mero levels or something like that I

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,399
want seen a uh a comic and and and it

320
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,719
depicted a a gentleman on the phone to

321
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,440
his local grow store and he was placing

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,800
his order so to speak and and he ordered

323
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,199
one bag of Humble County Tera and one

324
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,359
bag of Menino Tera and I just I still

325
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,719
find that funny as hell because if you

326
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,079
really get into Tera and and and you

327
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,959
know there's

328
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:44,559
appalation um there there's uh you know

329
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,638
other things that denote where a wine is

330
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,198
produced but when you get into Tera a

331
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,240
wine grape in a given Appalachian there

332
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:56,399
there's no outside influence there's no

333
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,120
nutrient application there's no uh you

334
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,000
know uh the influences that the the

335
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,839
Cannabis has cannabis has nutrient

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,799
applications a wine grape doesn't so you

337
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,399
know to to to truly say that you are

338
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,799
extoling the the properties of an

339
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,839
appalation of a given region of a

340
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,479
cannabis plant would be to plant it in

341
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,720
the dirt water only and never give it

342
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,639
food and that's never going to happen

343
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,120
you know what I mean so you know then

344
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,120
then you get into the uh environmental

345
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,078
aspects of it you know is it a a cool

346
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,679
region a foggy region is it a rocky

347
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,638
region uh iron rich and those other uh

348
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,000
outside environmental

349
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,560
influences uh are are are really what

350
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,958
makes up the characteristics of the

351
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:44,078
final product more so than um a a a

352
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:47,000
so-called Tera you know what I mean

353
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:50,479
because because it terat isn't really

354
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,839
appropriate term the second you add

355
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,920
nutrients or amendments to the soil

356
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,399
because that's not what happens in

357
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,278
grapes you

358
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,639
know yeah certainly certainly and I

359
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,679
think I have come across a few farms at

360
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,159
least on Instagram on face value who say

361
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,719
they're trying to do that even a few who

362
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,639
go so far as to say they're trying to do

363
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,360
like dry farming and you know like just

364
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,240
natural rain only but it does remain to

365
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,919
be seen if it's like actually a viable

366
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,240
option and then uh maybe you could start

367
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,319
to assess if there is some degree of TOA

368
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,440
there you you mentioned in the last

369
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,040
answer that your friend was growing some

370
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,240
organic outdoor I love to ask all the

371
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,759
guests what's your preferred style of

372
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,720
growing if you have your choice are you

373
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,839
like an indoor cocoa and salt Sky you an

374
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,480
outdoor organic what's your preferred

375
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,519
setup if you had your

376
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,399
choice

377
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:46,519
uh hybrid uh supplemental Lighting in a

378
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:49,320
greenhouse um I have uh been fortunate

379
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,399
enough to meet some of the largest uh

380
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,160
commercial tomato growers in the world

381
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,879
that do so with uh no compromise of

382
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,240
quality so to speak you know what I mean

383
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,639
so they're just not spitting out

384
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,399
flavorless to tomatoes and and in fact

385
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,759
he handed me a tomato from his

386
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,360
Greenhouse one time and I kid you not to

387
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,800
this day it is the best damn tomato I

388
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
ever taste it you know what I mean and

389
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,559
it's not just because he's my friend or

390
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,879
I I prefer his methodologies but it's a

391
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,679
fact and and you know it's uh you know

392
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,399
he's in um not really using supplemental

393
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,439
lighting because he's in a preferential

394
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,120
location but if I was going to be in a

395
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,959
preferential location um I would use

396
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,480
supplemental lighting for cultivating

397
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,679
cannabis in a greenhouse large scale

398
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,159
commercial yeah I wanted to ask you

399
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,039
about that because you know you're

400
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,278
you're well known especially you know in

401
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:42,198
a in sort of 10 uh 15 years ago for

402
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,958
being a pioneer of like scaling up

403
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:47,639
commercial cultivation tell me a little

404
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,958
bit about what it's like to grow on the

405
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,159
sort of scale you're referring to

406
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,198
because I think both myself and many of

407
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,318
our listeners um probably you know for

408
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,359
better or worse uh kid ourselves at

409
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,519
times and think oh you know I've I've

410
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,199
got Mastery of this tent I could do a

411
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,879
greenhouse you know what are some of the

412
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,039
issues you come across on scale that

413
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,919
just simply aren't present on the the

414
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,958
smaller hobby level well keep in mind

415
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,519
when I was uh doing those commercial

416
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,318
cultivations that you were talking about

417
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,519
that were so famous and fluid in those

418
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:20,519
magazines I was facing a 20 to5 to life

419
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,560
sentence because prop 215 wasn't even

420
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,759
enacted let alone prop 64 so it was just

421
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:28,518
all illegal you know activity um you

422
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,440
know even going back as far as when I

423
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,639
did 60 Minutes television show in 1996 I

424
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
I had already been arrested in 1993 and

425
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,600
was facing 25 to life if I got caught

426
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,440
doing that interview so there was the

427
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,959
mindset you know um it wasn't I didn't

428
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,319
go large and and do those commercial

429
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:53,719
levels out of um you know uh money or

430
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:55,799
you know uh what what what ended up was

431
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,600
uh to to get a lot of data you have to

432
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,359
do a lot of plants and when especially

433
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,000
when you're breeding I bred over 200

434
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,919
different cultivars so when you start

435
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,439
breeding that much and and and taking

436
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,838
that many clones by default your plant

437
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,279
go count just skyrockets you end up with

438
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,678
2,000 4,000 and then if you got 4,000

439
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,798
what's six you know what I mean there's

440
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,679
no really you know 25 years or 50 what's

441
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,279
the difference you know what I mean so

442
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,720
you know but then after a while it was

443
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,720
like you know the the cultivation

444
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,160
techniques and the information available

445
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,240
you know especially when there was no

446
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,880
real internet so to speak um I mean

447
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,359
there was but there there there wasn't

448
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,160
as free and open as it is today um as

449
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,719
far as marijuana cultivation information

450
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,080
or anything else so it was still books

451
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,038
and papers and and magazines

452
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:46,798
Etc so you know um you know it was just

453
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:49,240
uh to to to answer my own questions uh

454
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,440
you know what happens if and scaling up

455
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,359
and and you know those nft systems that

456
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,600
I built and then you know okay well nft

457
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,439
does this that and the other thing with

458
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,199
rock well then what about fog ponics

459
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,840
what about you know organ organic

460
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,519
amendments uh you know because uh you

461
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:07,240
know you mentioned salts versus uh

462
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,079
Organics it's it's you know very hard to

463
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,279
get Organics to go through a drip system

464
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:15,038
and not end up clogging it you know so

465
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,158
so then inevitably you end up with two

466
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,079
if you're you know um trying to

467
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,760
incorporate organic uh amendments you

468
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,759
end up with the drip system and hand

469
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,359
watering over the top with your organic

470
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,400
amendments so you can get include those

471
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,558
Etc but I think I went off track with my

472
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,720
answers but no I love it it gives such

473
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,720
colorful context to your your story and

474
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,880
we're certainly going to loop back and

475
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,159
and cover you know chronologically your

476
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,799
journey because it's so interesting but

477
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,679
I guess one thing I still wanted to hunt

478
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:45,798
down from that last question was what

479
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,519
are some of the challenges you face on

480
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:51,639
scale when you're growing thousands of

481
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:55,079
plants versus say maybe you know 80 to

482
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,840
100 at home in a room skilled labor and

483
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,359
time you know what I mean being able to

484
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:01,119
manage everything especially you know if

485
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,000
if you're the one uh paying the bills

486
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,839
you know physically going down to pay

487
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,038
the pg&amp; bill etc etc uh if you're the

488
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,558
one physically doing deliveries of the

489
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,359
product to The Dispensary if you're the

490
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:17,119
one procuring materials uh to you know

491
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,439
uh uh continue the process you know uh

492
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,678
if you're a Onan Shan there's onean show

493
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,400
there's only so many hours in the day so

494
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,519
when it was illegal activity um you know

495
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,360
you had to watch who be very mindful of

496
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,038
who you trusted um now that it's legal

497
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,959
you there's there there's you know

498
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,679
there's unions there's there's you know

499
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,919
there's uh you know legitimate places to

500
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,480
hire skilled labor yeah there's there's

501
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,799
college courses being given now at AR

502
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,720
you know multiple colleges in the United

503
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:50,000
States so it's it's much easier to get

504
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,720
labor um skilled labor should I say and

505
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,558
and and much easier to deal with than an

506
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,159
illegal

507
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,440
entity yeah certainly I mean did you

508

impressive but yeah I had I had a

542
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:17,519
real OG the sort of guy you'd want on

543
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,919
your team so let's let's go back a

544
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,000
little bit and uh and roll this out in a

545
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,799
bit of order so tell me you know what

546
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,319
was your first grow when did you first

547
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,558
start

548
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:31,759
growing I first started growing when I

549
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:33,798
was uh just turned 13 years old um a

550
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,200
friend across the street his dad was a

551
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:40,400
dealer so I just caught the tail end of

552
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,400
say uh the the hippie era the the the

553
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,240
the the the hash trails and stuff I

554
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,840
caught the very end of the red lebanes

555
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,640
and the blonde levian and the the the

556
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,879
the Panamanian and and you know just

557
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,038
started you know the 80s began the uh

558
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,400
influx of the uh black Afghanistan hash

559
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:02,000
that was lower quality but I got to

560
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,679
experience a lot of the end of the the

561
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,839
era so to speak and it kind of

562
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,840
fascinated me that you know people went

563
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,599
to prison and and and put their lives on

564
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:14,000
the line for this plant and stuff and I

565
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,798
I grew up I was born and raised in Napa

566
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,519
Valley and wine country and then lived

567
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,119
in other agricultural based communities

568
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,918
so I knew you know plant production and

569
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,599
plant growth and stuff and new kids that

570
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,240
you know Liv their life off farming and

571
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:31,798
so you know my mom had cutting and the

572
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,880
the the the the the kitchen window like

573
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:35,918
anybody else that rooted and stuff and

574
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,200
things and you my parents work for the

575
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,400
government and they didn't really want

576
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,840
me out and about um doing you know

577
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,240
illegal grows in in the the the the the

578
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,678
surrounding areas so they preferred that

579
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,159
I do it at home so I was able to at a

580
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,640
very young age grow in the backyard so

581
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,960
you know I was able to you know get

582
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,559
Colombian marijuana seeds and plant them

583
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,240
and see them grow and fail and fall over

584
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:00,918
and not enough life trials and

585
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,159
tribulations there was no books there

586
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:04,880
was no information and if there was no

587
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,039
one could sell it to a little kid you

588
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,559
know and then I seen an ad in High Times

589
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,919
that offered something called a hydrop

590
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:15,158
poot and it sounded magic so you know so

591
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,720
I bought that um and it was basically a

592
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,400
bus boy tray uh it's in my book there's

593
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,919
a picture of me standing there next to

594
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,159
it a bus boy tray with a lava rock in it

595
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,400
with the AirStone bubbler and it came

596
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,640
with a little packet of um Miracle Grow

597
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,919
and uh yeah it worked it grew and and

598
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,320
that as a 13-year-old kid sparked my

599
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,799
fascination with Hydroponics and

600
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,000
cannabis growth and everything related

601
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,359
um and then you know I was telling some

602
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,679
the other day I can distinctly remember

603
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,719
and could take you to today the exact

604
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,600
spot where I was standing when I seen

605
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,079
seedless cannabis uh what we would know

606
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,079
today is um it just it completely

607
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,480
fascinated me um as well as the first

608
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,798
time I seen a concentrate in 1980 a has

609
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,440
soil concentrate that was of part

610
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:06,240
today uh tell me about both of those you

611
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,679
know what was that first herb you saw

612
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,919
that was Sensei did it have a name or

613
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,600
I'm guessing it was just back at the

614
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,240
time where it was just like the kind or

615
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,199
something and also tell us about that

616
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,480
concentrate and it was uh well both

617
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,440
happened about 1980 a new guy moved into

618
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,679
town um and he brought this cannabis and

619
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,440
showed it to me and it had these it had

620
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,440
a when it did have a seed it was huge it

621
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,038
was like you know to me it looked like a

622
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,440
a watermelon you know what I mean it was

623
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,599
absolutely huge with these Jagged black

624
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,720
uh lines it was completely different

625
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:44,038
than any kind of um sativa or thin Leaf

626
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,919
cultivar uh seed that I had ever seen it

627
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:50,158
was just this gargantuan seed um but you

628
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,799
you very rarely got one um the G the the

629
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,520
the person that sold us the pot ended up

630
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,720
telling us he'll give us 25 a seed to

631
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,720
buy them back so anyway um I asked that

632
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,120
guy where'd you get that and he you know

633
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,360
and can you get more and he said yeah he

634
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:07,918
could get more and because when I was

635
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:12,079
young um I I I was a TR have always been

636
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:16,320
trustworthy so older yeah and and and

637
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:18,519
kind of um hung out with older uh kids

638
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,960
uh uh one of my best friends was you

639
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,480
know almost twice my age and and so my

640
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,399
mom would let me go hang out with them

641
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,919
and stay as long as I stand out of

642
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:32,719
trouble you know what I mean uh and so

643
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:34,240
you know uh so knowing him um I I was

644
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,679
you know afforded the luxury of seeing

645
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,359
lots of different cannabis and stuff

646
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,200
like that so when the new kid came to

647
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,918
town and I asked him if he could get

648
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,440
more of it I I knew adults that sold

649
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,799
cannabis so I knew if he could get more

650
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,120
that those adults would want that

651
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,879
cannabis so he said yes he could get

652
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:53,000
more and there was a a school program a

653
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,799
occupational program for auto mechanics

654
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,558
and and it took you like three towns

655
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,879
away and you went to their auto shop and

656
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,000
you learned all day and then you came

657
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,039
back to town and so that town was the

658
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,720
same town that he could get the

659
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,079
marijuana so I said well let's get on

660
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,399
that bus and let's go to that town and

661
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,398
let's get that marijuana and we went

662
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,558
there and we got a pound and this is in

663
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:13,239
what ninth grade and or grade nine

664
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,918
whatever you want to say and then from

665
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,880
there we went to uh uh you know got got

666
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,159
front at a pound took it to my friend

667
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,880
bod's house and said here look and he

668
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,840
went how much for that we said $2,200

669
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,799
and he said okay boom and so we got it

670
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,678
for 2,000 we kept 200 each

671
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,558
100 each and and brought the the the

672
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,919
main guy the money back and started

673
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:39,480
doing that at like n ninth grade um you

674
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,520
know and none of the adults knew where

675
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,599
this stuff was coming from but it was

676
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,359
just from me and him and his connection

677
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:50,119
to his dad's

678
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:52,599
friend and then one day a guy named rust

679
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,319
armmer came over my house and he had

680
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:56,558
some what he called hash

681
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,439
oil and he said do you want to buy some

682
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,119
of this for $25 a grand which which was

683
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:05,519
a very high price back then then again

684
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:09,359
1980 and before that sorry this is a

685
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:11,599
three four P part story um I had a

686
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,199
childhood friend and and maybe he didn't

687
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,759
tell the truth all the time he stretched

688
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,919
the truth quite a bit um about fishing

689
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,440
and all kinds of stuff and he came over

690
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,919
one day and he's got a brown paper bag

691
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,558
full of marijuana and it was like hey

692
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,679
Phil where'd you get the marijuana he

693
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,398
was like it was by my trash and it was

694
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,360
like so and we lived in a small again

695
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:32,558
agricultural town and

696
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,199
so the probability of someone sneaking

697
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,038
marijuana on your trash back in 1980

698
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,240
when that could be a felony a felony

699
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,640
amount of marijuana on your trash it

700
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,880
just didn't make sense so it was like

701
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,720
yeah sure so you know rolled a joint of

702
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,960
this and smoked it and got nothing but a

703
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,399
headache it was like wow this is

704
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,120
terrible and it was like maybe if you

705
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:51,599
smoke a bunch more of it it'll be okay

706
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,319
and and it wasn't and so we didn't smoke

707
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,240
more more of that and so a couple weeks

708
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,558
later he came back with another round

709
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,880
paper bag and it's like you know it

710
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,440
wasn't buds it was just all all ground

711
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,480
up and it was like what's with this you

712
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,840
know didn't couldn't couldn't figure it

713
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,120
out and then his older brother one day

714
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,519
was sleeping and uh there was a banging

715
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,639
on the door and he went to the door and

716
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,278
it was the neighbor and the neighbor

717
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,840
said can I put something in your garage

718
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,960
and he said I don't care and went back

719
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,240
to bed and then a couple hours later

720
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,399
there was more banging on the door he

721
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,880
went to the door flung the door open and

722
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,518
the local police department are sitting

723
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,880
there and he's like I didn't do nothing

724
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,798
and they're like we know you didn't do

725
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,399
anything Randall uh get your get your

726
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,158
pants on and come outside so he went

727
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,079
outside and he could see Dolly marks

728
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,200
from the neighbor's house going to his

729
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,278
house and then he looked over at the

730
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,759
neighbor's house and the neighbor's

731
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,919
house is on fire and they're they're

732
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,200
they're cutting a hole in the roof and

733
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,440
putting that out and the firemen are

734
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,919
there and stuff so he opens his garage

735
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,240
door and inside is a wooden crates full

736
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,759
of siloc cybin mushrooms and the other

737
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,359
wooden crates are full of honey oil and

738
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,839
he said thought that's not mine and they

739
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,079
they said yeah we know that's not yours

740
00:28:52,839 --> 00:29:00,000
Randall but anyway so apparently the

741
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:02,519
hash oil that I got um and the horrible

742
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,200
marijuana by the trash came from the

743
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,240
neighbors that were making honey oil

744
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,240
back in the day um I sitting right next

745
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,079
to me I can tell you what year what

746
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,599
address exactly where this was I someday

747
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:19,839
want to go find a police report so I can

748
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:22,038
go and this is an odd tale um so I was

749
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:26,639
told that the person was out of

750
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:29,599
Australia so um yeah um a guy named Phil

751
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,640
or Phillip and supposedly Australian and

752
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,480
again why would he be doing this in that

753
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,320
location way back then it didn't make

754
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,120
sense but um when I first sampled that

755
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:45,558
first concentrate I mean it it wasn't a

756
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:50,000
chlorophyl nasty hash oil it was a

757
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:54,200
golden you could read through it Amber

758
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,640
flavorful strong as hell for a kid uh uh

759
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,399
hash oil that was every bit worth of $25

760
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,440
a gram and I spent I spent 25 to 30

761
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:06,759
years trying to find something of that

762
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:10,679
quality and never found it until today's

763
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,519
modern uh extracts became available so

764
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,120
to

765
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,798
speak wow I mean what a what a testament

766
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,959
to the quality of the extract that was

767
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:19,519
being produced in like the ' 80s like

768
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,880
how why do you think and how do you

769
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,919
think he got the knowledge to be so

770
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,039
ahead of the

771
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,559
curve I think it was just you know it

772
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:27,679
wasn't a super knowledge or anything

773
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:29,839
else with the basic chemistry degree and

774
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,559
and availability of the chemical I

775
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,278
believe probably what he was doing was a

776
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,079
quick wash with with ether and and then

777
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:38,159
just doing the evaporation of The Ether

778
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,918
out in the backyard you know and and and

779
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,960
hence that's where the fire came from

780
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,840
and when it all went to hell but I I

781
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,558
don't think it was anything

782
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,199
sophisticated there was no no glass

783
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,079
square no lab or anything else I think

784
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,880
it was just take marijuana soak it in

785
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,000
ether and evaporate The Ether real quick

786
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,039
without you know um letting it soak too

787
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,558
long and pick up any um any kind of

788
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,599
chlorophylls or sugars or fats or waxes

789
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:00,359
and da da da da da I think it was just a

790
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,158
quick

791
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,240
wash wow that's cool to hear and I I

792
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,480
guess you know the natural followup is a

793
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,038
lot of people uh very reminiscently

794
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,399
remember their first dab or concentrate

795
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,960
hit was that the experience you had it

796
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:18,558
went straight to my pleasure Center you

797
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,399
hear people in in in in addicts in

798
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,200
Rehabilitation talking about their drugs

799
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,518
of of choice and how it just went to

800
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,919
their their their core their their their

801
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,480
nerve center their brain it was again it

802
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,240
wasn't just the the the high it was the

803
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,960
flavor and the smell and and everything

804
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,480
about it you just that that it resonated

805
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,960
with me and that became my drug of

806
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,798
choice even though I I had no

807
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,679
availability of

808
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:46,359
it yeah wow look I I certainly as you

809
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,480
were saying that I went back to the

810
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,519
first dab I ever took and it it does

811
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,679
right it hits you in that uh that

812
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,759
primordial part of our lizard brain as

813
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,960
they say but um while we're on the topic

814
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,119
we had a a fan submit a question which

815
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,240
was that they said oh look I'd love to

816
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,879
hear a little bit about the evolution of

817
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,960
extraction from K and maybe a little bit

818
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,320
of a rundown on his current methodology

819
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,919
of how he makes

820
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,918
extracts so I I can give my perspective

821
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,559
from my bubble in Northern California

822
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,440
let's start there so you know there

823
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:20,200
there was a book called cannabis Alchemy

824
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,960
or or marijuana chemistry um by Starks

825
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,080
or David Hoy um that talked about

826
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,440
isomerization it was the same book with

827
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,839
different covers and you know slight

828
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,519
different

829
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:33,959
um and and that was the first book I

830
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,240
ever seen that talked about concentrates

831
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,759
and and before there that there was a a

832
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,000
red oil comic book that talked about uh

833
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,398
and I still have these things um um that

834
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,398
talked about a red oil that the

835
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,278
government had made and then I got the

836
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,959
the the government brochure on their red

837
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:55,599
oil which is basically just you know raw

838
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,480
dirty black hash oils um so uh uh I I

839
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,519
got the book and the book said you know

840
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,240
um to basically get cannabis grinded up

841
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,519
put it through a

842
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,000
a a cheesecloth and press it into a

843
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:10,159
apply heat and next to a fire and and

844
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,599
and twist it in a ball it was obviously

845
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,278
from someone looking over the shoulder

846
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,879
of someone that didn't speak the

847
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,038
language didn't know the questions to

848
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,039
ask or didn't know what was taking place

849
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:22,720
there so so it was convoluted all I got

850
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,079
was a ground up ball of marijuana you

851
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,600
know what I mean so it certainly wasn't

852
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,240
H and so but I I didn't understand

853
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:33,719
anything about like res glands Etc you

854
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:36,798
know it was just dipping into the um era

855
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,600
of the mid 80s where you know uh

856
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,558
Northern California was reading good

857
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:43,959
genetics with high resin contents before

858
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,720
that it was imported pressed you know

859
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,880
you never seen a triome kind of sort of

860
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,919
thing you know so on once I started

861
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,399
producing high resin content plants and

862
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,639
then started breeding and then as I said

863
00:33:55,398 --> 00:34:00,319
the numbers climbed exponentially

864
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:01,918
with with with a rise in the amount of

865
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,599
cannabis there was a rise in the amount

866
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,919
of waste and you're looking at this trim

867
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,480
with all this good resin on it and

868
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,639
asking yourself well you know what do I

869
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,280
do with this you know and so you know

870
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,079
after a while I started taking it put it

871
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,040
in the you know not drying it trimming

872
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,800
it wet putting it in the freezer and

873
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,719
then uh getting silk screens on a big

874
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,039
big bowl and then just slightly slightly

875
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,158
swirling them before they would defrost

876
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,480
and then dumping it and doing that like

877
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,720
for 12 hours straight and and the

878
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,440
resulting powder that I got was the most

879
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,398
incredible dry sift that I had

880
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,599
personally ever had in my life so that

881
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:45,000
right there became a fascination of mine

882
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:49,879
was you know how to make dry SE hash and

883
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,918
you know that was probably in um

884
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:57,000
1989 um you know and then I started you

885
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,400
know trying to automate it with

886
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,199
vibrating boxes and things trying to

887
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,838
scale it up and things but it never

888
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,239
really came out as well as I could get

889
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:07,599
with a fresh frozen hand trim you know

890
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:13,439
so that that became my focus for quite

891
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:16,119
some time then um let's see so uh then a

892
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,800
after that uh you know I just started

893
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:22,960
you know again bigger screens more

894
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,640
cannabis uh you know scaling up scaling

895
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,000
up and at that point you were just doing

896
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:30,039
hand pressing and stuff and things later

897
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,838
on they like uh mil Jensen produced a

898
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,838
pollinator which automated things uh but

899
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:37,559
only had one size working screen you had

900
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:40,920
to refine and clean the resulting

901
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:43,119
product after that and then so you know

902
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,159
that that I wrapped my head and you know

903
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:51,079
got fairly good at at dry seing and and

904
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:55,318
um uh me I I wrote an article and um it

905
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:58,000
was edited and uh cleaned up so to speak

906
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,800
and co-authored by Mel Frank one of my

907
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,039
Heroes and and someone I respect

908
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,839
immensely um and so that was prob that

909
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:09,880
was in the year 2000 um and it basically

910
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:12,199
that they told how to do dry seeve um

911
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,880
and that was for High Times magazine and

912
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,919
then also I had gotten a piece of paper

913
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,039
in

914
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,480
1994

915
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,960
from someone that got let's see so the

916
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,039
piece of paper I got from Ed Rosenthal

917
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,599
who got from Neville sh and mocker from

918
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:36,960
from Super City the seed club and

919
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:39,240
and uh he got that document from uh sadu

920
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,119
Sam or Sam the skunkman and basically

921
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,118
this document onepage document it's on

922
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,519
my Instagram page you can see the the

923
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,760
the original document there and it was

924
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,719
originally sold in High Times magazine

925
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,200
as an

926
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,078
instruction and so it basically said

927
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:58,439
take cannabis put it in a blender uh

928
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:02,000
blend it gently quickly and then

929
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,200
uh SE out the the floating part and

930
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,599
collect the uh sinking part in a coffee

931
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,960
filter and basically that was the the

932
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,440
early stage information and early stage

933
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,679
of water has uh

934
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,559
technology and so from there I I I you

935
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,559
know uh try to scale it up then you know

936
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:22,799
did did you know ridiculous stupid

937
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,679
things you know what I mean like you

938
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,599
know um used a a a a a paint stir to try

939
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:33,358
to you know uh you know so you got a a

940
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,039
uh a chiller instead of using ice to

941
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,838
drop your temperature of your water you

942
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,079
got fresh frozen material in there and

943
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,480
you're trying to keep it uh the resin

944
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,000
gland solidified but trying to separate

945
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,400
it without um using the bulk of ice and

946
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,079
also the damage of ice so you know it

947
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,000
made sense to like try a a painer which

948
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,960
was far too aggressive and and put far

949
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,880
too much particulate into the into the

950
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,800
the final product etc etc but yeah you

951
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,720
know I had no sources of information and

952
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,359
and so this is how I you know went

953
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:09,239
through the process of elimination of

954
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,920
what worked and what didn't you know in

955
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:12,919
the in the end you would just uh use the

956
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,838
water chiller no ice and hand or that

957
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,559
you know and and so but I was doing

958
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:21,400
fresh frozen you know way before it was

959
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:24,279
a term or or being utilized um and so

960
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,838
that article also went into the same

961
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,640
article with Mel Frank it taught you how

962
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,239
to dry seeve and it also taught you how

963
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:34,318
water hash but and the year 2000 um and

964
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:38,039
those are both uh on my Instagram page

965
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:40,519
you know you can see what what year what

966
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:42,318
uh issue you know uh everything I say

967
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,318
I've got publish proof kind of sort of

968
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:49,000
thing um and at that point there wasn't

969
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:51,719
um uh water bags or or you know any of

970
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,239
those products so I just told how to do

971
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:55,358
it without those products and those

972
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:59,239
products came out very soon after and

973
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:01,318
you know took off and and exploded um

974
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:04,559
from from there you know I I was still

975
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:06,838
fascinated by those those I loved dry

976
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,599
seeve hash don't get me wrong water hash

977
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,000
uh

978
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,920
secondary but I but I absolutely loved

979
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,719
that original oil and I wanted to get

980
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,079
back to that I had had oil since but it

981
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:18,639
was all chlorophilia dirty black some

982
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,400
nasty extraction and and and certainly

983
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,960
wasn't close to the original that I had

984
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,318
so then I started asking myself how to

985
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,760
do that da d d d da so you know that

986
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:31,559
gets into you know fairly you know Roto

987
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,640
Vapes in chemistry I had the the luxury

988
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,519
of meeting a gentleman that was um doing

989
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:39,199
Roto Vapes with ether on the hillsides

990
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:42,759
of Kabul Afghanistan in

991
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:46,519
1983 wow and boy that's some some hair

992
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,520
raising stuff oh funny story there that

993
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:50,280
they were kids they were from Berkeley

994
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,480
um and and one of them had a chemistry

995
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,480
degree so they they they went to Kabul

996
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,400
and they were shipping all their their

997
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,280
materials there their rot of Vapes their

998
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,358
their ether ET

999
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,079
Etc and they said one time that um the

1000
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:04,759
the winter times get very very cold

1001
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,160
there and so their ether was in the

1002
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,800
basement and and so someone went down to

1003
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,159
the basement and somehow they sparked

1004
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,560
off a the the the the cans of ether had

1005
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,679
condensed because of the cold and Vapors

1006
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,279
had filled the basement so when they

1007
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,399
went down to the basement they sparked

1008
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,440
off this explosion and it blew you know

1009
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,318
all the windows out started a fire and

1010
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,400
stuff so everybody rushed down the hill

1011
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:30,880
and they went to the local um um the

1012
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,200
coffee restaurant down in the Flatlands

1013
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,160
so they could sit there and stare at

1014
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,759
their house burning after a while it

1015
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,279
went out and nothing really happened but

1016
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,880
they noticed like people were walking by

1017
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,280
and staring at them and stuff until they

1018
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,119
finally stared at each other and they

1019
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,640
realized all their hair was singed and

1020
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,039
their eyebrows and and everybody had

1021
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,799
soot looked like they had been burned up

1022
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,400
so pretty dangerous but yeah the Soviets

1023
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,920
C the Soviets came in and they stopped

1024
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,559
doing that um another funny story they

1025
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,119
told me was like uh on on one side of

1026
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:02,480
the valley they had their lab and and so

1027
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:05,280
and on the other side they they had

1028
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,880
their their source so one day the source

1029
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,599
shows up at at at their spot and and

1030
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,680
he's kind of watching what's going on

1031
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,119
and he's kind of dismayed and they're

1032
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,039
like what's wrong and he was like see

1033
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,559
your guys there and he's like yeah and

1034
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,920
he's like they they've got these huge

1035
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,960
bricks of hash and they're they're

1036
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,480
they're scraping them over screens so

1037
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,199
they could particulate it you know what

1038
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,559
I mean and expose the surface area for

1039
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,759
extraction for ether you know and he's

1040
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:28,400
like you see on the other side of the

1041
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,200
valley and he like yeah and he's like I

1042
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,079
have my guys over there pressing it into

1043
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,519
those into those blocks he's like he's

1044
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,519
like you mean you could just give it to

1045
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,519
us in in in gunny sacks so just raw

1046
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,079
resin he was like yeah yeah yeah save us

1047
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,440
both a bunch of time so I found that

1048
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,599
amusing but but I I didn't want to do

1049
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,960
ether you know um at that time early in

1050
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,760
the days ether was a um very forbidden

1051
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,280
um substance because it was used

1052
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,400
utilized in the the the manufacturing of

1053
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,280
methamphetamine so in California it

1054
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,680
probably wouldn't be a good idea to go

1055
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,160
out there running around trying to buy

1056
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,519
ether so and and plus I'm not I'm not a

1057
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:07,440
fan of the flammability of it and etc

1058
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,239
etc so that wasn't the path I wanted to

1059
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,318
take um or or even ethanol and Roto

1060
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,598
Vapes it just seems so backwards you

1061
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,960
know and and and the the distillate that

1062
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,079
that It produced just really did nothing

1063
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,800
to fancy me the turpine content was

1064
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:27,318
destroyed etc etc by the heat so from

1065
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,800
there um a friend was talking about the

1066
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:32,199
the petrochemical companies um how they

1067
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,160
utilize something called a cracker and

1068
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:38,199
how they utilize that to to to make um

1069
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:41,239
petroleum and basically what he

1070
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:44,000
explained was a tube um that you push uh

1071
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:45,759
butane through and then very quickly

1072
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,960
after that you started seeing stuff in

1073
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,440
the Bay Area called wax uh from ear wax

1074
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,720
because it was all brown and looked like

1075
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,599
ear wax and it was all sticky and nasty

1076
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:58,759
what a horrible term but that stuck you

1077
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,480
know um later on um well that but uh so

1078
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,440
so then people started making the the

1079
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,800
the butane extracts and stuff and um

1080
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,679
pushing it through you know they didn't

1081
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,839
know any better uh I wrote an article

1082
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,598
for rede magazine called uh Captain

1083
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,799
butane I didn't write it I told Nick how

1084
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,599
to write it but but it basically you

1085
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,119
know told you know how to do the nasty

1086
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,559
process of pushing butane through a PVC

1087
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,480
pipe you know which was revolutionary

1088
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,040
for the time you know um you know later

1089
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,599
we learned that you know that's a bomb

1090
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,880
and it's poison and you shouldn't do

1091
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,079
that but

1092
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,559
until then it made some fancy product um

1093
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,800
so you know people started doing that

1094
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,559
but very quickly it started getting into

1095
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:44,920
closed loop systems and and and the

1096
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:46,720
industry shifted gears before this the

1097
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,680
glass bong makers were about to go out

1098
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:52,159
of business because nobody wanted a

1099
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:55,118
glass bong with the invent of dabs and

1100
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,838
the dab rig it reinvigorated so many

1101
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,039
Industries the Cannabis industry it it

1102
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:03,960
it it it took off like I've never seen

1103
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:06,719
before I remember the first time showing

1104
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,880
Mel Frank a a Cannabis Cup in Los

1105
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,399
Angeles and you know one day they were

1106
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,318
smoking weed the next day they were

1107
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,960
smoking dabs it was just that fast and

1108
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,318
they've got blowtorches and it was just

1109
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,519
like what in the [ __ ] is going on here

1110
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,318
he was just blown away as well as I

1111
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,719
remember in Richmond California walking

1112
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:25,440
through into the cranway Pavilion with

1113
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,838
Mila Johnson the first time she seen the

1114
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,358
whole dab Scene It just blew her mind

1115
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,239
you know what I mean it was just you

1116
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,199
know it was just it was overnight you

1117
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,558
know it just it just just

1118
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:39,279
exploded um

1119
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,760
then uh the but before that I I started

1120
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,319
in um cannabis culture with Dana Larson

1121
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,440
and and Mark Emory I read a small little

1122
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:50,279
quote about somebody making something in

1123
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,760
Canada called butter bu u d d r i later

1124
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,839
learned his name um and spoke with the

1125
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,079
gentleman he was fascinating he uh was

1126
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,078
very kind and and told me everything

1127
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,079
that I answered all my questions and

1128
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,599
told me exactly what he was doing at the

1129
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:09,359
time and basically he was doing a quick

1130
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:13,760
uh um wa alcohol wash and then

1131
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:16,799
collecting the um residual and and um

1132
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,839
evaporating the alcohol and whipping the

1133
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,440
uh final concentrate into something that

1134
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:26,039
he termed butter and it was bright

1135
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,920
colored not dark in color it was

1136
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:30,000
absolutely fascinating

1137
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,680
um and and

1138
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:39,039
so uh combined that uh butter um with

1139
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:42,000
also um a um

1140
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,558
a let's call it open blast article that

1141
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,239
I wrote for High Times was called The

1142
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,480
Art and Science cleaning concentrates

1143
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,199
part one and part two part one was all

1144
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,838
about the quick wash and how to make

1145
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:55,039
butter part two was all about you know

1146
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:58,199
how to do you know I introduced the term

1147
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,519
uh thin layer evaporation winterization

1148
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:02,558
and uh vacuum drying oven to the

1149
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:04,519
industry in that article you know nobody

1150
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,480
was talking about these terms but you

1151
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:08,599
know from from you know they were just

1152
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,760
open blasting but now you take the open

1153
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:14,440
blast you e you add ethanol then you

1154
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,200
wait for the uh butane to dissipate then

1155
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,760
then you're able to now take that put it

1156
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:21,199
in a freezer winterize it solidify any

1157
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,520
of the undesirables the lipids the fats

1158
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,919
the waxes and all that kind of stuff

1159
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,639
then you're able to filter it through a

1160
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,159
coffee filter and get a much cleaner

1161
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:36,039
purified concentrate and so then after

1162
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:38,558
that I seen a ad for a video um that um

1163
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,599
was called medicinal alchemy.com and it

1164
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,720
offered a video and I later was

1165
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,920
introduced met the the person

1166
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:47,279
responsible for it and it was an

1167
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,639
interesting little video and an

1168
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,240
interesting little method but it it it

1169
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:58,639
basically showed you how to take a 2 L

1170
00:46:54,239 --> 00:47:01,239
bottle uh take the top roduce a um uh a

1171
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,440
valve to be able to introduce butane put

1172
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,000
your product in the 2 L plastic bottle

1173
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,200
introduce your butane shake it around

1174
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,599
then then filter that out into a another

1175
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:14,480
vessel glass vessel um and then

1176
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,680
introduce your your ethanol and then

1177
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,240
winterize and then he was spreading it

1178
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,598
out on a glass sheet and and letting it

1179
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,558
slowly evaporate and then scraping it

1180
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,760
with the methodically scraping it with

1181
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:31,119
the razor blade and and coming up with a

1182
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,319
you know a almost clear concentrate what

1183
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,720
fascinated me most was when I heard him

1184
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,920
drop that that piece of concentrate onto

1185
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,279
a glass dish it made a pinging sound

1186
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,079
telling me it was hard like it wasn't

1187
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,480
sticky it wasn't anything like that it

1188
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:48,200
wasn't gooey it was hard like a glass so

1189
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,039
then this video said that it could show

1190
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,318
show you how to make butter and glass

1191
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,039
and shatter and things and so it was

1192
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,119
fascinating to me but you know once I

1193
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,440
got behind the curtain and seen the the

1194
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,599
the rudimentary

1195
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,358
methodologies then it made sense so was

1196
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,359
like oh wait a minute there there's got

1197
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,239
to be ways to scale this up so you know

1198
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:08,838
basically with a Clos Loop then then you

1199
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,078
get into the winterization aspect of it

1200
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:13,639
and then you know um the utilization of

1201
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,960
a uh vacuum drying oven you know instead

1202
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:18,199
of uh drying it on a piece of glass and

1203
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,800
you know then then I taught myself all

1204
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:21,639
these things then I contacted AC cross

1205
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,119
international who made the the vacuum

1206
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:27,078
drying oven and said hey I uh uh you

1207
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,358
know I'm contaminating my oil and things

1208
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,720
are going arai and then and got one of

1209
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,920
their technicians who was about to quit

1210
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:35,199
on the phone and he said oh what you

1211
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,599
want to do is you want to upgrade your

1212
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,519
plumbing you want to do this you want to

1213
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,359
do that blah blah blah blah blah and

1214
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,239
then I said well in your literature

1215
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:44,558
somewhere it mentions this thing you

1216
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,118
know and he was like oh we don't sell

1217
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,960
those and he's like but here's where to

1218
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:50,079
get one you know so you know I went and

1219
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,920
got this apparatus and I attached it to

1220
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:56,200
my vacuum drying oven in between the

1221
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,680
oven and the pump and uh you it would it

1222
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:02,439
would build up with ice and then so when

1223
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:05,798
I tried to because of the moisture um

1224
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:09,519
and so the the residual moisture from

1225
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:11,559
the alcohol left in the the the the

1226
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,000
concentrate from the winterization

1227
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:16,480
process so when I tried to get that out

1228
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,400
um it would contaminate my pump oil so I

1229
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,599
put this uh device in and when I went to

1230
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,559
to drain the device I got hit in the

1231
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,640
face with the smell of tping so very

1232
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,319
very strong and it was like oh wait wait

1233
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,239
wait maybe you don't want to throw that

1234
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,558
away so I started methodically

1235
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:33,959
collecting it over and over and over and

1236
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:37,519
over and over again and then after that

1237
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,159
I put it into the The Ice I let it melt

1238
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,880
and then I put it into graduated

1239
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:45,679
cylinders and so um I was able to with

1240
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,640
the the the graduated cylinders let a

1241
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,480
layer thin layer of essence oil float to

1242
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,838
the top and separate the essence oil

1243
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,199
from the top from the hydrosols and SE

1244
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:59,239
separate the two and so you know um I

1245
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:01,439
basically taught myself how to do um uh

1246
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:02,798
turpine isolation and then it made sense

1247
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,119
that it's like well I could do that with

1248
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:10,400
a fresh frozen flow and capture all the

1249
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:13,798
tpin or or or hops or any other uh plant

1250
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,318
material uh I could uh take that and

1251
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:19,440
collect the Essences that are typically

1252
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:23,880
lost to the drying process or that are

1253
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,760
lost during um the the the recapture of

1254
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,960
the um hydrocarbon in a closed loop

1255
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,480
system and so I I could capture all

1256
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:36,199
those those tpin um and so and you know

1257
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,719
put them in a bottle unlike ever before

1258
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:42,519
and so that that that kind of fascinated

1259
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,919
me right there and then so then you know

1260
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:46,639
looping back in today I just finished an

1261
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,200
article I write for cannabis business

1262
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,598
times and uh somebody wrote a question

1263
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,598
saying that they expected a much larger

1264
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,119
Harvest this year than they have room to

1265
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,318
dry it and so there's you know

1266
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,000
technology and apparatuses that some

1267
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,119
don't know about that are available

1268
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,760
right now like uh something called a

1269
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:07,680
Cyro Mass it's a um liquid nitrogen

1270
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,880
freezes the Cannabis the Cannabis goes

1271
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:15,598
into a uh uh vibrating seeve and the

1272
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,280
seeve separates the resin gland from act

1273
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,440
the active ingredients from the

1274
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,440
undesirable green vegetative material

1275
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,599
call it biomass so it can do this by the

1276
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,240
ton you know what I mean so so it

1277
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,079
eliminates you don't have to dry the

1278
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:30,000
Canabis don't have to cure the Cannabis

1279
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,880
don't have to hand trim the Cannabis

1280
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,838
don't have to have a place to store it

1281
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,480
buy a whole bunch of dehumidifiers or

1282
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,519
any of this stuff or employ the hundred

1283
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,119
people to trim this or anything else you

1284
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:43,639
take the the wet fresh frozen plant

1285
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,400
material and you separate the desirable

1286
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:48,239
material from the undesirable material

1287
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,559
and then after that you put it through a

1288
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:54,639
static apparatus that separates

1289
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:57,798
the uh any kind of particulate that went

1290
00:51:54,639 --> 00:52:01,759
through or any kind of uh

1291
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:04,920
uh triome stocks or immature glands um

1292
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,760
it separates the undesirable resin from

1293
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,280
the desirable resin but it it does so

1294
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:15,319
the desirable resin still has multiple

1295
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,440
sizes so after the the static separation

1296
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:20,558
you'll go back into a vort with multiple

1297
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:25,280
screens and then you can separate by

1298
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:29,640
size and and so then you've got whatever

1299
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:33,119
size desired you know uh triome size

1300
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:38,078
separated that you want so that that

1301
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:40,280
right there is how I believe because now

1302
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:43,359
you've got the the the resin gland in a

1303
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,839
55 gallon drum and that you can press it

1304
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:48,000
into rosin you can do hydrocarbon you

1305
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,279
can do ethanol extract you can use it as

1306
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,079
just an active ingredient and a product

1307
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,760
that you're trying to develop you know

1308
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:58,079
so you know I I I advise like you know

1309
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,599
someone that wants to take down 20 acres

1310
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,480
you know take the the the desirable

1311
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,760
cream of the crop the whatever you

1312
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,159
destined to be hand trimmed as flower

1313
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:12,119
the 10 15% the best of the best the rest

1314
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:15,480
of it should go immediately into uh uh

1315
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:19,079
storage and be it fresh frozen and then

1316
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,679
taken out as needed and and separated uh

1317
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,680
as as active ingredients to to

1318
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,118
manufacture whatever you know from your

1319
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,480
baked goods to your your Vape carts to

1320
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,039
to anything in

1321
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,440
between wow what a what an incredibly

1322
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,838
comprehensive rundown of both the

1323
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,599
progression over the years as well as

1324
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,039
you know that technology I have to admit

1325
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,318
even I haven't heard of that and it

1326
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,519
sounds like it's almost like an

1327
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:46,599
all-in-one automated process in terms of

1328
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:50,199
taking fresh cannabis and ending with

1329
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:52,200
highly refined and segregated sized uh

1330
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:53,598
glands there's so many things we'll have

1331
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:55,679
to touch on I'll have to give you like

1332
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,798
four or five questions but I guess the

1333
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,798
first one is do you foresee that as the

1334
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:01,440
the future of um the production of

1335
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:04,199
concentrates in that you've got this

1336
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,079
process like do you think that type of

1337
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,439
um Machinery will become common place

1338
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,000
and as a quick follow-up what would be

1339
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,358
in your opinion the best use of those

1340
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,400
glands what's your preferred method of

1341
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,039
consuming uh concentrate well it just

1342
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,760
stands the reason that that's the way

1343
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,318
the the industry has to shift because

1344
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,920
already it's flooded you know um the the

1345
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,519
the the retail Market is basically

1346
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,200
flooded um so so know you you you can

1347
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,599
lower your cost of production but

1348
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:35,759
typically that's done at a compromise of

1349
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:38,280
quality this is a way of of of of of

1350
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,160
minimizing cost without compromising

1351
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,839
quality you're taking fresh frozen

1352
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,879
cannabis the best of the best of the

1353
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:48,239
best um uh and and taking those resin

1354
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:51,240
glands off without losing uh Tarpin to

1355
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,519
drying losing tpin to to to hydrocarbon

1356
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:57,279
extractor uh to the Roto Vape or or

1357
00:54:54,519 --> 00:55:00,798
ethanol or you know so you're collecting

1358
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,559
all the the the the best of the best um

1359
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,759
for the lowest cost of production and

1360
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,200
able to pass that on to Consumers um so

1361
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,599
it just stands to reason that that will

1362
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:12,480
be the future um there's there's

1363
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,440
facilities that are you know um multiple

1364
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,838
facilities in in the state of California

1365
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,838
that are over 20 acres and so how do you

1366
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:20,960
take down 20 acres every two weeks you

1367
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,440
know it's impossible to dry it and cure

1368
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,798
it and and and all that other stuff

1369
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,960
especially when in a flooded Market when

1370
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:31,199
nobody really wants the B and C grade so

1371
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,079
you know to take the a grade as flowers

1372
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,399
present your customers with the best of

1373
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,640
the best of the best and all B andc

1374
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,720
grade gets turned into top quality

1375
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:41,920
flowers again you don't lose tpin by

1376
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,038
drying and curing um you know you don't

1377
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,680
have to to pay for those services and

1378
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:49,280
and the equipment that do so so that

1379
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:51,759
that affects your overall cost of

1380
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,039
production so in the end you're able to

1381
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,599
produce Superior Products for a superior

1382
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,000
price and pass those those on to

1383
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,000
Consumers um without compromising

1384
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,920
quality um the second part of your

1385
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,719
question was it was just in terms of

1386
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,920
what's your preferred method of

1387
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:08,078
consumption in regards to say like high

1388
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,680
quality resin heads where would you just

1389
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,559
want to do it as dry Si would you

1390
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,558
convert it to Rosen like what's your

1391
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:15,680
preferred method of

1392
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,839
consumption kind of old school like with

1393
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,279
Rob Clark I really like my favorite is

1394
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,798
just like you know

1395
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:25,000
unadulterated high quality fresh frozen

1396
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:28,639
dry seed um but I do appreciate a really

1397
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,440
nice rosin too um and and I got to admit

1398
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,598
some hydrocarbons are really fascinating

1399
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,639
too they're they're still very flavorful

1400
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:37,119
and I like them very much not too much

1401
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,920
on a distillate um that's kind of like

1402
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,559
uh I'll pass on that I was going to say

1403
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,838
what's your thoughts on the prevalence

1404
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:45,519
of CRC do you think it's going to like

1405
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:49,078
fade away or it's just going to continue

1406
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:51,318
to become more and more um around no no

1407
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:53,000
it produces great ibles you know it's

1408
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:55,838
it's fascinating you know it's it's it's

1409
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,358
a you know distillation CRC all of it is

1410
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:03,318
is great for producing raw ingredients

1411
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:08,038
for uh gummies and the plethora of I

1412
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:10,838
also um consult for an a company called

1413
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:13,400
uh uh deeper they produce a product

1414
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:15,838
called deeper green now you can see more

1415
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,440
about the company on my Instagram page

1416
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,358
that talks about them if you want to

1417
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,798
contact them but uh I I so after you

1418
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:23,598
after you have all the raw ingredients

1419
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:25,719
the cannaboids and the chapines and all

1420
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,720
this stuff separated in the raws form

1421
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:30,598
how do you formulate them right so that

1422
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:32,639
get in got into bioavailability

1423
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:35,559
solubility you know how how do you take

1424
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,440
a distillate and make it water soluble

1425
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:40,119
um you know or how do you make it past

1426
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,838
the brain blood barrier or you know

1427
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:44,358
stuff like that those things fascinate

1428
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,838
me as well so you know then I started

1429
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,038
teaching myself how to formulate

1430
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,400
products and I help formulate a product

1431
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:53,119
called damper green for a believe

1432
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,838
they're called essential Origins uh and

1433
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,720
and so the relevance being is like yes I

1434
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,679
can take a distillate and make it water

1435
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:03,879
soluble and put it into any of the

1436
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:07,279
drinks uh beverage uh but also also they

1437
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:10,318
make a U bioavailable white powder for

1438
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,440
say if you are a outside company and you

1439
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,000
have a chocolate or you have a gummy or

1440
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,240
you have all this whatever um that you

1441
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,239
can buy their product as an active

1442
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,798
ingredient no different than flour sugar

1443
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:25,318
or salt the the relevance being is like

1444
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,038
it's it's measured it's it's it's uh

1445
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,599
it's um

1446
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,559
if if they give

1447
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,480
you

1448
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,079
uh their final product they they can

1449
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,920
give it to you in a form that if you

1450
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,519
require 10 milligrams per unit they can

1451
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,760
tell you exactly how much of their

1452
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:45,798
product will yield that 10 milligram and

1453
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,640
how many pieces you will get so you know

1454
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:49,880
if you say you know I I do a thousand

1455
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,159
pieces at a time they'll tell you

1456
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,880
exactly how much of their product to use

1457
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,399
to to make your thousand that are going

1458
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,960
to be exactly 10 milligrams

1459
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,920
the the with no hotpots or any of that

1460
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,240
kind of stuff the also the relevance

1461
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:06,200
being is it's it's got Superior

1462
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,358
bioavailability be it that um some of

1463
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:10,719
the

1464
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:14,318
microemulsions will not really

1465
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,959
process or or become uh available to

1466
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,920
your system because your only body is

1467
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,119
only capable of processing maybe six to

1468
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:26,639
8 milligrams of a a micro Emulsion as

1469
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:30,079
opposed to this uh um process that you

1470
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:33,318
will get um you will metabolize the the

1471
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:35,480
whole 10 milligrams um which when you're

1472
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:37,838
say in California and you could you're

1473
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:41,199
you're subject to only a 10 milligram

1474
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:43,199
gummy you would prefer to be able to

1475
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,879
metabolize the whole 10 milligrams

1476
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,480
rather than six to eight so it it

1477
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,079
delivers a superior experience but the

1478
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,079
company provides an active ingredient

1479
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,920
you can buy a 55 gallon drum of deeper

1480
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,000
Green from them if and and never grow

1481
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,760
pot extract pot or formulate pot or do

1482
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,079
anything else it's just another active

1483
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,680
ingredients for your product so I see a

1484
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,359
lot of that going to happen especially

1485
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:10,318
with the changes just made to the farm

1486
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:13,239
bill combined with rescheduling you know

1487
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:15,960
will will that allow some of the larger

1488
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:18,159
pharmaceutical companies to start buying

1489
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,159
um active ingredients because again you

1490
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:20,558
know they're not they're they're not

1491
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:21,679
going to compete with the Cannabis

1492
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,680
Market they're going to make true

1493
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:26,318
Pharmaceuticals hopefully um the you

1494
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:29,440
know

1495
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:31,798
don't uh involve inhalation or

1496
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,400
combustion or any of that kind of stuff

1497
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:35,880
so I I believe that just even starting

1498
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,720
on the research that they're they're not

1499
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,240
going to want to grow yeah it certainly

1500
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,959
paves an interesting uh picture of the

1501
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:45,239
future where you can be totally

1502
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,880
uninvolved in the production yet have it

1503
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,798
as a central feature of your product if

1504
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,880
you were say an Edibles company for

1505
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:54,358
example given your you know extensive

1506
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,480
knowledge within tpin I did want to ask

1507
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,078
you because you mentioned you I mean

1508
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,480
we've been talking about concentrates in

1509
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:04,798
general right and dab pens for the Youth

1510
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,760
are all the craze as we know my question

1511
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:09,838
though is a lot of the heads complain

1512
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,359
they're unsatisfied compared to flower

1513
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:14,558
the dab pens don't quite hit the spot my

1514
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,358
question is do you think that it's

1515
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,200
possible for us one day to get to a

1516
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:21,159
point where the uh say addition of the

1517
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,000
correct Turpin and maybe the right

1518
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:26,879
extraction process creates dab pens that

1519
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,400
truly are um you know satisfying to say

1520
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,798
people who prefer flour or do you think

1521
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,000
it'll just always inherently be a

1522
01:01:29,798 --> 01:01:33,038
different

1523
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,440
experience uh I think that's a cause and

1524
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:38,160
effect based on illegality illegality so

1525
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,679
the the the the the the comments that

1526
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:44,118
you're you're referencing from the dab

1527
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,118
pens uh and the

1528
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,440
majority of the dab pens and especially

1529
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,960
the the popular commercial grade ones so

1530
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,960
like um you know like stizzy and those

1531
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,838
sorts of really popular brands that the

1532
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:11,440
youth are very into um don't seem to

1533
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:13,400
quite be uh the same hit the same spot

1534
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,119
yeah no there there there's a like

1535
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,240
anything else you have to look between

1536
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,680
the the the the the products there

1537
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,919
there's Superior Products out there

1538
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:26,798
there's uh both hydrocarbon and um rosin

1539
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,720
pens that are just um delicious

1540
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,880
absolutely delicious that are you know

1541
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,759
they're not distillates they're not

1542
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,278
artificial uh non-cannabis Drive Tarpin

1543
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,359
and Etc and they don't they don't have

1544
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:40,079
glycol or glycerin or any of that kind

1545
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:42,278
of stuff they're not distillates at all

1546
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,839
you know so a lot of those those

1547
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:47,079
unsatisfactory pens that you're talking

1548
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:49,358
about are you know most of them are are

1549
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:51,440
are distillates with with some kind of

1550
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:54,199
artificial flavoring or you know

1551
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,000
something else cutting agents or

1552
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,838
something to lower viscosity there's

1553
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,079
some other you know adulterant in there

1554
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:01,400
as opposed to you know some of the I I

1555
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,880
don't want to give out brand names and

1556
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,240
stuff like that but you know I certainly

1557
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,760
there's there there's a couple pens that

1558
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,719
I certainly like you know what I mean or

1559
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,760
if I you know if you're not satisfied

1560
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:12,919
with one don't buy that one again find

1561
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,960
one that you will or or or or you know

1562
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,278
ask your friends what what ones they

1563
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,798
prefer and what ones they

1564
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:21,440
haven't enjoyed no certainly I've

1565
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:22,679
noticed huge variation in the quality

1566
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,039
and I've had some that have been

1567
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:27,358
incredible so certainly a test to that I

1568
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:28,839
wanted to actually loop back to

1569
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,278
something you mentioned a few answers

1570
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:33,639
ago you know you you you've met a wide

1571
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:35,679
variety of uh how shall we say like

1572
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:37,838
industry movers and shakers over the

1573
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,679
years and you mentioned that photo on

1574
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,798
your Instagram that comes from Sam the

1575
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:43,519
skunkman and I'd love to ask you this

1576
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:45,679
because you've been around long enough

1577
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:49,038
to have a perspective but I feel like

1578
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:51,159
for years um Dave Watson has at times

1579
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:54,599
been painted as a bit of a shady

1580
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:56,480
character but in terms of my analysis I

1581
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,680
think it stands to reason that he's one

1582
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,519
of the biggest players in the overall

1583
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:02,118
modern scene and you could make a strong

1584
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:04,559
argument you know he's certainly up

1585
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,640
there on the rout the Mount Rushmore so

1586
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,079
to speak what's your thoughts on Dave

1587
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,960
Watson what's your interactions with him

1588
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,680
being like he's a very mysterious figure

1589
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,400
it's hard to get much info on him he's a

1590
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:17,919
beautiful man and

1591
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,798
uh I I'll say his name is Sam the

1592
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,480
skunkman or sadu Sam I'm not saying the

1593
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:25,960
other words I'll get in

1594
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:28,920
trouble he he he he is uh yeah he's an

1595
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:31,519
absolute beautiful individual um he he

1596
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,358
is way ahead of his time his

1597
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:38,639
accomplishments uh are are are Head and

1598
01:04:34,358 --> 01:04:41,880
Shoulders uh above many of today um you

1599
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:44,960
know any of the the I I agree with your

1600
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,640
assessment um there there's much to do

1601
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,599
about nothing I've I've met him in

1602
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:53,000
person multiple times I consider him a

1603
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:56,920
friend um he he's never done anything

1604
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,719
malicious that I know of um if if if any

1605
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,760
if half of those things that are said

1606
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:04,318
about him were true that uh Rob Clark

1607
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,079
would not associate or participate with

1608
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,920
him um so you know without getting you

1609
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,440
know a whole lot of backlash going you

1610
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,519
know oh he he created Terminator seeds

1611
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,440
he sold to GW he did this he did that he

1612
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,719
did this he did that you know and you

1613
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,798
know I I don't I don't see any malicious

1614
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:26,679
activity I I I've only seen good things

1615
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:30,000
that David has done you know uh you know

1616
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:32,239
skunk number one help helping preserve

1617
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,400
and bring the haze to light so many

1618
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,278
different things uh you know most people

1619
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,960
aren't even aware of his contributions

1620
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:41,159
you know yeah hugely I can certainly

1621
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,240
attest that the more I've leared over

1622
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:45,399
the years the more and especially like

1623
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:48,038
the stuff that's sort of a bit more hush

1624
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,440
hush on the back end not not for any um

1625
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:52,079
other reason than like you know I

1626
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,760
suspect he's just not looking for more

1627
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,400
praise so to speak but yeah that's

1628
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,680
that's incredible to hear here that um

1629
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,400
that's your experience cuz that's

1630
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,118
obviously you know what my

1631
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,798
interpretation has been and while we're

1632
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,358
on the topic I guess just as a general

1633
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:06,639
question you know you've met an amazing

1634
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:10,199
array of characters throughout your life

1635
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:12,558
any memorable stories or standout

1636
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:15,919
interactions ah dozens you know what I

1637
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:19,119
mean it's like you know uh you know one

1638
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,119
time I seen the movie Blow um I I I I'm

1639
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,680
highly allergic to alkaloids so I don't

1640
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,960
do cocaine or you know or or or

1641
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,838
recommend it or or Advocate it or

1642
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,400
anything like that but when I seen that

1643
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,599
money that that movie that movie really

1644
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,760
tugged on my heartstrings as it did

1645
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:38,039
millions of others you know what I mean

1646
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:41,160
but you know I I uh was fascinated with

1647
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:44,079
the trafficking of the the the material

1648
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:47,358
not really the material in itself so I I

1649
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:50,119
started uh uh back we're talking over 20

1650
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:52,400
years ago now um started um uh

1651
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:54,880
conversing with George Young from the

1652
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,200
movie um you know because he was in

1653
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,400
Northern California

1654
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:01,480
he he likes aircraft I like aircraft uh

1655
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,240
there's a lot of common denominators

1656
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,639
there you know and as he said it could

1657
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:06,679
have been moon rocks you know what I

1658

01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:12,719
from from one point A to point B across

1660
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:15,278
an imaginary line you know so meeting

1661

1662
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:20,318

1692
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,640
that brief interaction so there you go

1693

person he he is he has always been there

1696
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,960

1697
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,880
for Canabis business times or something

1698
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,920
him and Mojave Richmond produced

1699
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,279
Superior wonderful articles for that

1700
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:49,640

absolutely golden yeah that's awesome to

1702
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,359
hear that's awesome to hear I want to go

1703
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,920
back because we we sort of brushed over

1704
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,039
it very early on but there's so much

1705
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,679
history I'm I'm just going to have to

1706
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:59,399
try to take us back and we'll steer

1707
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,480
forward from there but you mentioned

1708
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:04,158
earlier on you know you you had a 60

1709
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:06,639
Minutes segment that featured you and I

1710
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:08,399
actually tried to look up that clip and

1711
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,359
uh I couldn't find it unfortunately so I

1712
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,559
wanted to ask you what were you talking

1713
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,719
about and give us the backstory as to

1714
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,880
how you found yourself in that position

1715
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,319
because I think some people are probably

1716
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,759
not aware of your

1717
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,520
backstory some people over there do do

1718
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,560
do you even get 60 Minutes TV show in

1719
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,679
Australia yeah definitely it's uh I

1720
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,199
think it's probably bigger in Australia

1721
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,000
for the Australian audience the what

1722
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,960
itties in America like it was a real

1723
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:37,359
focal part of Australian journalism for

1724
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:41,119
the past 30 plus years interesting so um

1725
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:45,039
I was arrested in 1993 and one of the uh

1726
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:47,318
the the expert Witnesses I hired to uh

1727
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:50,319
deal with an aspect of my case was Ed

1728
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:53,159
rosenvall so I met Ed rosenville in 1993

1729
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:56,120
under adverse conditions so after I had

1730
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:59,559
dealt with that I immediately I I

1731
01:09:56,119 --> 01:10:02,399
harvested within one year of my date of

1732
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:06,640
arrest so you know I I was not going to

1733
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:10,000
allow them to um win so to speak so uh I

1734
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,679
already had a garden and so um and knew

1735
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,359
Ed and he one day said here come to my

1736
01:10:12,679 --> 01:10:16,399
house and you know they're going to do

1737
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:18,119
this interview and so I was you know

1738
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,639
fascinated wanted to see how interviews

1739
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:22,439
were done and stuff and things so you

1740
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,800
know there was no notable note there was

1741
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:27,039
just producers and cameraman and stuff

1742
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,960
and asking questions and stuff and

1743
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:31,600
things and so that went down then later

1744
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,840
on we went to San Francisco and they did

1745
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,520
the same with Dennis Peron and they

1746
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,039
asked all kinds of questions and stuff

1747
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,840
and things and stuff and it was a

1748
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:41,760
fascinating process and that's all I

1749
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,880
wanted out of it you know and then me

1750
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,119
and Ed were dropping the the producer

1751
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,199
guy off at the airport and he kind of

1752
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:49,719
turned and looked at me and he was like

1753
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:51,238

01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,920
came in and Morley came in he was you

1775
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,119
know kind of like talking to your

1776
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,279
grandpa you know what I mean he was

1777
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,158
really kind and you know he was positive

1778
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:40,079
and believed it should be legalized and

1779
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:41,799
stuff and he was you know pretty cool so

1780
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:43,960
that was kind of a a neat interaction

1781
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:48,039
and I believe you know either either you

1782
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:51,880
can Google Kenneth Marl UH 60 Minutes

1783
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:53,479
interview or triome Technologies uh uh

1784
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,800
60 Minutes interview or something like

1785
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:56,559
that it's up there it's on YouTube

1786
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,320
actually

1787
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,000
the one of the funnier interactions I

1788
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:04,238
had uh was um I got a call from Chris

1789
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,800
simic uh from High Times magazine he

1790
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:09,158
says uh you want to talk to Heraldo

1791
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,800
Rivera I'm like you know what's that

1792
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,079
about he was like I don't know you'd

1793
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,039
have to ask them so I was like all right

1794
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:16,800
I'll entertain the conversation so I'm

1795
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,920
standing in a coffee shop standing in

1796
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,440
line and I get this producer on the

1797
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:23,480
phone he's like look you know uh you we

1798
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:25,879
want to do this TV show and you know

1799
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,198
it's a you know the opening segment

1800
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,159
there they want to stand in front of

1801
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:30,799
this this you know big pot garden and

1802
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:32,719
pretty much tell people this could be in

1803
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,600
your neighborhood in any any

1804
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:37,158
neighborhood you know any house in your

1805
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,840
neighborhood you know and I was like

1806
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:40,198
that's not really a positive light you

1807
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,480
know I mean that's that's that's not

1808
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:43,000
kind of the hysteria I want to be

1809
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:44,399
responsible for bringing on you know

1810
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,520
what I mean you know that sounds like

1811
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,559
you're going to be getting people in

1812
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,800
trouble that way and he was like no no

1813
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:53,520
no no and and then all a sudden like

1814
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,239
uh Heraldo pipes in he's like look if

1815
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,600
it's a security thing you can take me

1816
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:58,198
which I thought was pretty nefarious

1817
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,920
that he was on the phone call and didn't

1818
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:02,559
announce himself you know but he was

1819
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,359
like look you you can you can blindfold

1820
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,520
me you can put me in the trunk and stuff

1821
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:08,719
and you my mind immediately went to like

1822
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,000
wow what a blast that would be to to go

1823
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,679
put Heraldo Rivera in your trunk and and

1824
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,479
drive around town with them and you know

1825
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:16,600
pull up the people and open it up and be

1826
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:19,079
like look I got a Heraldo AR in my trunk

1827
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,600
you know so that was fascinating but you

1828
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:22,119
know in the end I was not going to

1829
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,520
participate in something like that

1830
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:26,158
because you know that again all it was

1831
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,480
going to do was put it in the negative

1832
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:31,198
life sure thing look big ups for for not

1833
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:34,119
participating in it but I agree it would

1834
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:36,238
have been uh certainly a fun story to be

1835
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:37,399
able to just at least do it and know

1836
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:40,158
that um you're not going to get in

1837
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:43,359
trouble so I guess the next question I

1838
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:45,719
wanted to ask you was in your mind what

1839
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:47,839
was the first big break you had in terms

1840
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,239
of getting Community attention you know

1841
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,079
do you was it like when you first

1842
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:52,718
started to appear in magazines when did

1843
01:13:51,079 --> 01:13:56,279
you start to appear on other people's

1844
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:59,359
radar in your own mind

1845
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:01,960
uh so I was arrested

1846
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,920
1993 and then Ed started writing

1847
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,679
articles about me um because I

1848
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,600
immediately went back into you know

1849
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,880
cultivation so you know uh you know

1850
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,400
every once in a while he'd be like hey

1851
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,199
could you try doing this for me like you

1852
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:16,279
know uh try this gibberelic acid and see

1853
01:14:14,198 --> 01:14:17,719
if it makes me flowers and so I do

1854
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:20,039
little experiments here and there and

1855
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:23,198
stuff for him and you know was also a

1856
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:25,760
photo source for him so you know did

1857
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:31,638
that for a couple years and then

1858
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:35,840
um uh there came a time where there was

1859
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:38,560
um you know uh let's say um an

1860
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,000
opportunity just to present my work from

1861
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:45,280
myself so you know I I contacted uh the

1862
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,679
the editor at High Times magazine and

1863
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:50,920
said look you know um you know you

1864
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:54,359
you've featured my work multiple times

1865
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:57,480
and here it is um but at the same time I

1866
01:14:54,359 --> 01:15:01,319
sent him some samples of hash oil and a

1867
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:03,839
whole a whole Christmas uh bag of treats

1868
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:05,279
so uh I knew that he had probably

1869
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,600
received his bag of treats and was

1870
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,399
staring at his bag of treats uh upon my

1871
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,159
phone call so you know he was very very

1872
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:14,039
pleased about the treats but begged me

1873
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:16,719
never to do that again which started a

1874
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:19,560
lifelong friend friendship and at that

1875
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:22,679
time he was uh his name is Chris simic

1876
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,159
he was a editor of High High Times

1877
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:27,239
magazine that that ended up being

1878
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:30,399
editor-in chief of high times before

1879
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:32,718
they uh changed ownership and stuff like

1880
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:36,599
that um but I'm still friends with him

1881
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,439
today etc etc and so you know from there

1882
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,960
you know I said look you I've got a new

1883
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:42,479
project you should come you know shoot

1884
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,719
some photos so you know he came out and

1885
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:48,158
you know it was beyond his expectations

1886
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:52,840
so he quickly scheduled another uh photo

1887
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:55,599
shoot and that brought um uh keny or or

1888
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Andre Gman and they came out with uh

1889
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:01,560
real proper hustle bomb cameras with 4x5

1890
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,360
uh uh negatives and stuff like that and

1891
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,880
so that fascinated me right there being

1892
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:10,158
able to see uh a legitimate photographer

1893
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,000
do really high quality photos and you

1894
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:15,238
know those ended up being Centerfolds

1895
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,719
and covers of from High Times to a lot

1896
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:19,238
of the

1897
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:22,158
also those ended up being covers of a

1898
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:24,158
red ey Magazine from in England or um

1899
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:28,158
also submitted them to burst high in

1900
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:31,399
Japan or some of the uh Centerfolds and

1901
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:33,000
magazine inclusions in Cano in Spain so

1902
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:35,479
it kind of went all over the world you

1903
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,198
know um but also those articles were

1904
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:39,439
pretty revolutionary because you know

1905
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,879
the the the cultivation setups were you

1906
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:43,799
know there was you know that three

1907
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,840
three4 of a million dollar nft systems

1908
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,199
put together you know so you know

1909
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,079
obviously these Gardens weren't just

1910
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:50,399
about making money or profit you know

1911
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:52,158
what I mean it was their their

1912
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,559
legitimate research and development

1913
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:58,000
facilities for breeding you know so

1914
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:00,120
that's that's kind of what it it you

1915
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,560
know took off and ended up being you

1916
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:05,319
know it wasn't for glamour it wasn't for

1917
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:09,239
profit it wasn't for selling products or

1918
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:12,319
hacking products or you know no no no no

1919
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:14,759
disingenuous intent it was it was about

1920
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,079
uh any of the articles I wrote any of

1921
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,079
the things I did I never got paid for I

1922
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:21,158
never got compensated for it wasn't the

1923
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:24,039
purpose the purpose was to disseminate

1924
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:26,039
that information as fast as possible so

1925
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:29,719
the industry could take it grab it and

1926
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:32,279
Rise you know so that that was always my

1927
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:34,198
focus yeah that's incredible and and so

1928
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:36,039
many topics I want to touch on like

1929
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:38,439
first of all you know you wrote for red

1930
01:17:36,039 --> 01:17:41,560
eye and for people who aren't aware this

1931
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:44,359
is truly like one of the most like heady

1932
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:47,520

Nick loved hash his name was Nick

himself he whatever proceeds he got from

1968
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:10,359
the magazine he bought a plane ticket

1969
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:14,399
and he went to Nepal he went to uh

1970
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:16,319
Gambia to sagol to to to you know

1971
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,439
Pakistan he you know went to the

1972
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,639
mountaintops he meant the gangsters that

1973
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:23,319
were making the tons of hash to smuggle

1974
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:26,039
back to England you know it was just

1975
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:30,559
just fascinating the stories he he he

1976
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:34,679
wrote uh a a Side Story uh so

1977
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,159
he back in the day you know a CD uh

1978
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:39,560
music CD there there's when you open the

1979
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:42,119
packet there's a little dead space uh on

1980
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:44,800
the left so to speak uh

1981
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:47,119
so when he went someplace he would take

1982
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,480
a gram and he would put the gram in that

1983
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:52,158
little dead space of a CD and he would

1984
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:54,919
mail that to me separately from the new

1985
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:56,960
magazine so when I got the magazine I

1986
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,920
would also get this CD and I would pull

1987
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,359
out a gram of the hash and I would get

1988
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,679
to read the article and smoke the hash

1989
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:05,359
and take the journey with them so it was

1990
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,800
our our private little thing and it was

1991
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:11,839
very very special to me but until one

1992
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,719
day he goes to to to Nepal and you know

1993
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,079
when you're a hash lover you want you

1994
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:19,119
want to the five cents is kind of sort

1995
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:21,319
of the smell the the flavor the the the

1996
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:22,880
touch the you know so inevitably you

1997
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:24,719
want to put some in your mouth and kind

1998
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,000
of like between your teeth and see how

1999
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,439
sticky it is and if it's got any

2000
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,079
contaminant be it dirt or debris or

2001
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:33,719
whatever you know what I mean so as I'm

2002
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:36,359
getting to the bottom of the article I'm

2003
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:38,960
about to to do the last five last thing

2004
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:41,039
which is put it in my mouth but as I'm

2005
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,600
reading it says oh but when you go to

2006
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:46,319
this region never consume uh the the

2007
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,039
Cannabis edibly because there's a lot of

2008
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:51,279
tuberculosis uh in this region and and

2009
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:54,639
some of the the the pressors utilize

2010
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:56,840
saliva to to to get the the resin uh

2011
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,480
moist and and make it easier to get off

2012
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,360
your hands you know what I mean so you

2013
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,919
know just as I'm about to bite this I'm

2014
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:05,079
I'm I'm I'm figuring out that I'm just

2015
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:08,279
about to give myself tuberculosis so I I

2016
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:10,279
didn't eat the hash but you know uh

2017
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:12,479
great great Journeys we did did that

2018
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:15,000
probably four or five times and and and

2019
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:17,479
it was just an incredible experience I I

2020
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,600
wish every reader of the magazine got a

2021
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:21,599
grandma hashed in their magazine to take

2022
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,239
the journey you know what I mean if in a

2023
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,560
per perfect world but Nick was amazing

2024
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,799
like I said said each I think he he did

2025
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:33,199
22 of the

2026
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:35,719
magazines um I've I've got issue 22 but

2027
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,399
I never read issue 22 it's in my

2028
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:40,119
collection

2029
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:43,039
um because it's very personal to me

2030
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:45,760
because if I read issue 22 it'll mean

2031
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:48,800
that uh that's the the the last issue

2032
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,840
that I'll ever read so maybe even though

2033
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,560
Nick's dead if I don't read the issue

2034
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,719
maybe it's not the last I'll ever read

2035
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,800
kind of sort of thing so I've got I've

2036
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,480
the last issue I've got all the issues

2037
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,960
but I've never personally opened or read

2038
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:03,799
number 22 but it was great because I got

2039
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,480
to bring again George Young from the

2040
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,000

2041
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:10,759
people don't understand is like you know

2042
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,520

mean yeah look that sounds truly epic

2066
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:17,279
and quickly while we're on the topic you

2067
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:18,960
mentioned that you're involved in burst

2068
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,399
High you know the Japanese cannabis

2069
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,239
magazine that's a really cool and quite

2070
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:26,439
a niche one how did you get involved in

2071
01:23:23,238 --> 01:23:26,439
the Japanese cannabis

2072
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:32,679
as I said uh I had a worker that was

2073
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:35,158
Japanese so he spoke fluent Japanese um

2074
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:37,440
and so I could converse with them that

2075
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:40,638
way and so once I learned that they

2076
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:43,638
existed I asked him to contact them and

2077
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:47,039
um provided them like with a whole photo

2078
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:49,520
library I knew that they were you know

2079
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:52,119
probably in a basement somewhere didn't

2080
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,920
have funding you know in a in a highly

2081
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:57,800
illegal situation so to dump a bunch of

2082
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:59,639
free content on them was was you know I

2083
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,239
I I felt the appropriate thing to do

2084
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:04,039
which ended up you know they printed

2085
01:24:01,238 --> 01:24:06,799
them as copies of uh you

2086
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,760
know Centerfolds and covers and stuff

2087
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,719
and we took all kinds of Japanese toys

2088
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,239

2089
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,000

2090
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:17,238
blast that's really cool do you know how

2091
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
much about the active scene is still

2092
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:21,319
alive today because I mean a lot of the

2093
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,600
world what I've noticed a lot of the

2094
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:26,559
world is online like you can even find

2095
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:29,239
like you know um a handful of like

2096
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,800
Afghan proper land race farmers who are

2097
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:32,559
on Instagram just doing their thing you

2098
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,760
know but I have yet to really come

2099
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,080
across anyone in um Japan or the Asia

2100
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,039
scene obviously probably implications

2101
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:41,039
about the penalties do you know is it

2102
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:45,238
still pretty active over

2103
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:46,600
there uh no that magazine doesn't exist

2104
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:49,759
and you know there there's some

2105
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:53,119
incredible glass blowers and dabri uh

2106
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,719
producers that are Japanese um that you

2107
01:24:53,118 --> 01:25:00,399
know rose rose and and and you know just

2108
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:02,560
some not fluid in in the the the glass

2109
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:05,039
Community but I've seen their work and

2110
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,840
they're absolutely incredible but you

2111
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,399
know they you know they have nothing to

2112
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,360
put in their pipe kind of sort of thing

2113
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:13,599
so you know it's you know besides the

2114
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,279
you know the Thailand situation who

2115
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,840
would have predicted that that's kind of

2116
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,238
an interesting thing but apparently now

2117
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,279
they're trying to put that gen back in

2118
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:25,000
the bottle and and go back to uh uh

2119
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:26,759
medical and not recreational which is I

2120
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
don't think is going to be possible but

2121
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,960
you know they could do you know

2122
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,679
something Draconian like in the

2123
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:37,079
Philippines and you know say you

2124
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:39,880
know uh recreational drug use is

2125
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:41,880
a crime punishable by that you know what

2126
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,000
I mean the Indonesia style who knows

2127
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:47,359
what the what what what could happen but

2128
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,840
you know but yeah so that's a an unusual

2129
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:50,559
thing I never would have seen Thailand

2130
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,360
do that which I think is pretty

2131
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,600
Progressive and I wish they would just

2132
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:58,439
leave it the way it is it seem to be

2133
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:00,199
working in fantastic fashion yeah it

2134
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:02,759
certainly remains to be seen what's

2135
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:04,439
going to happen over there in Thailand

2136
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,920
but I you know I I think I think the

2137
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:07,039
world worldwide the Genie's out of the

2138
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,560
model you know what I mean when you

2139
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:10,920
start talking about rescheduling in the

2140
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,320
United States mo mo most times you know

2141
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,760
with treaties and stuff it was the

2142
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,599
United States putting pressure on

2143
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:20,199
Lebanon to stop hash production or you

2144
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:22,639
know uh you know India or or you know

2145
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:26,919
any of the other you know hash producing

2146
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:29,639
countries in the 70s you know stomped

2147
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,600
production based on you know pressure

2148
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:33,159
from the United States so when the

2149
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,520
United States stops pressuring those

2150
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:39,599
foreign countries and you know you see

2151
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:42,520
you know slight change Germany legal

2152
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,320
legalizing and you know you know I think

2153
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:46,320
the world is going to progress and I

2154
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:48,158
think I think very quickly cannabis is

2155
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,799
going to be the least of the world's

2156
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:53,920
problems yeah I I certainly hope so that

2157
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,760
would be a beautiful future for sure I

2158
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,520
want to quickly loop back before I lose

2159
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,600
my train of thought to uh High Times for

2160
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,280
a moment because you're famous for

2161
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:05,480
having been chosen as having had the

2162
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:08,000
best grow room in 25 years history of

2163
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:11,000
the magazine can you describe the setup

2164
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,679
that won that for you and uh maybe just

2165
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,920
give us a few little pointers about how

2166
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,319
people might be able to improve their

2167
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:20,440
home setup in the context of you know

2168
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:23,238
you are a Titan according to High

2169
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:25,000
Times uh yeah bless up to Danny Denko

2170
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,839
for writing that article and giving me

2171
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,479
him and Chris cinic for giving me that

2172
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,480
title and credit that's very kind to

2173
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:35,479
them but you know I think there was you

2174
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:37,879
know many bests but um you

2175
01:27:35,479 --> 01:27:39,359
know in a nutshell like I said it was it

2176
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,118
was never about profit it was about

2177
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:44,399
research and development so you know um

2178
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:47,479
you know filling pots with dirt to to

2179
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:50,599
grow indoors and urban settings got to

2180
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:54,599
be problematic but also it got to be it

2181
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:57,920
seemed like environmental wasteful so

2182
01:27:54,600 --> 01:28:00,520
you know the to to to migrate to a a 3in

2183
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:04,359
rock wo cube in an nft system seemed

2184
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:06,440
like a a logical thing to do um maybe I

2185
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:11,319
wouldn't do that today because of a

2186
01:28:06,439 --> 01:28:14,319
legality I wouldn't have to um maximize

2187
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:18,158
every aspect of of of the production you

2188
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:21,519
know um maybe uh I I would have them

2189
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:25,879
spaced a little bit farther etc etc etc

2190
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:28,880
but in that we we we you know spent the

2191
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:31,840
company spent 3/4 of a million dollars

2192
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:34,118
to develop the nft systems that were a

2193
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:38,039
drip from the top but also allowed again

2194
01:28:34,118 --> 01:28:40,719
for a handw waterer uh uh augmentation

2195
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:42,880
um but you know it would drain we run

2196
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:45,520
the waste we didn't recycle because of

2197
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,520
uh contamination and and you know

2198
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,239
pythium and all kinds of disease and

2199
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,080
stuff and you know to sterilize we

2200
01:28:49,238 --> 01:28:53,439
didn't have the ability to sterilize

2201
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:55,118
reuse capture 15,000 gallons of water

2202
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:57,599
and reuse every day back and forth back

2203
01:28:55,118 --> 01:28:59,960
and forth so you know but to develop

2204
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,480
that system and and literally have a

2205
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:05,840
plank go from a 1-in clone into a 3 and

2206
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:07,519
1 half inch rockle Cube and finish its

2207
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,000
life in a three and 1 half inch rockle

2208
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,719
cube with a 4 to six inch plant but then

2209
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,800
at the end of harvest I could take you

2210
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:17,800
know uh what was it 400 and something

2211
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:20,079
3inch Rock hoal cubes squeeze the water

2212
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:23,719
out and walk out of my facility with a

2213
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:25,880
with a all of my medium waste medium and

2214
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:28,118
and and a garbage bag over my shoulder

2215
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:32,679
you know as opposed to getting rid of

2216
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:35,639
you know 400 dirt pots and root balls

2217
01:29:32,679 --> 01:29:38,239
and all this other stuff uh again just

2218
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:40,920
wasn't conducive to a Urban

2219
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:44,158
situation so you know a lot of things

2220
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:47,480
were were necessity by not by Design but

2221
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:49,479
by default you know sure and what are

2222
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:51,759
some general pointers you might be able

2223
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:54,439
to give to people in terms of like

2224
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,880
common issues or aspects that you feel

2225
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:58,479
people maybe Overlook or aren't paying

2226
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,118
enough attention to that would help

2227
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:03,599
Elevate their their

2228
01:30:01,118 --> 01:30:05,799
game well moving forward and stuff in

2229
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,880
today's you know Brave New World you

2230
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:11,960
know if if if I only would have known um

2231
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:14,719
then would I know now uh be it uh the

2232
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,840
potential for for virus uh transmission

2233
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:20,198
into the cannabis plants and the

2234
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:22,279
proliferation of hop Laden vroid disease

2235
01:30:20,198 --> 01:30:25,479
um I can't say enough about keeping

2236
01:30:22,279 --> 01:30:29,158
mothers sterile and clean with UV light

2237
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:32,559
um to eliminate the possibility of of of

2238
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:34,719
of hop Laden vroid disease transmission

2239
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,960
to a clone from one generation to

2240
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:40,118
another I started noticing this uh over

2241
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,679
15 years ago I started noticing I was

2242
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:44,039
hired by by an individual that said that

2243
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:45,560
they thought they had a virus and a

2244
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:49,079
problem and stuff and they would like me

2245
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:53,199
to prove or disprove and so there was no

2246
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:57,559
way to get um anything analyzed back

2247
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:59,319
then you know uh you know it just wasn't

2248
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,360
possible there was no legal Labs there

2249
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:05,238
no legal Avenue um so you know I put the

2250
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:07,039
garden together ran it you know uh very

2251
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:10,079
quickly it went sideways but it was like

2252
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:13,760
there was no way to confirm what it was

2253
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:16,880
but then once I started Consulting Once

2254
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,800
Denver went legal I had seen symptoms

2255
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,039
and signs at multiple locations

2256
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,600
throughout California but once I started

2257
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:26,118
going to other states I started knowing

2258
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:29,719
Sim similarities of of of cooking and

2259
01:31:26,118 --> 01:31:31,880
curling up leaves and yellow streaks and

2260
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:35,800
the plants you know stopped producing

2261
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:38,520
you know uh resin uh or or Aroma and you

2262
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:40,719
know resin content was garbage yield was

2263
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,440
garbage you know but there was no you

2264
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,480
know you look back at you know good

2265
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:45,319
quality records keeping and you know

2266
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:48,919
three

2267
01:31:45,319 --> 01:31:51,840
four previous uh uh Generations or

2268
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:54,118
harvest you know same food same

2269
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:58,079
environment same everything but there so

2270
01:31:54,118 --> 01:32:00,479
so no rhyme nor reason for it so I

2271
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:03,519
moving forward I think you know I can't

2272
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:07,359
say enough about you know

2273
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:09,480
um utilizing sterile genetics meaning

2274
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:11,839
going to a quality source to get your

2275
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:14,000
clones that will give you a report that

2276
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,600
says that your genetics do not have hot

2277
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,399
Laden thyroid disease um because if it

2278
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:20,000
does then you're

2279
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:22,799
just

2280
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,039
spreading the the disease but but also

2281
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,760
just causing yourself problem s so you

2282
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:29,719
know um but if you're utilizing mothers

2283
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,679
to produce your own clones it's in your

2284
01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:34,079
best interest to keep those clone or

2285
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,480
those mothers as clean as possible so so

2286
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:40,920
you don't end up

2287
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:43,559
proliferating a vroid and and and so

2288
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,158
that brings me back to uh Sam the skunk

2289
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:48,159
man or sadu Sam you know he he pointed

2290
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:50,960
out to me because you know his work at

2291
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:52,839
HOA farm and his association with GW

2292
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,198
Pharmaceuticals afforded him the luxury

2293
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:58,000
of identifying

2294
01:32:55,198 --> 01:33:00,879
many different viruses that cannabis is

2295
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,639
susceptible to as well as you know Rob's

2296
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:08,440
work with uh cannabis ethnobotany etc

2297
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:11,239
etc I I can't I can't stress enough the

2298
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:14,559
the importance of some of of of the new

2299
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:19,279
generations you know buy a book buy buy

2300
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,719
Rob CL Clark's marijuana botney uh it

2301
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:22,559
there's still stuff in that book that I

2302
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,960
don't understand today you know what I

2303
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:29,280
mean it was it was his thesis in college

2304
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:32,520
it it was an amazing work um you know as

2305
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:35,000
well as uh you know his book hashish um

2306
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:40,199
that that book just changed my world you

2307
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:41,880
know to to to to to tell me certain it

2308
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:44,079
answered so many questions you know

2309
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:46,118
because uh you know Rob Trav traveled

2310
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:48,639
the world and and in the end I was

2311
01:33:46,118 --> 01:33:51,118
afforded the luxury of being uh included

2312
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:53,440
in his second revised Edition for the

2313
01:33:51,118 --> 01:33:56,039
article that I previously mentioned that

2314
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:59,799
I co-authored and wrote with Mel Frank

2315
01:33:56,039 --> 01:34:02,880
about water separation you know uh so I

2316
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,800
was lucky to be included in Rob's book

2317
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,079
but that that book hashish is absolutely

2318
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,119
incredible I you know it deserves to be

2319
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:12,359
on everybody's shelf as well as as uh

2320
01:34:10,118 --> 01:34:14,599
you know hemp Pest and disease as well

2321
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:16,158
as ethnobotany like every every

2322
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:19,320
everything he's ever touched everything

2323
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:22,759
he's written is is is just beyond

2324
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:24,359
Priceless um and and that gets into the

2325
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:27,719
viruses and and

2326
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:29,799
as Sam the skunkman pointed out that

2327
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:31,719
there's multiple viruses that that

2328
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:34,360
cannabis is susceptible to I read a

2329
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:38,079
report that the relevance being that

2330
01:34:34,359 --> 01:34:41,000
that 90% of of the the Cannabis in

2331
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,760
California it could be polluted with

2332
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,279
that virus which

2333
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:48,360
is

2334
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:49,319
uh a billion dollar at least a billion

2335
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:51,679
dollar

2336
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:54,238
catastrophe especially when you consider

2337
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,199
that once a legal another legal Market

2338
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:57,919
opens

2339
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:59,839
up in whatever state in the United

2340
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:03,118
States people want the newest latest

2341
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:06,920
hottest trendiest cultivars um which

2342
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:10,920
typically um come from existing um

2343
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:13,399
markets so those genetics are going to

2344
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:16,679
migrate from existing markets to the new

2345
01:35:13,399 --> 01:35:18,759
markets and the potential of the those

2346
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:22,199
genetics from

2347
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:24,639
the Old Market to the New Market of

2348
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:26,839
being polluted with the virus is very

2349
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:28,960
high it's so interesting that you

2350
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:32,079
mention that because just last week

2351
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:35,039
there was uh a lot of scuttlebug and

2352
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:37,319
articles coming out about how uh some

2353
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,760
plants in the relatively newly

2354
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:41,599
established Australian medical scene uh

2355
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:44,400
plants in those facilities had tested

2356
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,239
positive for a hopl and virus which is

2357
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:48,719
interesting because most of the

2358
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:50,039
facilities are working with seed um but

2359
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,760
there are still a few that have brought

2360
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:55,319
over some clones so it's certainly doing

2361
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:57,079
exactly what you just said so we'll have

2362
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:59,559
to you know hope we're able to get on

2363
01:35:57,079 --> 01:36:01,158
top of this virus just to clarify but

2364
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:03,560
but but the virus is transmittable from

2365
01:36:01,158 --> 01:36:05,559
a mother to a seed so it doesn't matter

2366
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:08,440
if the Clones were the source or the

2367
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:11,440
seed was the source yeah you know uh

2368
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:13,359
infected mothers produce infected seed

2369
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,479
yes certainly certainly I just wanted to

2370
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:17,599
loop back one last time to wrap up on

2371
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:19,799
the old high times because you've you've

2372
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,400
had so many um you know articles being

2373
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:24,400
featured about you and I wanted to ask

2374
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,719
what's your thoughts on high these days

2375
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:28,599
because it was just a week or two ago

2376
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,880
the news came out sadly that they've put

2377
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:32,039
out the announcement that they're going

2378
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:34,118
into receivership indicating that their

2379
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:36,198
their finances are maybe not once what

2380
01:36:34,118 --> 01:36:37,118
they were where do you think High Times

2381
01:36:36,198 --> 01:36:41,039
went

2382
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:43,679
wrong um it's hard to roll with progress

2383
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:49,679
in the in the industry I I I know the

2384
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:52,639
old guard and um you know uh every print

2385
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:54,880
magazine is having troubles you know the

2386
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,880
new generation you know isn't drinking

2387
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:59,679
alcohol and they're not reading

2388
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:04,800
magazines you know so hard hard to to

2389
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:07,079
to uh exist in that um Arena but also

2390
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,840
like in you know red eyee the demise of

2391
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:12,158
red eye was the the demise of the

2392
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:16,159
advertiser you know um with a downturn

2393
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:19,079
in economies uh advertisers stop paying

2394
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:21,920
their bills and stop as uh advertising

2395
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:23,719
and and periodicals or or what have you

2396
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,960
and so that's what you know that's how

2397
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:30,279
they pay their bills and that's how they

2398
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:33,359
drive it so um you know I was you know

2399
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:35,279
privileged to to to to you know know

2400
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:37,719
Michael Kennedy the owner of high times

2401
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:42,039
as well as again multiple staff members

2402
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:46,319
from the old guard and you know um you

2403
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:48,000
know when it sold to the new owners um I

2404
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:52,000
believe that

2405
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:55,439
that what the new owners bought was uh a

2406
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,760
name was a brand and was was was a hard

2407
01:37:55,439 --> 01:38:01,158
drive with with uh 200 million or I mean

2408
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,560
with 2 million followers or or or

2409
01:38:01,158 --> 01:38:05,319
whatever you know what I mean whatever

2410
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:10,400
their social Med media presence was you

2411
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:13,920
know um you know the brand just didn't

2412
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:16,198
didn't didn't progress it didn't carry

2413
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,279
the the weight the the the the

2414
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:20,399
merchandise wasn't you know going to

2415
01:38:18,279 --> 01:38:23,800
going to carry it through

2416
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:26,279
the you know it just it it just it

2417
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:30,800
reached it reached the end you know and

2418
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:34,399
so you know sad because because I was a

2419
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:38,279
you know from from from a you know 12

2420
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:42,479
and 13 year old child a a consumer of

2421
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:44,679
the magazine let's say you know um I it

2422
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:47,959
taught me a lot and and they allowed me

2423
01:38:44,679 --> 01:38:53,039
to parti participate and

2424
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:55,800
I from what their archives has has shown

2425
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:59,118
as as on my Instagram page my

2426
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,800
contributions are as an independent uh

2427
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:03,439
contributor to the magazine uh was

2428
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,159
probably the number one contributor to

2429
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:07,960
that magazine in the history of the

2430
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:10,198
magazine so I lament the loss but but

2431
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:13,359
but you know I it doesn't surprise me

2432
01:39:10,198 --> 01:39:15,279
its progress you know yeah look all good

2433
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:16,880
things must come to an end and and I

2434
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:19,000
think an aspect of it certainly has to

2435
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,520
be attributed to the uh changing

2436
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,840
landscape of the way people are

2437
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:24,599
consuming informations and you know

2438
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:27,440
Instagram certainly seems to be the more

2439
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:29,440
prevalent than magazines these days but

2440
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:31,158
I wanted to talk about you as a breeder

2441
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:33,039
it's sort of surprising it hasn't come

2442
01:39:31,158 --> 01:39:35,079
up already but we've got a lot of stuff

2443
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:36,399
on it so I guess the first thing I

2444
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:38,118
wanted to say was that you know there's

2445
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:40,238
a number of strains that have been

2446
01:39:38,118 --> 01:39:42,359
associated with you but the one that

2447
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:44,319
comes up the most consistently has to be

2448
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:46,158
you know the Purple Kush and

2449
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:48,559
specifically your one that's known as

2450
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:51,000
the ultraviolet I've seen this cut

2451
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:53,599
talked about on the forums for years I

2452
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,118
know a few breeders who use it first of

2453
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:56,679
all give us a bit of a backstory where

2454
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:58,439
does this cut come from what's the

2455
01:39:56,679 --> 01:40:00,960
Genesis story on

2456
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:02,839
it well living in Northern California

2457
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,760
one of my best friends from high school

2458
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:07,599
who I'm still friends with today had an

2459
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:12,679
uncle and an aunt that were in Redway

2460
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:16,159
California um in Humble County and so we

2461
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:18,719
from ninth grade on uh after I started

2462
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:20,679
trafficking for the other uh with the

2463
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:23,399
other friend I started trafficking with

2464
01:40:20,679 --> 01:40:24,800
this friend and so every week we'd go up

2465
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:27,279
and back up and back and bring you know

2466
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:31,880
15 to 30 pounds of outdoor Northern

2467
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:34,519
California bud and they you know since

2468
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,920
there was so so much of it being

2469
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:39,040
produced Outdoors it wasn't um unheard

2470
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:41,960
of to get common bag seeds here and

2471
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:43,840
there as well as you know um you know

2472
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:45,760
they would have uh on Black's Beach

2473
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:48,960
there would be Fourth of July parties

2474
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,719
and you know fireworks etc etc and and

2475
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,079
there was you know trading up seeds

2476
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:55,639
there and so I was afforded the luxury

2477
01:40:53,079 --> 01:40:58,519
of being part of this community as you

2478
01:40:55,639 --> 01:41:01,800
know a fairly young man um with my

2479
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:03,880
friend and his family um and so I would

2480
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:07,639
collect everything that I possibly could

2481
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:10,239
and so uh you know inevitably I ended up

2482
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:13,480
getting a just a basically a purple

2483
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:14,598
Afghani and a pure Afghani but they they

2484
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:16,279
more

2485
01:41:14,599 --> 01:41:18,920
were you

2486
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:21,000
know let's let let's Callin had had

2487
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,960
string stringy traits to them and stuff

2488
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,599
they weren't like short Squat and

2489
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:29,399
so you know and and you know the the the

2490
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:31,840
color was fairly inconsistent so I I I

2491
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:34,479
took the two I bred the two but then

2492
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,599
after that I started reproducing them so

2493
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:39,359
I could pheno hunt pheno hunt pheno hunt

2494
01:41:36,599 --> 01:41:41,639
feno hunt and and in search of the the

2495
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:44,039
darker color the darker color the darker

2496
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:47,118
color you know had no idea what anthos

2497
01:41:44,039 --> 01:41:50,118
cyanin was uh didn't know why I was

2498
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:52,399
doing what I was doing but but besides

2499
01:41:50,118 --> 01:41:55,238
the purple color it it had this great

2500
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:58,799
Kool-Aid flavor and and and you know it

2501
01:41:55,238 --> 01:42:02,799
was only like a 16% THC but it was you

2502
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:06,560
know to me it was a a beautiful midday

2503
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,719
uh cultivar um so you know but also

2504
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,400
since I'm working with High Times the

2505
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,800
they started shooting lots of photos of

2506
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:14,679
it and and because it was unusual they

2507
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,520
started featuring it on their covers and

2508
01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:18,760
Centerfolds and and throughout the

2509
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:21,280
Articles and stuff and so then it

2510
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:23,960
started you know taking hold then um

2511
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:27,759
Berkeley Patients Group uh dispensary

2512
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:31,000
and uh a Blue Sky Coffee shop or or

2513
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:34,000
SR71 um Richard Lee and a friend of mine

2514
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,599
work there asked if he could uh

2515
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,439
distribute it through there um I kind of

2516
01:42:36,599 --> 01:42:40,079
wanted to see what it what one of my

2517
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:41,598
Cult of Arts would do on the o Open

2518
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:44,399
Market because I really didn't sell

2519
01:42:41,599 --> 01:42:45,840
things or or or have a seed company or

2520
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:48,479
anything like that so just out of

2521
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,960
curiosity you know I I I released it

2522
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:53,399
through both of those dispensaries um

2523
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:56,079
and it kind of exploded you know um so

2524
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:58,598
much so that you know it was at a time

2525
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:00,559
where you know um URL and Granddaddy

2526
01:42:58,599 --> 01:43:02,199
Purple started coming out and some

2527
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:05,480
friends of mine were running a club in

2528
01:43:02,198 --> 01:43:07,598
Hayward called CCAC or CCDC um they

2529
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:09,399
ended up getting shut down by the feds

2530
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:12,560
because I was Consulting for them and

2531
01:43:09,399 --> 01:43:14,679
stuff um they they it's when

2532
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,239
dispensaries were few and far between

2533
01:43:14,679 --> 01:43:19,000
and they were one of the few in the East

2534
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:21,519
Bay and then the year they got arrested

2535
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:25,158
they ended up doing 53 million in sales

2536
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:28,040
in 52 weeks they one of the first to pay

2537
01:43:25,158 --> 01:43:30,960
State uh sales taxs and when the feds

2538
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:33,198
figured out uh what they were doing um

2539
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:36,520
they pretty much came after him and and

2540
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:39,158
you know G gave each brother that was

2541
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:43,080
running it you know well over 60

2542
01:43:39,158 --> 01:43:47,598
felonies um but you know

2543
01:43:43,079 --> 01:43:49,279
uh sorry why did I go into that um oh uh

2544
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:52,719
uh so so you know once they started

2545
01:43:49,279 --> 01:43:53,639
running their dispensary um you started

2546
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,439
noticing

2547
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:58,440
um you know okay purple's trendy um you

2548
01:43:56,439 --> 01:44:01,479
know but you know one day I was in there

2549
01:43:58,439 --> 01:44:03,039
and and their buyer walked into their

2550
01:44:01,479 --> 01:44:05,118
their buying room with the wet paper

2551
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:07,479
towel and I was like what's with the wet

2552
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:12,639
paper towel he was like we're starting

2553
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:16,000
to get people rolling their pot in dye

2554
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:17,599
um so we've got to roll the pot in a wet

2555
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,560
paper towel to see if the Dy comes off

2556
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:21,960
and if so then we don't buy the pot and

2557
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:24,520
I'm like wow that's that's how much the

2558
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:26,439
the purple has in influen the market and

2559
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:28,960
and that's when I first started noticing

2560
01:44:26,439 --> 01:44:32,598
that like oh no this is this is going to

2561
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:35,480
be problematic um you know ultimately

2562
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:37,400
answer your question um so so you know a

2563
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:39,439
purple afghan and a pure Afghani you

2564
01:44:37,399 --> 01:44:41,158
know called it purple kush but pretty

2565
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,638
pretty soon it BEC so popularized that

2566
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:45,079
people started bootlegging the name so I

2567
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:47,319
had to change the name to ultraviolet um

2568
01:44:45,079 --> 01:44:49,920
and and hence they're the same cultivar

2569
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:53,519
I just changed that name

2570
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:56,760
um um and the problematic part was I I

2571
01:44:53,520 --> 01:45:00,199
started seeing how Trend driven the IND

2572
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:02,840
industry was going to become and and so

2573
01:45:00,198 --> 01:45:05,319
the one day the the the purple was was

2574
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:07,520
was very hot and the most desirable once

2575
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:09,639
the market got flooded with purple then

2576
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,280
everybody started going to Kush the LA

2577
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:15,840
Kush the the then then Kush was on it

2578
01:45:12,279 --> 01:45:18,399
was kush everything and and the the more

2579
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:20,880
popular it became the less popular some

2580
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:24,039
of those lad races and those old school

2581
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,039
cultivars became and desirable those

2582
01:45:24,039 --> 01:45:28,479
became because they weren't marketable

2583
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:31,479
because the the the market wanted the

2584
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:36,158
Kush so it's it's interesting how you

2585
01:45:31,479 --> 01:45:39,279
know I started noticing let's call it um

2586
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:41,638
species Extinction driven by Trend you

2587
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:43,279
know what I mean um there you know there

2588
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:45,279
there there's C of ours out there you

2589
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:48,158
know the found on the side of the road

2590
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:51,118
Dead Skunk that everybody romanticizes

2591
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:55,479
about everybody laments the loss of that

2592
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:58,319
that I do too it did like a skunk not a

2593
01:45:55,479 --> 01:46:01,238
a skunk that was just sprayed but a

2594
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:03,479
3-day old side of the road Dead Skunk

2595
01:46:01,238 --> 01:46:06,959
which was you know to me a beautiful

2596
01:46:03,479 --> 01:46:08,638
smell you know I love the smell and and

2597
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,639
you know to me that brings me back to

2598
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,560
1983 School Bus everybody rolling joints

2599
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:16,079
on the way to school you know the whole

2600
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:19,199
damn thing smelled like a skunk that c

2601
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:22,679
bar is gone you know uh and you know I I

2602
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:26,039
I I blame trends for that you know um

2603
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:30,079
now it's all candy flavors and gelato

2604
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:33,920
and da d da you know so it's interesting

2605
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:37,800
to see the the es and flows of popular

2606
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:40,440
cultivars but the the the purple um i'

2607
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:42,880
I've still got um a small amount of

2608
01:46:40,439 --> 01:46:46,879
seeds um right now trying

2609
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:50,039
to uh raise Capital to put together uh a

2610
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:52,239
seed company because me and my friends

2611
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:53,639
lament the loss of multiple cultivars

2612
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,198
that I used to have

2613
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:59,279
and so we're trying to put something

2614
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:00,598
together so I can restart those so just

2615
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:03,000
just so we could have those flavors

2616
01:47:00,599 --> 01:47:06,159
again not really for

2617
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,880
um marketability or not for profit or

2618
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:09,759
something like that but you know the the

2619
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:13,279
main focus is just because we we want

2620
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:17,199
that again we're we're kind of tired of

2621
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:18,639
today's availability so to speak yeah

2622
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:21,678
certainly look that that would be cool

2623
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:23,880
to see that get off the ground my um my

2624
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:26,760
my immediate follow-up question would be

2625
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:29,639
so are you saying that the uh your your

2626
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:32,760
purple cush is in fact the Blue Sky

2627
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:34,520
SR71 Purple Kush and correct but but you

2628
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,800
know again if you go to my Instagram

2629
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:39,440
account you can see an SR71 catalog that

2630
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,480
says exactly that you know what I mean

2631
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,638
that it's from triome Technologies da d

2632
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:47,079
d so you know it's not a secret that

2633
01:47:43,639 --> 01:47:49,319
that that they're uh ultraviolet slurple

2634
01:47:47,079 --> 01:47:51,599
Co came from triome Technologies they've

2635
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:53,840
admitted that for many many years sure

2636
01:47:51,599 --> 01:47:55,599
sure there's lots of stuff on the

2637
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,199
internet but it's all wild speculation

2638
01:47:55,599 --> 01:48:01,279
and people saying you know uh you know

2639
01:47:58,198 --> 01:48:03,238
the G13 was a cavar that was uh grown by

2640
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:05,000
the government that you know someone

2641
01:48:03,238 --> 01:48:06,638
liberated and all this other stuff and

2642
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,560
it's like that's hogwash you know what I

2643
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:11,560
mean uh you know I'm someone one of the

2644
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:13,039
rare individuals you meet that has read

2645
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:14,679
something called the rips papers and

2646
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:17,158
it's like rips papers what the hell is

2647
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:19,199
that and it's like so it's the Research

2648
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:21,238
Institute of pharmaceutical Sciences

2649
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:23,158
papers it comes from the University of

2650
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:25,238
Mississippi it comes from the University

2651
01:48:23,158 --> 01:48:28,079
of Mississippi's cannabis cultivation

2652
01:48:25,238 --> 01:48:31,319
program because it's a

2653
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:36,559
a public

2654
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:41,158
uh a a public paid for uh subsidiary or

2655
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:43,840
company or college um and and the data

2656
01:48:41,158 --> 01:48:45,879
that was comes out of University of

2657
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,159
Mississippi and the grants everything

2658
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,319
associated with they they were forced to

2659
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:53,359
put a bibliography together each and

2660
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:55,279
every year so if you again go to my

2661
01:48:53,359 --> 01:48:58,238
Instagram page you can see both the

2662
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:00,800
catalog from SR71 but you can also in

2663
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:02,158
one of my posts see some of these books

2664
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,320
from the Research Institute of

2665
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:06,359
pharmaceutical sciences and so every

2666
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,439
year that they did research they had to

2667
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:10,479
document their research that they did

2668
01:49:08,439 --> 01:49:13,559
regarding cannabis each and every year

2669
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:16,279
so there's like 25 volumes starting in

2670
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:18,080
like 1982 or something like that that

2671
01:49:16,279 --> 01:49:22,039
started with like you know stapled

2672
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:26,679
together hand hand uh uh assembled

2673
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:29,519
little leaflets to you know actual bound

2674
01:49:26,679 --> 01:49:31,639
books that you know they you go through

2675
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,760
pages and pages and Pages it's all the

2676
01:49:31,639 --> 01:49:36,440
research all the stuff they ever ever

2677
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,400
did in that you can see what Muhammad

2678
01:49:36,439 --> 01:49:40,799
ooli and Carlton Turner and the

2679
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:42,759
University of Mississippi what cultivars

2680
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,920
they actually researched and and and

2681
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,679
worked with you know some some will say

2682
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:49,359
that oh this is a university in

2683
01:49:46,679 --> 01:49:51,118
Washington or Maine or you know that's

2684
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:53,359
where the G13 came from you know I don't

2685
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:54,839
know nothing about that I I can say that

2686
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:57,279
I've read the documentation of the

2687
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,639
cultivars that they did utilize at the

2688
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:02,439
University of Mississippi and and you

2689
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:06,118
know towards the very very end of the

2690
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:08,638
the the program did they they start even

2691
01:50:06,118 --> 01:50:13,880
investigating or working with any kind

2692
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:17,239
of wide Leaf call it Indica cultivars um

2693
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:20,319
it was it was mostly thin uh Leaf uh

2694
01:50:17,238 --> 01:50:22,799
sativa said cultivars from seized

2695
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:25,399
product that they ever researched with

2696
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:28,079
so the G13 is I I don't know if I find

2697
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:30,799
that whole story you know the internet's

2698
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:33,198
a crazy thing I noticed on your

2699
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:36,560
Instagram you had a few photos of both

2700
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:39,000
the uh the nl5 and the G13 uh in

2701
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:41,599
magazines and I wanted to ask you like

2702
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,158
how do they stand up to today's cultivar

2703
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,719
and what was your experience with the

2704
01:50:43,158 --> 01:50:47,839
G13 it seems to be one that's largely

2705
01:50:45,719 --> 01:50:50,359
been lost

2706
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:53,000
mostly let's say that the C you know I

2707
01:50:50,359 --> 01:50:55,118
got it and it was very leggy and gang I

2708
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,520
started breeding it and rebreeding it

2709
01:50:55,118 --> 01:50:59,158
and inbreeding it and and and you know

2710
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,159
it's just an inbred line that I kept

2711
01:50:59,158 --> 01:51:03,198
doing over and over and over until I got

2712
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:05,679
something that I I I found

2713
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:08,158
fascinating and when I say fascinating I

2714
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:10,279
can say just breaking up a joint It

2715
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:13,559
produced more resin on my fingers than

2716
01:51:10,279 --> 01:51:15,319
anything else I had ever ever run across

2717
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:18,679
so that's that's what sparked my

2718
01:51:15,319 --> 01:51:21,399
curiosity it was finicky it it was the

2719
01:51:18,679 --> 01:51:24,840
first to to to get bugs it was the first

2720
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:26,638
to die it was it it yielded like crap

2721
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:29,039
you know what I mean it was a nightmare

2722
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:32,319
but the flavor the flavor was like just

2723
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:35,319
smoking pure hat and then the stickiness

2724
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:38,359
pretty much proved that it was high THC

2725
01:51:35,319 --> 01:51:40,639
content but there was no way of testing

2726
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:46,039
then I was afforded the luxury of uh

2727
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:48,319
working with uh after uh 215 passed uh I

2728
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:50,399
was afforded the luxury through uh

2729
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:51,960
General Hydroponics they had an

2730
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,719
individual that was working there that

2731
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:56,480
was putting together a study with

2732
01:51:53,719 --> 01:51:59,118
California normal and that product was

2733
01:51:56,479 --> 01:52:01,919
going to go to uh drug detection

2734
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:03,000
Laboratories in Sacramento and they had

2735
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,800
a

2736
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,399
gcms that they were going to do testing

2737
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:08,800
on all the Cannabis and including

2738
01:52:07,399 --> 01:52:11,920
mother's milk I've still got these

2739
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:15,400
documents to prove all this uh you know

2740
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:17,359
uh so they they I long story short 11 of

2741
01:52:15,399 --> 01:52:19,638
my cultivars went to this drug detection

2742
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:21,519
laboratory you know besides like Mel

2743
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:25,480
Frank and a couple others that were able

2744
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:28,520
to get uh THC uh testing done at the

2745
01:52:25,479 --> 01:52:30,198
University of Mississippi um I'm

2746
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:32,719
probably the second private individual

2747
01:52:30,198 --> 01:52:34,519
that got those government entities to

2748
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:36,359
test their cultivars but it was a

2749
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:38,520
roundabout way because it went to drug

2750
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:41,238
detection Laboratories and and some of

2751
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:46,000
the cult of ours tested unusually high

2752
01:52:41,238 --> 01:52:48,439
so uh it was uh brought to question so

2753
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:52,078
Muhammad Ali Who provided the standards

2754
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:55,919
for the gcms was sent those samples with

2755
01:52:52,078 --> 01:52:58,399
a the DEA license uh from drug detection

2756
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,800
Laboratories so my samples went from me

2757
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:03,519
to Sacramento Sacramento to University

2758
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:06,199
of Mississippi where Muhammad Ali tested

2759
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:09,800
them and Quantified them and said that

2760
01:53:06,198 --> 01:53:13,399
the G13 tested at a 20 and and said yes

2761
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:16,440
it was true that the G13 tested at a 272

2762
01:53:13,399 --> 01:53:19,158
per THC and that was in

2763
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:21,759
1996 and so those in the photos you see

2764
01:53:19,158 --> 01:53:23,759
in the magazines it's got THC levels

2765
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:26,280
down below

2766
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,000
yeah certainly cuz I mean it's so it's

2767
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:29,960
so like interesting that you were one of

2768
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,800
the first people to get actual tests and

2769
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:34,158
that the numbers came back so high

2770
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:37,440
because the common Mantra you hear is

2771
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:40,000
that you know stuff was like sub 20% in

2772
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:42,319
the '90s it begs the question do you

2773
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,679
think we've really improved cannabis as

2774
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:46,880
much as we might like to think if those

2775
01:53:44,679 --> 01:53:49,760
are truly the

2776
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:51,800
values yeah yeah because you know you

2777
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,000
know let's let's go back to 1996 there

2778
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:56,239
was you know there was a handful of Mees

2779
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,880
you know what I mean let's go to today

2780
01:53:56,238 --> 01:53:59,279
there's dozens of Mees you know what I

2781
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:01,560
mean there's there there's there's an

2782
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:03,599
army of Mees out there creating the

2783
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:05,360
newest latest hottest genetics there's

2784
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:07,440
companies out there that trading you

2785
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:09,000
know uh seeds like trading cards you

2786
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:11,078
know what I mean there's there's uh

2787
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,399
there's amazing genetics out there that

2788
01:54:11,078 --> 01:54:13,799
just you know every day I look at

2789
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:16,638
Instagram or something like that and it

2790
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:19,639
blows my mind to see these resin coed

2791
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:21,719
Cult of ours that are just like awesome

2792
01:54:19,639 --> 01:54:23,000
just so awesome and then there's you

2793
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:25,279
know there's a

2794
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:30,920
a couple companies out there that do

2795
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:34,759
high resolution um uh photography uh

2796
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:36,920
schale and uh sorry the name escap me I

2797

just met him not too long ago he gave me

2798
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:44,158
a decal I can dig out his decal

2799

a an incredible closeup view of the the

2803
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,880
resin

2804
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:56,679
but yeah some of the some of the he was

2805

in the the last one of the last

2806
01:54:56,679 --> 01:55:03,118

2807
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:04,840
um damn what is it uh yeah the wellness

2808
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:08,000
issue

2809
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:10,199
um yeah he's one of the people I follow

2810
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,439
on Instagram and stuff but yeah schale

2811
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:16,439
and him both do the the best high high

2812
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:18,238
quality high resolution photography um

2813
01:55:16,439 --> 01:55:22,158
of resin Clans that I've ever seen in my

2814
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:23,839
life um but yeah so so you know do it do

2815
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:27,118
I think you

2816
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:29,800
know well you know you've got polyploids

2817
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:32,639
and stuff like that out there today um

2818
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:34,239
and and and and you know some some so

2819
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,520
very good genetics very good breeders

2820
01:55:34,238 --> 01:55:39,158
then Poly on top and it's like do I

2821
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:42,119
believe the 35% thc's

2822
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:44,319
absolutely there's an army of breeders

2823
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:46,399
out there producing incredible things

2824
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:48,679
back and forth back and forth back and

2825
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:49,960
forth yeah you read my mind that was

2826
01:55:48,679 --> 01:55:52,639
going to be my next question do you

2827
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:54,480
believe the 35% well look that's good to

2828
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:56,199
hear the answer there um I want to loop

2829
01:55:54,479 --> 01:55:57,598
back because I I realized I forgot to

2830
01:55:56,198 --> 01:55:59,399
ask you when you were talking about the

2831
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:01,400
G13 you mentioned that you did the

2832
01:55:59,399 --> 01:56:03,399
breeding project with it and I wanted to

2833
01:56:01,399 --> 01:56:05,158
ask you a little bit about that because

2834
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:06,839
I'd read online that you said you know

2835
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:08,519
the goals were to reduce the height the

2836
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:10,760
internodal length and improve the

2837
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:13,920
potency which all sounds like fantastic

2838
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:16,000
stuff what was the initial male you used

2839
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,920
to get that cross going and to do that

2840
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,198
line breeding and what do you look for

2841
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,800
when you select

2842
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:26,039
males no I I started with the G13 and

2843
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:28,840
just inbred the the the the jurny itself

2844
01:56:26,039 --> 01:56:30,679
with with SCS so I I just start got it

2845
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,440
to produce pollen and just started you

2846
01:56:30,679 --> 01:56:35,000
know reproducing it reproducing it

2847
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:38,158
reproducing it oh wow that's incredible

2848
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,679
so you just did consequential uh self so

2849
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:41,960
what what uh generation did you

2850
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:46,319
eventually get it

2851
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:48,118
to easy 15 easy 15 because it it was

2852
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:51,078
like I said it was just it was the first

2853
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:52,880
to die it was finicky it was you know

2854
01:56:51,078 --> 01:56:56,880
gangly um

2855
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:59,719
um you know it was uh yeah there there

2856
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:02,118
it was just it was like just a sickly

2857
01:56:59,719 --> 01:57:04,719
anemic plant that that that hated to

2858
01:57:02,118 --> 01:57:06,880
live you know what I mean so it took

2859
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:09,560
everything I I I and even the final

2860
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,359
version is like ick you know kind of

2861
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,320
sort of except for the finished except

2862
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:16,198
for the finished

2863
01:57:13,319 --> 01:57:19,679
product wow I mean when when you hear

2864
01:57:16,198 --> 01:57:21,678
common um rhetoric around doing multiple

2865
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:23,599
uh selfing projects you hear people

2866
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:25,560
citing that they're concerned about like

2867
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:27,960
loss of vigor but it sounds like part of

2868
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:30,159
your goal was to improve it would you

2869
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:32,840
say that you know when you get into like

2870
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:34,638
those higher numbers of the self um

2871
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:36,960
Generations that you you notice any

2872
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:40,920
decline in the genetics or not

2873
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:42,960
necessarily no uh the the main my main

2874
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:45,039
focus was to produce as many seeds as I

2875
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,760
could so I could increase the variables

2876
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:49,840
by having as many options to feno hunt

2877
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:52,480
as I possibly could you know that that

2878
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:55,319
was the key and and and again that's it

2879
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:57,718
wasn't by by by Design all the the high

2880
01:57:55,319 --> 01:58:00,078
numbers and the commercialization and

2881
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:02,480
scaling up and all that stuff you know

2882
01:58:00,078 --> 01:58:05,399
it was it wasn't a want to it was a have

2883
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:06,718
to you know to to to you know especially

2884
01:58:05,399 --> 01:58:09,479
when you're breeding like that to have

2885
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:11,800
as many options as possible so you know

2886
01:58:09,479 --> 01:58:15,959
if you can get you know

2887
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:18,400
uh a 36 inch plant to produce 200 seeds

2888
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:21,719
so you can in turn pop those 200 seeds

2889
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:24,078
to try to get you know 900 seeds but but

2890
01:58:21,719 --> 01:58:27,198
but but also you know find you know

2891
01:58:24,078 --> 01:58:29,840
preferential desirable traits within the

2892
01:58:27,198 --> 01:58:33,638
the the the genus and and and you know

2893
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:35,880
look for Superior phenotypes of the

2894
01:58:33,639 --> 01:58:37,920
genotype yeah that's that's beautiful

2895
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:40,359
information and I guess something I've

2896
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,880
wondered for a while now is how much

2897
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:44,880
were you able to achieve those goals

2898
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:48,239
like you know you described The Strain

2899
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:50,199
as quite lanky and um not not compact at

2900
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:52,359
all how much were you able to improve

2901
01:58:50,198 --> 01:58:54,879
that while being within the confines of

2902
01:58:52,359 --> 01:58:56,519
just selfing it and using just purely

2903
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,880
selections we able to achieve that in

2904
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:00,960
your

2905
01:58:57,880 --> 01:59:03,279
mind no no you're hamper I mean to to do

2906
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,719
a you know as as as Sam the skunk man

2907
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:08,000
says look a you know a proper pheno Hunt

2908
01:59:05,719 --> 01:59:10,520
is 20,000 plants you know what I mean

2909
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,520
and and in a GW Pharmaceuticals or a ho

2910
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:14,440
of farm situation you know back in the

2911
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:17,000
day ho of farm got to do some or

2912
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:19,439
participate in some very large

2913
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,238
Greenhouse operations you know and and

2914
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,839
so you know that's that's that's who

2915
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:25,000
educated me to that fact that like look

2916
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:27,199
you know you're you're not going to

2917
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,158
you're not feno hunting you know I mean

2918
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:32,839
you are you know but you're stifled if

2919
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:35,759
you only have 10 copies of a given

2920
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:38,560
cultivar to choose from or or or you

2921
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:41,159
know those are your only representations

2922
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:44,079
as opposed to you know

2923
01:59:41,158 --> 01:59:46,519
thousands I I I see some seed companies

2924
01:59:44,078 --> 01:59:49,679
that you know are and this is the the

2925
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:52,040
the benefit of legalization or or or you

2926
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:56,000
know um whatever you want to call

2927
01:59:52,039 --> 01:59:57,840
today's um situation uh I've seen you

2928
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,479
know some you know very reputable seed

2929
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:03,560
companies you know out there doing you

2930
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:05,559
know uh you know a 100,000 uh plants to

2931
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:07,119
to to go through and do their genetic

2932
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:09,280
selection you know what I mean and that

2933
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:10,920
that's really the proper way to do it

2934
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:14,439
you know because then you get full

2935
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:16,800
expressions of you know far and Far Far

2936
02:00:14,439 --> 02:00:18,919
you know ends of the spectrum both

2937
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,679
positive and negative you

2938
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,960
know there's there there's some

2939
02:00:20,679 --> 02:00:24,560
companies out there doing incred

2940
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:26,960
incredible fenal hunts just just I'm in

2941
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,239
awe when I see some of them just it's

2942
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,078
you

2943
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:33,479
know some of them are producing so so

2944
02:00:31,078 --> 02:00:35,719
much that they they they can't even you

2945
02:00:33,479 --> 02:00:37,759
know they've got to have teams of of S

2946
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:40,078
of Samplers and note takers because you

2947
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,880
know you're you're you're you

2948
02:00:40,078 --> 02:00:44,238
know eight hours of of of sniffing

2949
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:47,960
cannabis you're burnt you know what I

2950
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:50,959
mean you you just can't do a 12h hour

2951
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:53,239
day that's almost like a uh like a first

2952
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:55,560
world problem like I got old factory

2953
02:00:53,238 --> 02:00:57,319
fatigue I love that but you're right

2954
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:59,560
they they certainly do produce enough

2955
02:00:57,319 --> 02:01:02,759
that that's the case and it's a it's an

2956
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:04,159
evolving landscape for sure I wanted to

2957
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:05,719
ask you've given us such an awesome

2958
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:09,198
rundown of the

2959
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:11,439
G13 you also had a number of many other

2960
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:13,960
notable strains I wanted to touch on but

2961
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:15,960
I guess first off the nl5 you know what

2962
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:18,599
I've certainly noticed over the years of

2963
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:21,000
running this podcast is that many of the

2964
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:23,480
guests have like a notable nl5 cutting

2965
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,920
they had or M smoking but the

2966
02:01:23,479 --> 02:01:27,519
interesting part is that it seems to me

2967
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:29,239
like most of these cuttings they

2968
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:31,840
referenc were different from the other

2969
02:01:29,238 --> 02:01:34,319
ones what was your nl5 like how would

2970
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:36,319
you describe it and again do you feel

2971
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:39,078
like it stands up to today's

2972
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:42,799
stuff yeah well that's that's why to

2973
02:01:39,078 --> 02:01:45,479
clarify I I did an nl6 uh which was was

2974
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:47,560
a you know an nl5 that I got that I

2975
02:01:45,479 --> 02:01:49,678
ended up like you know back Crossing in

2976
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:52,320
[ __ ] withd like six times so there

2977
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:56,118
hence the name and and that's all it is

2978
02:01:52,319 --> 02:01:59,519
but you know uh it it it was certainly

2979
02:01:56,118 --> 02:02:02,399
Head and Shoulders above most that I I

2980
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:04,199
ever encountered and and you know and

2981
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:08,519
certainly made a name for itself and

2982
02:02:04,198 --> 02:02:11,198
stood on its own um you know uh I I

2983
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:16,079
found it you know very pleasurable very

2984
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:19,439
unique very very um very uniquely

2985
02:02:16,078 --> 02:02:22,118
aromatic was was my

2986
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:24,399
nl6 wow yeah cuz a lot of the people

2987
02:02:22,118 --> 02:02:26,399
we've had on historically say that uh

2988
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:28,238
you know the nose was probably lacking

2989
02:02:26,399 --> 02:02:30,719
to be honest and it was really like the

2990
02:02:28,238 --> 02:02:32,638
resin um that and maybe some of the

2991
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:35,520
potency to a lesser extent that really

2992
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:36,880
sold them so I guess you you improved it

2993
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,480
and you read my mind I was going to ask

2994
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:42,599
you what's the

2995
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:45,078
nl6 yeah no and that's you know like I

2996
02:02:42,599 --> 02:02:47,000
like I said long ago the the the the

2997
02:02:45,078 --> 02:02:50,000
aromatic and flavorful qualities is like

2998
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:52,520
50% you know I I used to say you know

2999
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,119
it's 25% High

3000
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:56,480
uh you know uh you

3001
02:02:55,119 --> 02:03:00,439
[Music]

3002
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:03,959
know you know easily 35 flavor and 35

3003
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:08,519
smell you know what I mean is is is you

3004
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:11,319
know well yeah more so than the high I

3005
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:15,480
enjoy the flavor and smell is is what I

3006
02:03:11,319 --> 02:03:16,960
I guess I can say um so in in my

3007
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:20,638
breeding that's that's what I kind of

3008
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:22,920
focus on is is you know the most

3009
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:24,599
aromatic and flavorful

3010
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:26,118
but that that that's hard when you know

3011
02:03:24,599 --> 02:03:27,920
when you're not using STS when you're

3012
02:03:26,118 --> 02:03:29,960
using you know pure lines when you're

3013
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:32,279
using mail breeders you know trying to

3014
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:35,719
find a preferential male that's Superior

3015
02:03:32,279 --> 02:03:38,078
to others without testing at your at

3016
02:03:35,719 --> 02:03:40,480
your disposal as well as you know I

3017
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:42,158
always wished that I had a a large

3018
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:44,158
enough facility to where I could

3019
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:46,960
completely finish out all my male

3020
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:49,078
candidates and do lab work on those and

3021
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,198
find Superior traits in the finished

3022
02:03:49,078 --> 02:03:54,118
product of the males and then go back

3023
02:03:52,198 --> 02:03:56,399
with clones that I took off those males

3024
02:03:54,118 --> 02:03:59,198
and then use those clones as my my basis

3025
02:03:56,399 --> 02:04:01,638
of breeding I I always lament that I

3026
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:04,799
wasn't able to do that afforded that

3027
02:04:01,639 --> 02:04:05,920
luxury because you know other than that

3028
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,480
we you know your thumb and your

3029
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:10,000
forefinger and rubbing it on the stem

3030
02:04:07,479 --> 02:04:12,118
and trying to find a superior smelling

3031
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,960
male is basically how you chose your

3032
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:16,799
males back in the day if you did use

3033
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:18,800
males and didn't use you know STS or

3034
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:20,960
something gibberelic

3035
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,840
whatever yeah certainly and and you

3036
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:25,118
touched on an interesting point which is

3037
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:28,199
that over the past few years we've seen

3038
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:31,439
a huge increase in the number of people

3039
02:04:28,198 --> 02:04:33,118
demanding feminized seeds over regular

3040
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:35,879
sex and I think part of it is due to

3041
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:38,359
what you said that so few if any people

3042
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:40,679
have the ability to truly run out their

3043
02:04:38,359 --> 02:04:42,118
males fully do you feel like in the

3044
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:43,639
future we're going to see that Trend

3045
02:04:42,118 --> 02:04:46,238
continue and we'll eventually just get

3046
02:04:43,639 --> 02:04:48,960
to almost totally fem

3047
02:04:46,238 --> 02:04:50,319
Market uh I I believe that would you

3048
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,639
know that would hinder that would be a

3049
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:54,880
hindered s would bottleneck I I I

3050
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:57,239
believe all most of this and I've talked

3051
02:04:54,880 --> 02:05:00,078
to interviewed

3052
02:04:57,238 --> 02:05:01,479
most of the seed companies and and they

3053
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:04,039
would you know they they they would like

3054
02:05:01,479 --> 02:05:07,039
something for everybody so yes they will

3055
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:10,238
uh continue to produce uh uh feminis yes

3056
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:13,279
they will continue to produce regulars

3057
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:15,678
um as well as uh uh autof flowers you

3058
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:18,719
know uh but you know possibly in the

3059
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:22,158
future uh polyploids um you know we'll

3060
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:26,840
see how that's embraced um or not

3061
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:28,039
you know so so you know um yeah you know

3062
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:30,000
because there's going to be some

3063
02:05:28,039 --> 02:05:32,279
companies that are out there producing

3064
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,359
not for for the general public they're

3065
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:37,719
not producing for uh consumables as

3066
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:39,118
flowers or even concentrates you know

3067
02:05:37,719 --> 02:05:42,118
they're going to be for pharmaceuticals

3068
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:43,960
they're going to be for you know uh you

3069
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:45,960
know commercial products of the

3070
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:48,840
beverages whatever you know what I mean

3071
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:50,760
you know I've heard that you know you

3072
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:54,920
know cannabis beverages could

3073
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:58,199
potentially you know e Eclipse uh uh

3074
02:05:54,920 --> 02:06:00,279
alcohol consumption in the distant

3075
02:05:58,198 --> 02:06:03,359
future you know as as the next

3076
02:06:00,279 --> 02:06:06,719
Generations drink less and less so you

3077
02:06:03,359 --> 02:06:08,759
know um those those those genetics will

3078
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:10,599
produce those things so you know anybody

3079
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:13,679
it's like I don't want some poly Ploy

3080
02:06:10,599 --> 02:06:16,039
blah blah blah and it's like it's it's

3081
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:18,359
it's not to be consumed by you it's to

3082
02:06:16,039 --> 02:06:22,118
be consumed in a pharmaceutical that's

3083
02:06:18,359 --> 02:06:24,039
put in a pill or whatever have you

3084
02:06:22,118 --> 02:06:25,198
yeah that's an interesting perspective

3085
02:06:24,039 --> 02:06:26,800
that I actually haven't given much

3086
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:28,960
thought to I'll have to I'll have to

3087
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:31,079
ponder that one actually and you know

3088
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,719
there is some uh some poly ployed

3089
02:06:31,078 --> 02:06:34,840
controversy in the community at the

3090
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:36,520
moment but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we

3091
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:38,159
can leave that be for the moment I

3092
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:40,520
wanted to quickly ask you before I

3093
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:41,638
forget you also in um some of the

3094
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:43,320

02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:59,039
info just yeah just track on

3101
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:00,319
Technologies yes yes um these two other

3102
02:06:59,039 --> 02:07:01,639
strains keep popping up that I wanted to

3103
02:07:00,319 --> 02:07:03,399
ask you about the Juicy Fruit and the

3104
02:07:01,639 --> 02:07:04,800
cryptonite where'd you get those you

3105
02:07:03,399 --> 02:07:06,359
know we've heard about them in from

3106
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,559
other guests but um I'd love to hear

3107
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:11,679
from you juicy fruit was

3108
02:07:08,559 --> 02:07:13,599
fascinating you know if you produced it

3109
02:07:11,679 --> 02:07:15,920
today and called it that you'd get sued

3110
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:18,159
by rley you know what I mean but but it

3111
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:20,760
genuinely did smell like that and it was

3112
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:23,879
just again a cultivar that I stumbled

3113
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:26,480
across coming from Northern California

3114
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,960
um you know and and bettered it and

3115
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:30,839
refined it you know most of the

3116
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:33,880
cultivars I was getting at that time

3117
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:36,078
were all bred for outdoor production so

3118
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:38,279
it took a lot of work to get them to to

3119
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:40,319
size down and and get a little bit more

3120
02:07:38,279 --> 02:07:41,960
manageable for indoor production because

3121
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:42,880
they were you know they were used to be

3122
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:46,599
in you

3123
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:49,319
know very distant internodal lengths uh

3124
02:07:46,599 --> 02:07:51,639
up up to you know 9 to 12 feet Outdoors

3125
02:07:49,319 --> 02:07:54,039
you know so that's that's what I started

3126
02:07:51,639 --> 02:07:57,078
with and and and the best I could given

3127
02:07:54,039 --> 02:08:00,399
my limited resource ability and

3128
02:07:57,078 --> 02:08:02,399
bandwidth and space and you know uh you

3129
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:06,078
can only have so many plants in a given

3130
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:08,558
rotation so you know yeah I I did the

3131
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:09,880
best I did I could with what I had but

3132
02:08:08,559 --> 02:08:11,400
you know some people would say well you

3133
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:13,800
started with other people's material and

3134
02:08:11,399 --> 02:08:15,479
it's like well didn't everybody um you

3135
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:17,920
know the which came first the chicken or

3136
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:21,839
the egg but I I certainly believe that

3137
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:25,039
like the the juu fruit the the the D13

3138
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:28,000
the all all the apps were mentioned uh I

3139
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:31,238
I definitely left them better than I

3140
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:35,039
received them the uh I first encountered

3141
02:08:31,238 --> 02:08:40,839
the uh Kryptonite in 198

3142
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:43,960
1995 at Dennis peron's uh cup in the

3143
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:46,000
upper Castro that I went to with Ed

3144
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:47,239
rosenal um and if you look at my

3145
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Instagram again there's there's

3146
02:08:47,238 --> 02:08:52,198
brochures from that cup you know what I

3147
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,399
mean I think there was five cvars ENT

3148
02:08:52,198 --> 02:08:58,158
uh but a gentleman named Brian

3149
02:08:54,399 --> 02:09:01,359
jeul jwl is the breeder of the

3150
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:03,519
Kryptonite he is the

3151
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:05,960
original person that brought it to that

3152
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:07,960
cup and won that cup and I became

3153
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:10,960
fascinated with it because had a very

3154
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:14,239
unique flavor you know what I I and and

3155
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:16,439
if you look at my photos in my articles

3156
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:18,839
that were taken at that time and compare

3157
02:09:16,439 --> 02:09:21,439
them to what other people call crippy

3158
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:25,119
and this and that whatever they've

3159
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:27,399
mutated it into they look nothing alike

3160
02:09:25,118 --> 02:09:30,279
so you know I don't I don't

3161
02:09:27,399 --> 02:09:33,078
know you know I I can only assume that

3162
02:09:30,279 --> 02:09:35,519
the name's been appropriated and and and

3163
02:09:33,078 --> 02:09:38,039
given to other cultivars Etc because

3164
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:41,960
it's not the same fortunately I do have

3165
02:09:38,039 --> 02:09:44,639
a lot of uh genetics left of that so uh

3166
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:47,639
along with the purple Kish I hope to to

3167
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:51,679
re in introduce

3168
02:09:47,639 --> 02:09:54,599
that uh if possible but uh so uh yeah my

3169
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:56,078
my my friend is the one who BR that um

3170
02:09:54,599 --> 02:09:58,520
Brian

3171
02:09:56,078 --> 02:10:00,039
Jewel that's that's awesome to hear and

3172
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:02,079
I was going to ask you know any relation

3173
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:04,479
to the crippy so good to get that

3174
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:07,359
clarification I think I also saw two

3175
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:09,558
other strains pop up uh maybe one called

3176
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:15,719
Washington another called

3177
02:10:09,559 --> 02:10:17,599
Yoshi yeah yeah uh yeah again uh I I

3178
02:10:15,719 --> 02:10:20,480
responsible for over 200 so there

3179
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:22,078
there's a plethora of them and and I

3180
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:23,598
believe in those mag magazine articles

3181
02:10:22,078 --> 02:10:26,799
those were some of them that also have

3182
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:29,440
the THC uh levels and stuff at that

3183
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:31,480
point I think most of those were around

3184
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:33,598
the 16 or something like that they were

3185
02:10:31,479 --> 02:10:35,718
mid-levels you know they were hybrids

3186
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:39,360
so-called sativa indicia

3187
02:10:35,719 --> 02:10:41,760
hybrids yeah okay look yeah 200 God we

3188
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:44,399
be here all day right it's uh it's

3189
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:47,639
interesting to see how many of them um

3190
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:51,399
are notable names I wanted to ask you've

3191
02:10:47,639 --> 02:10:52,840
won a numerous amount of awards over the

3192
02:10:51,399 --> 02:10:55,479
years and one of the stories that

3193
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:57,199
grabbed me the most was how in uh in one

3194
02:10:55,479 --> 02:10:59,479
of the first cups you entered you you

3195
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:02,118
won first second and third place all in

3196
02:10:59,479 --> 02:11:03,519
the same cup that was h a pretty funny

3197
02:11:02,118 --> 02:11:07,679
story tell me a little bit about what

3198
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:10,239
that experience was like it was done uh

3199
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:12,440
by a man named Bob at the Hayward hempy

3200
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:14,078
and it was put on by a very dear friend

3201
02:11:12,439 --> 02:11:16,719
named Debbie goldsbury from an

3202
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:18,880
organization called cabis Action Network

3203
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,800
Ed rosenball asked me to go and you know

3204
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:23,639
at that point I you know had 11

3205
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:27,159
different C of ours and I was just out

3206
02:11:23,639 --> 02:11:29,279
of curiosity you know I I I don't really

3207
02:11:27,158 --> 02:11:30,839
uh play in the sandbox with other kids

3208
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:33,439

3209
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:36,039

3210
02:11:33,439 --> 02:11:39,238
I've you know never been to a a

3211
02:11:36,039 --> 02:11:42,319
Amsterdam Cannabis Cup back in the day I

3212
02:11:39,238 --> 02:11:43,718
I you know I I just uh yeah I'd rather

3213
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:46,558
just stay home and work you know what I

3214
02:11:43,719 --> 02:11:48,158
mean so you know um I I didn't go out

3215
02:11:46,559 --> 02:11:49,599
much so Ed was like hey just for fun you

3216
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:51,479
should enter this thing and I was like

3217
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:54,400
okay so you know I put 11 different

3218
02:11:51,479 --> 02:11:56,558
cultivar in and stuff and you know it

3219
02:11:54,399 --> 02:11:58,039
was interesting I mean it was very Neal

3220
02:11:56,559 --> 02:12:00,119
it was like you know watching watching

3221
02:11:58,039 --> 02:12:02,319
the general public grab samples of your

3222
02:12:00,118 --> 02:12:04,399
pot and tear it apart on on paper plates

3223
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:06,439
literally you know and then they smoked

3224
02:12:04,399 --> 02:12:08,679
it and stuff and I was like okay we see

3225
02:12:06,439 --> 02:12:10,719
what happens here and then you know they

3226
02:12:08,679 --> 02:12:13,399
started to give Awards and they like

3227
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:16,198
okay you know this this Cult of art blah

3228
02:12:13,399 --> 02:12:18,319
blah blah third place and I was like oh

3229
02:12:16,198 --> 02:12:20,479
okay kind of disappointed that I got

3230
02:12:18,319 --> 02:12:22,439
third place but okay I never done this

3231
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:23,919
before you know and so then I went and

3232
02:12:22,439 --> 02:12:26,479
sat down and they were like okay well

3233
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:28,399
second place and blah blah blah and you

3234
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:29,919
know then they said by cultivar and so I

3235
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:31,359
was like okay well that's not too bad

3236
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:33,000
you know what I mean and you know got a

3237
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:34,558
second and a third first time out you

3238
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,359
know what I mean and then the guy just

3239
02:12:34,559 --> 02:12:38,320
looked at me he was like don't even sit

3240
02:12:36,359 --> 02:12:39,920
down and I was like what do you mean he

3241
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:42,078
was like oh you got first place too and

3242
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:43,639
I was like oh but it was kind of

3243
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:45,558
uncomfortable because then there started

3244
02:12:43,639 --> 02:12:48,239
being like grumblings in the room you

3245
02:12:45,559 --> 02:12:50,440
know what I mean it was like oh that at

3246
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:52,439
the point you know I I I wish I wasn't

3247
02:12:50,439 --> 02:12:55,519
still there so I don't know it felt

3248
02:12:52,439 --> 02:12:58,198
uncomfortable and you know at that point

3249
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:00,880
I decided that I really don't like being

3250
02:12:58,198 --> 02:13:03,839
a so-called you know mo most people

3251
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:05,199
don't know what I look like you know

3252
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:08,480
what I mean so I can walk through most

3253
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:09,879
events and nobody's points or stares or

3254
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:12,279
you know says anything you know what I

3255
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:14,840
mean so I I I enjoy my anonymity so to

3256
02:13:12,279 --> 02:13:17,000
speak you know so at that point I felt

3257
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:20,239
kind of uncomfortable having the general

3258
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,639
public uh displeased that I took first

3259
02:13:20,238 --> 02:13:22,439
second and third so

3260
02:13:21,639 --> 02:13:24,639
There He

3261
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:26,198
Go yeah that's an interesting

3262
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:27,880
perspective I I certainly wasn't

3263
02:13:26,198 --> 02:13:29,919
expecting to hear that but I can I can

3264
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:32,679
appreciate your point of you you know

3265
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:34,399
certainly being uh a little bit more

3266
02:13:32,679 --> 02:13:37,359
introverted than extroverted myself I

3267
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:39,558
can appreciate that I guess from a more

3268
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:42,598
theoretical point of view that's just

3269
02:13:39,559 --> 02:13:44,800
one of a numerous amount of awards and

3270
02:13:42,599 --> 02:13:47,078
just high placings in general you've had

3271
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:49,320
over the years what do you think has

3272
02:13:47,078 --> 02:13:51,238
allowed you to be so successful in

3273
02:13:49,319 --> 02:13:52,198
competitions what made your samples

3274
02:13:51,238 --> 02:13:54,839
stand

3275
02:13:52,198 --> 02:13:56,919
out just hard work you know what I mean

3276
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:59,078
just uh attention to detail and

3277
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:01,000
dedication you know what I mean and

3278
02:13:59,078 --> 02:14:04,118
again the people that came before me uh

3279
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:06,800
you know being H having the luxury of of

3280
02:14:04,118 --> 02:14:09,519
you know having good quality genetics

3281
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:11,559
provided to me to to to breed and

3282
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:13,920
improve with you know what I mean so you

3283
02:14:11,559 --> 02:14:15,719
know can't even really take the credit

3284
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,599
myself it was you know the the

3285
02:14:15,719 --> 02:14:20,198
generation before me that that that gave

3286
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:23,000
me the tools to work with you know so

3287
02:14:20,198 --> 02:14:25,598
you know I I I just paid attention and

3288
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:28,520
fortunately I had books like marijuana

3289
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:32,078
botney from Rob Clark and you know I I

3290
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:34,599
know I paid attention you know

3291
02:14:32,078 --> 02:14:37,759
um yeah

3292
02:14:34,599 --> 02:14:39,760
so hugely look and uh I think no one

3293
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,760
needs to hear it because if you've been

3294
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:43,119
paying attention throughout this

3295
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:44,800
interview you've heard just the the

3296
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:47,039
numerous amounts of Articles you've

3297
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:49,000
written it's no surprise that you ended

3298
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:51,158
up writing your own book marijuana

3299
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,800
Horticultural fundamentals a

3300
02:14:51,158 --> 02:14:55,638
comprehensive guide to cannabis

3301
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:57,760
cultivation it's highly regarded by many

3302
02:14:55,639 --> 02:15:00,078
in the industry I wanted to ask you what

3303
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:02,119
was the process of writing the book like

3304
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:03,719
and what are some things people can

3305
02:15:02,118 --> 02:15:04,679
expect to get out of it if they grab

3306
02:15:03,719 --> 02:15:06,840
themselves a

3307
02:15:04,679 --> 02:15:08,279
copy uh it was a nightmare and probably

3308
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:12,119
one of the hardest things I ever did

3309
02:15:08,279 --> 02:15:13,880
trying to put all the the the content

3310
02:15:12,118 --> 02:15:15,319
you know there there was so much more

3311
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:17,960
that I wanted to include you had to

3312
02:15:15,319 --> 02:15:20,399
limit it to 400 pages so what what was

3313
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:23,480
the best and you know um I've got I've

3314
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:25,799
been critized for for for kind of

3315
02:15:23,479 --> 02:15:27,879
favoring the commercial scale even you

3316
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:30,480
know back then but that was my focus

3317
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:32,920
that was my Fascination you know but I

3318
02:15:30,479 --> 02:15:35,000
tried to include everybody and and and

3319
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:38,158
even the small little handw watered

3320
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:40,078
Gardens etc etc I tried to produce and

3321
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:43,319
and provide something for everybody you

3322
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:45,158
know uh keeping in mind that 60% of the

3323
02:15:43,319 --> 02:15:47,960
photos in that book are minded are are

3324
02:15:45,158 --> 02:15:50,719
are the are are my work I didn't Source

3325
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:52,439
photos from other people there is 40%

3326
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:54,239
that other people that the publisher

3327
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:57,078
took and sourced from other people but

3328
02:15:54,238 --> 02:15:59,638
the gardens the you know the the setups

3329
02:15:57,078 --> 02:16:02,880
and all that kind of stuff you know 60%

3330
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:04,960
of it is all my work and and stuff so

3331
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:07,639
you know um the the hard part was what

3332
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:10,359
to include and what not to but even then

3333
02:16:07,639 --> 02:16:12,000
that that was you know between the time

3334
02:16:10,359 --> 02:16:13,759
that it was written the time that it was

3335
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,479
published was five years so even when it

3336
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:18,079
was published there's things that now I

3337
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:19,439
wish weren't in there that I would love

3338
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:22,319
to change some of the product

3339
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:24,158
recommendations Etc Etc you know for

3340
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:27,479
instance you know a lot of the lights

3341
02:16:24,158 --> 02:16:30,759
and you know uh other products that I

3342
02:16:27,479 --> 02:16:32,718
recommend um other corporations turned

3343
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:34,679
around and bought those companies and

3344
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:36,159
and now I wish that I didn't recommend

3345
02:16:34,679 --> 02:16:38,519
those companies because they're bought

3346
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:40,359
by corporations you know what I mean so

3347
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:42,639
in the revised next Edition I'll be

3348
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:45,120
taking that out you know so that was

3349
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:47,239
kind of a an interesting perspective but

3350
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:48,760
you know um yeah the hardest part was

3351
02:16:47,239 --> 02:16:49,679
probably you know what to include and

3352
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:52,359
what not

3353
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:53,760
to yeah yeah look certainly I don't

3354
02:16:52,359 --> 02:16:55,719
think anyone's going to hold it against

3355
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:57,359
you as time goes on you know things

3356
02:16:55,718 --> 02:16:59,039
change but that's great to hear that

3357
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:01,800
you're still trying to keep it relevant

3358
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:05,200
with subsequent updates and I wanted to

3359
02:17:01,799 --> 02:17:06,920
ask you know you have notably been one

3360
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:09,920
of the first if not the first to write

3361
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:12,478
about dryv extraction in common magazine

3362
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,120
as well as large scale water hash

3363
02:17:12,478 --> 02:17:16,679
extraction and even some of the first

3364
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:18,160
articles describing BHO I feel like

3365
02:17:16,679 --> 02:17:20,398
you've always been ahead of the curb in

3366
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:21,359
that regard so I wanted to ask you what

3367
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:23,119
do you think

3368
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:24,679
on the future what's your prediction for

3369
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:30,120
the next big

3370
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:33,120
thing like I said uh taking 20 acres and

3371
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:36,760
and turning it into a 55 gallon drum of

3372
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:41,160
dry seeve of from fresh frozen material

3373
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:43,200
within uh eight hours that fascinates me

3374
02:17:41,159 --> 02:17:44,879
you know what I mean uh you know you did

3375
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,479
not compromise the final product to

3376
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:47,959
final product is sitting there it's from

3377
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:50,879
a fresh frozen product the highest

3378
02:17:47,959 --> 02:17:53,119
Turing content available um you know

3379
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:55,438
know uh and and then to be able to

3380
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:57,079
separate those cannaboids from tpin all

3381
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:59,840
organically for the lowest cost of

3382
02:17:57,079 --> 02:18:02,079
production that fascinates me as well so

3383
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:04,799
you know it starts with the cry Mass cry

3384
02:18:02,079 --> 02:18:07,398
Mass separates uh the the the the

3385
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:10,518
biomass from the active ingredients then

3386
02:18:07,398 --> 02:18:12,718
then like I said a a static electricity

3387
02:18:10,519 --> 02:18:14,478
separator separates and this equipments

3388
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:17,239
available so you've got one equipment

3389
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:19,318
the the cry Mass second equipment is the

3390
02:18:17,239 --> 02:18:21,519
the the the static separator then you've

3391
02:18:19,318 --> 02:18:24,638
got a vorticy a vorticy will separate

3392
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:28,960
the the the the the material that comes

3393
02:18:24,638 --> 02:18:31,959
off the the the static separator uh in

3394
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:35,079
multiple sizes the vorticy the second

3395
02:18:31,959 --> 02:18:37,398
vorticy will separate by size you know

3396
02:18:35,079 --> 02:18:39,359
so so being able to do that with a fresh

3397
02:18:37,398 --> 02:18:41,718
frozen material that hasn't been dried

3398
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:44,120
hasn't been cured hasn't been trimmed

3399
02:18:41,718 --> 02:18:46,438
and all the equipment and equip uh the

3400
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:49,479
the space and everything that goes with

3401
02:18:46,439 --> 02:18:52,280
that process to eliminate all that stuff

3402
02:18:49,478 --> 02:18:55,558
take a 20 acre BAS from a greenhouse and

3403
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:58,000
and on it put you know so I I say one

3404
02:18:55,558 --> 02:19:00,638
team walks in De lefs the pro the the

3405
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,879
the plants second team behind them takes

3406
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:07,199
uh uh all the the branches off the main

3407
02:19:03,879 --> 02:19:09,839
stocks puts them in a bin does a 1880

3408
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:11,760
rotation puts that b onto a conveyor

3409
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:14,880
belt that conveyor belt goes to a

3410
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:16,960
bucking team bucking team uh takes all

3411
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:19,318
that material off the stem with the

3412
02:19:16,959 --> 02:19:22,558
Bucking puts it in seals containers and

3413
02:19:19,318 --> 02:19:25,519
goes into subzero minus 20° uh uh

3414
02:19:22,558 --> 02:19:28,000
storage until needed and whatever is is

3415
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:33,398
is able to be processed that day goes

3416
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:35,599
into something AK to a uh a a chomas

3417
02:19:33,398 --> 02:19:38,760
separator that will you know take fresh

3418
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:41,280
frozen biomass and and turn it separate

3419
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:42,960
the green vegetated material uh from

3420
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:45,120
from the active ingredient and then

3421
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:47,718
you've got again the the the static

3422
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,840
separator uh that's available so then

3423
02:19:47,718 --> 02:19:52,639
you'll go into that from that you'll go

3424
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:55,840
into the VY again and separate to your

3425
02:19:52,639 --> 02:19:57,959
final size and and those are your active

3426
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:01,079
ingredients I mean yeah that that will

3427
02:19:57,959 --> 02:20:03,639
enable companies to engage with that 20

3428
02:20:01,079 --> 02:20:06,280
acre facility and be like look I'm just

3429
02:20:03,639 --> 02:20:07,719
a a vapen company I'm a rosin company

3430
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:09,000
and I I don't want to grow don't want to

3431
02:20:07,719 --> 02:20:10,760
extract don't want to do any of those

3432
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,239
things don't want to hydrocarbon don't

3433
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:15,079
want to blow up they want you know I'm

3434
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:19,039
just going to take your 55 gallon drum

3435
02:20:15,079 --> 02:20:22,478
put it in bags got a got a got a vacuum

3436
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:24,920
seal them um then GNA

3437
02:20:22,478 --> 02:20:27,358
uh should I say freeze dry them then

3438
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:29,559
vacuum seal them then press them and

3439
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:30,960
then you know gonna get crash it out

3440
02:20:29,559 --> 02:20:35,398
make my diamonds do whatever I'm going

3441
02:20:30,959 --> 02:20:37,799
to do uh hdfb High turpine whatever blah

3442
02:20:35,398 --> 02:20:41,478
blah blah and make my VAP carts or you

3443
02:20:37,799 --> 02:20:44,239
know so you know to be able to take uh

3444
02:20:41,478 --> 02:20:46,438
20 acres and turn it into active

3445
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:48,959
ingredients all organically for the

3446
02:20:46,439 --> 02:20:52,040
lowest cost of production again so I can

3447
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:54,358
pass those savings and and and and you

3448
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:57,439
know again a superior product for a

3449
02:20:54,359 --> 02:20:58,960
superior price to customers all organic

3450
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:00,079
that's that's that's something that

3451
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:02,599
fascinates

3452
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:04,920
me that that sounds incredible and it's

3453
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:07,200
absolutely going to be a game changer

3454
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:08,879
the more it rolls out and I guess I'd

3455
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:10,600
love to follow that up by asking what do

3456
02:21:08,879 --> 02:21:13,478
you think is going to be the future of

3457
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:15,960
tpin in the context that we're seeing a

3458
02:21:13,478 --> 02:21:18,318
massive rise in the popularity of tped

3459
02:21:15,959 --> 02:21:20,239
infused cannabis it's it's almost its

3460
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:22,119
own entity I'm sure you've seen it what

3461
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:25,478
do you think the future of

3462
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:27,520
turpins H turpins are a fascinating

3463
02:21:25,478 --> 02:21:29,438
thing to me um especially being someone

3464
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:32,079
that you know I mean uh was one of the

3465
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:34,159
very first to enter a I separated

3466
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:36,120
cannaboids from tpin and entered them

3467
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:37,439
into a cannabis cff but they wouldn't

3468
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:38,720
accept them because they didn't have a

3469
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:40,359
category for them and didn't know what

3470
02:21:38,719 --> 02:21:41,760
to do with them but there is people out

3471
02:21:40,359 --> 02:21:43,520
there that remember that and if you look

3472
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,200
on my Instagram it shows pictures of it

3473
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:47,840
and the time and place etc etc so you

3474
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:51,479
know i' I've definitely pioneered the

3475
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:55,159
field of tpine isolation and application

3476
02:21:51,478 --> 02:21:58,719
uh I I the the trend that you say of of

3477
02:21:55,159 --> 02:22:02,920
of utilizing non-cannabis derived tpes

3478
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:06,279
on cannabis I'm not in favor of uh

3479
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:09,120
non-derived cannabis uh tpes into Vape

3480
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:12,600
carts I'm also not a fan of um you know

3481
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:15,120
I've I've pioneered and and and and

3482
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:19,439
established processes and procedures for

3483
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:22,280
all organic tpine isolation and and I

3484
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:24,159
think you know take the Cannabis

3485
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:26,760
separate the active ingredients then

3486
02:22:24,159 --> 02:22:29,159
separate the the the tpin all

3487
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:30,760
organically from from fresh frozen

3488
02:22:29,159 --> 02:22:33,680
material that hasn't been dried so you

3489
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:36,079
haven't lost any of the the the monot

3490
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:38,120
tanes ETC put those in a bottle then

3491
02:22:36,079 --> 02:22:39,478
separate your cannaboids and then after

3492
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:41,160
that you've got the raw ingredients to

3493
02:22:39,478 --> 02:22:44,358
mix them back the way you want to you

3494
02:22:41,159 --> 02:22:46,719
know and and for or VAP pens or you know

3495
02:22:44,359 --> 02:22:48,920
uh I believe those separated Tarpin are

3496
02:22:46,719 --> 02:22:50,559
going to be utilized for for that next

3497
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:52,799
generation of Pharmaceutical

3498
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:54,680
applications as well you know um

3499
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:57,199
where're just at the tip of the iceberg

3500
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:00,120
of understanding the medical benefits of

3501
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:02,800
the Entourage effect combined with the

3502
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:04,960
endocannabinoid system on the human body

3503
02:23:02,799 --> 02:23:08,119
to be able to formulate the next

3504
02:23:04,959 --> 02:23:10,679
generation of cannaboid and turpine

3505
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:12,600
based Pharmaceuticals or wellness

3506
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:15,840
products if you

3507
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:18,479
will yeah it's such a a Big Field that's

3508
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:20,159
unfolding it's almost hard to like

3509
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:23,239
articulate what products are going to

3510
02:23:20,159 --> 02:23:26,520
exist in 10 15 years time and as you

3511
02:23:23,239 --> 02:23:28,719
said it's going to be

3512
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:30,960
incredible we don't don't know we're

3513
02:23:28,719 --> 02:23:34,358
still in our infancy because of you know

3514
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:36,719
Draconian laws and and legalization or

3515
02:23:34,359 --> 02:23:39,559
you know illegalization should I say you

3516
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:41,159
know uh I explain to to to you know

3517
02:23:39,559 --> 02:23:44,519
sometimes I I deal with you know

3518
02:23:41,159 --> 02:23:45,959
pharmacologists or or doctors Etc and

3519
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:47,920
you know they they'll ask me about the

3520
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:50,639
pharmacology of this the whole thing and

3521
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:54,639
I I have to explain to them how how

3522
02:23:50,639 --> 02:23:55,879
primitive and how in the infancy we are

3523
02:23:54,639 --> 02:23:59,760
meaning

3524
02:23:55,879 --> 02:24:02,639
that right now if if if I ask you what

3525
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:06,200
is responsible as some people have given

3526
02:24:02,639 --> 02:24:10,278
credit for for cannabinoids in reducing

3527
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:12,240
a a tumor a brain tumor so to speak um

3528
02:24:10,279 --> 02:24:15,840
you know so what what is responsible for

3529
02:24:12,239 --> 02:24:17,840
that is that uh uh thca or is that a

3530
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:20,159
decarbox Delta

3531
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:22,200
9 and and some people would say well

3532
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:24,200
what's the relevance and the relevance

3533
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:26,840
is is let's let's take for instance a

3534
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:29,640
pediatric cancer patient I could give a

3535
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:32,840
pediatric cancer patient a smoothie with

3536
02:24:29,639 --> 02:24:35,478
a th000 milligrams of thca with no

3537
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:38,200
euphoric effects so to speak you know no

3538
02:24:35,478 --> 02:24:41,639
uncomfortable effect where the same

3539
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:43,159
can't be said about the decarbox Delta 9

3540
02:24:41,639 --> 02:24:45,199
you know you you can give less than a

3541
02:24:43,159 --> 02:24:47,000
grain of rice to that pediatric cancer

3542
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:49,840
patient and and they're definitely going

3543
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:52,398
to experience a uncomfortable euphoric

3544
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:54,600
effect so to speak you know so so there

3545
02:24:52,398 --> 02:24:56,318
there's there's major relevance there

3546
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:59,479
you know you know I could give you know

3547
02:24:56,318 --> 02:25:01,840
10,000 milligrams of thca smoothie to

3548
02:24:59,478 --> 02:25:03,519
someone you know without a euphoric

3549
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:05,439
effect I don't know if that'd be healthy

3550
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,600
otherwise but you

3551
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:10,920
know too much of a good thing I don't

3552
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:14,479
know but but so you know until just that

3553
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:16,439
basic Foundation can be answered the the

3554
02:25:14,478 --> 02:25:18,760
the there's there's you know you've got

3555
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:20,520
to start from point A you know what I

3556
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:23,880
mean there is no answers to any of of

3557
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:25,960
this and today if you go to most modern

3558
02:25:23,879 --> 02:25:27,519
doctors and ask them about you know hey

3559
02:25:25,959 --> 02:25:28,839
you've got a lymphatic system right

3560
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:30,680
they'll be yeah and it's like you got a

3561
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:32,478
circulatory system and it's like yeah

3562
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:34,239
and it's like do you know anything about

3563
02:25:32,478 --> 02:25:35,920
the endocannabinoid system they'll look

3564
02:25:34,239 --> 02:25:36,920
at you sideways it's like what I don't

3565
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,960
know what you're talking about that

3566
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:40,879
doesn't exist and it's like yes it does

3567
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:44,478
you know it's medically proven da d d d

3568
02:25:40,879 --> 02:25:45,559
da and it's like you know yeah so so you

3569
02:25:44,478 --> 02:25:47,879
know they don't even teach the

3570
02:25:45,559 --> 02:25:49,840
endocannabinoid system in medical school

3571
02:25:47,879 --> 02:25:52,079

Twilight of his career so to speak uhh

3606

02:27:28,359 --> 02:27:34,040
not mixed with with with with cannaboids

3609
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:36,279
but pure tpine themselves and he was

3610
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:38,399
like wow that's fascinating and the only

3611
02:27:36,279 --> 02:27:40,079
person I know that you could really

3612
02:27:38,398 --> 02:27:42,840
probably work with in your area would be

3613
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:44,840
Paul Daly from Alexander shulan Research

3614
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:46,120

3615
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:49,520
him and he was like here come to the

3616
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:51,040
farm so I went there and didn't realize

3617
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,800
who what I

3618
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:56,279
was stepping into where I was going and

3619
02:27:53,799 --> 02:27:58,519
how privileged I was to be able to be

3620
02:27:56,279 --> 02:28:01,840
invited to go there especially when

3621
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:03,800
Sasha was alive um and in that I've got

3622
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:06,639
photos that you know of the first day

3623
02:28:03,799 --> 02:28:09,478
that me and Paul started you know

3624
02:28:06,639 --> 02:28:12,358
injecting the torpin into the gcms and

3625
02:28:09,478 --> 02:28:14,000
hplt and you know Sasha was there and

3626
02:28:12,359 --> 02:28:16,279
you know I got to talk to him about one

3627
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:19,719
of the early early early early papers he

3628
02:28:16,279 --> 02:28:22,200
did about uh tpin and Catabus and stuff

3629
02:28:19,719 --> 02:28:24,199
and he's said uh I wrote A B book about

3630
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:26,200
tpin and I said sir you've forgotten

3631
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:30,040
more than I'll ever know you know so

3632
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:33,279
it's just it was a sweet T toay and I'm

3633
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:34,960
just privileged that Paul enabled me to

3634
02:28:33,279 --> 02:28:38,000
have that experience to know Sasha at

3635
02:28:34,959 --> 02:28:40,039
his end wow there you go well look

02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:52,120
at the seses uh my friend uh big up

3687
02:30:47,159 --> 02:30:55,279
Teddy at the Yus uh can this company um

3688
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:57,240
you know I I I get to see you know the

3689
02:30:55,279 --> 02:30:59,920
the best and brightest and newest and

3690
02:30:57,239 --> 02:31:03,760
latest and hottest I I I haven't been

3691
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:05,840
judging competitions lately because uh

3692
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:09,279
um it's

3693
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:12,680
uh it's kind of

3694
02:31:09,279 --> 02:31:16,120
um I don't know a little bit too

3695
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:17,880
demanding as far as like uh you know a

3696
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:22,359
major amount of samples in a short

3697
02:31:17,879 --> 02:31:24,839
amount of time and uh um you know you're

3698
02:31:22,359 --> 02:31:26,720
really determining someone's fate kind

3699
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:29,600
of sort of thing so I I I felt

3700
02:31:26,719 --> 02:31:31,760
uncomfortable in that position but I

3701
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:33,040
used to judge competitions and found it

3702
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:35,079
kind of

3703
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,680
fascinating yeah look that's such an

3704
02:31:35,079 --> 02:31:38,318
interesting point which we don't really

3705
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:40,920
talk about much and I'd heard the

3706
02:31:38,318 --> 02:31:43,879
sentiment articulated in the context of

3707
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:46,120
of wine judging but haven't heard it in

3708
02:31:43,879 --> 02:31:48,519
cannabis as much if at all where you

3709
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:50,920
know you do have to acknowledge the uh

3710
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:53,120
the role of influence and power that

3711
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:54,600
comes with judging and uh for some

3712
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:56,279
people it can really make or break a

3713
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:59,200
business depending on how well they

3714
02:31:56,279 --> 02:32:01,399
score um I guess I'd be interested in

3715
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:02,960
asking we've sort of alluded to it and

3716
02:32:01,398 --> 02:32:04,920
lightly touched on the topic throughout

3717
02:32:02,959 --> 02:32:07,159
the episode but what's your thoughts on

3718
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:09,639
the Modern genan Pool cuz there are many

3719
02:32:07,159 --> 02:32:10,760
people who are critical that you know

3720
02:32:09,639 --> 02:32:12,959
we're sort of

3721
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,520
bottlenecking uh the the genan pool

3722
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:18,599
that's sort of largely driven by cookies

3723
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:20,760
gelato Skittles backbone you see that

3724
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:22,439
common in many strains to today do you

3725
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:24,439
have any thoughts on this do you see it

3726
02:32:22,439 --> 02:32:26,000
as a negative where do you think we're

3727
02:32:24,439 --> 02:32:29,120
going to go

3728
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:32,040
next my barometer on cultivars is is the

3729
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:34,279
emerald cup because that that is the

3730
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:36,399
heart of Northern California and it is

3731
02:32:34,279 --> 02:32:40,399
uh the premier

3732
02:32:36,398 --> 02:32:42,920
of competition that where where the real

3733
02:32:40,398 --> 02:32:46,439
true Growers of of of Northern

3734
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:49,159
California enter and so the the last cup

3735
02:32:46,439 --> 02:32:51,479
I entered I mean last cup I attended you

3736
02:32:49,159 --> 02:32:53,439
know there there was literally hundreds

3737
02:32:51,478 --> 02:32:56,278
I mean you know I think they stopped at

3738
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:58,159
300 different cultivars of just cannabis

3739
02:32:56,279 --> 02:33:01,520
and and and better yet even more

3740
02:32:58,159 --> 02:33:03,879
mind-blowing is is the California State

3741
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:07,720
Fair like everybody has a state fair

3742
02:33:03,879 --> 02:33:10,759
right in California the state fair not

3743
02:33:07,719 --> 02:33:14,159
only acknowledges cannabis but now just

3744
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:17,600
like you a pi competition the the the

3745
02:33:14,159 --> 02:33:19,920
California State Fair now has a cannabis

3746
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:21,720
competition that just finished enters

3747
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:23,600
entries I think just this week or

3748
02:33:21,719 --> 02:33:26,239
something like that from last year's

3749
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:28,800
Harvest so to speak you know um which

3750
02:33:26,239 --> 02:33:31,119
which is to me is just revolutionary I

3751
02:33:28,799 --> 02:33:34,239
never ever ever ever someone that you

3752
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:36,680
know was arrested for cultivation and uh

3753
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:38,359
of cannabis ever saw a day where where

3754
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:40,559
cannabis would be judged at a county

3755
02:33:38,359 --> 02:33:42,800
fair so you know that's that's about as

3756
02:33:40,559 --> 02:33:45,199
mainstream accept acceptable as you can

3757
02:33:42,799 --> 02:33:46,759
get at this point and you know so so I

3758
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,960
think you know competition both those

3759
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:50,559
competitions uh you know they're they're

3760
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:53,039
blind

3761
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:56,359
competitions th those are are pretty

3762
02:33:53,040 --> 02:34:00,160
much going to you know Drive help Drive

3763
02:33:56,359 --> 02:34:02,279
the trends of the Next Generation so to

3764
02:34:00,159 --> 02:34:04,478
speak you know what I mean will will

3765
02:34:02,279 --> 02:34:06,920
will it be sweet will it be Savory will

3766
02:34:04,478 --> 02:34:09,920
it be you know your candy flavors of

3767
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:13,000
gelato etc etc or you know what will it

3768
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:14,920
be you know so I I find that fascinating

3769
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:18,359
as well but but a lot of it as you said

3770
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:20,719
is hype driven it's uh you know you know

3771
02:34:18,359 --> 02:34:22,600
somebody out there r about it you know

3772
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:25,039
they they they happen to be a rapper

3773
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:28,600
they happen to own multiple dispensaries

3774
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:30,840
they happen to also be associated with

3775
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:33,439
the group that produced major amounts of

3776
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:36,559
genetics and now they're able to march

3777
02:34:33,439 --> 02:34:38,398
from City to City talking about how

3778
02:34:36,559 --> 02:34:42,559
great their cultivars is and how great

3779
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:45,398
their store is etc etc um you know I I I

3780
02:34:42,559 --> 02:34:48,159
I believe that that will probably um

3781
02:34:45,398 --> 02:34:50,239
Garner interest let's say you know um

3782
02:34:48,159 --> 02:34:53,239
and and help Drive their agenda and

3783
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:55,279
their Trend and there's multiples of

3784
02:34:53,239 --> 02:34:57,359
that you know as as well as you know you

3785
02:34:55,279 --> 02:34:59,359
see the celebrity Brands you know what I

3786
02:34:57,359 --> 02:35:03,200
mean um you know from Willie Nelson to

3787
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:06,279
Snoop Dog to Jim balushi to Martha

3788
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:08,079
Stewart dipping into the the game to you

3789
02:35:06,279 --> 02:35:11,479
know I heard I heard at one point the

3790
02:35:08,079 --> 02:35:14,039
number one celebrity brand is W palro go

3791
02:35:11,478 --> 02:35:18,318
figure more more more so than Whiz

3792
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:20,600
Khalifa or Snoop dogs wow or or Seth Ro

3793
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:22,840
or Seth Rogan's Health plant

3794
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:24,800
I think Seth Rogan's brand gets a

3795
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:27,318
surprising amount of backlash because he

3796
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:29,679
really overprices all his stuff and uh

3797
02:35:27,318 --> 02:35:31,199
it seems to seems to not work for him

3798
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:33,040
but the gwenneth ptro one that's

3799
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:34,920
interesting that's kind of funny she's

3800
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:37,160
uh she's had a few funny products she's

3801
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:38,920
released I guess while we're on the

3802
02:35:37,159 --> 02:35:40,959
topic of like existing in the modern

3803
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:43,799
Market do you feel that there is a

3804
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:45,799
future for mum and pop businesses in the

3805
02:35:43,799 --> 02:35:48,119
market and do you feel there are any

3806
02:35:45,799 --> 02:35:51,039
legal changes that might need to occur

3807
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:56,840
to help ensure they ongoing

3808
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:59,240
survival H so yeah I I I I I you know I

3809
02:35:56,840 --> 02:36:02,439
write for periodical that would would

3810
02:35:59,239 --> 02:36:04,799
would prefer that I don't name names and

3811
02:36:02,439 --> 02:36:07,159
and because it's not good for them or me

3812
02:36:04,799 --> 02:36:10,478
or anybody else but but but there had

3813
02:36:07,159 --> 02:36:12,559
but there was a rise of let's call it

3814
02:36:10,478 --> 02:36:15,559
corporations that were funded by

3815
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:17,359
publicly traded Canadian money let's say

3816
02:36:15,559 --> 02:36:19,199
that right there's a there's dozens of

3817
02:36:17,359 --> 02:36:22,920
them so there's there's no throw in

3818
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:25,800
stock stones at anyone a lot of those

3819
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:30,799
are are now one was just delisted from

3820
02:36:25,799 --> 02:36:34,278
the stock exchange uh one has sold the

3821
02:36:30,799 --> 02:36:38,679
majority of their millions of dollars of

3822
02:36:34,279 --> 02:36:40,880
Assets in cultivation aspects uh Assets

3823
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:42,359
in favor of it's a buyer's market we'd

3824
02:36:40,879 --> 02:36:45,920
rather just buy it than produce it

3825
02:36:42,359 --> 02:36:47,640
ourselves so um I I see I see a lot of

3826
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:50,680
people that didn't belong in the

3827
02:36:47,639 --> 02:36:53,478
industry seized the industry they took

3828
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:56,680
over the industry and they pushed out a

3829
02:36:53,478 --> 02:36:59,000
lot of Mom and Pops a lot of people that

3830
02:36:56,680 --> 02:37:02,200
deserve to be in this industry that

3831
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:05,959
built this industry H and help get the

3832
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:10,240
laws passed the way they are um but but

3833
02:37:05,959 --> 02:37:12,318
I I I hope that with the demise of some

3834
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:14,359
of these corporate entities that didn't

3835
02:37:12,318 --> 02:37:17,879
belong in the industry in the first

3836
02:37:14,359 --> 02:37:20,120
place it will create a vacuum that will

3837
02:37:17,879 --> 02:37:24,839
allow those mom and Pops that were

3838
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:28,319
pushed out to reenter the the industry I

3839
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:32,159
I I know people that that pay $400 an

3840
02:37:28,318 --> 02:37:35,000
ounce for marijuana today in California

3841
02:37:32,159 --> 02:37:37,760
and and they're happy to do so because

3842
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:41,200
they go to their favorite grower who has

3843
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:43,120
eight lights who who does not cut

3844
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:45,399
corners does all the right things for

3845
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:47,800
all the right reasons and and and and

3846
02:37:45,398 --> 02:37:50,159
works their ass off as that past

3847
02:37:47,799 --> 02:37:52,519
generation did as those

3848
02:37:50,159 --> 02:37:55,520
uh Legacy Growers did for lack of a

3849
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:59,000
better term um For the Love of doing it

3850
02:37:55,520 --> 02:38:01,359
not for the love of cash you know um and

3851
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:03,359
and and so you know I've got multiple

3852
02:38:01,359 --> 02:38:05,680
friends that would much rather go to

3853
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:09,439
that small mom and pop and spend their

3854
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:13,040
money with them and and I I do as well

3855
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:15,680
and and so um you know and I do proudly

3856
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:19,160
you know and so I I I look forward and

3857
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:22,079
hope that with the demise of of of some

3858
02:38:19,159 --> 02:38:26,559
of these corporate entities that that

3859
02:38:22,079 --> 02:38:28,359
that it will reinvigorate some of the um

3860
02:38:26,559 --> 02:38:31,278
the the mom and pops but more

3861
02:38:28,359 --> 02:38:33,640
importantly I I hope that that that the

3862
02:38:31,279 --> 02:38:39,840
the investors the people that are

3863
02:38:33,639 --> 02:38:39,840
funding those Bad actors uh have have

3864
02:38:40,359 --> 02:38:46,720
um now come to realize that the that the

3865
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:49,840
the the the true deserving people to

3866
02:38:46,719 --> 02:38:51,719
invest in is is the the the the Legacy

3867
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:54,079
Growers and the people who who got us

3868
02:38:51,719 --> 02:38:56,358
where we are today and more so than the

3869
02:38:54,079 --> 02:38:59,039
corporates that don't don't deserve and

3870
02:38:56,359 --> 02:39:01,479
there can end up burning your cash

3871
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:05,120
getting delisted and and going under you

3872
02:39:01,478 --> 02:39:07,879
know as many of them are today yeah 100%

3873
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:10,479
uh support the uh the organic the

3874
02:39:07,879 --> 02:39:12,478
passionate the mom and pop businesses

3875
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:13,318
those who deserve to be involved I love

3876
02:39:12,478 --> 02:39:15,879
that

3877
02:39:13,318 --> 02:39:17,959
sentiment I think that brings us to our

3878
02:39:15,879 --> 02:39:20,239
quickfire questions before we wrap

3879
02:39:17,959 --> 02:39:22,919
things up so the first one I wanted to

3880
02:39:20,239 --> 02:39:25,079
ask you was what's the single most

3881
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:26,279
memorable experience with cannabis

3882
02:39:25,079 --> 02:39:29,520
you've had you know it doesn't have to

3883
02:39:26,279 --> 02:39:31,319
be the most insanely potent dab but just

3884
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:33,399
the most memorable experience that comes

3885
02:39:31,318 --> 02:39:36,079
to mind where cannabis was

3886
02:39:33,398 --> 02:39:38,199
involved uh I I think like I told you

3887
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:41,159
that day I consumed my first uh uh

3888
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:43,640
quality con concentrate um that that

3889
02:39:41,159 --> 02:39:46,200
right there was you know that you talked

3890
02:39:43,639 --> 02:39:47,920
uh or hear interviews with with uh

3891
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:49,479
people about their drug of choice or

3892
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:51,239
something that just went to the Cor

3893
02:39:49,478 --> 02:39:53,438
their brain and that right there was you

3894
02:39:51,239 --> 02:39:56,600
know a significant moment to

3895
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:58,559
me yeah certainly I can I can understand

3896
02:39:56,600 --> 02:40:00,640
your reasoning for that one on the other

3897
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:02,760
end of the spectrum what's a strain that

3898
02:40:00,639 --> 02:40:04,760
was really popular all your friends were

3899
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:06,439
hyping it up you were really Keen to try

3900
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:09,200
and then when you finally did you were

3901
02:40:06,439 --> 02:40:09,200
left a little bit

3902
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:14,799
disappointed some of the bubble gums

3903
02:40:13,079 --> 02:40:16,959
mostly you know what I mean it was just

3904
02:40:14,799 --> 02:40:19,599
a I I suspect that most of the bubble

3905
02:40:16,959 --> 02:40:21,839
gums I ever tried that smelled like

3906
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:24,239
bubble gum were were artificially

3907
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:26,960
enhanced so to speak with some kind of

3908
02:40:24,239 --> 02:40:28,439
uh you know bubble gum essence or

3909
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:30,919
something like that that's probably the

3910
02:40:28,439 --> 02:40:32,720
my most disappointing because it smelled

3911
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:35,040
so good it smelled like you want to eat

3912
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:36,879
it it smelled like just like bubble gum

3913
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:40,279
and then like the smoke it was like so

3914
02:40:36,879 --> 02:40:42,039
disappointing it was a w w w moment yeah

3915
02:40:40,279 --> 02:40:44,520
sure everyone's got their own sort of

3916
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:46,319
stories that's interesting to hear yours

3917
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:48,960
um I'm going to drop you off on a desert

3918
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:50,840
island you can take three strains or

3919
02:40:48,959 --> 02:40:53,438
three packs of seeds with you for the

3920
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:56,559
rest of Life what are you going to be

3921
02:40:53,439 --> 02:40:58,559
growing three what three strains in the

3922
02:40:56,559 --> 02:41:00,119
form of seed yeah like you could you

3923
02:40:58,559 --> 02:41:02,719
could take three clones or you could

3924
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:07,640
take three packs of seeds or any sort of

3925
02:41:02,719 --> 02:41:12,478
mix I'm going to start with my G13

3926
02:41:07,639 --> 02:41:14,159
um geez uh I guess I would try the

3927
02:41:12,478 --> 02:41:16,159
spound on the side of the road Dead

3928
02:41:14,159 --> 02:41:19,879
Skunk as number

3929
02:41:16,159 --> 02:41:22,359
two um I really like Old School

3930
02:41:19,879 --> 02:41:24,478
California orange or or Tangi that it

3931
02:41:22,359 --> 02:41:27,159
morphed into or you know they say

3932
02:41:24,478 --> 02:41:29,920
they're not related but you know a

3933
02:41:27,159 --> 02:41:31,840
cultivar that really smells like a

3934
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:33,719
really nice fresh orange I really

3935
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:36,040
enjoyed that

3936
02:41:33,719 --> 02:41:38,278
cultivar yeah that's gorgeous to hear

3937
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:40,520
like you hear a lot of um you know

3938
02:41:38,279 --> 02:41:42,880
sentiment at times from the American

3939
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:46,120
audience about being burnt out on say

3940
02:41:42,879 --> 02:41:48,079
Tang or train wreck or blue dream but i'

3941
02:41:46,120 --> 02:41:49,359
like to remind everyone that uh for

3942
02:41:48,079 --> 02:41:51,079
pretty much everyone outside of

3943
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:53,479
California they're not burnt out on

3944
02:41:51,079 --> 02:41:55,239
those flavors and Tangi I agree

3945
02:41:53,478 --> 02:41:59,799
incredible stuff I love

3946
02:41:55,239 --> 02:42:02,199
it next question is if you had to start

3947
02:41:59,799 --> 02:42:04,358
a seed company with just one pack of

3948
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:06,520
seeds could be your seeds could be

3949
02:42:04,359 --> 02:42:08,200
another company's seeds what are you

3950
02:42:06,520 --> 02:42:09,640
going to throw your weight behind which

3951
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:12,200
pack you going to

3952
02:42:09,639 --> 02:42:14,840
choose uh it's either the G13 or the

3953
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:17,760
purple kush one of the other both of

3954
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:19,600
those have really defined my my breing

3955
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:20,639
so

3956
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:23,479
that's

3957
02:42:20,639 --> 02:42:25,879
beautiful all right well look on to the

3958
02:42:23,478 --> 02:42:28,039
final question for our interview today

3959
02:42:25,879 --> 02:42:30,920
I've got a time machine for you you can

3960
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:33,240
go back anywhere anytime any place get

3961
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:34,719
seeds clone whatever you want where are

3962
02:42:33,239 --> 02:42:36,478
you going what are you

3963
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:39,358
getting uh

3964
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:42,799
1983 approx to get that found on the

3965
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:47,840
side of the road Dead Skunk cultivar I I

3966
02:42:42,799 --> 02:42:50,438
absolutely loved it the roadkill the one

3967
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:52,880
the original one incredible a lot of

3968
02:42:50,439 --> 02:42:57,359
people speculate it's like an Afghan do

3969
02:42:52,879 --> 02:43:01,879
you have any ideas um in my conversation

3970
02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:04,479
with h sadu Sam Sam the skunk man um who

3971
02:43:01,879 --> 02:43:08,000
created skunk number one he told a tale

3972
02:43:04,478 --> 02:43:10,559
how his while during breeding there came

3973
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,439
a crossroad where his wife preferred the

3974
02:43:10,559 --> 02:43:18,559
sweeter cultivar as opposed to the

3975
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:21,920
more skunkie cultivar so he chose to

3976
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:27,119
take a right and go with the site and

3977
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:28,719
forsake the uh more skunky cultivar um

3978
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:32,920
and then

3979
02:43:28,719 --> 02:43:35,239
that is how that went but then as far as

3980
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:38,200
the the the consumers I believe that you

3981
02:43:35,239 --> 02:43:41,920
know it was Trend driven that you know a

3982
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:43,600
new a new fancy thing came to town and

3983
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:46,520
less and less people started growing

3984
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:49,880
that original skunk and it just faded

3985
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:52,399
away yeah there we go I think hopefully

3986
02:43:49,879 --> 02:43:55,679
in time it'll reemerge and we can all

3987
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:57,840
enjoy it again fingers crossed and with

3988
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:59,439
that I think that just about brings us

3989
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:01,159
to the end of it for this one did you
