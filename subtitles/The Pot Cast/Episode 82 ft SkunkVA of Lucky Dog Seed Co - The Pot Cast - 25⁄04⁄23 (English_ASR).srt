Montana tell me a bit about it when did

88
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,080
this happen

89
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,819
Lucky Dog cannabis uh kind of was

90
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,300
conceptualized uh a long long time ago

91
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,899
but this particular version of it is you

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,260
know

93
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,500
uh we uh we started here in February of

94
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:48,959
21 uh right after coven covet actually

95
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,419
uh prevented us from getting a lot of

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
the uh licensing requirements like the

97
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,958
inspection and just a lot of the

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,799
paperwork that has to be done here in

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,199
Montana beautiful Montana Bozeman and uh

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,019
you know so that's that's kind of how it

101
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,119
is and uh I made a big move from Sonoma

102
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,980
County to here to kind of make this

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,680
happen

104
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,840
um just want to be in the legal space

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,400
the legal cannabis space

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,439
um just because I feel like in the

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
future it's going to be absolutely

108
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,259
necessary to be part of a to be part of

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,180
cannabis in the future uh to

110
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,259
have a licensed facility so that's what

111
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,360
we're doing here

112
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,100
that's awesome to hear I guess the first

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,379
question that jumps to mind is how would

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,300
you compare Montana to California in

115
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,519
terms of the scene and maybe some of the

116
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,199
legalities

117
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:41,698
well Montana is a reddish purplish State

118
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,800
and they have an interesting population

119
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:48,840
here and I fit in very well here because

120
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,240
freedom is Big here not just in word but

121
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,519
in action and I appreciate that it

122
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,740
motivates me and inspires me

123
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,659
and I'm always going to have my heart in

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,418
California of course the Bay Area is

125
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,840
where I kind of grew up after

126
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,819
you know I left Virginia and Grateful

127
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,159
Dead tour was over raised my family

128
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,779
there my daughter there so but it's

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,600
changed a lot the climate's changed

130
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,219
there a lot and and then cannabis has

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,540
changed a lot there because it's very

132
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,660
difficult for

133
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,979
a small operator like myself to function

134
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,360
there

135
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:28,439
um the regulation Loop uh hurdles the

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:32,400
obstacles of distribution and it just

137
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,439
didn't work out for me there so I how I

138
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,000
got here is a long story we can get into

139
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,300
that some other time

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,459
and uh but I'm happy to be here and so

141
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,960
the way it's different here is I would

142
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:48,180
say that the consumer here is more

143
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,299
geared at least my consumer customers

144
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,160
that come here are more geared towards

145
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,960
like older school like they're

146
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,740
interested in what they had in high

147
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,620
school

148
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,180
and I was surprised to find out that

149
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,160
even though there's only a million

150
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,000
people in Montana it seems like

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,479
everybody here consumes cannabis and so

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,639
I have the opportunity to you know talk

153
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,399
directly to my customers again something

154
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,780
that I'd had to let go of when I was in

155
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,019
my early 20s

156
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,599
turkey bags on beds you know suitcases

157
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:25,318
and duffel bags full of

158
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,639
you know Kush and Sour Diesel going far

159
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,919
far places so I've learned here that uh

160
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,740
you know I've gotten back in touch with

161
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,620
the consumer directly and I love it it

162
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,019
inspires me I love to be around the joy

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,519
that cannabis brings people

164
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,198
and when people are just trying to make

165
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,299
a hundred dollars here and there there's

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,879
no joy in that you know it's just the

167
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,720
way you survive but when you are able to

168
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,360
show a consumer 71 different options of

169
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,919
strains we have 44 on the in the display

170
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,560
case right now

171
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,939
I mean you can find and talk to them and

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,740
find what they want based on what

173
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,660
they've seen and what I've noticed is a

174
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,240
lot of folks young and old they kind of

175
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,620
go back to what they remember what they

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,720
fell in love with when it comes to

177
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,300
cannabis and we have plenty of options

178
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,180
for them you know we have the new and

179
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,340
the old and so yeah

180
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,978
um yeah that's pretty much it and as far

181
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,359
as the regulations go I never really did

182
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,959
it in California but I was close enough

183
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,139
to see how difficult it was there and

184
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,560
although I don't I don't really do well

185
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,900
with regulations in general I uh have

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,300
found that I can adapt to what is asking

187
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,219
me here so I have

188
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,319
it's mostly just a bunch of letting go

189
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,819
of you know that's [ __ ] stupid

190
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,098
you gotta Bend to the will of the man

191
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,319
right that's interesting all of that

192
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:51,300
info and I would love to dive into some

193
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,979
of the strains you have on offer I guess

194
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,020
the first thing I'd be interested in

195
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:57,899
knowing is for anyone listening to this

196
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,598
there's basically every clone only

197
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,719
you've ever drilled over in this display

198
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,939
case so my question is do you feel like

199
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,979
your customers are aware of how spoiled

200
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,399
they are in terms of they've got

201
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:13,620
basically like the top 41 most in-demand

202
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,959
client onlys at their fingertips do you

203
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,000
think most of them realize this they do

204
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,459
have a slight view of it

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,019
um when they come in I you know my

206
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,899
perception is just between me and my

207
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:27,538
customers between my customer and

208
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:29,758
another company a flower shop or what

209
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:32,639
have you I don't really have that

210
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,879
perception so what I do know is that

211
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,620
when folks come in they I you know I

212
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,958
with a few questions because I love

213
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,719
cannabis too I can kind of narrow down

214
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,579
where we're going to go and it's a lot

215
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,700
of fun for me because we're both

216
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,259
discovering new things together and I

217
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,360
love it you know I have customers that

218
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,278
come in here hang out and talk about

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,159
you know purely what they're looking at

220
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,439
and what what they've experienced for 20

221
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,819
30 minutes you know and I'll spend every

222
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,080
minute with them and usually they're the

223
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,360
ones that are trying to get away from me

224
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,639
because I'm leveling our mind with

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,278
cannabinoid and terpene and brain

226
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,139
chemistry information and you know

227
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,759
trying to explain to them that THC

228
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,179
percentages don't really matter that

229
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,259
much and why don't they matter and so I

230
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,359
love it because it's given me the

231
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,778
opportunity to kind of you know

232
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,240
re-educate a cannabis user as to what we

233
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:26,759
now know about cannabis and you know why

234
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,919
we all love different things and you

235
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,240
know why we're drawing why you know the

236
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,879
individuals are drawn to different

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,680
things you know so it's kind of like a

238
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,120
discovery for them so I would say that

239
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,859
it's mostly

240
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,500
you know the thing I've noticed about

241
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,000
the account my consumers that come in is

242
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,799
that they want to try everything it's

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
like a winery they want to go through

244
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,979
the flight of course it's going to take

245
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,080
you a couple weeks because we have so

246
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,259
much but you know we will get there

247
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,379
we'll go from the A to B and down to C D

248
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:58,559
E and F you know we got it all so my

249
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,240
favorite comment when I show someone

250
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,039
um and let them you know take in the

251
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,560
aroma is

252
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,120
man that smells like high school and I'm

253
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,000
like that's the one for you then because

254
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,919
I know exactly what you mean you know so

255
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,778
that's brilliant I like the um the

256
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,179
analogy of taking him on a journey and

257
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,399
I'd be interested to know what has

258
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,439
unexpectedly caught you off guard as

259
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,240
popular are there any strains that you

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,519
thought maybe you know they're too

261
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,720
strong for most people or just you

262
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,459
didn't think it was going to be a crowd

263
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,759
favor but it's turned out to be like a

264
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:32,759
really big hit well I would say that the

265
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,819
the the answer to that would be not

266
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,159
necessarily new streams but uh streams

267
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,500
that have been with us for a while uh

268
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,500
Durban Poison comes to mind that's never

269
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,958
really been a popular stream as you know

270
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,860
so to speak in all my circles in life

271
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:53,399
but up here they really do like that you

272
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,039
know jet fuel you know energetic

273
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,019
um feeling they like it you know so I've

274
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,059
learned a lot about what people like by

275
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,039
being here because you know you make

276
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,078
assumptions you know about what you like

277
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,259
and what someone else may like based on

278
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,519
those assumptions of what you enjoy and

279
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,019
I've learned that that's definitely not

280
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,060
the case you know I've gotten

281
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,679
reintroduced to that fact that it's just

282
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,359
not the case that you just never know

283
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,578
and you have to take the time with

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,740
someone and go through it with them and

285
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,838
so you know luckily for us even though

286
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,700
we have probably more strains on the

287
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,760
table than anyone else in this in this

288
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,079
uh beautiful state

289
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,019
um you know we've been I've been

290
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,759
collecting these for a long time and uh

291
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,078
you know the things that I held on to

292
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,720
that it weren't never really popular

293
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,539
were are very popular here and so that's

294
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,579
been a big surprise for me also you know

295
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,139
pleasant surprise you know because we

296
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,639
could talk him all day long but there's

297
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,500
so many different things you know and

298
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,819
those folks they try Kim and people come

299
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,100
in and they're very Frank with me about

300
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,560
why they use cannabis and it's just it's

301
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,079
a treasure to me I love it you know it's

302
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,179
rewarding again you know there you go

303
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,338
well look I gotta tie it in you know

304
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,519
this has to be one of probably the only

305
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:07,380
places you can get verified chem 91

306
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:10,259
flower uh to purchase what to you what

307
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,639
conditions do you feel chem 91 works

308
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,278
best for and have you ever had any

309
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,159
customers sort of do the the fabled

310
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,620
story of taking some home consuming it

311
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,980
becoming a bit uncomfortably numb it's a

312
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,620
little too strong or comfortably High

313
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,339
um honestly no I I uh I've been

314
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,500
surprised on the a level of consumption

315
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,019
well at least in my experience with

316
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,360
these customers I'm always Blown Away by

317
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,879
you know you know like their tolerance

318
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,919
and like how much you know they like

319
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,419
powerful cannabis I don't have many

320
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,620
people come through this door and say

321
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,958
hey give me you know do you have

322
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,278
something that's just not that strong I

323
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,679
mean that's a that's a thing out there

324
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,778
but I don't get a lot of that

325
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,338
um so the way I do it here and the way

326
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:57,179
we do it here

327
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:59,459
um is that like you know obviously we

328
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,239
all agree that you know most of us agree

329
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:05,219
that there's the Indica sativa you know

330
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,500
nomenclature is not really accurate it's

331
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,120
it's got a purpose to it and but it's

332
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,339
just not accurate so I try to steer

333
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,019
people away from that and I try to find

334
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,880
out you know what what when do they like

335
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,679
to smoke you know do they like to smoke

336
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,659
in the morning or do they like to smoke

337
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,000
in the daytime do they like to smoke

338
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,100
anytime do they like to smoke night time

339
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,379
and that helps us narrow it down to what

340
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,879
we're looking for you know and some some

341
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,578
folks come in and they're they're

342
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,679
clearly looking for a relief of an

343
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:34,078
ailment that's happened still it's real

344
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,419
and so that makes it even easier when

345
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,059
it's like that you know sleep

346
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,458
um stress you know my body hurts those

347
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,619
types of things so we just ask some

348
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,138
questions you know and we narrow it down

349
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,879
and you know I've noticed you know when

350
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,159
I first started doing this and selling

351
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,379
to the public

352
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,360
um I I kind of

353
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,220
um you know felt like you know I got to

354
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,720
be quick with these folks and I found

355
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,519
out that I wasn't really the case they

356
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,440
want me to spend the time they want us

357
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,019
here at Lucky Dog cannabis to spend the

358
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
time with them to help them understand

359
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,440
what they're going to be consuming why

360
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,939
that you know what the and then of

361
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,980
course when they come back I mean my

362
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,620
customers are are like my family here

363
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,600
they're like we talk about our lives we

364
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,899
pick up where we left off last week if

365
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,899
that's the case and I enjoy that and and

366
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,820
getting to know them allows me to you

367
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,679
know kind of pinpoint hey maybe you want

368
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,360
to try this you know maybe you want to

369
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,620
stay away from this maybe this one's

370
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
going to give you too much anxiety

371
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,159
possibly maybe this one's going to make

372
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,360
you too sleepy and that's not I know

373
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,679
that's not what you want you want to go

374
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,019
golfing with your buddies or whatever

375
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,838
you know so

376
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,778
um you know I I just I don't think that

377
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,760
you know if I had if it was a much

378
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:45,958
bigger company I don't think that we

379
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,778
would be able to have that kind of

380
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,759
personalized service but here we do and

381
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:53,519
I you know I really enjoy it so as far

382
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,740
as like the Kim 91 goes you know I

383
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,259
always tell folks that it's basically

384
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,419
good for any time anything you want to

385
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,458
do and then I mean you know to be honest

386
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,039
I say especially at four in the morning

387
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:08,819
after a long night you know with uh you

388
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,740
know say a Brighton vibrant psychedelic

389
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,139
experience and the sun's coming up

390
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,698
there's no better time to consume chem

391
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,500
91 than that

392
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:18,719
but you can get up in the morning and

393
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,940
smoke it and you can smoke it all day

394
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,079
it's medicinal you know if you're hungry

395
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,839
it's certainly going to help you with

396
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,939
that you know so you know it's it's in

397
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,560
any time herb here you know and I've in

398
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,300
the past you know I've always said that

399
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,000
you know maybe this is the more narcotic

400
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:35,159
more but then when I get other people's

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,259
experience and that's a key point is

402
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,120
that my experience is one thing I have

403
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,338
my brain chemistry but everyone else has

404
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,659
different brain chemistries and so I

405
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,880
always make sure to get the feedback

406
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,559
from them because I learned more from

407
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,600
them than they learn from me I don't

408
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,638
know if they know that but they're

409
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,459
different experience than mine you know

410
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,198
enlightens me and I appreciate that and

411
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,838
then that allows me to kind of reflect

412
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,919
on it and to share that with the next

413
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,040
customer

414
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:04,019
so yeah I would say the Kim 91

415
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,480
experience you know a lot of people come

416
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,220
here just to have the chem 91 or the

417
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
crossroad count they've heard about it

418
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,220
and this is their chance to try it you

419
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
know and this is the plate this would be

420
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,759
the place to get it and so you know we

421
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
have a lot of Tourism here in Montana

422
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,259
and we have had a lot of people come

423
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,899
from out of town search us out and then

424
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,059
come and try real chemdog 91.

425
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,480
that's brilliant it sounds in general

426
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:30,719
like the Montana uh clientele base or

427
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,759
the you know patrons of the business a

428
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,920
more educated and sort of interested in

429
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,319
finding out a bit more as you said out

430
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,120
of curiosity do you still find there are

431
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,519
still a lot of those same Trends you see

432
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,100
in California like I guess maybe a way

433
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,759
to distill it down is uh is is cookies

434
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,980
still pervasive in Montana for example

435
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,079
um I wouldn't be able to answer that

436
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,440
accurately because my ex my perception

437
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,000
is not it doesn't include that

438
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,060
um so

439
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,759
I don't really get you know and I don't

440
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,259
think I can't say this is this is uh uh

441
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,759
you know something that would be across

442
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,439
the board here in Montana but my

443
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,818
experience is you know folks don't

444
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,439
really come in here looking for the

445
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:12,779
strain they heard of I have some of

446
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:17,160
those strains and I've been surprised

447
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:20,279
that uh how very little I I um you know

448
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,740
sell to a consumer of that it surprised

449
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,779
me the the gelato 41 for instance you

450
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,939
know I think it's tremendous I love it I

451
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:28,980
love the smell I offer it to people

452
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,480
oftentimes and they usually don't even

453
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,940
want to look at it and I'm not I can't

454
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,679
really tell you why I sensed that

455
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,960
they've tried it somewhere else maybe

456
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,519
and that that they already had decided

457
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,220
that it's not for them

458
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,160
we don't really have any cookies streams

459
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,380
here as far as I know

460
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,759
um we do have chop Cherry you know I

461
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,740
don't know how these are really related

462
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,259
to that but they in my mind they're kind

463
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,940
of a part of that group

464
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,960
um you know of course we have the tits

465
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,500
this is the [ __ ] uh by D-Back genetics

466
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,740
um and uh grandpa I think it goes by and

467
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,400
it does have the ogkb in it so that's in

468
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,279
there

469
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,200
and that one's been moderately popular

470
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,119
maybe not as Pop it's one of my

471
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,759
favorites so I don't think it's quite on

472
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,678
that level with the consumer most of the

473
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,259
people come in they've heard of older

474
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,440
School strains that we have you know or

475
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,179
they've maybe heard you know uh me

476
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,700
talking about in the past and wanted to

477
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,320
try it and then we have you know lots of

478
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,660
colonies that everyone's heard of you

479
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,399
know so but we don't have a lot of that

480
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,980
kind of stuff and we don't get asked

481
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,960
about it a lot and

482
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,519
um you know that's kind of that's all I

483
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,980
got on that really it's it's a little

484
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,798
bit of a weird perception I got because

485
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,839
of what we do have you know yeah no

486
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,220
that's that's a good answer and you you

487
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,720
made me

488
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,220
um sort of remember one of the patreon

489
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,500
submitted questions we got which was

490
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,298
that on a recent episode we were

491
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,519
speaking to Tom Hill and he sort of said

492
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:58,619
that um it was a bit unexpected that he

493
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,379
he'd try to sample a gelato 33 and he

494
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:03,418
was pretty into it and uh one of our

495
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,919
patreon listeners was wondering are

496
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,900
there any other modern strains besides

497
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,700
maybe the July 41 you just mentioned

498
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,580
that sort of caught you off guard a bit

499
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,679
and you are interested in or fond of so

500
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:17,038
to speak yeah I mean we have a lot of

501
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,640
things that I are new to me you could

502
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,220
say and I don't know if anything caught

503
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,120
me off surprise like that

504
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,919
um

505
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,259
you know I'm kind of particular about

506
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,840
what I prefer I do like the skunk dog

507
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:32,940
that's kind of new to me but it's in the

508
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,558
same realm as everything else that I you

509
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,400
know love

510
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:42,079
um oh and I do have a a good cut of uh

511
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,720
Wedding Crasher afino that uh my partner

512
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:48,599
uh selected you know years ago and she

513
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,700
was kind enough to share with me and

514
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,918
that one's been surprising to me and I

515
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,679
think that would be one that I could you

516
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,960
know say would answer that question and

517
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,380
that is like it's a mellow it's very

518
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,380
smooth it's easy going it's any time and

519
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,480
I'm almost I'm 49 years old and I've you

520
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,299
know cannabis now that's kind of where

521
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm at I like Smooth easy you know I

522
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,538
don't need like the big heavy whack me

523
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,640
in the top of the head experience

524
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:16,440
anymore with it I just want you know

525
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
something that tastes good and makes me

526
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,860
feel relaxed you know so I would say

527
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,120
that was a surprise to me that's a new

528
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,219
one to me

529
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,399
um symbiotic genetics I believe created

530
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,679
that one I and this Fino here is the

531
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,679
best I've seen and I'm glad to have it

532
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,380
and I I often you know take uh less

533
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,380
experienced smokers or older folks who

534
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,700
are delving into cannabis and I kind of

535
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,860
guide him to that and I said you know

536
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,600
it's got a nice grape flavor to it you

537
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:45,178
can't you know complain about the flavor

538
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,279
and it's not a big commitment when you

539
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,780
smoke which I think you know you have to

540
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,058
be careful you know like not everybody

541
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,619
wants it comes to the door wants a you

542
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:55,500
know the strongest weed you got you know

543
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,879
what I mean and so that that one is I

544
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,640
think that would be one that was a

545
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,260
surprise to me you know yeah great

546
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,538
answer I wasn't expecting to hear that

547
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,339
while we're on the topic what have you

548
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:06,900
been smoking on lately what's the sort

549
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,159
of things if I asked you at the end of

550
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,500
the day what are you being puffing on

551
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,120
what things are your go-to

552
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,798
um well the Wedding Crasher is a good

553
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,178
one for me and I'm always smoking on

554
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:20,879
tits uh I really do like the uh red

555
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,740
Lebanese hash plant that's my go-to at

556
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,559
night that's my night time let's go to

557
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,599
bed I'd like I have a lot of uh you know

558
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:30,418
body pains you know working my whole

559
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,819
life doing too much so I have some body

560
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,038
pain so I like to I tend to always fall

561
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,740
towards the indicas

562
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,480
um but you know I try to have a little

563
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,779
bit of everything I try to try a little

564
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,240
different things I've been pleasantly

565
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:47,158
surprised with

566
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,200
um let's see what are we looking at of

567
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,380
course I love the Durban Thai high flyer

568
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,759
so that would be my daytime thing but

569
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,260
Crossroad chem is still my favorite and

570
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,779
I know it sounds kind of cuckoo because

571
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,700
I made it but I love it I like weed

572
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,798
that's perfectly right down the middle I

573
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,900
like hybrids that are perfectly right

574
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,359
down the middle any timer and that one

575
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,820
hits that box big time it's got good

576
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,538
flavor you can smoke anytime it's just

577
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:15,480
gonna get you happier and more relaxed

578
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:16,558
and more you know engaged in what you're

579
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,599
doing it doesn't matter if you're going

580
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,700
to the bank if you're taking the kids to

581
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,798
the park if you're walking your dog it's

582
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,360
good for everything so it's always my

583
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,819
go-to and it's my most popular stream

584
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,099
nice one and you just mentioned the dirt

585
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,839
and tire high flyer I wanted to ask you

586
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,459
because you find that with a lot of

587
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,779
breeders they tend to sort of stick to

588
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,340
one lane like maybe they're more into

589
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:37,619
indicas and they just sort of do Indica

590
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,418
stuff but you do tend to with both

591
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,119
within your dispensary and within your

592
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:45,299
seeds offer a bit of a mix of sativa and

593
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:48,418
indica offerings what in your opinion is

594
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:50,339
your most sativa seed offering

595
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,100
seed offering

596
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:55,759
um

597
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,219
it probably would be

598
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,658
[Music]

599
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,400
um

600
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,080
I don't know it's kind of a toss-up I

601
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,960
mean the Chaska is probably the most

602
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,819
sativa like strain that I offer in seat

603
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,840
form

604
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,899
um

605
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,000
but I would say that one I would say

606
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,220
that but the Chaska

607
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,019
um you know we've done the Russell so

608
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,100
yeah I would I would also add the chem

609
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,200
flyer though what I liked about the

610
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:21,899
camouflage so I'm not really you know I

611
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,538
probably have less experience with pure

612
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,759
sativas as you say than most people you

613
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,919
talk to it just wasn't my Lane when I

614
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,319
was younger but I think as most cannabis

615
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,080
users who you know are as we're aging we

616
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,658
find out that this changes over time and

617
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,038
I have really fallen in love with a nice

618
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,280
sativa

619
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:43,740
I like the the the the the the lack of

620
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,480
appetite I like the energetic part of it

621
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,000
what I didn't like when I was younger

622
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,940
was the anxiety it brought on to me and

623
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,319
so I would say that the chem flyer the

624
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,279
cross I made with the Durban Thai high

625
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:58,500
flyer crossed with the Kim 91 bx3 male

626
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,899
it's it's got that for me it gives me

627
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,400
the energy it wakes me up it wants it's

628
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,620
great with coffee I want to go out and

629
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,720
do stuff but I never feel jittery I

630
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,339
don't feel my heart racing I don't feel

631
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,620
like all these things that I don't like

632
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,899
about that type of herb and so I really

633
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,000
enjoy that and I love that sharp

634
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,100
pineapple flavor I mean who doesn't love

635
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,079
that you know it's Unique you can't say

636
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,538
it's fruity you can't say it's gassy

637
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:24,000
it's sharp you know astringent and I

638
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:26,480
love that flavor so as long as I don't

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,240
get like caught up in too much thought

640
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,460
crippled with too much thought or you

641
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,558
know just anxiety

642
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,058
borderline I find that to be really

643
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,178
uncomfortable for me I think a lot of

644
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:42,119
people agree and so that's kind of it I

645
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,220
would say that Kim flyer the Russell but

646
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,279
the chask is definitely the most whoa

647
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,620
you know energetic you know for I've had

648
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,558
a lot of Kim Fuego Finos over the over

649
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,558
the course of uh testing those out they

650
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,079
gave me that that experience where I

651
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,759
felt inspired creative you know

652
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,178
energetic the things that I think people

653
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:05,700
describe sativa with but without the

654
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,100
jittery you know and I don't like the

655
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,259
appetite uh I don't like the

656
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:12,119
um you know the Kim dog makes me

657
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,980
extremely hungry you know and I don't

658
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,959
really care for that you know because

659
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,058
I'm kind of I succumb to that I can't

660
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,440
really fight that off you know so that's

661
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,019
what I like about this TV is this

662
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,058
sativas are new to me in a sense I would

663
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,519
say relatively new to me in my

664
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:28,259
perception than most folks and I'm

665
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,700
really enjoying it I'm glad that I'm

666
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,019
discovering it at this point in my life

667
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,019
you know

668
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,579
that's awesome to hear I too am just

669
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,220
getting more and more intensity versus

670
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,259
each day goes by so piggybacking on that

671
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,960
thought tell me a little bit about the

672
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:45,599
Russell because it uses a jackhara bx2

673
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,298
female and so I guess the questions that

674
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,639
come to mind are uh what cutting did you

675
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,619
use initially what mail did you pair to

676
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,419
it to start the process and were there

677
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,579
anything specifically you wanted to

678
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,038
improve on that Jack Herer clone I guess

679
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,199
well the Jack Herrera is you know a

680
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,720
legendary kite it's got the not just

681
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,400
lemon but the lime flavor to it and I

682
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,839
think that makes it unique I think

683
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,080
there's a lot of dreams that have that

684
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,459
lemon citrusy flavor and Aroma and I

685
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,819
think the Jack Herer is unique because

686
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,440
it it has that lime as well and so I

687
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,019
like that I like that

688
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,179
it's like a multi-layered citrus

689
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:23,339
astringent Citrus and I love that about

690
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,038
it like I said before when I started

691
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:27,839
working with uh with it that cut and

692
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,778
messing around with what's going to come

693
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,599
next what I noticed was that the figure

694
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:35,339
wasn't the best on that cut at least in

695
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,599
that moment it wasn't I've been growing

696
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,879
the Jack career for a while and it's

697
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,019
actually you know I get big yields out

698
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,000
of it so maybe I just didn't have it

699
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,278
dialed in but what I felt was that the

700
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,980
the production was a little on the

701
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,240
weaker side and I wanted to improve that

702
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,819
you know

703
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,558
so I did use the bx2 in the first

704
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:55,678
outcross and then I crossed it back and

705
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,019
made the bx2 the Jack herrer bx2 the

706
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,240
goal was to keep the Terps keep the that

707
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,099
lemon lime flavor keep of course keep

708
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,798
that you know high-powered sativa

709
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:06,418
feeling that you many of us feel when

710
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,700
they smoke

711
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,038
um but I wanted bigger yields more

712
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,900
bigger which is you know at the very top

713
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,720
of my list you know that's one of the

714
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,480
higher parts of you know traits that I'm

715
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,819
always breeding for is bigger I want the

716
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,798
end user to have the experience of like

717
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:25,019
look what I did over here with this

718
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,700
particular plant you know because I know

719
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:29,158
what it feels like and I appreciate that

720
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,519
and you know you know when you're a home

721
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,740
grower you've got a 10 or a small grow

722
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,839
maybe and this is changing of course but

723
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,940
maybe your environment's not 100 perfect

724
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,058
maybe it's difficult for you to do that

725
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,740
maybe you live in a state where it's

726
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:46,259
very difficult to create the perfect

727
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,759
environment just for safety reasons and

728
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:50,940
so I'm always thinking about that human

729
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,220
that may man or that woman and then I

730
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,038
want them to have the experience of like

731
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,720
success you know that they pulled

732
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,819
something off because that when you're

733
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,778
growing cannabis I think that's one of

734
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,720
the most

735
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:06,659
rewarding parts of it is that wow look

736
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,759
what I can do I can do this you know and

737
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,100
I you know why I like that is because

738
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,259
that I feel like that translates into

739
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,480
other parts of your life you know you

740
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:17,158
can Empower yourself with

741
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,480
all kinds of things you find out that

742
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,159
you've been paying other people to do

743
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,079
for you and now you can do this you know

744
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,299
I think that's what makes life better

745
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,220
and so I want my customers to have that

746
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:27,720
experience and I'm trying always to have

747
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,538
let them have that I'm trying to

748
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,759
facilitate that and so that's why I

749
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:35,400
decided to make the bx2 instead of the

750
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,839
Jack Herer just in the cross I wanted to

751
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,140
see if I can get more bigger I felt like

752
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,298
we did and we kept the Terps we kept the

753
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,000
the essential experience of the Jack

754
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:47,519
Herer and then we just added some punch

755
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,319
to it with the chem dog you know yeah

756
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,599
and I I might have missed it did you

757
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:54,960
mention what was the mail you used to

758
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,519
start the outcross the Kim dbx2 yeah oh

759
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,620
okay and then at that point when I

760
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,619
popped that first generation of F1 seeds

761
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:04,019
I saw that maybe it would be a good idea

762
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,119
to create our own female to work with

763
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,918
and it wasn't really like a big master

764
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,899
plan it was kind of like what we're

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,419
[ __ ] around and then we found a bx2

766
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,600
that was very Jack Herrera lemon lime

767
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:17,038
you know very vigorous and very and it

768
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,599
was like well why don't we use this

769
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,000
instead of the Jack Herer you know we're

770
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,658
allowed to do that and so that's what I

771
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,519
did you know yeah nice one nice and uh

772
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:29,520
in that same vein you know you did the

773
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,139
Chaska with the super silver haze bx2 is

774
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,759
that a similar story are there any

775
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,820
differences with that one

776
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,019
it is it's it is a little bit similar

777
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:39,480
but it's also a little bit different

778
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,639
there was a I had a cut of super so

779
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,519
right now I have here at Lucky Dog

780
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,880
cannabis I have the super silver haze as

781
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,639
they say 98 Cup winner cut and it's the

782
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,240
most I would say it's the most uh you

783
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,700
know Common cut that you see and uh you

784
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,980
know but I had a cut in the early 2000s

785
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,640
that was in my opinion better a super

786
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,380
silver haze it was

787
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,820
it was it grew it had more of like a the

788
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,440
structure was more like a cookie

789
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:09,778
structure it had like the nut the the

790
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,940
like tighter nugs as you go up the stick

791
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:13,558
you know it wasn't like the big Cola

792
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,720
that you get with the super silver haze

793
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,298
you know with a shorter plant and it

794
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,339
stretched a little bit more so I uh

795
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:22,139
actually I I kind of accidentally made

796
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,519
seeds of that by accident a long time

797
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,140
ago

798
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,538
um I would like to tell you what the

799
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,240
mail was but uh I can't really recall

800
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:33,480
because I did this in like 2006. so I

801
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,519
had those seeds in storage and I got the

802
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,038
cut of the 98 cup the one that's common

803
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,460
nowadays and of course they smelled

804
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:44,640
almost identical uh the smoke

805
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,899
uh effect was almost identical but I

806
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,240
just really like the way the other one

807
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:49,379
tasted better and I like the way the

808
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,620
plant

809
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:55,080
overall looked better you know

810
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:58,139
um it was really mold resistant you know

811
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:00,058
and like it just it just it just was my

812
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,880
favorite one and it had already started

813
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:05,339
the work kind of you know coincidentally

814
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,559
you know like so I took that and I

815
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,918
selected a uh

816
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:13,440
um a male and I went back to that uh to

817
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,759
that to that lady back then and those

818
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,340
seeds have been in storage for a long

819
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,679
time and so when I got this cut I was

820
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:22,019
hoping it was the same cut and it wasn't

821
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,360
and so I started popping those and I

822
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,579
found myself a nice female and I said

823
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,859
you know we could either use this cut or

824
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:31,319
we could use that seed Ling and that's

825
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:33,479
what I chose to do hoping that I would

826
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,099
get some of that structure

827
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,079
to be honest though I don't really feel

828
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:39,839
like I succeeded on that structure part

829
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:42,599
of that cross I feel like

830
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,220
it's you know mixed all up it doesn't

831
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,619
seem like it really did but it's just

832
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,778
what I used and the effect was the same

833
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,479
the flavor was the same it was just my

834
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:53,038
favorite so I just went with it you know

835
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,240
yeah I mean that's a great answer and

836
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,339
it's cool to hear that it's a bit

837
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,339
different from the the more available

838
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:02,339
one while we're talking about breeding

839
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:05,099
uh I think as of yet we really only see

840
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,898
mostly F1 hybrids being offered do you

841
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:08,819
have any interest in doing any line

842
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:10,619
breeding or do you feel like you're just

843
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,319
happy to be offering f1s and as a

844
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:15,959
follow-up how about Femmes

845
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,178
okay so I get this question a lot from

846
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,860
people when I when I get into deeper

847
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,399
conversations about what they're looking

848
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:25,319
for and I always try to remind folks

849
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,500
that there's a place you know for

850
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,898
everything you know uh for Femmes and

851
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,538
f1s and so on and so forth and My

852
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:36,058
Philosophy is that nature intended for

853
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:38,759
cannabis to be

854
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:41,879
to survive the species to survive in the

855
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,919
F1 stage that that's the diversity of

856
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,260
you know provides like the best chance

857
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,778
for survival and of course you know we

858
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,839
have manipulated nature and survival is

859
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:54,659
really not why no one's breeding for

860
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,959
survival we're rooting for genetic

861
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,960
preservation we're breeding for uh Vigor

862
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,440
we're trying to improve our favorite

863
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,019
traits with other favorite traits and

864
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,820
that's what I do so I stick with the f1s

865
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,819
and I if you know I've made I've made

866
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:14,579
femini seeds in the past you know and I

867
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:17,339
would say that I what we do what I do at

868
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,259
lucky dog is this it's really simple we

869
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,259
take our favorite cuts

870
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:24,298
and we cross them with our favorite male

871
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:25,919
and what he does and we have two

872
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:28,259
different males but what what they do is

873
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,299
they the idea was never to like

874
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,500
everything is going to be like Kim now

875
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:33,658
we're going to take your favorite cut

876
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,759
and we're going to cross our mail and

877
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,220
I'm gonna make it so yours is now Kim

878
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,379
that is a failure and a lot of my trial

879
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,319
and error that's what happened we kept

880
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,120
picking you know studs that were a

881
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,418
little too dominant I think most people

882
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:51,298
who breed with chem dog can agree that

883
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:55,200
chem dog is very dominant you know he

884
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:56,519
she dominates you know its partner and

885
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,899
so that can be problematic because

886
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,220
that's not what you're trying to do you

887
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:02,178
know you're just trying to add a little

888
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,278
extra goodness to it so what we do here

889
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:07,860
is you know the F1 generation has a lot

890
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,139
of variance a lot of uh genetic you know

891
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,699
traits that you don't see in any either

892
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,378
one of the parents and so that can be a

893
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,539
problem you know people don't want to

894
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:18,059
buy a pack of season have 13 different

895
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,259
phenos or six different phenos they want

896
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:21,838
to like they have an idea of what the

897
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,980
looking for before they even look at the

898
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:24,599
pictures they have an idea what they're

899
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,418
looking for as soon as they see the

900
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,000
cross so the trial and error over here

901
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,638
was that you know we we take the stud

902
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,378
and we've the way we selected him our

903
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,500
way I select at least I say we but it

904
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:39,418
says me selected him was to find him

905
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:45,659
find the one that's going to bring the

906
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:48,598
most Vigor that's top and add potency

907
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,820
um and add some gas flavor some fuel but

908
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:54,059
not overpower the mother you know and

909
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,039
furthermore to to keep it limited to say

910
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,139
three or four different phenos you know

911
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,639
not a million different things and so

912
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,159
the way we do that is that's where the

913
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,779
testing comes in we make the cross and a

914
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,639
lot of times it doesn't work I have a

915
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,560
whole dresser drawer full of seeds that

916
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,539
I don't feel like worked with cross's

917
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:12,420
favorite cuts

918
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:13,739
um and you know we wanted the testing

919
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,720
what we do is of course we're looking

920
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:17,879
for stability we're looking for the

921
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,858
Vigor but we're also trying to say okay

922
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,480
you know no matter how many we pop we

923
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:22,980
keep finding the same four females

924
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,900
roughly you know of course there's some

925
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,639
variants in that and if we do that then

926
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,559
we've succeeded they know what they're

927
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,139
looking for you know if someone wants to

928
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,059
buy Kim Fuego they know what headband is

929
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:34,920
they know what sour band or I'm sorry

930
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:36,838
Sour Diesel is and they know what chem

931
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,420
dog is so they don't want like some

932
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,619
Oddball you know usually and they're

933
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,019
probably going to get one every day once

934
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,820
in a while this is F1 generation but the

935
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,338
work's been done and you know we've

936
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,320
looked at it and we've said you know I

937
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:51,299
would I would smoke this I smoked this I

938
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,640
would buy this I would grow it again and

939
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,619
if those boxes get checked and we don't

940
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,239
have just Kim dog everything turned into

941
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,380
Kim dog and that would be probably at

942
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,419
the top of the list so that's not what

943
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,480
we want but that work was done when we

944
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,000
selected the mail you know we don't just

945
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,039
pick the most Kim dog male we picked the

946
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,519
strongest one that passes on certain

947
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:13,440
traits the potency some of the flavor

948
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,759
but once again you have to be careful

949
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,200
because the flavor get you know the

950
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,359
flavor in the room it can get dominated

951
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,480
by Kim dog you know we just want the

952
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:25,619
potency to pass on and then having a

953
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,420
male a a different male uh on a female

954
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,519
it creates the F1 and that creates the

955
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,858
Vigor we're looking for which gives our

956
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,119
customer the end user the best success

957
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:35,400
you know

958
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,200
we think yeah brilliant I love it

959
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,780
because I always say to people that 90

960
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,059
of the time when someone's buying seeds

961
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,220
of a regular strain they're usually

962
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:46,259
buying it because they want the mother

963
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,959
you know the mother is a clone only they

964
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,339
can't get their hands on it and so I

965
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,539
think that really complements your

966
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:53,400
philosophy in the sense that you're

967
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:54,960
allowing the mother to shine through one

968
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,079
of the questions we got from a lot of

969
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,760
our listeners is are there any focal

970
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,099
differences you might be able to discuss

971
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,500
between the two chem dog males you use

972
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,599
is does one bring a certain thing to the

973
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,219
table or is it more just about testing

974
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,460
and seeing Oh what happens to work

975
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:13,439
better that's exactly it you know of

976
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,559
course we started off you know I started

977
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,780
off with the bx2 and you know

978
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,179
um but then as I took it further I

979
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,040
started to see that you know of course

980
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,259
you think okay well if we select right

981
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,539
with the bx3 it's going to be more of

982
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,460
what we're trying to offer right that

983
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,338
turned out not to be the case it's more

984
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,858
like a key in a lock some things just

985
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:36,358
work better with others you know I don't

986
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:38,880
know I can't really explain to you why

987
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:41,338
it's all just you know my perception my

988
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,820
observation I don't really have like a

989
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:46,858
master plan behind any of that but I you

990
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,900
know was hoping to get to a point where

991
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:52,019
I had a stud that I can work with you

992
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,300
know and I ended up too because

993
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,259
um some just work better than others you

994
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,820
know

995
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,339
um and that's kind of what is reflected

996
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,440
in what we offer because you know we

997
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:04,078
keep the bx2 around because it just

998
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,900
works better you know for instance the

999
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,079
Dog Patch it just works better like bx3

1000
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,240
dominated too much and I would say that

1001
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,940
most people who've experienced chem dog

1002
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,659
genetics can family Gen X would say you

1003
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,059
know Kim D what we call Kim D is much

1004
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:23,039
much much different than Kim dock you

1005
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,259
know in fact I would say that you know

1006
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,119
if you could get a Kim dmail it would

1007
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,640
help you select a bx3 faster because

1008
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,660
when you're making a back cross what

1009
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,980
you're trying to do is you're finally

1010
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:34,319
trying to find something that's not

1011
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,199
related so it's much easier for you to

1012
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,720
differentiate the um the traits you know

1013
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,118
so if you have you know plan a and plan

1014
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,578
B and plan a is the opposite polar

1015
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,440
opposite of Plan B this is the best

1016
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:48,480
starting point for making a back cross

1017
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,920
because your next generation is going to

1018
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,019
be so much easier for you to select the

1019
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,240
traits you're actually looking for

1020
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:56,039
unfortunately it's not quite that simple

1021
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,959
and that's why I keep both around

1022
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,838
because what I've learned is you can't

1023
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,119
quite plan out exactly how it's all

1024
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,619
going to go down and that we you know

1025
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,079
it's better if you just kind of be

1026
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,539
open-minded and think outside the box

1027
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,160
and if the X2 works better the bx2 works

1028
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:14,519
better and the Dog Patch is a great

1029
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:18,480
example of that when I tried to use the

1030
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:20,400
bx3 uh in hopes to replace the bx2 I

1031
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,579
found that it was just too dominant in

1032
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,980
the in the cross and those very

1033
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:28,800
different chemd traits weren't coming

1034
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,480
out and that was definitely not my goal

1035
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,940
so I think that's a good example of why

1036
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,800
because and I don't I'm not going to

1037
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,420
tell you how I'm just because I don't

1038
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,579
know I will just tell you what I observe

1039
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,619
and that's what I observed so we have to

1040
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:42,480
keep him because he works better with

1041
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,220
that and then of course we found that to

1042
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,960
be true with the Kim's sister

1043
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,179
you know what we call the Kim sister

1044
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,579
these days you know the Bundy cut or

1045
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:52,858
whatever they call it now and so you

1046
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,940
know those are just two good examples of

1047
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:56,639
that you know

1048
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:00,960
yeah great examples before we delve into

1049
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:03,000
some chemd and uh folk MDS I want to ask

1050
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,500
you I know you've done some Femmes in

1051
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,599
the past is there any chance we might

1052
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,920
see them in the future or even more

1053
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,720
specifically maybe some s1s absolutely

1054
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,099
um and you know I realized just right

1055
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,659
now that I didn't fully answer your

1056
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,420
question when you when you asked me

1057
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:22,078
about you know f1s and s1s and feminized

1058
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,740
and uh F1 generation and you know

1059
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,560
um

1060
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,719
so right now I feel from my perspective

1061
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,179
that uh feminized seeds are really

1062
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,799
popular you know maybe because they're a

1063
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:34,618
better bang for your buck you know you

1064
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,320
get 12 13 female plants guaranteed for

1065
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:41,099
roughly the same price makes sense but I

1066
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,440
always try to to kind of remind the

1067
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,940
consumer customer grower you know

1068
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,159
they're just basically two different

1069
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,280
tools they're two different approaches

1070
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,199
to a situation f1s were not really

1071
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,660
preserving the genetics you know we're

1072
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,299
not preserving mom or not preserving you

1073
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:59,219
know one of the two plants in the cross

1074
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,260
I would say that for femini seeds of

1075
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,879
course having all females can be very

1076
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,440
useful to some folks especially when

1077
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,960
they live in a state that doesn't have

1078
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,280
really you know legal cannabis and they

1079
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,260
have to be careful with their numbers I

1080
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,260
understand that I can't make a case

1081
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:16,440
against that I would support that

1082
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,180
um but you know if you're a home grower

1083
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,400
if you're growing your own cannabis

1084
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:23,279
which is always someone who's on my mind

1085
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,099
when I do any kind of work is

1086
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,859
um is that you know you want success and

1087
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,140
you know you can have success with s1s

1088
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,819
and feminized seeds of course you can so

1089
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:35,578
you're going to have a higher rate of of

1090
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,740
just yield you know getting a jar of

1091
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,599
flour to smoke for you know several

1092
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:43,078
months which is what you might need

1093
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,180
with an F1 cross you know so I just try

1094
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,160
to remind people that like you know they

1095
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:48,719
have they each have their place and I

1096
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,420
would say that you know feminized seeds

1097
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,519
s1s you know they they're more geared in

1098
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,320
my opinion towards if you know exactly

1099
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,659
what you want you know you're not really

1100
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,280
interested in any kind of variation and

1101
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,759
you're in other words like genetic

1102
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,820
preservation so to speak and so you know

1103
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,700
with the with the regular seeds f1s f2s

1104
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,820
we're making f2s now too those are going

1105
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:13,858
to be that's what you're going to get if

1106
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,480
you want genetic preservation if you

1107
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,858
know you want this and you maybe you

1108
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,480
want to buy a couple hundred of those

1109
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:19,858
feminized seeds and kind of go through

1110
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,320
them over the course of your few years

1111
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:25,199
and find exactly what you want and so

1112
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,000
yes we have made feminized seeds and

1113
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,679
I've made feminized seeds in the past

1114
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,900
and I'm getting ready to make another

1115
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,179
round I'm going to be using the

1116
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,099
crossroad chem and we're going to

1117
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:37,919
basically cross it to all of my favorite

1118
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,619
cuts and test them out and see how

1119
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,420
people like them and then yes they'll be

1120
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:45,240
uh you know a crossroad chem S one in

1121
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:48,240
there too Ooh La La so much different

1122
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,459
angles to go off there I guess the the

1123
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,098
question I've been asked a few times by

1124
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,260
some listeners is you just mentioned the

1125
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,420
crossroad chems are you able to tell us

1126
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,700
a little bit about that one specifically

1127
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,099
what it's like what maybe sort of traits

1128
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,199
it would bring to a cross and how it

1129
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,000
differs from the chem Crush because I

1130
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,858
think people get a bit confused because

1131
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,599
they notice they have the same lineages

1132
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:11,818
so how are they different and what do

1133
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,579
you like about the crossroad cam right

1134
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:18,960
so the crossroad Cam and the camera

1135
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:23,280
Crush are both chem 91 females crossed

1136
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:28,019
with the San Fernando Valley OG Kush bx2

1137
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,480
bx2 came from a shape Bud from 707 seed

1138
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,759
bank of top-notch breeder one of the

1139
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,619
best out there maybe not the well most

1140
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,480
well-known but definitely someone who's

1141
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,059
been doing work for a long time

1142
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,900
uh I know him because I gave him the

1143
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:45,179
chem 91 and I think Circa 2006 which you

1144
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,740
know he kind of took it up to Arcata and

1145
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:48,419
gave it to all those guys up in the

1146
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:50,459
Emerald Triangle

1147
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,260
um and it was all chance you know it was

1148
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,358
like a random moment where it was like

1149
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,560
this guy you know we should hand I

1150
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:56,880
should hand him the cut you know like

1151
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:58,980
he's going to do some good things with

1152
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,960
it and it just was one of those

1153
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,639
inspirational things in other words this

1154
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,220
is the plant speaking at the moment you

1155
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,739
know and so I did and so that you know

1156
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:11,098
years later we lost contact and you know

1157
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:14,459
as we all do out here in the the gutters

1158
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:16,019
of America and so like I ran back into

1159
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,280
him and he had a bunch of seeds he's

1160
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:19,199
been trying to give me a long time and

1161
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,000
so I went through a few of them a lot of

1162
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:23,639
them I think were kind of getting old

1163
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,559
and you know I uh probably have a bunch

1164
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,000
left they weren't really like great

1165
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,179
germination rates I think because they

1166
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,219
were old and but I did find the mail

1167
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,919
that I used in that cross

1168
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:38,098
and so when I made the cross I popped a

1169
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,079
bunch of those seeds and I found that I

1170
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,838
had two distinct Finos that I found that

1171
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,880
I could not decide between and that

1172
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,639
would be you know they're both casinos

1173
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,099
of that and so you know the Kim crush is

1174
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:53,578
more of like a chem dog Fino

1175
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:57,180
whereas the uh the crossroad Kim is more

1176
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,800
of a cushy more balanced more cottony I

1177
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:00,899
don't know how to explain it and I just

1178
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,420
couldn't decide between the two so I

1179
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,619
went with both you know and I get that

1180
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,240
question a lot and sometimes I'm like

1181
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,240
geez I shouldn't have done that you know

1182
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,559
because it's just

1183
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,899
hard to

1184
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,920
Tran it's hard to express it's hard to

1185
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,579
kind of

1186
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,740
um

1187
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,720
heart kind of hard to like Express to

1188
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,699
people that

1189
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,439
um and so but that's that's basically

1190
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:25,019
the difference you know they're both

1191
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,760
standalones they're they're our sisters

1192
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:28,739
you know it's just that I couldn't

1193
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,420
decide between the two I noticed that

1194
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:32,578
one was just include more Kim and the

1195
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,200
other was distinctly more Kush and so I

1196
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:36,420
said [ __ ] it let's just use them both

1197
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,299
you know perfect

1198
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,760
so it's been a minute since we've spoken

1199
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,099
and in that time Lucky Dog Seed Co has

1200
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,740
flourished and had a lot of success with

1201
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,720
a lot of uh strains that have you know

1202
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,039
quite quite a strong cult following so I

1203
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:51,838
think we're going to have to drill into

1204
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,358
a few of them and the first one that

1205
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,358
comes to mind for me is the hunza valley

1206
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,920
and I think the reason for that is

1207
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,619
um you know it's a combination of like

1208
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,300
the Skelly and the cam and there's not a

1209
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:05,400
ton of Skelly crosses out there and

1210
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,318
people are really interested in it why

1211
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,880
do you think the hanza valley has got a

1212
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:10,619
cult following and how would you

1213
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,300
describe it to anyone if they're

1214
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:13,920
interested in sort of hearing your

1215
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,039
description of it

1216
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,539
well I would say that uh why I feel like

1217
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,699
it's been popular is the same reason I

1218
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:23,039
love it I think those Terps are so

1219
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,439
unique the burnt rubber the fresh tennis

1220
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,500
ball can you know all the things people

1221
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,960
describe about it and I'm big on Indica

1222
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,639
I got body pains and I love something

1223
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,679
that relaxes my muscle

1224
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,139
I fell in love with the Skelly when I

1225
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:38,460
obtained it and uh I couldn't wait to

1226
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:40,440
make a cross with it I wanted to make

1227
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,780
something the Skelly is notoriously

1228
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,639
difficult to grow it's you'll won't see

1229
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,200
it in a shop like this because it's it's

1230
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,879
not a producer

1231
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:52,618
um it's extremely you know botronous uh

1232
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,818
resistant you know even though it's got

1233
00:46:52,619 --> 00:47:00,838
that wet greasy uh you know trichome not

1234
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:04,079
Sandy not dry and it really it is it's

1235
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:06,059
just perfect for me I love the smoke but

1236
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,160
you know and that's that's kind of it

1237
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:10,199
right there like when you find a plant a

1238
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,838
clone only that's difficult to not only

1239
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,000
obtain but also to produce grow

1240
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:16,440
then but you love it it could be

1241
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,300
frustrating because you want to share it

1242
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,800
with the world you know like

1243
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,880
um so that was the motivation behind

1244
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,560
making the Hanzo Valley and uh you know

1245
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,180
um I feel like the hunter Valley passes

1246
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,480
on most of those trades so skelly's very

1247
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:33,539
dominant in that cross I would say it's

1248
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,280
not it's you won't find a lot of chem

1249
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:39,539
doggy stuff in those you're gonna find

1250
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,599
more Indica Skelly burnt rubber tennis

1251
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:45,059
ball you know heavy duty Indica cro you

1252
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,920
know fenos when you pop those seeds and

1253
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:48,358
I'm really happy with it um and I'm glad

1254
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,700
people enjoy it because it's one of my

1255
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:53,699
favorites that I have for sure

1256
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:55,500
um I actually hate to say it out loud

1257
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:57,179
but I like the hunza valley more than

1258
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,480
Miss Kelly the finals that I've grown

1259
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:02,639
they were consistent they were stable

1260
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,318
and they were fun to grow they had a

1261
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,259
little bit more stretch than this Kelly

1262
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:11,099
which I think is useful to

1263
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:13,140
um you know for end users skelly's you

1264
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,619
know complicated you know even though

1265
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:19,379
it's pretty durable pretty you know

1266
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,858
um it's I guess durable would be my word

1267
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:25,500
it's it's it's hard to screw it up but

1268
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,539
it's just you know the fact that it's so

1269
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,519
short and squat it's like you have to

1270
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:31,559
know how to grow it you know the hunza

1271
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,838
valley gives you a little bit more a

1272
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,338
little bit more flexibility a safety net

1273
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,078
yeah it gives you a little bit more

1274
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:39,900
stretch a little bit more air can get

1275
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:42,240
through and so so um that's kind of it

1276
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,180
you know I just wanted to share that cut

1277
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,858
with the world as I discovered it and

1278
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:48,539
that hunza Valley allowed me to do that

1279
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:49,739
you know it just was one of those it's

1280
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:52,019
one of the crosses that just really

1281
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:53,578
worked out you know like instantly you

1282
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:56,219
know not a lot of thought not a lot of

1283
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,680
not a lot of testing had to go on it

1284
00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:00,000
just worked you know so hell yeah what a

1285
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:02,098
great answer and definitely one of the

1286
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,539
ones I've been eyeing off myself I've

1287
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:05,160
got to ask you because it's been on my

1288
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:07,318
mind for years

1289
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:09,239
there are Whispers that some people

1290
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,338
including myself have been partial to

1291
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,919
the idea that maybe Skelly has got some

1292
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:15,960
relation to the chem dog do you think

1293
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,000
that and as a follow-up at the bare

1294
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,318
minimum do you see any similarities in

1295
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,099
the flavor

1296
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:22,099
hmm

1297
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,579
I've heard that and I've even I even

1298
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:30,000
mentioned on the back of the pack that

1299
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:31,800
that people have mentioned that

1300
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,539
um I don't know if it's true I mean of

1301
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,579
course there's no way to know I don't

1302
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:37,559
know how we would figure that out

1303
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:40,019
um they definitely both have crossed

1304
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,239
Leadville Colorado

1305
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:44,338
um for sure and so you know the super

1306
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,379
skunk was there Leadville Colorado you

1307
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:48,059
know I've only snowboarded there over

1308
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,579
the years and maybe I spent the night at

1309
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:53,039
someone's house on the way to see some

1310
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:56,700
you know grateful deady stuff in the

1311
00:49:53,039 --> 00:50:00,539
Denver area but besides that you know

1312
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:04,019
um I can't say I don't think I feel like

1313
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:05,639
I see a direct resemblance especially

1314
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:08,519
when you take into consideration the

1315
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,980
Northern Lights the nl1 because that one

1316
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:13,019
seems to be more like when you ask me

1317
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,059
where what traits do I see outside of

1318
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:17,219
Kim dog that are Kim doggy I would say

1319
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:20,578
that's from my memory that would be the

1320
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:22,679
one the Skelly I I can only say that

1321
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:25,440
because people who are closer to that

1322
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:28,440
cut the puck have mentioned it you know

1323
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,740
I wouldn't say that's impossible you

1324
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:33,960
know I would say maybe if you took Kim D

1325
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:36,479
and set it next to its sister the Kim

1326
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,220
dog and then he took Skelly and he sat

1327
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,679
next to the Kim dog you would probably

1328
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:42,899
say the Skelly had more resemblance you

1329
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,239
know that's what I would say

1330
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,039
um so I I don't really know you know and

1331
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:48,959
I don't like to speculate on those

1332
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,000
things because there's so much diversity

1333
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,960
in cannabis as soon as you think you can

1334
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,519
identify traits on different streams you

1335
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,740
know you find out there is no resemble

1336
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:01,199
there is no actual not resemblance but

1337
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:03,479
no uh relation you know it can surprise

1338
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,699
you and it does often so I don't know

1339
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,460
you know I just know that that's what

1340
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:12,539
folks from the Leadville area at that

1341
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:14,699
Circa in 1989-ish you know set so yeah

1342
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,639
well look while we're on the topic of

1343
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:19,259
Leadville and the infamous Joe brand the

1344
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,480
the chem brand has gained a lot of

1345
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,880
popularity and I guess for a lot of

1346
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,880
people they may I think of it as like

1347
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,440
sort of a pure chemline in a sense is

1348
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,519
that how you would describe it or do you

1349
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,440
think they're actually getting a little

1350
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:35,460
something different than two chem dogs

1351
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,159
crossed together so to speak oh 100 the

1352
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:41,099
JB cut as I call it and I I think that

1353
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,920
you you would body coin that uh name for

1354
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,780
it which is I love

1355
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,240
um we were familiar with the JB cut

1356
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,780
before it was called the JB cut in

1357
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,879
Sonoma County uh in Sonoma County

1358
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:56,220
honestly over most of the last couple

1359
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,640
decades we weren't that concerned about

1360
00:51:56,219 --> 00:52:01,799
names we were more concerned about what

1361
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:04,440
customers wanted and it was on scale

1362
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,420
large scale and it was always OG

1363
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,300
cushions and it was always Sour Diesel

1364
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,338
and no matter what else came through

1365
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:13,920
those were the ones that always were

1366
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:15,539
getting asked about so we had this cut

1367
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,700
and I honestly cannot tell you where it

1368
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:20,519
came from but we used to call it the uh

1369
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:22,679
a sour diesel most people called it The

1370
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,059
Saturdays on my little circle and of

1371
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,818
course it's not the sour diesel but it

1372
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:30,059
was very similar to it but the

1373
00:52:26,818 --> 00:52:33,420
distinction was tighter nugs heavier

1374
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:35,700
nugs shorter squatter plant but it had

1375
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,519
every bit of that smell that the sour

1376
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:40,379
diesel is known for and so we called it

1377
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,780
a sour diesel or some of it's called a

1378
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,640
sour diesel IBL and I'm not really sure

1379
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,559
like where that originated from I'm not

1380
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,779
sure if it's actually that that's just

1381
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,440
what people called and so we were

1382
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,260
growing and cropping that out at scale

1383
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,059
um before you know I even knew who Joe

1384
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:00,059
brand was you know probably even heard

1385
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:02,160
of who he was to be honest you know I

1386
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:05,339
didn't get a I didn't come across

1387
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:08,039
chemdawg cuts the chem dog or the chemd

1388
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:09,659
or any of the Kim family I didn't come I

1389
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:12,480
didn't get that from any of the chem dog

1390
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,219
family you know I got her outside of

1391
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,420
that you know coincidentally as I've

1392
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:18,239
mentioned before

1393
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,700
okay so yeah so then you know that cut

1394
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,799
was with us and what happened was it's

1395
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,659
really a cute story actually so what

1396
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,180
happened was I was uh going through a

1397
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:29,219
divorce at the time I had a home in

1398
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,480
Oakland I was working in I had a home in

1399
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:32,219
sebast while I was working and actually

1400
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,679
I had two homes in Sebastopol California

1401
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:38,818
that I was working in so that's about an

1402
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:40,858
hour difference Drive I was also a an

1403
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:42,838
apprentice an electrical worker

1404
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:44,818
Apprentice at the time and I was working

1405
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:46,400
a lot and there's always a lot of

1406
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:50,300
commuting and construction

1407
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:53,160
my ex-wife wanted me to get a real job

1408
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,140
at some point because cannabis wasn't a

1409
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:57,598
real job I guess I mean there's always

1410
00:53:55,139 --> 00:54:00,299
risk with cannabis and you know she felt

1411
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,700
that the danger was affecting

1412
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,680
you know our families say you know

1413
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:06,779
security and happiness and just kind of

1414
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:09,000
our day-to-day so I succumbed and I

1415
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,460
became a an apprentice in the electrical

1416
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,800
industry with the ibw and so I was

1417
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,740
working a lot and I had a partner in

1418
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,539
Oakland that we were he was living there

1419
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:21,419
and I was living there half time we had

1420
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:22,800
a basement full of herb and one day he

1421
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,760
approached me

1422
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,818
um and said uh hey uh there's this guy

1423
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,140
named Joe brand and he

1424
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:37,259
um the guy who popped the Kim dog seed

1425
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:40,618
gee asked if we wouldn't mind giving him

1426
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:43,020
a cutter than chemdog 91. and I didn't

1427
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:44,519
know any of the story I I so he told me

1428
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:46,259
the story and I was like oh that's

1429
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:49,139
that's an interesting story I'd never

1430
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:51,000
actually this is 2006 mind you I'd never

1431
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:52,858
actually heard about all the stuff that

1432
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,239
happened at Deer Creek and then it's odd

1433
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:56,639
it's kind of weird to think about but

1434
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,279
it's true I wasn't really privy to that

1435
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,318
stuff my experience with Kim dog you

1436
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,880
know was outside of that it had nothing

1437
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:05,400
to do with those folks you know that's

1438
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,079
just the way it is you know and so you

1439
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,940
know he explained to me and I said well

1440
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,519
yeah of course sure you know like that's

1441
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,440
kind of cool you know he's you know

1442
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,119
explain to me that the guy was kind of

1443
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,500
you know all these people of course were

1444
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,480
out of contact with each other it was

1445
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:23,519
all chance meetings and then here we are

1446
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:26,219
in 2006 I think it was 2006 2005 where

1447
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,259
we all were a lot of these folks could

1448
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:29,818
get in contact together and you know I

1449
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,440
appreciated that you know even though I

1450
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:34,079
wasn't part of that I appreciated that

1451
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,338
and so I said yeah sure you know I think

1452
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,780
we have some cuttings in the basement

1453
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:38,759
that are rooting and you know he had to

1454
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,160
ask me for my permission or you know I

1455
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,260
had a lock on that thought so I said

1456
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,058
yeah sure and then I went to work in

1457
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,800
Napa and I was working at the Napa High

1458
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:49,380
School doing the lighting there you know

1459
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,619
looked good and uh you know so I said

1460
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:55,019
yeah sure well a little back story so my

1461
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:57,240
roommate at the time was and I've known

1462
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:59,039
him for a long time you know like we

1463
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:00,719
used to be very close and we've known

1464
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,699
each other since the Grateful Dead days

1465
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,699
and you know that's our history there's

1466
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:07,618
a lot of nostalgia yada yada so

1467
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:10,618
um and he's a Kim head you know he loves

1468
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:12,180
it and he gets it and he actually knew G

1469
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,160
you know that's why they were able to

1470
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:15,358
talk they actually met each other on the

1471
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,420
East Coast they kind of grew up in the

1472
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,880
same area in the Northeast and so

1473
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,800
um you know I agreed and uh and I you

1474
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,140
know I just went to sleep and woke up

1475
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,640
went to work the next day well what had

1476
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:29,098
been going on in the background is that

1477
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,098
my roommate was selling packs of uh chem

1478
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:34,200
91 that he was getting from another

1479
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:36,000
grower in our area and I and I was

1480
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,699
surprised by that because I know the guy

1481
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,940
and he asked me for the cut and I said

1482
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:43,318
no of course and uh and it appeared

1483
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,059
according to my roommate that he had

1484
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:46,858
obtained a cut somehow and I was curious

1485
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:49,500
about like how is that possible

1486
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:51,239
wasn't really you know didn't have a

1487
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,059
time or energy to even really give a

1488
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:56,399
damn but I was curious and every night I

1489
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:58,260
would come home from work and uh and I

1490
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,660
would see turkey bags of what he was

1491
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,000
saying was chem 91. now as far as I'm

1492
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:06,179
concerned he should know what chem 91 is

1493
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,980
right he it's his favorite you know all

1494
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:09,598
of us are like chem dog heads in my

1495
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,358
little circle and he's certainly in that

1496
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,338
you know and so you know that was that

1497
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:15,900
and so I came home from work the next

1498
00:57:14,338 --> 00:57:18,539
day and I said did your buddy come over

1499
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,980
he's like he did I said did you give him

1500
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:22,079
a cut because I went down the basement I

1501
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,000
don't see any Cuts going on anywhere he

1502
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,500
goes well I was over at my homie's house

1503
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,280
who I've been getting these packs of

1504
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:31,800
chem 91 from and he had a root cutting

1505
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,079
right then and there and I said hey you

1506
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,720
know I I think I got

1507
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,339
you know skunk va's permission but let

1508
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,919
me just go ahead and grab one you got a

1509
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:43,078
nice healthy rooted one here and he was

1510
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,599
picking up some packs of chem 91 I think

1511
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:48,960
and so that's how he got it and then he

1512
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,579
passed it to JB and so that's that and

1513
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,699
well I came home from work and he told

1514
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,740
me that and I said huh and I was like

1515
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:57,598
I'm still very curious about this chem

1516
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:59,459
91 cut that I had you know why would

1517
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,800
they ask me if they already got it right

1518
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,539
and he was opening up turkey bags right

1519
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,460
that moment and I was in the dining room

1520
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:06,659
and he was in the kind of a darkened

1521
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,579
living room

1522
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:09,179
and uh

1523
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:11,880
um

1524
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,500
and he's like I said is that that Kim 91

1525
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,720
that you've been you know kind of

1526
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,260
rocking the last few weeks Pax he said

1527
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:21,118
yeah so that's not Kim 91. he goes what

1528
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,500
he goes you're you know in another room

1529
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,240
how could you I said you should know

1530
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,280
better than that look at that I can see

1531
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,019
from here it's not Kim 91. so I walked

1532
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,260
in the room I took the Bud from his hand

1533
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:32,818
but when he was smelling I smelled it

1534
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,380
and I threw it back in the bag I said

1535
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:37,380
you should know better that's not Kim 91

1536
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:40,200
and then his eyes got big as you know

1537
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,260
headlights and he was like oh my God I

1538
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:45,179
said I'm going to bed

1539
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,400
and so I said so that's the cut you gave

1540
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:50,940
that guy that you asked me about he said

1541
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,440
he sure is and his jaw hit the floor and

1542
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,659
you know I don't know what to say about

1543
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,179
all that I mean you know like it's funny

1544
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:59,519
like the uh Power of suggestion I think

1545
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:01,259
is very strong you know with any of us

1546
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,199
and so I think that's what a good case

1547
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,579
of that you know and so like I said I

1548
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,199
had already been familiar with that

1549
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:09,780
particular cut we had been rocking it

1550
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,219
for a while and we rocked it along you

1551
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,720
know after that separate from this

1552
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:15,480
partnership that I'm describing to you

1553
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,798
and you know it just kind of like I

1554
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,539
didn't really think much of it and then

1555
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:21,780
later on

1556
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:23,880
um I had uh maybe I don't remember what

1557
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,640
happened to the one I had to cut the the

1558
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,980
sour diesel IBL but it just kind of went

1559
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:32,159
away somehow I don't remember

1560
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,858
um and years later someone you know it

1561
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:37,739
came I heard that there was a cross that

1562
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:40,500
Bodhi had made of the Kim 91 but he had

1563
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:43,500
started to call the mother the JB cut

1564
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:45,358
the chem 91 JB cutter Joe brand cut

1565
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,460
and I was like oh that's the same thing

1566
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,338
and then I got the cut someone on the

1567
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:53,099
East Coast uh who prefers to stay in you

1568
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:54,900
know Anonymous he he sent me to cut and

1569
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:56,519
it was the same [ __ ] cut it was the

1570
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,220
same one that we used to rock in we used

1571
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:01,559
to really get good yields from it and so

1572
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:04,078
you know he then Bodhi had kind of

1573
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:05,280
coined the phrase JB cut which I I love

1574
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,260
that you know what I mean I think it's

1575
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,400
great because I that happened in my bait

1576
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,200
my house you know what I mean and I

1577
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,460
thought that was kind of cool so I

1578
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:13,618
couldn't wait to get my hands on I

1579
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,659
always wanted to make a cross with it I

1580
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:19,140
love Sour Diesel I love Kim dog it's

1581
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:20,639
just a little bit stronger vigorous you

1582
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,098
know version of Sour Diesel but it has

1583
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,659
all that stuff in there and so you know

1584
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:26,640
when I got it I couldn't wait to make a

1585
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:29,159
cross with it and luckily it came out

1586
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,900
and it's not chem dog I'm Kim dog

1587
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:33,118
because it's not Kim doggone Kim dog

1588
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,760
it's very unique it's one of my favorite

1589
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,519
crosses that I've made to smoke to grow

1590
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,079
out it's easy to grow easy to smoke and

1591
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:42,179
it just punches you in the face it's

1592
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,980
great you know what I mean so that's the

1593
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,318
story on it hell yeah it's one that's

1594
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,318
piqued my interest just hearing that and

1595
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:51,298
in a question or two uh before you

1596
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:52,858
mentioned the old NLS and how the chem

1597
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:54,179
does remind you of that I'd be

1598
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:57,058
interested to hear you know we've seen a

1599
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:58,500
bit of a Resurgence of NLS both in terms

1600
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:00,599
of some seed offerings but even just

1601
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,639
other breeders talking about how they

1602
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:04,740
would love to get some of those NL lines

1603
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,139
they tried in their youth back into the

1604
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:09,179
stable do you have any fond memories of

1605
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:11,578
NLS have you ever wanted to explore that

1606
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:14,578
realm at all oh yeah

1607
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:18,780
um when I was a young man in Virginia

1608
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:21,839
um I got uh as a 17 year old a minor

1609
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:23,760
which is kind of a key to my life that I

1610
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:26,039
was a minor I got in trouble I got in

1611
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,160
big trouble I got in trouble for

1612
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:32,099
possession and distribution of LSD and

1613
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:35,219
uh you know they wanted to charge me as

1614
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:37,500
an adult and uh I had to jump through a

1615
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:39,539
lot of Hoops to not be charged as an

1616
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,400
adult you know I had a good friend who

1617
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:44,579
was 18 that night who got set up by the

1618
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,700
same snitch and uh

1619
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:50,160
uh and so he actually had a very

1620
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:53,519
different outcome because he was 18. and

1621
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:55,679
I had gotten in trouble when I was 17

1622
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,019
probably about five months before I

1623
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,699
turned 18 I'm thinking you know roughly

1624
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:01,500
yeah and

1625
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:05,098
um but they still wanted to charge me as

1626
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:06,960
adult this is Heyday drug war 1990 I

1627
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:09,420
think yeah and

1628
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,579
um you know very very aggressive law

1629
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,559
enforcement very aggressive like War on

1630
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:16,440
Drugs in Virginia you know especially

1631
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:19,200
and they were gonna like maybe he got 18

1632
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:22,260
years suspended for 18 years to give you

1633
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:24,298
uh comparison whereas I had an

1634
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,400
opportunity to not really do any jail

1635
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:30,539
time or not really do much jail time as

1636
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,099
a minor or do maybe some hard time five

1637
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,199
or six years is what they were saying

1638
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:37,140
and you know they were talking about

1639
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,779
putting a 17 year old in a in a cage

1640
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:43,318
with grown men you know it's not I don't

1641
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:45,240
I I could never imagine a crime to wear

1642
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:47,099
a child even you know someone who's

1643
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,558
about to become adult should belong in a

1644
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:52,318
cage with you know adults it's just

1645
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,720
you're guaranteeing you're you know

1646
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:57,239
destroying that person's future and so

1647
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,798
my attorney which was like a court

1648
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,959
appointed attorney unfortunately because

1649
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,239
we were poor ass

1650
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,740
um you know fought hard for me to make

1651
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,259
sure that didn't happen understanding

1652
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:10,078
that that was going to negatively impact

1653
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:13,859
my life forever so

1654
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:17,039
um so back then we had in Virginia we

1655
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:20,039
had the super skunk we had NL which

1656
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:23,159
turned out to be nl1 I believe and we

1657
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:24,719
had the Nigerian we called the Nigel we

1658
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,058
had the Afghani a couple different

1659
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,618
Afghans these were all like stuff you

1660
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:30,599
would find in the seed catalogs you know

1661
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:32,818
these this is stuff became the legend of

1662
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:36,240
cannabis you know like we were right at

1663
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:38,039
Ground Zero I don't know how but we were

1664
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,139
um Beatrix choice of course I've talked

1665
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:43,199
to you about that one before

1666
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:45,058
um so those were the ones and so it had

1667
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:48,779
a hierarchy you could find Nigerian

1668
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:50,220
easier Nigel quicker Afghan quicker and

1669
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,319
that's just what we called it there was

1670
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:54,000
obviously more to the names than that

1671
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,019
that's just what we called it that's all

1672
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,780
I got

1673
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:59,940
in my memory and then then the harder

1674
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:03,480
ones would be and then the super skunk

1675
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,980
and then you'd get to uh the NL and then

1676
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,380
of course the Beatrix Choice was the

1677
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,480
Holy Grail the hardest to find but these

1678
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,818
are roughly the strains that we could

1679
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,519
find and they were Primo they were the

1680
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:16,558
best and this is what makes a young

1681
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:18,960
you know person fall in love with

1682
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,880
cannabis you know and so the northern

1683
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,420
lights so I was on probation from that

1684
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,858
charge right my guy sent me to he said

1685
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:28,260
you're going to have to go to a rehab

1686
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:30,420
which was pretty Vogue back in the late

1687
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,460
80s early 90s and you're gonna have and

1688
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,200
you know you're gonna have to you know

1689
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:36,539
be you're gonna have to play the part

1690
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:39,239
you were addicted to marijuana and you

1691
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:41,219
were addicted to LSD you were addicted

1692
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:42,838
to psilocybin that's your story you're

1693
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:44,818
gonna stick to it you're gonna [ __ ]

1694
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:47,099
beat it with a drum this is going to

1695
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:48,900
save your life and he convinced me as a

1696
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:51,740
young man so I did

1697
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:55,019
and it was an interesting experience

1698
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:57,358
that's where I met the man who became

1699
01:04:55,019 --> 01:05:01,139
and to this day as my mentor who made

1700
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:03,838
the super skunk as we know it the F2 the

1701
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:06,539

1702
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:10,019
know people out here call it who you

1703
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:12,779
know want to know somebody and so we uh

1704
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:15,059
you know he approached me at one of

1705
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,740
these n a meetings and he uh he handed

1706
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:18,900
me a Grateful Dead tape now he's an

1707
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:20,279
adult and I'm in a minor in a facility

1708
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,700
where people are coming off the street

1709
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:25,260
for an n a meeting you know and uh we

1710
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,000
were forced as the Myers to go to this

1711
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,280
of course it's part of the program fine

1712
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,659
and he knew that we weren't allowed to

1713
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,079
have anything to do with Grateful Dead

1714
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:35,639
The Grateful Dead music or paraphernalia

1715
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,039
meaning like t-shirts you know

1716
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:39,719
insignia's symbology it was all

1717
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:40,318
considered

1718
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:44,039
um

1719
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:46,380
drug paraphernalia not allowed right so

1720
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:47,940
as a minor in this place you're a child

1721
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:50,338
you're not allowed to have a Grateful

1722
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,260
Dead bootleg tape so I'm at this meeting

1723
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:53,818
this is what I'm doing to try to save my

1724
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,339
life according to my attorney mind you

1725
01:05:53,818 --> 01:05:57,659

1726
01:05:56,338 --> 01:06:00,119
anyone who's ever been to these things

1727
01:05:57,659 --> 01:06:01,858
know that coffee is the big thing so I'm

1728
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:03,539
at the thing getting the coffee at 7 pm

1729

1731
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,880
impatience there and they're

1732
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,619
um they're not allowed to talk to the

1733
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,000
miners like it can be a big problem for

1734
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:12,780
them you know they can get kicked out of

1735
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,880
the program

1736
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:17,220
but then I'm at the coffee thing and a

1737
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,440
man Taps my shoulder and he said don't

1738
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:21,118
turn around so I didn't turn around and

1739
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,039
he handed me a Grateful Dead tape

1740
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,200
because I hear you youngins aren't

1741
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,818
allowed to have these and I said no

1742
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,980
we're not and he goes well here you go

1743
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:30,480
and I shoved it down my pants

1744
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,119
that turned out to be the guy who made

1745
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,740
the F2 the super skunk my mentor it was

1746
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,200
kind of a chance thing you know that's

1747
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:39,779
how I met him but uh

1748
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:41,578
um so when I was on after I got out I

1749
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,140
was on probate I went through my case I

1750
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:44,579
became on probation I had to quit

1751
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:46,440

1752
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:48,420

1753
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,179
strict you know I had to have be known

1754
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,980
where I was at all the time and so I

1755
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:55,139
remember we went up to some friends of

1756
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,460
mine and everyone was on board they were

1757
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:58,440

1758
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,298

1766
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:16,858
help him not hurt his own self so that's

1767
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:20,338
what it was but however at the end of

1768
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:22,679
this period of time in probation I was

1769
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:24,239
you know all my friends my circles were

1770
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:25,980
heading up to Boston to the Boston

1771
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,399
Gardens to see The Grateful Dead there

1772
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:31,139
in 1991 it would have been at this point

1773
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,940
and so I convinced them to let me go

1774
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:34,500
even though that was you know could have

1775
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,659
been dangerous for me as far as my

1776
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,219
probation goes and this is serious like

1777
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,920
people hear probation now it was

1778
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:43,318
different back then like this was just a

1779
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,539
simple procedure to get you in prison

1780
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:48,179
you know this was a way around it so it

1781
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:50,339
was more serious in my opinion and so we

1782
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:52,618
get up to Boston and we go to the show

1783
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:54,719
and I I'm a good boy I take a little

1784
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:56,519
acid but I don't smoke any weed my

1785
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,439
friends are keeping it away from me to a

1786
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,019
degree watching out for me doing you

1787
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,818
know being good friends and then after

1788
01:08:01,019 --> 01:08:05,759
the show we all pile into a car it was

1789
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:07,558
six of us and all I can do is smell the

1790
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,900
[ __ ] bag of weed in someone's pocket

1791
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:12,119
and I can't help myself I'm like can I

1792
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,338
just look at it y'all you know show me

1793
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,798
the bag I know that smell let's just see

1794
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:18,420
is that the Northern Lights you know and

1795
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:20,338
they won't say a word you know because

1796
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,079
they know that once that Domino God's

1797
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:24,778
starts to fall all of them are going to

1798
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:28,079
fall well on the way the hotel from the

1799
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:30,120
show some guy took a little too much too

1800
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:32,579
fast and took all his clothes off as

1801
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:34,500
they sometimes do at those events and

1802
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:36,000
you know having a psychedelic experience

1803
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,979
it was getting a little too intense for

1804
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,020
the default world and so he was

1805
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:43,259
surrounded by Boston's Finest you know

1806
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:45,660
the the law enforcement and we all had

1807
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:47,279
to wait for this whole movie to unfold

1808
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:49,559
as we're trying to just get to the hotel

1809
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,120
we're exhausted and I'm sitting in a car

1810
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,500
for an hour and a half smelling this bag

1811
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,719
of weed that no one will show me it's

1812
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,880
driving me insane and so we get to the

1813
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,159
hotel and I say listen

1814
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,779
I'm smoking that damn joint I don't give

1815
01:08:59,159 --> 01:09:02,579
a damn what anyone says No One's Gonna

1816
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:04,259
Stop Me I don't the consequences are

1817
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:06,719
mine and mine alone and I appreciate you

1818
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:08,219
it's not your fault but when you roll

1819
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,020
that and they didn't they rolled that

1820
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:13,380
eight that fifty dollar eighth of

1821
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:16,440
Northern Lights that sticky icky [ __ ]

1822
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:18,539
um goodness into a 50 [ __ ] joint with

1823
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,039
a club a nice wrap and it was a

1824
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:22,439
beautiful joint I can picture in my mind

1825
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:23,939
right now and we smoke that [ __ ]

1826
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:26,579
it was the first time I'd smoke in a

1827
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:27,899
whole year and everyone passed out

1828
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,818
almost immediately

1829
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:31,079
but when you haven't smoked wheat in

1830
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,580
that long and you're tolerance down it's

1831
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:35,579
a much different effect as we all know

1832
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:37,500
and I turned on that Kung Fu theater and

1833
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:39,778
I laughed my [ __ ] ass off until I

1834
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:42,060
practically pissed my pants tears

1835
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:44,120
streaming down my eyes it was probably

1836
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,859
the best joint I ever smoked in my life

1837
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:48,238
and I had smoked it before it was the

1838
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,319
Northern Lights as we caught it and I

1839
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,579
asked him I was like where'd y'all get

1840
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:52,440
this and they said well we got it here

1841
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:55,019
in the parking lot but the parking lot

1842
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:56,698
was flooded and you know whose weed this

1843
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,500
is and we don't really know the guy's

1844
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:00,000
name but we knew it was from Virginia

1845
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,560
and they said I was like this is from

1846
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,779
Richmond right and they said yeah sure

1847
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,400
enough this it was everywhere they they

1848
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:07,198
started opening up to me about it now

1849
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,420
that it's too late and they told me all

1850
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:12,119
about it you know and they're like it is

1851
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:15,000
better than ever and you know yeah let's

1852
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:16,800
smoke it so we did and so that's that's

1853
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,779
my memory of it it'll stick with me

1854
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,460
forever of course I had memories of it

1855
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:22,679
before because we used to smoke it but

1856
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:25,260
that was so significant in my life you

1857
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:27,179
know because it was exciting you know I

1858
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:30,420
was once again breaking the [ __ ] law

1859
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:32,460
and you know rightfully so so I smoked

1860
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,679
that joint and luckily I got off

1861
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,239
probation within 30 days I was already

1862
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:39,179
on when I got off probation I was

1863
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:42,119
already on Jerry Garcia's bands uh East

1864
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:45,658
Coast tour which was you know

1865
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:47,698
you know amazing and so you know that

1866
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:49,679
was it and I I and I never got drug

1867
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:52,678
tested again I went back to my final

1868
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:55,319
probation uh meeting I didn't get tested

1869
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:57,658
and I was grateful for that and that was

1870
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:59,039
that you know that's brilliant and so

1871
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:01,979
obviously you've had these very

1872
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:04,500
memorable and impactful experience with

1873
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:07,619
the no one recently we hear a little

1874
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,140
chat about the nl5 making a Resurgence

1875
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:12,840
from a few different seed sources you've

1876
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:15,600
got Matt and Caleb who have done theirs

1877
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,659
you've got Todd McCormick has the nl5

1878
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,579
ever held a similar reminiscent spot in

1879
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:23,639
your mind or was it really just that nl1

1880
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:25,500
it was just that inner one it was and we

1881
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,640
just do it as NL Northern Lights you

1882
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,579
know

1883
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,679
um only and I'm I'm speculating when I

1884
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:33,179
call it no one based on what I've seen

1885
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,739
since then

1886
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:37,739
um it's one of the Holy Grails in my

1887
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:40,919
world and so like though that particular

1888
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:44,399
cut you know but the ones that I've seen

1889
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,199
that uh folks have been kind of working

1890
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:48,119
with maybe since then it's a little

1891
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:49,738
convoluted to me like exactly you know

1892
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:51,840
where did it come from how to get these

1893
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:54,479
at the same cut I don't know but the

1894
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,579
similarity is there and it's clear and

1895
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,839
so I I go with it you know

1896
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:03,658
and uh the nl5 is not it's small it's

1897
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,699
not my it's not quite it it might this

1898
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:06,899
is my perception when you had that

1899
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:07,859
Northern Lights let's just call it

1900
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:09,539
normal lights because that's what we

1901
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:11,460
call it back then let's be accurate when

1902
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:13,439
you had that to go to the nl5 it's just

1903
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,539
not the same you know it's got a similar

1904
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,119
name but it's a much different Fino you

1905
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:20,519
know and so like it's just not in that

1906
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:23,099
Avenue of that I fell in love with just

1907
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,080
to be truthful you know so yeah it's

1908
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,640
more common and maybe that's exceed my

1909
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:29,219
perception a little bit too because I

1910
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,260
love like the Rarities of Some Cuts you

1911
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:33,658
know like I'm drawn to the Rarity of

1912
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:36,239
things you know like how did it make it

1913
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:37,979
this far but ultimately the experience

1914
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,678
when you smoke it that's what what it is

1915
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:41,819
and I just can't compare the two I don't

1916
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:44,460
feel like they're even in the same

1917
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:47,579
ballpark that's just my opinion you know

1918
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:49,198
so and I've got uh Matt was nice enough

1919
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:50,519
to send me some of those seeds that

1920
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,738
you're speaking of and I can't wait to

1921
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,080
go through them but I haven't yet yeah

1922
01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:57,238
nice that'll be cool to see what comes

1923
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:59,519
out of that and I mean in that same vein

1924
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,019
we've seen some skunk one seeds pop

1925
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,080
their head out as well as some original

1926
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,699
Haze do either of those ones hold a spot

1927
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,340
in your mind or you just didn't really

1928
01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:10,919
get exposed to them original Haze would

1929
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,420
be out of my wheelhouse and but when it

1930
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,940
comes to skunk that's right in my

1931
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:17,460
wheelhouse and

1932
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:19,738
I hate to tell y'all it's not there we

1933
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,359
don't have it it's gone at least for my

1934
01:13:19,738 --> 01:13:22,919
perception everyone's got a different

1935
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,960
opinion about it we can fight about it

1936
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:27,420
if you want but I've been around a long

1937
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,340
time and I know what skunk smells like

1938
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,899
and I think we all do if you live in

1939
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,579
North America you know what a skunk

1940
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:34,559
smells like so if you don't smell that

1941
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:36,420
when you smell the weed be careful

1942
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,739
calling it skunk because we all know

1943
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:42,000
what a skunk smells like it's not it's

1944
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:43,678
not like you know uh gardenia

1945
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,439
do you know what a gardenia smells like

1946
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,000
sure me too but not everybody does but

1947
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:50,219
everyone knows what a skunk smells like

1948
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,500
right and so if we don't smell that

1949
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:54,779
let's be honest with ourselves okay you

1950
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,939
know so and yeah you know that sounds

1951
01:13:54,779 --> 01:14:00,179
horrible to say but it's true we have to

1952
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:02,339
be honest and like that smell that the

1953
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:04,199
super skunk had that was what they

1954
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,579
caught we didn't call it road kill skunk

1955
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:06,779
I was right in the middle of all this

1956
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:08,158
stuff we didn't call it that you can

1957
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:10,619
call it that now I know what you mean

1958
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:12,839
yeah it's accurate but that that name

1959
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:14,698
comes from Modern Times it doesn't come

1960
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,159
from back in the late 80s early 90s

1961
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:19,559
right you know skunk was it was just

1962
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:22,319
skunk you know and so like you know

1963
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,000
grower real growers in Virginia the ones

1964
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:26,099
that really put it all on the line back

1965
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,039
then the ones that really did what they

1966
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:32,520
wanted to do in spite of United States

1967
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:34,679
laws Virginia state laws Draconian drug

1968
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,080
laws those are the guys that were

1969
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:39,899
growing it and what were strain to grow

1970
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:42,000
than Super Skunk or skunk one Basics

1971
01:14:39,899 --> 01:14:44,039
Gunk what would be worse for you to grow

1972
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,140
in a place that you know there's no such

1973
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:47,880
thing as a carbon filter reminds you so

1974
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,199
what did they do they take that dead

1975
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,119
skunk that they found on the highway

1976
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,319
that they scooped up and put in the

1977
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,760
garbage bag and they throw it in front

1978
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,139
of their [ __ ] house until the someone

1979
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,659
came and cleaned it up and then go get

1980
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,219
another one until you know until their

1981
01:14:57,658 --> 01:15:00,899
house didn't smell exactly that's gone

1982
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:03,060
and the reason they did that is because

1983
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:06,599
that smell was so similar to that dead

1984
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:08,580
skunk that you know it worked right well

1985
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,960
we all know what skunk smells like and

1986
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:12,420
like we have to be honest for ourselves

1987
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,279
when we describe things and each other

1988
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,319
it's just not around anymore I don't

1989
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:17,939
know why but it's not around you know so

1990
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,559
well look I guess that answered my next

1991
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:21,839
question which was going to be do you

1992
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,120
have any leads on the Super Skunk but I

1993
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,319
guess as if we zoom out a bit there has

1994
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,500
been a bit of discussion in the

1995
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:30,420
community around the uh Super Skunk that

1996
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:33,060
he's passed around and whether the mass

1997
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:35,219
Super Skunk as we call it was the same

1998
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,620
as the original one that you first had

1999
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:40,198
what's your thoughts on that

2000
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:41,880
my thoughts are my experience and my

2001
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:45,419
experience is this

2002
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:48,359
um so we you call them Staten Island but

2003
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:51,480
we were very uh we were he's my mentor

2004
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:53,639
my brother uh he's someone I love we've

2005
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:55,619
known each other for a long time he's

2006
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,900
responsible he's who I got the chem dog

2007
01:15:55,619 --> 01:16:00,000
from he's the one who taught me

2008
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:04,500
everything that he knew at the moment

2009
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,899
he's the one that I uh you know I kind

2010
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,420
of linked up with uh some very private

2011
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:12,238
growers in Virginia where they traded

2012
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:15,060
Super Skunk for Kim dog and he traded a

2013
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:16,439
chem dog for the Super Skunk based on

2014
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,880
all the stories I tell them about you

2015
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:19,500
know it's like the one that got away you

2016
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,699
know like the super skunk you've got to

2017
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,158
check it out of course he had heard of

2018
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:25,559
it we hadn't seen it so when he brought

2019
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:27,119
it back you know he told me that he had

2020
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,280
passed it around some other folks in the

2021
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,979
tricest area it didn't matter to me I'm

2022
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:34,500
just a kid mind you and uh you know I

2023
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:36,658
was just grateful to kind of make the

2024
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:39,060
connection or be part of it or just you

2025
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:42,119
know the joy like show my friends in

2026
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:43,920
Virginia and him that like I care about

2027
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:45,899
this stuff you know it's not just I just

2028
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,060
don't want to smoke the joints I want to

2029
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:49,920
be you know it's what I can do to help

2030
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,179
you know like you know and it's not like

2031
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,560
when you're that young you don't think

2032
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:55,500
too much into it you just do what your

2033
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,360
role is you know and so anyways you know

2034
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:01,140
and he brought the super skunk back out

2035
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:03,719
to uh Sonoma County where we were at and

2036
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:06,420
was very grateful and that's where it

2037
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:08,340
went but we did lose it we did lose it

2038
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:10,619
and I remember the day I have so many

2039
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:13,560
details my memory we did lose it and I

2040
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:15,658
want to say you know 1998 I think is

2041
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,520
when it was it was very early on you

2042
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:19,920
know luckily I'd pass it up to some

2043
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,560
people in Humboldt County you know uh

2044
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,199
maybe two or three years before that

2045
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,560
um in 1995-ish you know when when all

2046
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:30,178
this happened for me and so uh there was

2047
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,159
always a possibility we could go get it

2048
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,658
again the people I passed it to didn't

2049
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:35,039
have it anymore they had passed it to

2050
01:17:33,658 --> 01:17:36,779
another guy who was going to give it

2051
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,179
back to me right that never actually

2052
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:41,158
happened so we kind of lost it you know

2053
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:43,980
we went on and that was that you know

2054
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:45,059
and uh and it's one of the saddest most

2055
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:47,039
regretful things that I've ever

2056
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:50,039
experienced in my life is you know

2057
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:53,519
losing that cut and so then you know

2058
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:54,960
fast forward to 2006 when I met G you

2059
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,000
know Kim dog

2060
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,619
um I met him because I I think I told

2061
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,779
you before in the previous story but so

2062
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:02,399
I won't get into that but I uh when I

2063
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:04,559
went out you know I was going to get the

2064
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:08,099
Kim sis and I mean the real original Kim

2065
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:10,140
says and and and bring him back some

2066
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:13,079
chem dog cuts some healthy good Kim dog

2067
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,960
cuts so I did and

2068
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:18,539
um as I've said before and so what he

2069
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:21,600
ended up giving me was the Kim d

2070
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:23,460
and the super skunk as he put it to me

2071
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,719
he got and I said the Super's gone and I

2072
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:27,179
was surprised when he gave it to me

2073
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:29,279
because this wasn't part of the deal and

2074
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:32,880
and he said yeah the one that you guys

2075
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:35,819
brought up back then you know in 1992 or

2076
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,520
three and I was like Wow right on I

2077
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:40,859
didn't know you know and so he didn't

2078
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,260
call the mask he ain't called the MSS he

2079
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:44,939
just called the super skunk you know and

2080
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:49,800
so I took it back home I flew it back

2081
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:51,719
home to California and grew him out and

2082
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,600
you know I've told you about the kimdi

2083
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:56,279
whatever this was you know my big hope I

2084
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,780
was like wow what a bonus like this is

2085
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:59,219
going to be great we've been missing

2086
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:01,019
this because we gave up on it we let it

2087
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:02,760
go we mourned over it you know what I

2088
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:04,800
mean and so

2089
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,480
um I grew it out and I've immediately

2090
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,699
noticed the stretch wasn't there you

2091
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:11,698
know the super skunk has a I've shown

2092
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:14,698
pictures on my Instagram and you know I

2093
01:19:11,698 --> 01:19:17,099
I've documented what the super skunk was

2094
01:19:14,698 --> 01:19:19,379
in photo I mean as good of photos you

2095
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:23,219
could take in 1995 with a with a camera

2096
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:26,039
and um so you know the stretch wasn't

2097
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:27,300
there alarming you know but there was a

2098
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:29,698
little bit of resemblance in the

2099
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:31,860
structure so I went with it and then I

2100
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:33,719
just kept on waiting for that smell kept

2101
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:37,439
on waiting and it just never appeared

2102
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:39,060
and in 2006 like as best as I knew and I

2103
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,039
want to say that best is we knew but

2104
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,900
I'll say as best as I knew there was a

2105
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:45,899
thing called genetic drift you know

2106
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:47,519
maybe that's what happened to it but it

2107
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:49,859
was such a

2108
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,320
painful memory of something that was

2109
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:53,698
gone that wasn't it that I just said you

2110
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,319
know what I don't want this cut I'm

2111
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:58,079
going to let it go I'm not interested in

2112
01:19:55,319 --> 01:20:00,420
it it's not it if it is it it's not the

2113
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:03,179
same I'm Letting Go and that's not like

2114
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:06,119
me I don't let Cuts go like that but I

2115
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:07,920
did only after one car and so that was

2116
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:09,300
the end of it and then you know I was

2117
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,640
kind of like damn dude I didn't even get

2118
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,840
the Kim says you know like

2119
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,600
so

2120
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:18,659
um then fast forward to say 2000 let's

2121
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,219
just say 18 or 19 I can't say you know

2122
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:22,979
then you know of course now we're here

2123
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:24,300
about the mass super skunk and so uh

2124
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:25,919
someone was kind enough on the east

2125
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,300
coast to send me

2126
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,359
um and I don't even it was almost

2127
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:32,219
Anonymous and but he definitely had the

2128
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,019
credentials to have the mass Super Skunk

2129
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:36,300
he's in Massachusetts he knows all the

2130
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:38,219
people and everything and so I grew it

2131
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:40,920
out and it was the same [ __ ] cut that

2132
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:43,260
I got from G in 2006. I immediately

2133
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,239
recognized it doesn't have the skunk

2134
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:47,280
Terps doesn't have all the things I love

2135
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:49,799
and then you know I don't even have that

2136
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:51,960
cut anymore because it's just I'm not

2137
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,820
saying it's a standalone for some it may

2138
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,859
but you have to understand that like it

2139
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:57,899
just brings up a bad memory for me you

2140
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:59,819
know it's like a disappointment no

2141
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:01,920
matter how good it is on its own it's

2142
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:03,179
just when you when you have the

2143
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,920
perception I have it's just a

2144
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:06,960
disappointment you know because you know

2145
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,000
the super skunk was the Holy Grail it

2146
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,279
was one of the best cuts that's ever you

2147
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,679
know been on this planet and so it's

2148
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:16,619
just a bad you know kind of memory so I

2149
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:18,779
let it go now I do believe based on what

2150
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:21,960
they've told me there that at one point

2151
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:24,059
that super skunk cut from Virginia was

2152
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,619
the cut that we're talking about I can't

2153
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,300
say for sure I don't know you know I

2154
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:29,939
wasn't around for all those decades in

2155
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,800
their Circle you know and so who knows

2156
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:33,658
you know you'd have to ask them but to

2157
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,640
me seems like something got mixed up

2158
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:37,679
because how could that be you know the

2159
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,600
Holy Grail it it's it's just not that

2160
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:42,179
great in my opinion you know yeah maybe

2161
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,560
because of my perception but still and I

2162
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:46,020
ain't I'm not trying to dog to cut don't

2163
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:48,239
don't send me no hate mail just it's

2164
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,860
just not my thing I'm a [ __ ] weirdo

2165
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,658
you know no that's good to get some

2166
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:53,099
clarification from your perspective for

2167
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:54,899
sure and you know while we're on the

2168
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:57,480
topic of the super skunk and you even

2169
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:59,399
reference Staten Island guy himself I

2170
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:01,379
get tons of people messaging me asking

2171
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:03,000
me you know was that weasel was it this

2172
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,440
guy do you think he's ever going to pop

2173
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,359
his head out will we ever hear from

2174
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:08,339
Staten Island just from my perspective

2175
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:10,679
seems like he played a huge role in the

2176
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,659
chem dog story and people are naturally

2177
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:14,340
curious is it someone the community

2178
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:17,639
knows or do you think he'll remain a

2179
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:20,640
mystery the answer is no and yes

2180
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:22,860
no is not part of the you know no he's

2181
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,260
not someone part of you say or part of

2182
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:27,420
the community and yes he seems like he's

2183
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:30,119
he's not interested in all this he's

2184
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:32,819
interested in the work you know

2185
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:34,260
um and so you know we've had our falling

2186
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:37,198
outs in the past and we've come together

2187
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:39,420
as family members do and that's us and I

2188
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:42,000
love him with all my heart and he's

2189
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,840
meant the world to me you know

2190
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,119
um

2191
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,100
he was not supposed to do what he did

2192
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:49,859
with me you know but he took a chance on

2193
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:51,480
me you know and I appreciate that but

2194
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:52,738
he's a you know he I don't want to say

2195
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:54,419
he's private I don't really necessary

2196
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:56,399
thing is he's just not interested in all

2197
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:58,260
this you know he just wants to do the

2198
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,238
work and I can't speak for him but

2199
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:01,800
that's all I can tell you you know but

2200
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:04,859
no he's none of those people he knows

2201
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,199
them all but is not no there's a lot of

2202
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:09,059
dudes in the weed industry well let's

2203
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,219
just back it up I said industry there's

2204
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:13,980
a lot of people who are in the Cannabis

2205
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:15,960
find Cannabis who did their work in

2206
01:23:13,979 --> 01:23:17,939
Staten Island he's just one of them you

2207
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,140
know there you go I love that but he

2208
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:20,879
knows all the ones you're talking about

2209
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,380
let's just say that yeah there you go

2210
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,539
there you go and you know and

2211
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,679
furthermore like if if if if this was

2212
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:28,380
important to him he's how many

2213
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,779
opportunities he had you know lots right

2214
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:33,539
and he's never expressed to me that he

2215
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:35,519
gives a [ __ ] about any of this so that's

2216
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:37,619
that there you go we'll kudos to you Mr

2217
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,960
Staten Island we're all appreciative we

2218
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:40,920
sure are I forgot to ask you earlier you

2219
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,279
mentioned when you were talking about

2220
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:46,199
the strains you would get in um Virginia

2221
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:48,119
that The Afghani was one in the mix is

2222
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:50,639
that the Virginia Beach Afghani we see

2223
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:52,559
nowadays I don't think so

2224
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:55,560
um based off memory

2225
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:57,000
um The Afghani was honestly a little bit

2226
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,580
more like the chem dog than the Virginia

2227
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,380
Beach Afghani but I would you know and

2228
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:04,019
like we caught it the Afghan that's what

2229
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:05,640
we caught it but as anyone knows none of

2230
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:08,340
those seeds were really called Afghan

2231
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:11,100
they were crosses you know in this and

2232
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:13,199
that so we I and I can't say which one

2233
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:15,239
it was you know I can't say but I can

2234
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:15,899
tell you it came from that seed stock I

2235
01:24:15,238 --> 01:24:17,939
can

2236
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:20,399
pretty accurately say that can't say

2237
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:23,759
firsthand but I would guess hard that it

2238
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:27,238
was but the Virginia Beach Afghani

2239
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:29,640
um which I have I I love it actually

2240
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:32,039
um and it's it's probably not exactly

2241
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,079
the same that one had the the Afghan had

2242
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:36,300
a bit more stretch the Virginia Beach

2243
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:40,140
afghanis pretty squat you know typical

2244
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:42,239
Afghan Highland type of strain this

2245
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,460
particular Fino of whatever whichever

2246
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,479
cross it actually was was a bit more

2247
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,179
stretchy

2248
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:49,619
had a bit more smell I had a bit more

2249
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:51,000
punch

2250
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:52,920
um but it was definitely in the same

2251
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,279
realm definitely in the same family it's

2252
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:58,560
no doubt you know yeah killer killer

2253
01:24:56,279 --> 01:25:01,319
well while we're on the topic of super

2254
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,679
skunks I wanna ask you

2255
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:06,299
there's been a lot of discussion about

2256
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:09,000
whether or not it's possible that the

2257
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:12,420
chemd is actually just chem 91 cross to

2258
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,880
a soup skunk so the idea is that chem 91

2259
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:17,219
is in fact the mother of chemd and it's

2260
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,319
possibly just a super skunk Herman to it

2261
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:20,939
something along those lines what

2262
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:23,579
thoughts come to mind when you hear that

2263
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:25,500
immediately wheel my first thought is

2264
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:29,219
does Kim do you smell like skunk

2265
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:32,158
no so you know the kimdi to me is an

2266
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:34,020
anomaly like I don't know where it came

2267
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:36,839
from I don't know what it is exactly I

2268
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:39,300
could only take what I hear from the

2269
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,739
people who say they know on face value

2270
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,320
but I definitely have questions about

2271
01:25:40,738 --> 01:25:44,879
what I hear I mean I all I can expect

2272
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:47,698
you all I can do is speculate and I

2273
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,340
would say no you know it just doesn't

2274
01:25:47,698 --> 01:25:52,379
like it's just such an anomaly the kimdi

2275
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:54,420
it's like outside of all of this it

2276
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,000
seems to me you know like

2277
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:58,679
course like who am I to say what's what

2278
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,079
as far as like and I don't mean like the

2279
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:03,300
stories I mean like what what is what is

2280
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:05,340
possible in genetics like when you make

2281
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,739
crosses like what what kind of recess

2282
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:10,079
yet you know recessive genes can pop out

2283
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:12,539
and and create something that smells

2284
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,939
like trash you know like it just doesn't

2285
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:16,800
relate to anything and I don't make any

2286
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:18,419
claims I just you know I just have

2287
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,520
questions probably more than most people

2288
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:22,920
do but it just doesn't make any sense

2289
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,800
but I would say no based on what I know

2290
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,779
of those two cuts you know I've we've

2291
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,679
we've worked with uh crosses of super

2292
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:33,059
skunk and chem D or Kim dog I'm sorry um

2293
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:36,239
and so none of them came out like the

2294
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:38,880
chemd you know we had uh you know Staten

2295
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:41,099
Islands you call this human uh we you

2296
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,100
know super dog seats you know yeah it

2297
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:46,500
was the first time I'd ever seen weed

2298
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:48,600
come from seed you know the super dog

2299
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:51,479
and it was phenomenal you know it had

2300
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:54,420
that skunky Turf you know it had those

2301
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:56,119
those Kim dog earthy Piney just like

2302
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:59,340
dripping

2303
01:26:56,119 --> 01:27:01,198
goodness but nothing came out like the

2304
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,360
chemd I'd never smelled anything like

2305
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:05,519
the kimdi until I smelled the kimdi and

2306
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:06,960
I could say since then the only things

2307
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,360
that I have smelled that are like candy

2308
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:12,359
or crosses with made with the candy Dog

2309
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:15,000
Patch girl glue right is that that's a

2310
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:18,059
chemd cross GMOs got some Kim D in it

2311
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,300
right I think GMO is chemd I think

2312
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:23,280
um I think Gorilla Glue uses a different

2313
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:25,619
chem cut well I'm not really that

2314
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:27,658
familiar but I can I grow the GMO here

2315
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:29,698
and I can say yep that's it you know

2316
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:31,679
there's no doubt you know we call them

2317
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:33,359
trash chirps here you know we call them

2318
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,739
[ __ ] disgusting trash trips and I

2319
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:35,939
tell people say you're going to smell

2320
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:37,919
this at first you're not gonna like it

2321
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:39,839
give it a second and you're gonna love

2322
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,819
it and that's exactly what happens and I

2323
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,880
feel like everybody feels this way it's

2324
01:27:41,819 --> 01:27:46,500
repulsive yet

2325
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:49,440
attractive all at the same time but it

2326
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:52,198
goes in that order what the [ __ ] to man

2327
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:53,879
let me smell that again you know so I we

2328
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:56,519
didn't come across any of those you know

2329
01:27:53,880 --> 01:28:00,539
and I've I've taken down many of those

2330
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:02,460
super super dog seeds uh phinos and you

2331
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:04,800
know they were two or three different

2332
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:07,079
types of Finos

2333
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,400
um there wasn't anything like chemd I

2334
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:09,960
never smelled anything like that in

2335
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:11,279
cannabis until I actually smelled the

2336
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:14,340
chemd

2337
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:16,259
so and look there's a very uh rigorous

2338
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:17,940
discussion around all the various

2339
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:20,400
different chemd cuttings there are

2340
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:22,500
without delving into you know trying to

2341
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:24,899
identify them from visuals or whatever

2342
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,579
like why do you think there are so many

2343
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:27,960
different chemd cuts out there do you

2344
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:29,760
think it just piggybacks off what you

2345
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,319
said before where it's just it's Unique

2346
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:33,119
people are looking for their own version

2347
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:36,599
or do you think there's something extra

2348
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:38,698
which goes into why we see like I think

2349
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,900
um Matt counted them at one point and

2350
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:42,599
there's something like seven different

2351
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:44,638
chemd cuts that float around wow I

2352
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,560
didn't know that um I've heard there's a

2353
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,239
few different floating around but I

2354
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,380
didn't know that you know

2355
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,319
um

2356
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:55,739
I only can go to what my ex I can only

2357
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:57,719
based on my experience with cannabis and

2358
01:28:55,738 --> 01:29:01,079
what I've heard and combined the two and

2359
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:04,619
I would say that most likely Cuts got

2360
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:07,319
lost and s1s popped up I just don't know

2361
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:09,359
I really don't know I I try to like not

2362
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:11,639
speculate there's enough of that out

2363
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,319
there they don't I don't think that my

2364
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:15,600
speculation needs to be added to the Hat

2365
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:17,698
I just don't and I don't find it to be

2366
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,219
useful and I find that speculations

2367
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:23,339
usually lead to

2368
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:25,500
um you know nope that's not it you know

2369
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:27,420
so I don't really know you know I don't

2370
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:29,639
know I just took take it on face value

2371
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:31,859
you know if I wasn't there then I don't

2372
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:33,779
know and it's just that simple and you

2373
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:35,339
know that allows you for a good night's

2374
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:36,899
sleep when you live by this you know

2375
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,699
it's the you know the internet

2376
01:29:36,899 --> 01:29:41,519
detectives who have it all figured out

2377
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:43,738
you know their version has got you know

2378
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,800
the the phrase I hear that it always

2379
01:29:43,738 --> 01:29:48,658
makes me pauses yeah that makes sense

2380
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,659
well how does that make sense you know

2381
01:29:48,658 --> 01:29:53,519
does it make sense genetically like are

2382
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:54,839
you talking about recessive genes are

2383
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,960
you talking about combinations of

2384
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,699
genetics that make a brand new like what

2385
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,619
does it make sense to you you know like

2386
01:29:59,698 --> 01:30:04,259
how does it make sense so I that phrase

2387
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:06,300
makes me pause you know people say it to

2388
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:08,460
me all the time they'll be like they'll

2389
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,800
ask me a question and I'll tell them my

2390
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,899
experience I'll tell them my life I'll

2391
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,760
tell a story about what happened that I

2392
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:17,698
was there for and then they'll say that

2393
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:20,460
makes sense no it doesn't none of this

2394
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:22,079
makes [ __ ] sense to anyone dude you

2395
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,880
know what I mean like how does it make

2396
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:25,619
sense to you because people will have

2397
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,440
biases they have perceptions that they

2398
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:30,000
hold on to we all do it doesn't matter

2399
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:31,859
what it is you know it could be about

2400
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,479
anything in life you know but we all

2401
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:36,299
hold on to that and we have to be

2402
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:38,519
careful with that because we can add

2403
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:40,800
a false narrative to a story that's not

2404
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,840
even ours to tell and this happens every

2405
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,219
day in canvas as we know and I just

2406
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,920
don't want to do that I don't need to

2407
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:48,779
add to that my experience is limited but

2408
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,760
it's also vast I've had a lot of

2409
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:52,500
experience with some of this stuff just

2410
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,719
kind of chance kind of coincidentally

2411
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,100
I'm okay with just sticking with that I

2412
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,079
don't need to figure out anything else

2413
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:00,780
I'll let the people the internet

2414
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,340
detectives figure that out and I'll you

2415
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:04,920
know enjoy their stories as they come

2416
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,719
you know that's that I like it

2417
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:09,119
diplomatic well look while we're on the

2418
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,619
topic you mentioned the um the Superdog

2419
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:13,500
and we're talking about strains from

2420
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:16,738
sort of yesteryear are there any strains

2421
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:21,719
from the Sonoma Bay Area Mendo sort of

2422
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:23,579
area in that 95 to 2005 period that you

2423
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:25,079
miss that aren't the super skunk maybe

2424
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:26,880
strains that don't get as much of a

2425
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:28,319
mention but you do remember like oh that

2426
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,039
was a good one I kind of wish we had

2427
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,399
that

2428
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:34,920
jeez man my my answer is probably pretty

2429
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:37,979
boring of that because we were so delved

2430
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,139
into our chem dog you know like when I

2431
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:41,399
got the sour diesel I was like wow look

2432
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:42,900
at this you know and it had already been

2433
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:45,658
around you know I didn't even get that

2434
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:48,719
cut until like let's say 2002 three-ish

2435
01:31:45,658 --> 01:31:49,979
I think you know you know I you know my

2436
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,719
perception is kind of you have to

2437
01:31:49,979 --> 01:31:54,658
understand that like I lived in a bubble

2438
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:56,939
you know like I wasn't out here in the

2439
01:31:54,658 --> 01:31:58,439
world like hey man like we're this is

2440
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:01,379
what we're doing you know we were very

2441
01:31:58,439 --> 01:32:03,539
private like we lived in the old school

2442
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,980
by the old school rules like we don't

2443
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:07,500
talk about this stuff there's no deal

2444
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:09,299
now the the downside of that was like

2445
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,460
maybe we didn't get introduced to a lot

2446
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:13,440
of cuts but if but the answer to that

2447
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:16,139
question in the Bay Area would have been

2448
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:18,658
that super silver a haze cut that I

2449
01:32:16,139 --> 01:32:21,539
mentioned before that was a standout it

2450
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:24,599
was outside of our lane outside of our

2451
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:27,060
realm but it was lovely beautiful and

2452
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:29,699
just amazing smoke so that would be the

2453
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,900
first thing that pops to my mind

2454
01:32:29,698 --> 01:32:32,579
um

2455
01:32:30,899 --> 01:32:36,119
I mean of course you know like when I

2456
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:38,340
discovered OG Kush I was probably a

2457
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:40,139
little bit around that area era like

2458
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:43,199
2003 and that may have been a little

2459
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:45,179
late in the OG Kush story right so to me

2460
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:48,479
in my perspective and my little bubble

2461
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:51,179
like wow you know this is amazing you

2462
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:52,799
know and uh and so that would fall in

2463
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:55,560
that category so these answers aren't

2464
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,239
like sexy they're not [ __ ] fun but

2465
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,400
they are that's the answer you know like

2466
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:02,879
I was just in a bubble like we were just

2467
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:05,579
growing Super Skunk chem dog you know

2468
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:08,219
like you know and eventually Sour Diesel

2469
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:10,559
but like we were stuck in that you know

2470
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:12,239
my little circle no totally

2471
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,100
understandable if that's what you're

2472
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:16,619
working with and it was sort of almost

2473
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,600
on the Forefront in a sense but because

2474
01:33:16,619 --> 01:33:20,219
no one really knew how good chem was at

2475
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,739
that time it's only now I feel like it's

2476
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:27,359
really in the Zeitgeist oh yeah for sure

2477
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:29,339
you know like we or I was die hard I

2478
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,960
just grow what I like you know like I

2479
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,539
don't pay attention to the outside noise

2480
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,239
I never did to my own detriment and I

2481
01:33:33,539 --> 01:33:38,698
mentioned this before and so like I

2482
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:40,379
would push like and I mean push I'd be

2483
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:42,359
like check this weed this check this Kim

2484
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,159
dog out and I would get the same

2485
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:45,420
response like I don't want to look at

2486
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:46,679
that I've already seen it I'm not

2487
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,960
interested in it do you have any sour

2488
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:51,899
diesel OG kush I'm like geez man you

2489
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,698
know no I got a big [ __ ] tub full of

2490
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:56,099
this you know check it out it's amazing

2491
01:33:53,698 --> 01:33:57,238
just look no I've already seen it and

2492
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,739
it's because they'd already seen The

2493
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:00,658
Fakes you know they've already seen the

2494
01:33:58,738 --> 01:34:02,939
fake cuts and it was not just one there

2495
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:04,679
was mini you know and it was frustrating

2496
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:06,000
it was kind of heartbreaking because my

2497
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:08,219
favorite weed wasn't good enough for

2498
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,500
everybody else anymore you know what was

2499
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:11,819
well OG cushion Sour Diesel I'm like

2500
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:14,819
well if you like those you're gonna like

2501
01:34:11,819 --> 01:34:17,819
this so that's kind of it you know like

2502
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:21,179
I was in a bubble I kept myself there

2503
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:23,219
for better for worse and that's just my

2504
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:25,020
perspective you know no it makes sense

2505
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:27,060
totally and you mentioned the sour

2506
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:29,460
diesel I wanted to quickly ask you is

2507
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:31,260
the diesel therapy seems like it's also

2508
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:34,079
got quite a cult following it's a bit of

2509
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:36,179
a Powerhouse in terms of the fan demand

2510
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,100
what do you think it is about this cross

2511
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:40,079
that seems to be grabbing people's

2512
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,579
attention because I mean I don't know

2513
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,819
the back end but it seems extremely

2514
01:34:41,579 --> 01:34:47,519
popular it is it surprised me and you

2515
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:49,500
know when you make uh you know if when

2516
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:52,380
you decide to make several crosses you

2517
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:54,719
just never know what the what the users

2518
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:56,460
are going to like you know and that one

2519
01:34:54,719 --> 01:35:00,000
surprised me a little bit

2520
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:02,158
um but it's just I think what it is I

2521
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,039
think Sour Diesel well I know Sour

2522
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:07,319
Diesel it comes and goes in popularity

2523
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,899
and it's very popular right now you know

2524
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:11,279
like you can go across the board you can

2525
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:13,920
look at all kinds of stuff that's out

2526
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:15,960
there from what I can see that it's very

2527
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,760
desired right now and it doesn't

2528
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,100
surprise me it's I mean it's one of the

2529
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,800
less strange it's ever you know come

2530
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:24,840
across the scene and so I think that's

2531
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,460
what it is you know I don't think it's

2532
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,260
anything else I think that's what it is

2533
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:30,179
and the East Coast Sour Diesel is a

2534
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:33,000
great representation of What Sour Diesel

2535
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:36,239
can be as far as like you know the way

2536
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,158
it looks the way it smells the effect

2537
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,439
um and the East Coast Tower diesel is a

2538
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:43,738
little easier to deal with than they you

2539
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:45,479
know I don't I dare to say original Sour

2540
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:48,238
Diesel because that's probably not even

2541
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:49,738
the right way to describe it but it's

2542
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:51,299
it's a little easier to grow it's a

2543
01:35:49,738 --> 01:35:54,000
little shorter a little stouter a little

2544
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:56,279
stockier it's a little bit less stretch

2545
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,539
well it's a lot less stretch really and

2546
01:35:56,279 --> 01:35:58,859
so that was what made it a good

2547
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:00,840
candidate you know of course I'm going

2548
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:02,579
to be I'm always [ __ ] around with

2549
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,600
sour diesel [ __ ] you know I love it you

2550
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:06,300
know

2551
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,120
um but if if I was like uh and I think

2552
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:10,380
that Kim Fuego is going to give you all

2553
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:12,420
the traits that you're going to look for

2554
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:14,039
in Sour Diesel but maybe because it

2555
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:15,539
doesn't have the name up front maybe

2556
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:17,219
that's what it is so I think that's what

2557
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:19,619
it is I think it's the name you know

2558
01:36:17,219 --> 01:36:22,380
people people want to you know bring

2559
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:24,779
that fuel that diesel that fire you know

2560
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:26,819
right back in and so there it is you

2561
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:28,559
know 100 percent look we're gonna have

2562
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:30,479
to drill down into some of the strains

2563
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,920
because in the last chat we did

2564
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,138
um these weren't really released and so

2565
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,119
people have accumulated their questions

2566
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:38,639
and I guess on the topic of

2567
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:40,619
experimenting with new crosses a lot of

2568
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,600
people are really keen on the Tropicana

2569
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:44,819
Cherry cross you've been posting about

2570
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,039
and you've also done some hybrids with

2571
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:48,840
the apple fritter I guess in general you

2572
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:51,179
could say that you're bringing some some

2573
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,860
new uh genetics into the library making

2574
01:36:51,179 --> 01:36:55,440
some crosses with some more sort of

2575
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:57,539
modern stuff what's been your take on

2576
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:00,000
this and what and what uh crosses have

2577
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:03,359
sort of caught your eye I'm trying to

2578
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,039
expand and kind of get more experience

2579
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,079
with some of the newer crosses you know

2580
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,600
or the newer you know hybrids that are

2581
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:11,100
out there like the ones you mentioned

2582
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,020
and I like a lot of them you know

2583
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:15,000
they're outside of my wheelhouse or

2584
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:16,920
outside of my you know the things that I

2585
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,439
like about candles but I'm okay with

2586
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:20,940
that I'm open to it and so

2587
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:22,439
um I thought I was being kind of unique

2588
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:23,519
making those crosses and now it looks

2589
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:27,000
like a lot of breeders have been working

2590
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,980
with especially those two cuts but I you

2591
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,079
know we've tested them out you know our

2592
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:34,619
testing you know we move at a certain

2593
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:38,219
Pace we have a flow here I have a flow

2594
01:37:34,619 --> 01:37:41,340
um and it might be a little more slower

2595
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:43,319
than some and so we're here we've tested

2596
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:45,840
it out we really like it I like it you

2597
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:47,939
know so we've released them or we're

2598
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,800
getting ready to release them and I'm

2599
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:52,859
really happy with them you know and I

2600
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,779
and I I get a little bit of pushback

2601
01:37:52,859 --> 01:37:57,719
from the chem dog heads out there about

2602
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:59,399
it but that's okay you know

2603
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:01,800
um we can't make everyone happy all the

2604
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:03,539
time and but we want to like you know

2605
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:05,340
kind of cross it's like an opportunity

2606
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:07,800
to take the old school and cross it into

2607
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:09,060
the new school and kind of show the new

2608
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,900
school with the old school is all about

2609
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:15,600
in a cross you know and how things can

2610
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:18,719
be improved especially in the area of

2611
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:20,940
potency and also inflate flavor I hate

2612
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:23,939
to say and but we've we succeeded there

2613
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:25,379
and so like that's the idea and maybe

2614
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,939
we're always a little late to the game

2615
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:28,800
we always have been

2616
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:31,079
um but we do it right I do it right we

2617
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,100
do it right and and those two are the

2618
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:34,380
results of that we're going to release

2619
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:36,420
them later this month you know oh that's

2620
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,579
exciting and I mean you just referenced

2621
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,560
the Die Hard chem heads and one of the

2622
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:42,840
questions I have received a few times

2623
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,719
over the past few years probably one you

2624
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:48,179
get quite a lot is will people ever be

2625
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:52,859
able to get a pure chemline from you

2626
01:38:48,179 --> 01:38:57,060
maybe like a bx4 a bx5 just straight 91.

2627
01:38:52,859 --> 01:38:59,339
well we did make a bx4 selected and I

2628
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:02,159
and I've mentioned this to folks before

2629
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:04,920
um it was he was doing pretty good in

2630
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:06,960
the crosses and he was the one that we

2631
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,960
were probably going to test a lot of his

2632
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:13,079
progeny his brothers and sisters out and

2633
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:15,239
say okay this is the chem BX that we're

2634
01:39:13,079 --> 01:39:16,409
going to release however

2635
01:39:15,238 --> 01:39:17,839
um in

2636
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:21,779
[Music]

2637
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,520
2019 in Sonoma County most of the county

2638
01:39:21,779 --> 01:39:26,279
and I mean literally almost all the

2639
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,820
county got evacuated due to fire another

2640
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:33,059
[ __ ] Wildfire fueled by the El Diablo

2641
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:35,579
winds this is Nightmare and um during

2642
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:38,280
that of course when you a have a genetic

2643
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:41,519
library and you know full growing mother

2644
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:43,738
State outside of tissue culture you're

2645
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,940
going to not be able to leave your home

2646
01:39:43,738 --> 01:39:49,319
unless you want to lose big time so

2647
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:52,019
although the Emergency Services

2648
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:53,759
Sheriff's Department fire department and

2649
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:55,920
others were coming through the area

2650
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,060
where we were keeping the library I was

2651
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,279
keeping the library

2652
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:01,739
when I say we I mean with me you know

2653
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:05,279
but it's a habit so

2654
01:40:01,738 --> 01:40:06,959
um they we were uh basically hiding from

2655
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,779
the emergency services and not

2656
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,760
evacuating now you know

2657
01:40:09,779 --> 01:40:14,460
anybody listen to this you take those

2658
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:16,739
wildfires very seriously those fires can

2659
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:19,260
be very fast we had a good advantage

2660
01:40:16,738 --> 01:40:21,899
point and I had rooted cuttings you know

2661
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:24,360
in the bathroom of my RV under a

2662
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:27,479
skylight just in case we had to go along

2663
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:28,979
with the family photos you know and the

2664
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:31,979
glassware and all the things that matter

2665
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:33,718
in life that you cannot replace and so

2666
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:36,178
we were ready to go but I wanted to keep

2667
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:39,179
my moms going too well however we did

2668
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:41,699
lose the X4 male so we have the seed

2669
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:43,679
still but I've decided to kind of put

2670
01:40:41,698 --> 01:40:46,138
that on hold for now

2671
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:48,899
um I want to do the feminized project

2672
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:50,400
that we talked about and I want to um I

2673
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:52,920
have some other crosses that I've made

2674
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:54,479
that I'm testing out so for space I'm

2675
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:56,158
just leaving that alone

2676
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,198
I don't really feel like people are

2677
01:40:56,158 --> 01:41:01,138
gonna be

2678
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:04,919
getting what they expect I think the

2679
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:07,739
expectations of BX line released as it

2680
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,840
is will be less because like I said I

2681
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:11,339
don't I'm not trying to recreate Kim dog

2682
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,260
I'm not trying to put it and see I'm

2683
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:15,239
trying I always was trying to make a

2684
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:17,219
stud that I could cross with my favorite

2685
01:41:15,238 --> 01:41:19,738
females that wasn't going to dominate

2686
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:23,340
them but add potency to them add flavor

2687
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:26,579
to them add that extra little fuel you

2688
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:30,000
know chem Fuel and so if you were to

2689
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:32,579
grow them out and I have like you may

2690
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,960
you may it may you may feel like you're

2691
01:41:32,579 --> 01:41:36,479
not getting what you want you know I

2692
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:38,219
mean because my goal was not to recreate

2693
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:40,738
chem dog and Seed form

2694
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:42,600
so but to answer your question yeah I

2695
01:41:40,738 --> 01:41:45,779
will be doing that work but I have to

2696
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:48,000
kind of start from where I had started a

2697
01:41:45,779 --> 01:41:49,800
couple years ago and then I'm gonna have

2698
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,779
to gear it towards that and so that's a

2699
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,940
little bit different work than creating

2700
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:55,979
the studs that I've that I've created in

2701
01:41:53,939 --> 01:41:57,779
order to make the seeds that I make the

2702
01:41:55,979 --> 01:41:59,459
F1 hybrids

2703
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:00,658
um I'm gonna have to kind of backtrack a

2704
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,880
little bit and there's more work

2705
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:06,420
involved than people realize like to

2706
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:09,359
take all my bx3 seeds and I have bx4

2707
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:13,440
seeds too and just say this is the bx4

2708
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:15,539
I don't it's accurate but it's also the

2709
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,339
goal wasn't to get that to the market

2710
01:42:15,539 --> 01:42:18,840
the goal was to create a stud that

2711
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,940
doesn't overpower every female that

2712
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:22,679
comes in here and so if you were to grow

2713
01:42:20,939 --> 01:42:25,079
them out you'd be like wait a minute you

2714
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:26,699
know so you have to back it up a little

2715
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:28,019
bit and then you have to reselect for

2716
01:42:26,698 --> 01:42:29,879
different reasons and then you can

2717
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:33,000
continue the work once you find your

2718
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:35,579
selections with that goal in mind right

2719
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,979
and so this is like this is a lot more

2720
01:42:35,579 --> 01:42:40,500
work you know this is basically starting

2721
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:42,419
over in some ways not completely

2722
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:44,219
starting over but maybe going back to

2723
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:46,319
the bx3 generation and selecting for

2724
01:42:44,219 --> 01:42:49,380
different traits which certainly could

2725
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:50,819
happen and then you know maybe taking it

2726
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:53,520
in a different direction instead of

2727
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:55,738
going back into back cross maybe start

2728
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,960
to create filial Generations that are

2729
01:42:55,738 --> 01:43:02,339
geared towards that goal which I think

2730
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:04,618
is be a better more uh like a more

2731
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:06,360
um you know like what's the word like

2732
01:43:04,618 --> 01:43:07,920
it's it that would be a more accurate

2733
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:10,799
way of doing it at this point you know

2734
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:12,300
like an IBL essentially you know and so

2735
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,279
this is years and years and years of

2736
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:17,100
work you know I don't really think that

2737
01:43:14,279 --> 01:43:18,599
a bx3 or bx4 chem at this point is

2738
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,980
really useful to anybody I don't think

2739
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,119
it's going to be as great as anyone

2740
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:23,000
thinks you know what I mean that's

2741
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:26,039
basically what I'm saying I'd rather

2742
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,139
select brother and sister and move

2743
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:30,118
forward that way you know from one of

2744
01:43:28,139 --> 01:43:32,699
the generations and I haven't begun that

2745
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:35,099
work yet well I backed up I have begun

2746
01:43:32,698 --> 01:43:37,259
to work but I haven't like narrowed it

2747
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,940
down this is big work you know this is

2748
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,920
important work to do what you're asking

2749
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:43,319
or what you're suggesting

2750
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:46,440
and so I just haven't I that's gonna

2751
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:48,238
take that's a lifetime you know and we

2752
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:50,460
we're not going to do her dirty we're

2753
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:53,579
not going to try to make a quick Buck on

2754
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:54,899
a bx3 we're not doing that you know so

2755
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:57,300
that's the answer we're not going to do

2756
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:59,279
that we're going to probably go a

2757
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:02,039
different route we're going to select

2758
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:03,719
some filial generations F1 two three

2759
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:05,639
four five all the way wherever it is

2760
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:07,859
that's where it'll happen we're doing

2761
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:10,079
the background truthfully we're not

2762
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,359
really focused on it right now I'm not

2763
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:14,579
focused on right now sure it's a great

2764
01:44:12,359 --> 01:44:16,799
and a very comprehensive answer very

2765
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:18,658
much related but one I got from two

2766
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:21,360
different of our patreon listeners was

2767
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:24,000
sort of in that same vein they wanted to

2768
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,519
know of what's currently available what

2769
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,899
do you think best embodies the chem dog

2770
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,100
if someone was saying look what's just

2771
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:31,439
something that's going to give me a

2772
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:33,900
really good idea of what chemdog is

2773
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:35,939
which strain would you recommend that's

2774
01:44:33,899 --> 01:44:38,039
really easy so it's going to be griller

2775
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:40,079
for me you know

2776
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:42,779
um not by Design but kind of by Design

2777
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:45,000
it's also going to be double Crush you

2778
01:44:42,779 --> 01:44:46,380
know which you know the road dog like we

2779
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,600
talked about before it's kind of close

2780
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:50,699
relative very close relative that one's

2781
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,920
kind of taken over in that realm but I

2782
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:54,899
would say the double crush and certainly

2783
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:56,340
the gorilla for me the gorilla for me

2784
01:44:54,899 --> 01:44:58,379
when someone asked me that's immediately

2785
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,300
the answer you know you're going to find

2786
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:02,699
a lot of females that are very similar

2787
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:04,980
to the chem dog you know so that's what

2788
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:08,939
it is you know what I meant by that is

2789
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:11,459
that the bx3 is not as Kim doggy as the

2790
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:13,559
gorilla fume of the best phenos you know

2791
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:15,420
so that's the answer like the girl who

2792
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:17,880
may I always tell people that's chem dog

2793
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:19,560
in seed form you know that's as good as

2794
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:21,840
it's going to get you know we could

2795
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:25,020
probably do better but you know we

2796
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,039
haven't yet you know so and look just in

2797
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:27,600
the last question you're talking about

2798
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:29,100
the different chem dog miles you have

2799
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,719
them playing around with filial braiding

2800
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:33,600
I think you mentioned to me that you've

2801
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:35,399
been playing with a new male a Master

2802
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,480
Kush hybrid can you tell us anything

2803
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:39,599
about that

2804
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:41,819
yeah so we we one of our new we have a

2805
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:44,460
new release coming out Lucky Dog Seed Co

2806
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:46,738
does you know sometime Christmasy maybe

2807
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:48,000
depending on if we can come up with some

2808
01:45:46,738 --> 01:45:49,500
names

2809
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,760
um we're not real good at that well

2810
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,118
maybe we're good at it but it takes time

2811
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:56,579
but um so we have what we have Grand

2812
01:45:54,118 --> 01:45:59,039
Master Kim is our new one and that's the

2813
01:45:56,579 --> 01:46:01,679
Master Kush cross with the chemdog vx3

2814
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:03,600
male that we're all familiar with well

2815
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,460
we happen to have made f2s of that as

2816
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,980
well so we're not really planning on

2817
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:10,920
doing any extra work with that F2 mail

2818
01:46:07,979 --> 01:46:13,618
the mail that we used in the F2 we do

2819
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:15,239
have him around still for obvious

2820
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:17,399
reasons because we want to be at we are

2821
01:46:15,238 --> 01:46:19,259
happy with that cross and we want to be

2822
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:21,719
able to continually make it so we have

2823
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:23,820
for that reason will he go to anything

2824
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:25,800
else will we further work him I don't

2825
01:46:23,819 --> 01:46:28,679
really know that I don't really have a

2826
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:31,139
sense that we will that I will we just

2827
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:33,179
you know we wanted to make that F2 you

2828
01:46:31,139 --> 01:46:35,100
know we wanted to because we saw some

2829
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:37,139
diversity but we love the diversity so

2830
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:39,360
we wanted to kind of narrow it down and

2831
01:46:37,139 --> 01:46:40,859
the F2 generation and I think we did

2832
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:43,198
that I feel like we narrowed it down

2833
01:46:40,859 --> 01:46:46,139
from say seven or eight phinos down to

2834
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,519
five four three somewhere in there and

2835
01:46:46,139 --> 01:46:49,020
that's more what we're trying to do so

2836
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:51,719
that's why we did it and we've done it

2837
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:53,280
with other crosses I've made but not the

2838
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:56,639
same success that we're having with that

2839
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:58,079
guy in in his partner so you know that's

2840
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,960
kind of it you know that's why we're

2841
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:02,639
making that one because we

2842
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,500
I you know it was one of the ones that

2843
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:06,480
was going to go in the drawer that I

2844
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,738
mentioned before and we fell in love

2845
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:10,079
with some of the females we're like okay

2846
01:47:07,738 --> 01:47:12,000
what would we what do I do well let's

2847
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:14,698
make an F2 you know let's see if we can

2848
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,679
narrow down we did you know we're not

2849
01:47:14,698 --> 01:47:18,178
going to release dev2 yet because we

2850
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:20,819
want we have to do more testing but

2851
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:23,219
we're ready to release the F1 uh we got

2852
01:47:20,819 --> 01:47:24,840
Grand Master Kim we think it's kind of

2853
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:27,118
catchy and we think people are going to

2854
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:29,400
love it you know that's exciting I mean

2855
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:30,960
Master Kush is one you don't hear of as

2856
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:33,299
much these days so good to see that

2857
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:35,158
making a comeback I've got a similar

2858
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:36,779
sort of question for you in a sense to

2859
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:38,158
the last one

2860
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:41,399
um in terms of the recommendation of the

2861
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:43,138
chem what would you recommend if you

2862
01:47:41,399 --> 01:47:44,638
can't know any specifics about the

2863
01:47:43,139 --> 01:47:46,679
grower any you don't get to find out

2864
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:48,960
anything about their preferences you can

2865
01:47:46,679 --> 01:47:50,880
only recommend one pack so I guess in

2866
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,279
essence what I'm saying is what pack do

2867
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:55,380
you think is like broad appeal most

2868
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:56,639
people are going to be into it what is

2869
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,600
your cookie cutter that you would

2870
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:00,000
recommend

2871
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,860
did you say cookie cutter what it's

2872
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,179
almost like you're subliminally trying

2873
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:06,839
to get the answer I mean that would be

2874
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:09,300
the Schism this gives them fade Schism

2875
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,100
is the only cut the only seeds I've made

2876
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:15,060
that have some of that cookie in it's

2877
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:18,960
got the OG KB crossed to the Cyber band

2878
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:20,699
so the the male in the in that cross the

2879
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:24,719
tits is what it's called this is the

2880
01:48:20,698 --> 01:48:27,238
[ __ ] it is the the male to the the sour

2881
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:30,420
band male using that cross is direct

2882
01:48:27,238 --> 01:48:33,000
progeny direct brother and sister to the

2883
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:35,100
female that I used in the sour uh I'm

2884
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,020
sorry the Kim Fuego the sour band that's

2885
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:39,239
used in the Kim Fuego so they're

2886
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,380
directly related in that sense and the

2887
01:48:39,238 --> 01:48:43,019
Schism

2888
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:47,219
um is a cross between the tits and the

2889
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:48,719
bx3 male right and so honestly it's one

2890
01:48:47,219 --> 01:48:51,179
of my favorites even though I'm not a

2891
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:54,118
big cookies guy I just love that [ __ ]

2892
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:58,560
cross every I say this with 100

2893
01:48:54,118 --> 01:49:00,420
confidence every single uh Schism seed

2894
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,820
that I ever popped and grew out I would

2895
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:07,079
have kept as a clone only no doubt and

2896
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:09,599
that I that's me saying it I 100 now I

2897
01:49:07,079 --> 01:49:11,158
can't tell you why it hasn't been you

2898
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,980
know the Kim Fuego is our most popular

2899
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:17,158
the Dog Patch is up there for obvious

2900
01:49:13,979 --> 01:49:20,819
reasons you know sour band right but

2901
01:49:17,158 --> 01:49:24,420
that that Schism is just off the chain

2902
01:49:20,819 --> 01:49:26,698
easy to grow it's got both worlds it's

2903
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:29,100
got the new and the old mixed perfectly

2904
01:49:26,698 --> 01:49:32,219
all phenos you know like you're gonna be

2905
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:34,739
happy so that's the answer you know like

2906
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:38,100
it's interesting but that's the one that

2907
01:49:34,738 --> 01:49:40,319
you're I love it and is one of the rare

2908
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:42,719
one as one of the few people who's been

2909
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:44,579
lucky enough to try the rare tits cut

2910
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,020
it's truly a special cutting and I'm

2911
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:49,439
sure that pairing is going to tick a lot

2912
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:51,360
of boxes so let's do a um Let's do an

2913
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,519
adaptation of one of the questions we

2914
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:55,319
asked you last time so in our last chat

2915
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,420
I asked you if you had a time machine

2916
01:49:55,319 --> 01:49:59,279
like what would you go back and get so

2917
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:01,199
now I'm going to modify that question a

2918
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:03,238
little bit right let's just say those El

2919
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:05,099
Diablo wins had knocked out your entire

2920
01:50:03,238 --> 01:50:07,198
Library you lost absolutely everything

2921
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:09,179
turn up and I say I've got the time

2922
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:12,539
machine for you but you can only bring

2923
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:15,239
back one pack of Lucky Dog seeds and

2924
01:50:12,539 --> 01:50:17,939
you're going to restart the company with

2925
01:50:15,238 --> 01:50:20,218
a male presumably from this one pack of

2926
01:50:17,939 --> 01:50:22,500
seeds what pack of seeds are you going

2927
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:23,639
to restart the company with that's a

2928
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,760
good question

2929
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:25,760
um

2930
01:50:26,698 --> 01:50:30,419
male

2931
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:32,399
the mail oh I mean you could do whatever

2932
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:33,840
you want to read something but I presume

2933
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:35,759
you're going to get a rake pack and get

2934
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,920
a mail that's a good question I like

2935
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:41,539
that I got my head going here

2936
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:41,539
um I would say

2937
01:50:43,859 --> 01:50:47,639
man that's a tough one I don't know I

2938
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,840
like that Schism

2939
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:51,600
um

2940
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:53,159
I don't know like it depends on what I

2941
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:55,619
was trying to do like if I was gonna go

2942
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:57,599
back to you know working with Kim dog

2943
01:50:55,618 --> 01:50:59,819
and trying to wrap you know put Kim dog

2944
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:02,280
and Seed form it would be gorilla fume

2945
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:03,539
it would be you know it's special like

2946
01:51:02,279 --> 01:51:06,118
that

2947
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:07,738
um but you know I tend to want to answer

2948
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:09,479
it a different way but that's probably

2949
01:51:07,738 --> 01:51:10,919
the answer

2950
01:51:09,479 --> 01:51:12,599
um I would want to do that because it's

2951
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:14,219
chem dog you know and that's what I'm

2952
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:16,440
into that's my thing you know I love it

2953
01:51:14,219 --> 01:51:18,179
and nothing you know messes with my

2954
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:19,618
brain chemistry better you know and I

2955
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:21,899
think a lot of us agree once we

2956
01:51:19,618 --> 01:51:23,639
experience that like it's hard to

2957
01:51:21,899 --> 01:51:25,799
it's always going to be compared to

2958
01:51:23,639 --> 01:51:28,079
everything else we as we move forward so

2959
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,480
maybe that would be it but also like the

2960
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:33,179
Bohemian Highway comes to mind which has

2961
01:51:30,479 --> 01:51:35,698
really literally been one of my least

2962
01:51:33,179 --> 01:51:38,520
sought after which has always surprised

2963
01:51:35,698 --> 01:51:40,198
me because it's fire and the people who

2964
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:41,159
did buy it they always come back you

2965
01:51:40,198 --> 01:51:43,439
know

2966
01:51:41,158 --> 01:51:45,960
um I had a farm up in Philo California

2967
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:47,460
Mendocino County who I don't know where

2968
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:49,198
they got back from it wasn't for me but

2969
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:50,698
they got it from a seed bank and then

2970
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:52,919
they reached out to me you know they're

2971
01:51:50,698 --> 01:51:55,138
a farm you know they're a legal farm and

2972
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:57,118
they wanted to get quite a bit of bulk

2973
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:59,400
of that and then I was like finally

2974
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:01,559
someone recognized you know

2975
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:05,879
um what this is this cut is

2976
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:08,820
um and uh so I would say that that kind

2977
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,139
of makes me think about that one but I

2978
01:52:08,819 --> 01:52:11,158
can't get away from the fact that I

2979
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:13,020
would want to try to get back to the

2980
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:15,059
chem dog as fast as I could and then

2981
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:17,760
that would be the gorilla fume you know

2982
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:19,260
yeah great answer and I mean maybe

2983
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,360
there'll be some overlap with the answer

2984
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:24,139
for this one but a lot of the time

2985
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:26,639
people are interested obviously

2986
01:52:24,139 --> 01:52:28,679
yield for some people is very important

2987
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,779
what do you think is the most

2988
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:33,719
commercially viable in the sense that

2989
01:52:30,779 --> 01:52:35,340
it's a good compromise of potency yield

2990
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:39,300
all the different aspects that would

2991
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:42,060
make it suitable for production hmm

2992
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:44,940
I don't know I would I I guess I would

2993
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:48,060
try to you know I would think about one

2994
01:52:44,939 --> 01:52:49,738
that uh has a good really solid yield

2995
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:52,199
easy to grow it's not going to be

2996
01:52:49,738 --> 01:52:54,599
complicated it's not going to compete in

2997
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:57,238
a negative way with other strains or

2998
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,560
phenotypes you have in your garden and

2999
01:52:57,238 --> 01:53:01,198
it would be honestly it would be the

3000
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:03,539
Schism it would be you can't you can't

3001
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:06,059
beat the potency it's a unique the

3002
01:53:03,539 --> 01:53:07,439
mother's so unique you can't really pen

3003
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:09,239
her down you can't say oh this is a

3004
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:11,759
cookie strain yeah it's got that in it

3005
01:53:09,238 --> 01:53:14,279
but it you know oh no this is uh you

3006
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,560
know Sour Diesel headband you know you

3007
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:19,380
can't pin it down but it's got big

3008
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,800
yields you know it's you know resistant

3009
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:24,900
to pressure you know pests and otherwise

3010
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:27,119
and it's really consistent and easy to

3011
01:53:24,899 --> 01:53:30,599
grow it's very fast to find if you know

3012
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:32,279
I I was surprised by it I knew it was

3013
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,539
going to be interesting I had no idea

3014
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:37,259
that it was going to be so consistent

3015
01:53:33,539 --> 01:53:39,960
and stable as far as like traits that we

3016
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:43,500
all love you know and in this moment in

3017
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:45,359
cannabis in America or otherwise so I

3018
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:47,698
would have to say that one you know

3019
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:50,099
perfect great answer great answer so

3020
01:53:47,698 --> 01:53:52,259
you've got me wondering what's on the

3021
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:54,360
horizon for Lucky Dog Seiko or more

3022
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:57,539
generally for skunk VA you've gone from

3023
01:53:54,359 --> 01:53:58,500
seed to dispensary what do you plan to

3024
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:01,439
do next

3025
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:07,859
so you know and here's the deal so like

3026
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:10,678
we I see like a need for good clean

3027
01:54:07,859 --> 01:54:12,359
you know Legacy genetics and it doesn't

3028
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:13,859
have to necessarily mean it's old that's

3029
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:16,019
not what I mean but like

3030
01:54:13,859 --> 01:54:18,960
good representations of what we all

3031
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:21,480
agreed cannabis is you know and so

3032
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:23,819
there's a lot of stuff out there not all

3033
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:25,379
of it's gonna make it to the next day

3034
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:29,158
not at all it's gonna make it to the

3035
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:33,000
next phase uh there's a lot of hype

3036
01:54:29,158 --> 01:54:35,519
um so for me like I'm all I love doing

3037
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,698
lab work I love working under the hood

3038
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,199
you know I'm not a biologist I'm not a

3039
01:54:38,698 --> 01:54:42,719
scientist but I know how to do some of

3040
01:54:40,198 --> 01:54:46,259
the stuff that they do that we do and so

3041
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:50,100
like we are going to be introducing

3042
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:51,840
um VA labs to the community and we okay

3043
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:53,400
so let me start from the beginning so

3044
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,960
tissue culture we all know what it is

3045
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:56,460
we're all familiar with why we would

3046
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,618
want to do it we all understand the

3047
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:01,020
reasons why I exist we either want to do

3048
01:54:58,618 --> 01:55:02,939
long-term storage of genetics we want to

3049
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,560
clean up genetics you know Mary stem

3050
01:55:02,939 --> 01:55:06,299
tissue culture

3051
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,760
um and who knows what else next you know

3052
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:10,739
like there are some viruses that can be

3053
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:12,900
passed on to the meristem rather easily

3054
01:55:10,738 --> 01:55:15,479
and so therefore that's not necessarily

3055
01:55:12,899 --> 01:55:18,658
going to be a cure but to me like and I

3056
01:55:15,479 --> 01:55:20,339
first did tissue culture in 2005.

3057
01:55:18,658 --> 01:55:22,198
um Staten Island as you call them gave

3058
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:25,319
me a kit and he said figure this out and

3059
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:27,839
tell me you know tell me why this is

3060
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:30,658
useful to cannabis and I did what he

3061
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,699
asked and what I my answer was like I

3062
01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:35,759
can't really tell you what it's useful

3063
01:55:32,698 --> 01:55:38,039
for I can say that Transportation around

3064
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,539
the globe would be definitely at the top

3065
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:41,340
of the list

3066
01:55:39,539 --> 01:55:43,698
um and these this is 2006. these are

3067
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:47,639
things the the issues that are actually

3068
01:55:43,698 --> 01:55:50,579
you know being like uh dealt with with

3069
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:52,560
tissue culture uh propagation they

3070
01:55:50,579 --> 01:55:54,118
weren't really present at the time you

3071
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,860
know we weren't aware of some of the

3072
01:55:54,118 --> 01:55:57,420
viroids we weren't you know like there's

3073
01:55:55,859 --> 01:55:59,460
a bunch of stuff you know like we were

3074
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:01,139
still in that genetic drifting and so

3075
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:03,179
that's what the answer was so I've been

3076
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:05,279
familiar with it on that level I've done

3077
01:56:03,179 --> 01:56:06,960
other work with other uh I guess you

3078
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:09,059
call them plants under sterile

3079
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,639
conditions under flow hoods you know

3080
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:14,760
sterile air so like I'm familiar with

3081
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:17,460
the process and so what what I'm doing

3082
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:20,039
is I want to like what I did was like I

3083
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:22,079
wanted to find someone who I have so

3084
01:56:20,039 --> 01:56:25,380
many mothers you know right now I have

3085
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:27,179
70 mothers 71 71 different strains in my

3086
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:29,760
library that's not a lot but it's a lot

3087
01:56:27,179 --> 01:56:31,440
you know and so biggest problem and it

3088
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:34,320
became highlighted here at Lucky Dog

3089
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:36,719
cannabis is that geez how much labor and

3090
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:38,698
time and energy and resources go into

3091
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:41,158
keeping all those mothers I'm all about

3092
01:56:38,698 --> 01:56:43,259
redundancy redundancy is how you keep

3093
01:56:41,158 --> 01:56:45,779
plant alive for 30 [ __ ] years that's

3094
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:48,179
the secret what is redundancy redundancy

3095
01:56:45,779 --> 01:56:50,698
is overdoing it you know never relying

3096
01:56:48,179 --> 01:56:53,760
on one always relying on the redundancy

3097
01:56:50,698 --> 01:56:56,219
system and so you know what I've learned

3098
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:58,020
here is like I it's hard to describe how

3099
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:59,939
much energy goes into keeping that

3100
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:03,239
ground healthy

3101
01:56:59,939 --> 01:57:04,919
uh vibrant productive you know there's

3102
01:57:03,238 --> 01:57:06,718
always at least two moms there used to

3103
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,520
be four now we got it down to two to

3104
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,899
give you an example it takes up a lot of

3105
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,940
time a lot of space and a lot of

3106
01:57:09,899 --> 01:57:13,138
resource and I didn't discover that in

3107
01:57:11,939 --> 01:57:15,539
the last few years this has been a

3108
01:57:13,139 --> 01:57:19,199
problem I've had for a long time now and

3109
01:57:15,539 --> 01:57:21,719
so when tissue nodal tissue culture

3110
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:24,178
came an option for long-term storage I

3111
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:26,279
was very interested in this the problem

3112
01:57:24,179 --> 01:57:29,399
is is like who to do to work me I'm

3113
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:32,158
already busy I got a lot going on so

3114
01:57:29,399 --> 01:57:34,198
there's a lot of outside options

3115
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:36,238
um you know Outsourcing I think they

3116
01:57:34,198 --> 01:57:38,399
call it so I looked around and every

3117
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,559
time I looked into a company that does

3118
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:43,500
this type of work I just couldn't quite

3119
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:46,500
pinpoint what their goal was and it it

3120
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:48,719
it's like so when you want to store your

3121
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:51,539
library and it's that vast and that

3122
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,158
large you want to have peace of mind the

3123
01:57:51,539 --> 01:57:54,899
reason you want the reason you're even

3124
01:57:53,158 --> 01:57:56,339
thinking about is because you want to

3125
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:57,420
sleep at night without worrying about

3126
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:59,940
you you're wondering life again

3127
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:01,500
basically you want to be able to go have

3128
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:02,759
some fun with your girlfriend you know

3129
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:04,800
what I mean or whatever hang out with

3130
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:07,079
your family take your dog for a [ __ ]

3131
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:09,179
trip you know whatever it is it becomes

3132
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:10,800
a problem because you know you can't

3133
01:58:09,179 --> 01:58:12,539
really get that freedom it's not the

3134
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:14,579
flower production it takes your time

3135
01:58:12,539 --> 01:58:16,800
it's really that that's what keeps you

3136
01:58:14,579 --> 01:58:18,658
up at night if my flower crop goes to

3137
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,880
[ __ ] I don't lose any sleep over I just

3138
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:22,979
start over well you can't do that with

3139
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:24,779
your library you know you lose something

3140
01:58:22,979 --> 01:58:27,419
it's gone forever and whenever that

3141
01:58:24,779 --> 01:58:28,859
happens to you it breaks your heart in 5

3142
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:30,539
000 pieces and you can't put it back

3143
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:32,460
together ever again you just have to

3144
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:35,519
kind of mourn it and move on I've been

3145
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:37,859
through it so nodal tissue culture as we

3146
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,840
moved into the modern era was something

3147
01:58:37,859 --> 01:58:42,179
that was very interesting to me very

3148
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,739
attractive to me but every time I went

3149
01:58:42,179 --> 01:58:45,599
and looked at a company that could help

3150
01:58:43,738 --> 01:58:47,879
me with this

3151
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:50,099
and I'm I tend to do things on my own so

3152
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:51,960
there's that but it's just I couldn't

3153
01:58:50,099 --> 01:58:53,880
figure out what's going to happen next

3154
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:55,859
and then you hear stories this company

3155
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:57,599
did this this Scandal happened this

3156
01:58:55,859 --> 01:58:59,158
[ __ ] [ __ ] happened I don't want

3157
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:00,659
to be part of that because like I said I

3158
01:58:59,158 --> 01:59:02,579
just want to sleep well at night knowing

3159
01:59:00,658 --> 01:59:04,439
my shit's safe you know these are my

3160
01:59:02,579 --> 01:59:07,979
kids these are my dogs this is my family

3161
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:10,500
it has to be safe and so I just couldn't

3162
01:59:07,979 --> 01:59:11,459
trust the system so I was like okay if I

3163
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:14,819
want to do this I have to do it myself

3164
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:17,099
right not the decision I want to make

3165
01:59:14,819 --> 01:59:19,019
but that's the decision and so that's

3166
01:59:17,099 --> 01:59:20,819
where we're at and that's where VA Labs

3167
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:22,860
is popping up from that's where we're

3168
01:59:20,819 --> 01:59:25,859
that's where it was born of so I took it

3169
01:59:22,859 --> 01:59:28,319
upon myself to learn the process you

3170
01:59:25,859 --> 01:59:30,299
know nodal tissue culture Mary stem

3171
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:32,158
tissue culture yeah sure synthetic seeds

3172
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:34,320
these things aren't that uh you know

3173
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:37,559
useful to me they're part of the the

3174
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,299
work you know and so you know and I'm

3175
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:41,639
thinking to myself as like well you know

3176
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:43,260
maybe there's other uh you know

3177
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:46,440
preservationists out there that feel the

3178
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:48,179
same way they can't seem to break free

3179
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:49,738
of the chain around their damn neck

3180
01:59:48,179 --> 01:59:51,658
because of their mother's stock you know

3181
01:59:49,738 --> 01:59:54,658
their mother block is just taking up all

3182
01:59:51,658 --> 01:59:57,299
their life and time so you know maybe

3183
01:59:54,658 --> 01:59:59,698
maybe I can like you know learn the

3184
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:02,279
process share the process and that's key

3185
01:59:59,698 --> 02:00:04,979
I want to teach other folks how to do

3186
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:08,819
this you know I feel like that cannabis

3187
02:00:04,979 --> 02:00:11,039
has missed had a close call with say

3188
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:12,979
like hop late and thyroid you know it

3189
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:16,560
snuck into all of our Gardens and almost

3190
02:00:12,979 --> 02:00:19,678
ruined many you know uh people's

3191
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:21,239
libraries you know in the in the silent

3192
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:23,940
of the night you know it's kind of a

3193
02:00:21,238 --> 02:00:25,979
silent killer you know

3194
02:00:23,939 --> 02:00:28,198
um and so you know what I saw was

3195
02:00:25,979 --> 02:00:30,658
there's like a you a use for that like

3196
02:00:28,198 --> 02:00:32,339
you know storing people's genetics is

3197
02:00:30,658 --> 02:00:34,500
obviously a service that we're going to

3198
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:36,420
provide and that we're happy to but we

3199
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,698
also feel that it's going to be better

3200
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:40,920
to teach people the process teach

3201
02:00:38,698 --> 02:00:42,779
companies the process anyone who cares

3202
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:44,880
about it we can help them that and

3203
02:00:42,779 --> 02:00:46,738
that's what we're going to do so we're

3204
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:48,480
going to be doing you know genetic

3205
02:00:46,738 --> 02:00:49,979
storage we're going to be cleaning up

3206
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:51,419
genetics you know all the typical stuff

3207
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:52,738
but also we're going to be teaching

3208
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:56,340
people how to do it themselves because

3209
02:00:52,738 --> 02:00:58,678
we realize that that's where the um

3210
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:00,360
that's the biggest need you know you're

3211
02:00:58,679 --> 02:01:02,579
not going to like be a company in New

3212
02:01:00,359 --> 02:01:05,039
York and come out to Montana or

3213
02:01:02,579 --> 02:01:07,559
California to get you Cuts it's just not

3214
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:09,779
practical so what is practical having

3215
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:13,139
your own you know your own team learning

3216
02:01:09,779 --> 02:01:15,238
process Master the process feel

3217
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:16,980
confident and then you can store your

3218
02:01:15,238 --> 02:01:19,399
own genetics what does that do for

3219
02:01:16,979 --> 02:01:23,039
cannabis that propels cannabis that that

3220
02:01:19,399 --> 02:01:24,719
keeps cannabis genetic pool clean and it

3221
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:26,460
allows anyone who comes across any

3222
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:29,219
problems to have the proper skills to do

3223
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:31,079
something about it and then you know we

3224
02:01:29,219 --> 02:01:33,179
uh we've been known to have pretty good

3225
02:01:31,079 --> 02:01:34,738
reputation and we're not going to [ __ ]

3226
02:01:33,179 --> 02:01:36,658
you over we don't want nothing from you

3227
02:01:34,738 --> 02:01:38,579
we already got what you got so if you

3228
02:01:36,658 --> 02:01:41,939
want a store here we can do that for you

3229
02:01:38,579 --> 02:01:44,460
so to be honest with Lucky Dog cannabis

3230
02:01:41,939 --> 02:01:46,500
what this is It's a licensed facility

3231
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:47,698
it's a licensed business in the United

3232
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:49,920
States

3233
02:01:47,698 --> 02:01:52,259
you know I believe personally that

3234
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:54,118
National legalization is just a few days

3235
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:55,800
away it's coming quicker than anyone

3236
02:01:54,118 --> 02:01:57,598
realizes and once that happens

3237
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:59,219
interstate commerce when it comes to

3238
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:01,619
cannabis is going to become going to

3239
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:03,599
become part of the deal and what that

3240
02:02:01,618 --> 02:02:05,399
means is that like it doesn't matter

3241
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:06,480
what state we're in we're all going to

3242
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:08,698
be able to help you we're going to be

3243
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:11,218
able to work with you and that's what

3244
02:02:08,698 --> 02:02:14,059
the goal is so and then furthermore we

3245
02:02:11,219 --> 02:02:17,219
want to be able to provide clean

3246
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:18,719
verified clean how well we're going to

3247
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:19,920
be testing it we're going to be testing

3248
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:21,658
it every two weeks we're going to be

3249
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,460
testing mother stock your mother's stock

3250
02:02:21,658 --> 02:02:25,500
if you choose if you're ready to come

3251
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:28,980
out of tissue culture and be integrated

3252
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:30,899
into you know uh standard propagation

3253
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:33,059
practices we're going to make sure that

3254
02:02:30,899 --> 02:02:34,679
before that stuff happens whatever it is

3255
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:36,539
whether it be ours or yours or whatever

3256
02:02:34,679 --> 02:02:38,219
it is it's going to be clean you know

3257
02:02:36,539 --> 02:02:40,800
we're gonna we're gonna make sure that

3258
02:02:38,219 --> 02:02:42,779
you know and so you know the the testing

3259
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:46,560
has come a long way you know now we're

3260
02:02:42,779 --> 02:02:48,479
taking root uh you know we're testing

3261
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,960
the roots in the first few inch the soil

3262
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:53,879
at different locations and you know we

3263
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:57,539
are investing in we have a cute PCR

3264
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:59,279
machine so we are able to test for qpcr

3265
02:02:57,539 --> 02:03:01,079
machines are pretty readily available

3266
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:02,819
for hot plate and firewood for instance

3267
02:03:01,079 --> 02:03:06,118
and other pathogens

3268
02:03:02,819 --> 02:03:07,799
as long as as well as sex testing we'll

3269
02:03:06,118 --> 02:03:10,859
be offering all those services and we

3270
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:12,900
feel like that is a good focused focal

3271
02:03:10,859 --> 02:03:15,658
point for us to

3272
02:03:12,899 --> 02:03:17,219
further take the next step with cannabis

3273
02:03:15,658 --> 02:03:18,899
you know

3274
02:03:17,219 --> 02:03:20,399
um and of course there's other ways of

3275
02:03:18,899 --> 02:03:23,279
doing it there's other folks doing out

3276
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:26,698
there but you know It's just tough to

3277
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:28,559
find someone who really gets it you know

3278
02:03:26,698 --> 02:03:30,960
and understands like where we're going

3279
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:33,480
with all this and we feel I feel like we

3280
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:35,340
do we get it you know we've always been

3281
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:36,178
about the plant we always will be about

3282
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:39,480
to plan

3283
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:42,118
and so you know if there's you know a

3284
02:03:39,479 --> 02:03:44,459
service that is worth money great but

3285
02:03:42,118 --> 02:03:46,139
that's not exactly why we're doing it we

3286
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:47,939
just want to make sure that cannabis

3287
02:03:46,139 --> 02:03:49,739
makes it to its next step that's what

3288
02:03:47,939 --> 02:03:50,879
I've been doing the whole time and

3289
02:03:49,738 --> 02:03:53,339
that's what I'm going to continue doing

3290
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:56,460
and when when I saw this kind of

3291
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:58,920
opportunity or you know like kind of

3292
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:01,079
this Vision to do it it I just couldn't

3293
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:03,239
it's just passion it's like my passion

3294
02:04:01,079 --> 02:04:05,279
just went right to it like this is it

3295
02:04:03,238 --> 02:04:07,079
this is what we got to do this is the

3296
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:09,300
work we've been waiting for we've been

3297
02:04:07,079 --> 02:04:12,359
in this law between what we've done and

3298
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:15,000
what we're going to do and this is it

3299
02:04:12,359 --> 02:04:17,039
you know so we're doing it you know wow

3300
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,599
that's super exciting and in all honesty

3301
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:20,698
we could probably spend a whole episode

3302
02:04:18,599 --> 02:04:22,860
just delving into the specifics of it

3303
02:04:20,698 --> 02:04:25,500
all we'll have to keep our eyes open for

3304
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:27,359
VA Labs that sounds super cool we're

3305
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:29,039
sort of on the tail end of things and I

3306
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:30,479
have a really good patreon question I

3307
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:32,219
wanted to run by you before we wrap

3308
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:34,678
things up which is basically along the

3309
02:04:32,219 --> 02:04:36,300
lines of what does Staten Island think

3310
02:04:34,679 --> 02:04:38,520
about the fact you've been able to make

3311
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:40,380
a really successful company off the back

3312
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:42,179
of chemdog does he ever talk about

3313
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:44,279
wanting to do his own breeding or start

3314
02:04:42,179 --> 02:04:48,000
his own company

3315
02:04:44,279 --> 02:04:50,340
um he is uh gonna be opening a nursery

3316
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,840
in Northern California and so where

3317
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:53,699
we're at right now he's like he would

3318
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:57,060
like to get lucky dog you know breeder

3319
02:04:53,698 --> 02:04:59,279
Cuts in in the nursery so that's kind of

3320
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:02,280
where we're at you know yeah

3321
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:04,859
um you know he's he we all played our

3322
02:05:02,279 --> 02:05:07,380
role you know none of us like did

3323
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:10,198
anything we all collectively what we did

3324
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:12,000
was we preserved one of the greatest you

3325
02:05:10,198 --> 02:05:13,859
know the the queen of contemporary

3326
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,500
cannabis is what we've done you know we

3327
02:05:13,859 --> 02:05:17,158
did that and so you know

3328
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,319
um

3329
02:05:17,158 --> 02:05:21,479
I think that we all are aware of the

3330
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:23,639
role we played in the bigger picture and

3331
02:05:21,479 --> 02:05:25,559
for any one of us to take like uh you

3332
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:28,319
know a [ __ ] Victory lap about what

3333
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:29,699
each what an individual has done would

3334
02:05:28,319 --> 02:05:31,380
be kind of

3335
02:05:29,698 --> 02:05:33,539
that's not in the spirit of what we're

3336
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:36,719
trying to do and he he gets that you

3337
02:05:33,539 --> 02:05:38,519
know so I think that that like we're

3338
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:41,279
we're talking about

3339
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:43,139
um that nursery and how to get unique

3340
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:45,539
genetics and of course Lucky Dog you

3341
02:05:43,139 --> 02:05:47,219
know Cuts there so you know that's

3342
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:48,840
that's kind of what I would say I can't

3343
02:05:47,219 --> 02:05:49,800
speak for other people I would say that

3344
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:52,440
that's

3345
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:54,179
pretty close to what you would hear you

3346
02:05:52,439 --> 02:05:56,098
know that's really cool to hear and

3347
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:58,139
hopefully as time goes by people can get

3348
02:05:56,099 --> 02:06:00,239
access to some killer braided cuts

3349
02:05:58,139 --> 02:06:02,760
through his Nursery one of the other

3350
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:05,879
patreon questions we got from a fellow

3351
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:09,000
Virginian was what area of Virginia is

3352
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:10,679
skunk VA from and as legalization rolls

3353
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,319
out further would you ever consider

3354
02:06:10,679 --> 02:06:15,060
moving back to Virginia

3355
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:18,059
absolutely

3356
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:20,820
um I always dreamed to sell legal

3357
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:23,940
cannabis in Virginia I'm from Richmond

3358
02:06:20,819 --> 02:06:25,618
the south side of Richmond on the south

3359
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:28,439
side of the James River Chesterfield

3360
02:06:25,618 --> 02:06:30,960
County that's where I grew up but I did

3361
02:06:28,439 --> 02:06:33,598
I did uh spend some time in Oregon Hill

3362
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:35,279
in Richmond back when it was a weird

3363
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:36,779
place it's not weird now it's kind of

3364
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:39,179
gentrified

3365
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:40,738
um but uh south side of Richmond is what

3366
02:06:39,179 --> 02:06:42,840
we call it the South Side

3367
02:06:40,738 --> 02:06:44,579
um Chesterfield County you know

3368
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,500
I would definitely not consider moving

3369
02:06:44,579 --> 02:06:48,300
back there Virginia is a beautiful place

3370
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:50,158
it's one of the most beautiful places in

3371
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:52,139
the United States uh George Washington

3372
02:06:50,158 --> 02:06:54,299
National Park is one of the most

3373
02:06:52,139 --> 02:06:56,699
beautiful places you could ever be and

3374
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:58,199
there's so many other spots you know

3375
02:06:56,698 --> 02:07:01,500
um it's an interesting place it's a

3376
02:06:58,198 --> 02:07:04,259
diverse place in some ways and cannabis

3377
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:06,359
has always been a really popular thing

3378
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:07,860
in Virginia oddly enough because it's

3379
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:09,420
you know you get a lot of trouble for it

3380
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:11,098
over the years

3381
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:14,039
um I I don't think I would ever move

3382
02:07:11,099 --> 02:07:15,900
back to it but I would like to uh kind

3383
02:07:14,039 --> 02:07:18,179
of do what your your listeners

3384
02:07:15,899 --> 02:07:20,460
suggesting and and kind of be part of

3385
02:07:18,179 --> 02:07:22,618
the you know uh evolution of cannabis

3386
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:25,079
there because I'm from there I always

3387
02:07:22,618 --> 02:07:27,598
like uh every time I've ever been busted

3388
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:30,118
I'm always thinking you [ __ ] I

3389
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:32,400
might hire your kids one day you know

3390
02:07:30,118 --> 02:07:34,738
because I know they care about weed more

3391
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:36,359
than you hate it you know and so that

3392
02:07:34,738 --> 02:07:38,539
that's a little bit of a motivation but

3393
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:41,279
also yeah I'm from there and it's like

3394
02:07:38,539 --> 02:07:43,679
every thing that happened in my life

3395
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:46,859
stemmed from you know growing up there

3396
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,480
just kind of coincidentally and yeah

3397
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:51,179
Virginia's I think everyone knows now

3398
02:07:48,479 --> 02:07:52,859
Virginia is well known for its

3399
02:07:51,179 --> 02:07:55,199
contribution to cannabis in the United

3400
02:07:52,859 --> 02:07:58,559
States due to the Dark Ages especially

3401
02:07:55,198 --> 02:08:02,279
so I'm so happy to see that my brothers

3402
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:05,520
and my sisters there are able to you

3403
02:08:02,279 --> 02:08:07,439
know more freely Express themselves in

3404
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:09,900
uh their love for cannabis without the

3405
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:12,359
fear of what can happen the consequences

3406
02:08:09,899 --> 02:08:15,420
and so I would love that you know I

3407
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:16,920
would love to be part of any kind of you

3408
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:19,199
know thing that picks up and happens

3409
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:21,539
there you know it's a slow moving

3410
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:23,279
process legalization there

3411
02:08:21,539 --> 02:08:25,198
um just the way they're doing it but

3412
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,819
it's happening you know and when I go

3413
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:29,399
there to visit because I I have gone to

3414
02:08:26,819 --> 02:08:31,979
some seed events there and I go back and

3415
02:08:29,399 --> 02:08:34,859
I love my people back there like they're

3416
02:08:31,979 --> 02:08:36,779
good to me and I I just love their

3417
02:08:34,859 --> 02:08:39,479
passion you know I recognize their

3418
02:08:36,779 --> 02:08:42,300
passion I see it the same passion that I

3419
02:08:39,479 --> 02:08:44,399
came up with in spite of the law in

3420
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:47,159
spite of what the consequences I still

3421
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:48,960
see it and I so much love it you know so

3422
02:08:47,158 --> 02:08:50,819
yeah I would love to be part of it but I

3423
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,859
don't think I'll ever live there so to

3424
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:54,539
speak I'm not big on the humidity I

3425
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:57,238
wasn't when I grew up there and I'm not

3426
02:08:54,539 --> 02:09:00,359
still now so that would be a big one for

3427
02:08:57,238 --> 02:09:03,000
me you know so so so one of our

3428
02:09:00,359 --> 02:09:05,039
listeners wanted to know what is the

3429
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,020
sort of considerations that go into

3430
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:09,599
making a hybrid for you and they

3431
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:12,900
specifically reference that uh the pine

3432
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:14,340
Soul go gog is a cut they love they were

3433
02:09:12,899 --> 02:09:16,138
a bit caught off guard they weren't

3434
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:17,699
exactly expect you to make a hybrid with

3435
02:09:16,139 --> 02:09:19,380
it and they thought oh wow there's maybe

3436
02:09:17,698 --> 02:09:21,359
all these Cuts I wasn't necessarily

3437
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:23,520
thinking he might work with it what is

3438
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:25,259
it is it just you liking the flower and

3439
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:27,480
going this will work well like what goes

3440
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:30,659
into you picking a cut to breed with

3441
02:09:27,479 --> 02:09:32,939
well that's just it it's it's the I fall

3442
02:09:30,658 --> 02:09:34,259
in love with the mom the cut and and I

3443
02:09:32,939 --> 02:09:36,379
want to see what else we can do with it

3444
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:39,239
so it's like a bit of experiment

3445
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:40,920
experimentation at that point but it

3446
02:09:39,238 --> 02:09:43,259
starts with that it starts with I like

3447
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:46,260
the cut sometimes

3448
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:47,520
um you find a cut that you just want to

3449
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:49,619
see what happens you know and that's

3450
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,900
happened a few times but really it's the

3451
02:09:49,618 --> 02:09:53,880
you know like the

3452
02:09:51,899 --> 02:09:57,299
um the sunshine biscuits is a good

3453
02:09:53,880 --> 02:10:00,659
example of one where I absolutely love

3454
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:02,699
the mother I love the the flavor potency

3455
02:10:00,658 --> 02:10:05,158
is missing it's just not that strong you

3456
02:10:02,698 --> 02:10:07,138
know even for me and I don't need like

3457
02:10:05,158 --> 02:10:11,219
overpowering cannabis but it's just not

3458
02:10:07,139 --> 02:10:14,400
that strong it's kind of a quick lasting

3459
02:10:11,219 --> 02:10:16,679
um you know High effect and the flavor

3460
02:10:14,399 --> 02:10:18,059
is just phenomenal you know and so that

3461
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:19,739
one's an outlier because of that it's

3462
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:21,900
like maybe we can improve this and we

3463
02:10:19,738 --> 02:10:24,539
did and I feel like the strength what

3464
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:27,000
we've made is you know more in tune with

3465
02:10:24,539 --> 02:10:29,340
what we think it should be not the cut

3466
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,618
but just cannabis in general

3467
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:34,020
um but it maintains that flavor the

3468
02:10:31,618 --> 02:10:36,598
beautiful colors you know the experience

3469
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:38,520
you have with Cherry AK right so that's

3470
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:40,800
an outlier of that but other than that

3471
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:42,239
it's like oh I love this cut does this

3472
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:45,119
work with it and see what happens you

3473
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:47,339
know and like I said most of the time

3474
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:49,979
we're not happy with the results

3475
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:52,440
and most maybe everyone maybe most

3476
02:10:49,979 --> 02:10:54,419
people would be but I'm not you know

3477
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:55,979
like if there's too many damn funerals

3478
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:58,440
it's just it's not what we're trying to

3479
02:10:55,979 --> 02:11:00,118
do you know if it's too dominated by Kim

3480
02:10:58,439 --> 02:11:02,698
dog that's also not what we're trying to

3481
02:11:00,118 --> 02:11:05,219
do and in that case we may try the bx2

3482
02:11:02,698 --> 02:11:06,899
male right and if that's not where it is

3483
02:11:05,219 --> 02:11:08,399
then it just goes in the drawer you know

3484
02:11:06,899 --> 02:11:10,379
and we'll deal with it some other day

3485
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:12,479
there's plenty of types of work we can

3486
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:15,719
do with those but what we're trying to

3487
02:11:12,479 --> 02:11:18,000
do at Lucky Dog it now that's not really

3488
02:11:15,719 --> 02:11:19,800
in in tune with what we're doing so it

3489
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,880
goes in the drawer we're not trying to

3490
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,579
sell

3491
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,618
a guy in Texas for instance or Arkansas

3492
02:11:23,579 --> 02:11:26,579
or Mississippi you know let's take

3493
02:11:25,618 --> 02:11:28,679
Mississippi because they're they're

3494
02:11:26,579 --> 02:11:31,260
actually medical now but you know

3495
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:33,480
Georgia and then and then like confuse

3496
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:35,039
them with a bunch of phinos and it could

3497
02:11:33,479 --> 02:11:36,899
be disappointing you know and we don't

3498
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:39,599
want that so that's what we're trying to

3499
02:11:36,899 --> 02:11:41,039
do now you know in the future well we

3500
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:42,900
got a lot of stuff to work with and

3501
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:44,158
maybe our goals will be slightly

3502
02:11:42,899 --> 02:11:47,098
different you know

3503
02:11:44,158 --> 02:11:49,439
but that's kind of it nice I I like that

3504
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:51,300
it's a well thought out so our final

3505
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:53,399
patreon submerged questions before we do

3506
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:54,960
a few quick fire ones is can you tell us

3507
02:11:53,399 --> 02:11:57,598
a little bit about the Royal Apple it's

3508
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:59,579
made by our buddy Jay trees and used in

3509
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:01,079
The Zephyr I guess people don't really

3510
02:11:59,579 --> 02:12:03,238
see it anywhere else how would you

3511
02:12:01,079 --> 02:12:04,198
describe that mother for people that

3512
02:12:03,238 --> 02:12:07,079
mother

3513
02:12:04,198 --> 02:12:09,658
um it had the reason I uh got interested

3514
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:12,059
in using that mother was so I met him at

3515
02:12:09,658 --> 02:12:14,460
the 2017

3516
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:16,020
um Emerald cup and he gave me some seeds

3517
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:17,579
you know and they were interesting you

3518
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:19,380
know the Long Valley Royal we're all

3519
02:12:17,579 --> 02:12:21,420
familiar with that amount of rocks

3520
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:23,880
working and then uh cross with the sour

3521
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:25,380
apple I believe it is and so

3522
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:27,060
um you know that's interesting that

3523
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:29,699
sounds interesting to me so I popped it

3524
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:32,099
honestly they weren't like what I hope

3525
02:12:29,698 --> 02:12:34,198
but there was one Fino that had this

3526
02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:36,719
amazing color and purple and I don't

3527
02:12:34,198 --> 02:12:38,939
really have a lot of beautiful I wanted

3528
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:40,980
to like have visually a visually

3529
02:12:38,939 --> 02:12:43,919
different stimulating kind of cross you

3530
02:12:40,979 --> 02:12:46,859
know to kind of like give people who are

3531
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:49,199
in the that an option a lucky dog and so

3532
02:12:46,859 --> 02:12:51,598
that was where I started it didn't have

3533
02:12:49,198 --> 02:12:53,939
the structure didn't have say the

3534
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:55,800
potency so it was a prime candidate to

3535
02:12:53,939 --> 02:12:58,339
be crossed with the bx3 and so that's

3536
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:01,079
what I did I worked it into a

3537
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:03,420
pollination that I did and I was really

3538
02:13:01,078 --> 02:13:04,859
pleased with the results and I love the

3539
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:09,118
color the structure everything was

3540
02:13:04,859 --> 02:13:12,179
improved but it had that pedigree and

3541
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:14,819
also that extra fuel chem just you know

3542
02:13:12,179 --> 02:13:17,699
sticky icky just destroy you kind of

3543
02:13:14,819 --> 02:13:19,319
thing and so we went with it you know

3544
02:13:17,698 --> 02:13:21,000
um you know that's pretty much the story

3545
02:13:19,319 --> 02:13:23,578
you know it started off with I wanted

3546
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:26,219
more Beauty I wanted a a visually

3547
02:13:23,578 --> 02:13:28,198
appealing flower you know

3548
02:13:26,219 --> 02:13:30,000
um just to see what comes from it

3549
02:13:28,198 --> 02:13:32,759
because oftentimes with deep purple

3550
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,340
strains like that gosh they're pretty

3551
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:37,500
the flavor you know potency the the

3552
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:39,659
oftentimes those things are missing with

3553
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:42,238
the Zephyr we nailed it we got it you

3554
02:13:39,658 --> 02:13:44,098
know we had those pink purple Hues but

3555
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:46,439
we had this [ __ ] dripping trichome

3556
02:13:44,099 --> 02:13:48,779
production and just like amazing flavor

3557
02:13:46,439 --> 02:13:51,539
I fell in love with it you know and very

3558
02:13:48,779 --> 02:13:54,179
consistent you know like two phinos you

3559
02:13:51,539 --> 02:13:56,578
know it was really nice beautiful great

3560
02:13:54,179 --> 02:13:58,560
answer I'd love to hear that uh Jay

3561
02:13:56,578 --> 02:14:01,139
trees work made it into the library so

3562
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:02,579
on to our final questions we'll we'll

3563
02:14:01,139 --> 02:14:04,739
juggle it up a little bit this time so

3564
02:14:02,578 --> 02:14:07,078
we don't repeat any from last time first

3565
02:14:04,738 --> 02:14:08,819
one is what's the single most memorable

3566
02:14:07,078 --> 02:14:10,738
cannabis experience you've had so it

3567
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:12,299
doesn't necessarily have to be like the

3568
02:14:10,738 --> 02:14:14,279
most potent hit you ever took but just

3569
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:16,020
for whatever reason it just sticks with

3570
02:14:14,279 --> 02:14:17,698
you is like that was just a great memory

3571
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:20,040
and cannabis was involved

3572
02:14:17,698 --> 02:14:22,198
well I did I did share with you that

3573
02:14:20,039 --> 02:14:23,639
joint that I smoked in 1991 and that's

3574
02:14:22,198 --> 02:14:25,559
definitely at the top of the list but

3575
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:28,980
I'll give you another one

3576
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:30,719
um and Grateful Dead Land uh they you

3577
02:14:28,979 --> 02:14:33,839
would find what they call backstage bud

3578
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:35,520
and backstage Bud it didn't it wasn't a

3579
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:38,400
particular strain it was what they

3580
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:40,139
wanted you know as they you know came

3581
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:42,118
out in the parking lot and searched

3582
02:14:40,139 --> 02:14:43,319
around you know they got a lot of Clouts

3583
02:14:42,118 --> 02:14:45,118
so they're going to see things that I'm

3584
02:14:43,319 --> 02:14:46,979
not going to see you know even though

3585
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,078
I'm out there every day they come out

3586
02:14:46,979 --> 02:14:50,519
you know for a minute you know I don't

3587
02:14:49,078 --> 02:14:52,139
know who Steve parish is you know you

3588
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:54,960
want to see some good weed hey Steve

3589
02:14:52,139 --> 02:14:57,060
Parish he's the Roadie for you know I

3590
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,039
wrote it for the Grateful Dead uh he was

3591
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:02,820
Jerry Garcia's right hand man he's like

3592
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:05,519
a bouncer slash guitar polisher slash

3593
02:15:02,819 --> 02:15:07,019
Roadie like he did it all so I don't

3594
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,820
know if he was the one but I know he

3595
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:10,560
loves weed and he would come out you'd

3596
02:15:08,819 --> 02:15:12,599
see him out there every now and again I

3597
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,760
mean mostly he was working but he had a

3598
02:15:12,599 --> 02:15:16,739
thing called backstage butt and this is

3599
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:18,420
the backstage but it wasn't the same as

3600
02:15:16,738 --> 02:15:20,578
yesterday it wasn't the same as the last

3601
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:22,319
set of shows in the other City this is

3602
02:15:20,578 --> 02:15:24,000
what they're smoking tonight and there

3603
02:15:22,319 --> 02:15:28,259
was this one

3604
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:30,238
um particular uh backstage Bud that was

3605
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:32,340
I I think we were we were in Oakland

3606
02:15:30,238 --> 02:15:34,618
California and I believe it was December

3607
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:38,840
and I believe it was in December 1992

3608
02:15:34,618 --> 02:15:41,339
and this weed was indoor weed from

3609
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:42,539
from Minnesota I believe Minneapolis or

3610
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:44,340
St Paul area

3611
02:15:42,539 --> 02:15:45,899
this stuff looked like someone had taken

3612
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:47,760
sugar water and sprayed it on it and let

3613
02:15:45,899 --> 02:15:51,179
it die it looked like rock candy you

3614
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:53,579
know and it was almost fake looking the

3615
02:15:51,179 --> 02:15:55,739
buds were kind of sparse they were

3616
02:15:53,578 --> 02:15:58,380
definitely like coated in this like

3617
02:15:55,738 --> 02:16:01,439
glassy like trichome but it was just

3618
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:03,300
oozing with resin you know and the jars

3619
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:04,678
were all eighths mason jars that were

3620
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:06,060
sealed somehow don't know how they would

3621
02:16:04,679 --> 02:16:08,460
have done that you know like when you

3622
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:11,880
open it your the pop you know like like

3623
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:13,859
a like a canned jar and that stuff

3624
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:15,840
stands out my memory don't know what it

3625
02:16:13,859 --> 02:16:18,598
was don't know what the strain was it

3626
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:22,199
was just backstage butt and then someone

3627
02:16:18,599 --> 02:16:24,659
I knew my little buddy little Mike uh he

3628
02:16:22,198 --> 02:16:26,698
found he's rest in peace he's not with

3629
02:16:24,658 --> 02:16:28,500
us anymore but he had a knack for

3630
02:16:26,698 --> 02:16:31,379
networking that I've never seen anywhere

3631
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:33,659
in my life uh to this day and he somehow

3632
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:36,420
came across you know a box of these

3633
02:16:33,659 --> 02:16:38,519
eights and Mason jars and he you know

3634
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:41,280
this is the backstage but we didn't

3635
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:43,679
question that it was phenomenal and it

3636
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,179
was amazing you know it was so good so

3637
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:47,519
that always will stick out my head and

3638
02:16:45,179 --> 02:16:49,200
that's a long time ago that's 1992. you

3639
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:52,139
know it's a lot so I would say you know

3640
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,899
that that memory's endured you know

3641
02:16:52,138 --> 02:16:56,879
brilliant what a great story so next one

3642
02:16:54,898 --> 02:16:58,260
if I'm gonna drop you off on a desert

3643
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:00,299
island and you can only take three

3644
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:02,579
strains with you to grow for the rest of

3645
02:17:00,299 --> 02:17:04,500
Community what three are you taking

3646
02:17:02,579 --> 02:17:07,859
Kim dog

3647
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:09,599
I think yeah Kim Dong I don't know man

3648
02:17:07,859 --> 02:17:12,479
Sour Diesel

3649
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:13,859
and something different you make me pick

3650
02:17:12,478 --> 02:17:17,279
three

3651
02:17:13,859 --> 02:17:18,300
um tits a selection I like that I like

3652
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:20,219
that

3653
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:23,218
what sort of changes do you think I

3654
02:17:20,218 --> 02:17:25,079
needed to help keep the ogs in the

3655
02:17:23,218 --> 02:17:27,659
system and not being forced out

3656
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:30,659
the ogs are not business people business

3657
02:17:27,659 --> 02:17:34,319
people and ogs as you say they're very

3658
02:17:30,659 --> 02:17:37,920
different animals so I would say like to

3659
02:17:34,319 --> 02:17:40,319
the death protect the home grow to the

3660
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,478
deaf you know like increase the numbers

3661
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:44,579
allowed like how many tomato plants am I

3662
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:46,619
allowed to have endless so why would

3663
02:17:44,579 --> 02:17:48,120
cannabis bees different you know and

3664
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:50,939
right now in the United States the

3665
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:52,559
biggest problem I see right now is the

3666
02:17:50,939 --> 02:17:54,898
federal government is gearing up for

3667
02:17:52,558 --> 02:17:56,459
National legalization how are they doing

3668
02:17:54,898 --> 02:17:58,619
that right now what they're doing is

3669
02:17:56,459 --> 02:18:02,039
they're they're preemptively creating a

3670
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:05,099
regulatory system that's going to affect

3671
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:06,599
us all as National legalization comes oh

3672
02:18:05,099 --> 02:18:09,000
who did the federal government ask they

3673
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:14,040
asked liquor producers they ask beer

3674
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:18,299
producers we all know that we that those

3675
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:20,099
uh that industry feels falsely that

3676
02:18:18,299 --> 02:18:22,978
they're at odds with cannabis that

3677
02:18:20,099 --> 02:18:24,478
cannabis is direct competition you and I

3678
02:18:22,978 --> 02:18:26,779
both know we discussed it last night

3679
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:30,438
over dinner that that's not the case

3680
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:33,300
that cannabis and say wine

3681
02:18:30,439 --> 02:18:35,099
beer they go to hand in hand they're

3682
02:18:33,299 --> 02:18:38,459
actually complement each other you know

3683
02:18:35,099 --> 02:18:40,019
if I'm a beer you know if I'm away into

3684
02:18:38,459 --> 02:18:43,259
beer which I don't drink beer anymore

3685
02:18:40,019 --> 02:18:45,359
but if it was you know like I the same

3686
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:47,099
kind of experience I'm having with craft

3687
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:48,960
beers is the same kind of experience I'm

3688
02:18:47,099 --> 02:18:50,460
going to have with cannabis the people

3689
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:51,779
who are making the rules they get it

3690
02:18:50,459 --> 02:18:54,000
wrong every time and now they're getting

3691
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:55,859
ready to give it really wrong the

3692
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,840
federal government has put together a

3693
02:18:55,859 --> 02:18:59,760
regulatory committee or whatever you

3694
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:02,398
would call it and it's based on like the

3695
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:05,819
the makers of Molson uh you know

3696
02:19:02,398 --> 02:19:08,879
Kentucky cheap bourbon and others and

3697
02:19:05,819 --> 02:19:10,379
it's mostly alcohol and it's to me I

3698
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:12,420
think it's important that we don't just

3699
02:19:10,379 --> 02:19:15,299
stand by and say yeah cannabis is like

3700
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:18,179
alcohol it's not like alcohol you know

3701
02:19:15,299 --> 02:19:21,358
and it's not it's it intoxicates you but

3702
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:25,079
that's it that's as far as it goes on on

3703
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:28,019
a on a public safety standpoint

3704
02:19:25,079 --> 02:19:31,079
so as far as like the way we view wine

3705
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:32,219
and craft beers and and flavor that is

3706
02:19:31,079 --> 02:19:34,379
very much

3707
02:19:32,218 --> 02:19:36,839
um you know relating to cannabis and how

3708
02:19:34,379 --> 02:19:38,579
we we perceive it and experience it you

3709
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,380
know but how could the federal

3710
02:19:38,579 --> 02:19:42,058
government understand that how could any

3711
02:19:40,379 --> 02:19:44,339
of these people who feel like they're in

3712
02:19:42,058 --> 02:19:46,199
direct competition you know people have

3713
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:48,719
50 bucks this week to spend on their

3714
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:51,300
Vice you know the liquor and alcohol

3715
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:53,279
industry says we want all 50 bucks right

3716
02:19:51,299 --> 02:19:55,079
so if you put them in charge of

3717
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:56,579
developing a regulatory system for

3718
02:19:55,079 --> 02:19:58,620
cannabis they're going to make sure they

3719
02:19:56,579 --> 02:20:00,239
get the 50 bucks over here still

3720
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:02,640
what does that mean that means they're

3721
02:20:00,239 --> 02:20:04,739
going to like push us out you know the

3722
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:07,199
ogs as you say it's already happened in

3723
02:20:04,739 --> 02:20:09,299
many states like California you know and

3724
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:10,680
so like that would be the focus that

3725
02:20:09,299 --> 02:20:12,599
would be the place that we have to stop

3726
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:15,239
and we can't do it after we have to do

3727
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:17,280
it before because as we all know you

3728
02:20:15,239 --> 02:20:19,199
can't change what they already do you

3729
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:22,260
can't go back it's so difficult it could

3730
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,760
take decades Now's the Time Now's the

3731
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:25,260
Time to get involved Now's the Time to

3732
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:27,840
come out of the Shadows Now's the Time

3733
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:30,000
to push back now is the time for us to

3734
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:31,620
say what regulation for cannabis should

3735
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,478
and shouldn't be we don't want no

3736
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:37,680
regulation we all want a safe product

3737
02:20:33,478 --> 02:20:39,599
but I don't want Molson to tell us what

3738
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:42,420
that safety is they don't know anything

3739
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:46,140
about safety they've been their their

3740
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:48,420
gig has been you know like safety got

3741
02:20:46,139 --> 02:20:51,180
circumvented around their industry their

3742
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:52,859
industry is not safe I'd like to have a

3743
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:55,079
nice little drink you know we all you

3744
02:20:52,859 --> 02:20:57,479
like wine I like wine you know and

3745
02:20:55,079 --> 02:20:59,340
others I like Urban you know I

3746
02:20:57,478 --> 02:21:03,239
appreciate good bourbon good Kentucky

3747
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:06,000
bourbon and so like you know

3748
02:21:03,239 --> 02:21:08,818
it just doesn't translate the the liquor

3749
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,040
industry the alcohol industry will say

3750
02:21:08,818 --> 02:21:13,439
their regulation doesn't translate to

3751
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:16,319
cannabis now if you talk to a politician

3752
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:18,359
to them it clearly does it's two vices

3753
02:21:16,318 --> 02:21:20,100
that people spend money on we're gonna

3754
02:21:18,359 --> 02:21:21,780
tax the [ __ ] out of it and we're going

3755
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:23,760
to make money on it to them it makes

3756
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:26,040
sense and I understand that and this

3757
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:27,420
isn't like adversarial it's just they're

3758
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:30,600
uneducated they don't understand

3759
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:32,219
cannabis we do so Now's the Time if

3760
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:34,620
you're a big cannabis producer out there

3761
02:21:32,219 --> 02:21:36,659
you know you know get off your [ __ ]

3762
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:38,939
ass and stop counting your [ __ ] money

3763
02:21:36,659 --> 02:21:40,739
in your jet and get involved you're the

3764
02:21:38,939 --> 02:21:41,939
ones that are going to speak for me and

3765
02:21:40,739 --> 02:21:43,379
so since you're going to speak for me

3766
02:21:41,939 --> 02:21:46,500
make sure you speak clearly and

3767
02:21:43,379 --> 02:21:48,299
accurately for me I am an OG and there's

3768
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:50,398
many of us out here if you want to do it

3769
02:21:48,299 --> 02:21:52,619
right you do it right but get involved

3770
02:21:50,398 --> 02:21:55,199
you know take your [ __ ] millions of

3771
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:57,240
dollars you made off the legacies that

3772
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,859
many of us produce and [ __ ] put it

3773
02:21:57,239 --> 02:22:01,439
where it belongs put it where your mouth

3774
02:21:58,859 --> 02:22:03,420
is and stop bullshitting and and make

3775
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:05,639
get involved and I will get involved too

3776
02:22:03,420 --> 02:22:09,600
but I don't have that power I don't have

3777
02:22:05,639 --> 02:22:11,760
that that pull so you do do it you know

3778
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:13,559
what I mean don't let it [ __ ] up yeah it

3779
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:14,818
may work out for you you'll figure out a

3780
02:22:13,559 --> 02:22:16,739
way to work out for you but what about

3781
02:22:14,818 --> 02:22:18,180
the plan what about the culture what

3782
02:22:16,739 --> 02:22:20,760
about the rest of us you know get

3783
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:22,200
involved because now is the time they're

3784
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:24,719
already Congress the United States

3785
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:26,520
Congress has already passed a bill to

3786
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:28,739
allow the regulatory system to be

3787
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:30,899
developed but the people the players

3788
02:22:28,739 --> 02:22:32,520
that they invited in they're the wrong

3789
02:22:30,898 --> 02:22:34,139
people they're not the right people

3790
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:35,520
they're going to take it out of your

3791
02:22:34,139 --> 02:22:38,358
pocket they're going to take it from you

3792
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,920
so be careful and and furthermore

3793
02:22:38,359 --> 02:22:42,540
protect the home grower don't feel

3794
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:44,398
threatened by the Home grower I see a

3795
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:47,280
lot of these big producers are pretty

3796
02:22:44,398 --> 02:22:49,199
adamant against the home grow it

3797
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,880
disgusts me it makes me sick to my

3798
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:52,920
stomach you don't get it if that's your

3799
02:22:50,879 --> 02:22:54,358
position if you are against the

3800
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:56,100
homegrowner because you want to make

3801
02:22:54,359 --> 02:22:58,020
your little money off the eighth you

3802
02:22:56,100 --> 02:23:00,180
don't get it and you need to wake up and

3803
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:02,760
you need to act right and you need to

3804
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:06,180
like put your money where the culture is

3805
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:08,159
this is not alcohol no one makes beer no

3806
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:10,500
one makes beer or liquor at home for

3807
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:12,239
consumption it's a hobby it's a niche

3808
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:14,159
cannabis is different and that's the

3809
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:17,398
main reasons why I think that's you know

3810
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:19,799
maybe your point that the home grower is

3811
02:23:17,398 --> 02:23:22,739
the backbone of cannabis

3812
02:23:19,799 --> 02:23:24,420
why because the home grower has learned

3813
02:23:22,739 --> 02:23:26,459
you know what you learn from growing

3814
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:28,318
cannabis is one of the most important

3815
02:23:26,459 --> 02:23:30,539
lessons you can learn you can be

3816
02:23:28,318 --> 02:23:33,359
self-reliant you can be self-sufficient

3817
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:35,520
you don't need everything that you can

3818
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:37,500
buy you can actually produce some of the

3819
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:39,120
things that you consume cannabis would

3820
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:40,859
be at the top of the lesson list and

3821
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,540
when you when you discover that you can

3822
02:23:40,859 --> 02:23:44,460
you know when you fall in love with

3823
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:46,080
canvas it's at the top of the list of

3824
02:23:44,459 --> 02:23:48,898
things you love it's not like yeah I'm

3825
02:23:46,079 --> 02:23:50,939
okay with it you know no you're you love

3826
02:23:48,898 --> 02:23:53,519
it you know if you don't love it okay

3827
02:23:50,939 --> 02:23:55,620
but when you do love it you become

3828
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:58,920
passionate about it when you grow your

3829
02:23:55,620 --> 02:24:00,479
own cannabis it opens up a door that you

3830
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:02,700
never had open like you can be

3831
02:24:00,478 --> 02:24:04,858
passionate about so many things that you

3832
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:07,020
consume that you can't produce yourself

3833
02:24:04,859 --> 02:24:08,939
you know at home for you and your family

3834
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:10,859
I don't give a [ __ ] if it's San Pedro

3835
02:24:08,939 --> 02:24:13,260
you know I don't give a [ __ ] if it's

3836
02:24:10,859 --> 02:24:15,120
Tomatoes kale whatever it is you find

3837
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:18,239
you discover through canvas just like I

3838
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:21,300
did that you can be in control and

3839
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:23,939
empowered by what you consume and

3840
02:24:21,299 --> 02:24:26,279
producing yourself so that should always

3841
02:24:23,939 --> 02:24:28,318
be the focus without that there's no

3842
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:30,840
real legalization you know

3843
02:24:28,318 --> 02:24:33,478
so for the final question we're gonna

3844
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:37,200
Jazz it up a bit here I want you to give

3845
02:24:33,478 --> 02:24:39,119
me a quick summary of what a day in the

3846
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:41,700
life of skunk VA would be in 10 years

3847
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:44,520
time if everything goes to plan do you

3848
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:46,140
wake up in a in Malibu with a jacuzzi

3849
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:47,760
out front like what what's a day for you

3850
02:24:46,139 --> 02:24:50,039
in 10 years time if everything goes well

3851
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:52,380
hmm

3852
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:53,819
geez I don't know man that's a long time

3853
02:24:52,379 --> 02:24:55,199
from now you know I'm glad you didn't

3854
02:24:53,818 --> 02:24:57,840
ask what my day like is today because

3855
02:24:55,200 --> 02:25:00,240
nobody wants to hear about that but uh I

3856
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:02,579
would say you know what I talked about

3857
02:25:00,239 --> 02:25:05,840
like see you know pulling off some of

3858
02:25:02,579 --> 02:25:09,539
these goals like being like it you know

3859
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:11,579
how would I say reintroducing injecting

3860
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:13,979
into the Cannabis culture of the old

3861
02:25:11,579 --> 02:25:16,739
school you know how did this start never

3862
02:25:13,978 --> 02:25:18,599
letting the user the grower the big

3863
02:25:16,739 --> 02:25:20,939
producer forget where did all this come

3864
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:23,280
from how did we get to this point

3865
02:25:20,939 --> 02:25:27,960
um and I think that like the clean you

3866
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:30,079
know keeping dedicated to the uh further

3867
02:25:27,959 --> 02:25:33,000
you know furthering of the plant itself

3868
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:35,939
whether it be cleaning it from pathogens

3869
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,879
whether it be creating new practices for

3870
02:25:35,939 --> 02:25:40,800
people to avoid pressure from pathogens

3871
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:43,079
and stuff like that I think that's good

3872
02:25:40,799 --> 02:25:44,699
work you know and I I'm happy with that

3873
02:25:43,079 --> 02:25:47,340
you know

3874
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:49,439
um I would like to be

3875
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:50,880
you know part of that movement you know

3876
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:52,260
and I'm I am going to be part of that

3877
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:54,179
movement but I would like it to be

3878
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:55,680
successful like that and then of course

3879
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:58,800
what I said about when the United States

3880
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:59,760
goes National legalization it's one of

3881
02:25:58,799 --> 02:26:01,938
the biggest things that's going to

3882
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:04,978
happen on Earth you know imagine

3883
02:26:01,939 --> 02:26:07,920
cannabis producers in the United States

3884
02:26:04,978 --> 02:26:10,379
exporting cannabis to China you know

3885
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:11,879
imagine a stressed out Society like

3886
02:26:10,379 --> 02:26:13,438
China you know

3887
02:26:11,879 --> 02:26:16,559
feelings from relief from their

3888
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:18,420
day-to-day like we do with cannabis so

3889
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:20,100
to me that would be it where I'll be

3890
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:21,898
Malibu I don't know about all that you

3891
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:24,899
know you know I've been to Malibu I I

3892
02:26:21,898 --> 02:26:25,619
don't it's not for me you know but I

3893
02:26:24,898 --> 02:26:27,180
mean

3894
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:28,800
I certainly wouldn't want to have to

3895
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:31,620
work as hard as I am in 10 years from

3896
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:34,438
now I'm only 50 years old next year you

3897
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:36,660
know so I feel like I worked you hard a

3898
02:26:34,439 --> 02:26:38,880
lot and that would be you know

3899
02:26:36,659 --> 02:26:40,978
personally that would be something that

3900
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:43,739
I would want to go for the more kind of

3901
02:26:40,978 --> 02:26:46,318
feel like all right you know we we

3902
02:26:43,739 --> 02:26:48,478
fought the Battle and like we made some

3903
02:26:46,318 --> 02:26:50,879
progress and let's pass it on to the

3904
02:26:48,478 --> 02:26:53,459
next generation and let's hang out and

3905
02:26:50,879 --> 02:26:55,679
chill with our dogs and [ __ ] smoke a

3906
02:26:53,459 --> 02:26:57,959
fatty on the beach somewhere maybe on

3907
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:59,700
the top of a mountain but as far as

3908
02:26:57,959 --> 02:27:02,179
cannabis and the culture goes I just

3909
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:06,000
would like to re I think that it's being

3910
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:07,680
the you know you say oh geez has kind of

3911
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
gotten it's starting to feel like a

3912
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:10,260
relic it's starting to feel like the

3913
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,239
past it starts it needs to be

3914
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:14,460
re-injected it's not fast we're out here

3915
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:16,199
still we're still influencing we're

3916
02:27:14,459 --> 02:27:18,119
still working you know so that part I

3917
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:20,460
would I would say I would want to be

3918
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:23,220
part of that to re-inject that back into

3919
02:27:20,459 --> 02:27:25,318
the culture that hey you know young man

3920
02:27:23,219 --> 02:27:27,539
or woman this is where this all happened

3921
02:27:25,318 --> 02:27:29,159
this whole where it all came from this

3922
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:31,500
is what had to happen for you to enjoy

3923
02:27:29,159 --> 02:27:33,539
this plant you know that's awesome to

3924
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:34,978
hear that uh even in 10 years time

3925
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:36,720
you're still serving the plant I love

3926
02:27:34,978 --> 02:27:38,279
that so that brings us just about to the

3927
02:27:36,719 --> 02:27:39,719
end of it for this one do you have any

3928
