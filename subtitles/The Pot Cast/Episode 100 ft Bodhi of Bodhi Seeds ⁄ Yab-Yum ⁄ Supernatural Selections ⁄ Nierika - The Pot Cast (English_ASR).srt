134
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,279
introduction yeah so look I guess you

135
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,959
know the question we ask everyone

136
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,559
recently what have you been smoking on

137
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,519
recently uh well to be super honest I

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,800
haven't really been smoking for the last

139
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,879
maybe two months you know ever since my

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,038
son uh bod past I've been really trying

141
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,719
to cultivate my My Clarity and really

142
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:05,759
kind of rest in the emotions and rest in

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,039
this place of really feeling it and

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,879
really trying to understand it and you

145
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,959
know grief is such an incredibly

146
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,800
powerful substance like I feel like it's

147
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,399
the ultimate kind of solvent in a way it

148
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,038
just completely dissolves you and I feel

149
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,120
like I'm in a place where I can do it

150
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,719
but cannabis is such an

151
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,280
emotional like substance too in a way

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,280
it's you know it's tied to smell which

153
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,279
is emotional there's so much in it that

154
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,879
I was also too a little bit not scared

155
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,399
but I just needed a break you know like

156
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,519
you've been swimming and you just want

157
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,918
to jump on the raft so but the good news

158
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,560
is I'm feeling good I feel like um this

159
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,560

00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,599
when I don't have to get up for kids in

169
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:08,079
the morning for school but it has this

170
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:10,000
really clean like ex like some you know

171
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,719
how some plants are kind of like Spirit

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,759
nourishing they just kind of take you on

173
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,400
this like soft buoyant ride through all

174
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,560
the things that you're interested in and

175
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,519
all the things that you want to give

176
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,639
gratitude for and it just you know and I

177
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,038
love it I I was smoking it before and I

178
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,879
really love listening to music on it and

179
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,079
you know even better is like searching

180
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,639
for music like I'm a treasure hunter at

181
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,719
heart and everything I do and I go one

182
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,759
of my most favorite things to do is get

183
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,440
super blazed and then go like on to band

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
camp or something someplace that you can

185
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,478
kind of follow the tidbits and look for

186
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,478
new music and you know go from like

187

191
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,680
enjoyable and kind of makes me happy so

192
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,240
I think that's coming up really soon but

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,598
uh to answer your question before that

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,598
you know I was smoking that and I was

195
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:08,319
been working on kind of like a this La

196
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:11,319
pure kush that was really had a really

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,639
kind of good experience for me it was a

198
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,560
little bit kind of too

199
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,199
edgy um what else uh I've been doing

201
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
an ogkb

202
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,560
orgasmatron and then even before that

203
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,719
the best stuff was all of the samples

204
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,360

207
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,360

210
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,639

don't know but I feel good and I feel

214
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,639
cannabis is truly one of my best friends

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,720

240
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,519
I've been digging recently I'm trying to

241
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,239
think of what the only time I get to

242
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,078
listen now is like when I'm in the car

243
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,839
taking the kids like back from scho

244
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,239
what is it that's

245
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,360
so I know like one that we've been what

246
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,278
is it the there's like an is it Moroccan

247
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,759
or Algerian band let's fit woman with

248
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,240
one guy like Les fil something like it's

249
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:16,399
just it's kind of like

250
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,959
Naish and it has this really cool female

251
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,600
kind of chanting drone but with and I

252
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,679
think they're use a gimber or something

253
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,320
that goat skin

254
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,439
Bas I don't know um I feel like a dork

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,440
though because all my friend like oh

256
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
what are you listening and like I'm

257
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,480
supposed to be kind of but I think I

258
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,440
think I've just been you know like the

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,278
whole whole process of going through all

260
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,279
these challenges is really kind of just

261
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:43,360
brought me to like a base place of like

262
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,559
surrender and I feel like my mind hasn't

263
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,720
caught

264
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:51,439
up yeah sure no I understand definitely

265
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,440
hard being put on the spot isn't

266
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,759
it well look in in your last answer you

267
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,199
referenced that you've uh you've been

268
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,039
enjoying some new sativas and i' I'd

269
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,720
love to hear like how how do you think

270
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,519
we can try to bring sativas back into

271
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,000
the picture and one of the ideas I heard

272
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,959
recently that resonated with me was

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Shanti when I interviewed him made this

274
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,599
sort of comment about how Neville's ha

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,120
is like the champagne of cannabis and I

276
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,959
sort of thought that's actually like

277
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,000
quite an interesting and possibly

278
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:28,319
Innovative way to Market some really

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,120
hardcore sativas you know because they

280
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,720
kind of are like that if you experienced

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,639
them what's your thoughts how do how do

282
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,879
we bring it round back to sativas and

283
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,039
and what have you been enjoying lately

284
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,799
sativa wise I think the problem with

285
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,838
sativas is the pro is the profitability

286
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,039
and the duration so I think if we can

287
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,639
try and capture some of these highs and

288
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:53,000
package them into a shorter flower time

289
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:55,639
or like Empower farms and Growers to uh

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,320
really find sativas that they love and

291
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,560
they can cultivate well and and somehow

292
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,000
get those out to the people and then

293
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,919
also get to this out to everybody like

294
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,078
my whole thing right now is I realize

295
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:12,439
like we're in a pickle like it the state

296
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,078
of the nation is just so messed up and

297
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,519
it's like we realize that when anytime

298
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:20,078
Babylon gets involved it never turns out

299
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,120
it's kind of going back to Our Roots

300
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:27,239
like of over planet of just making seeds

301
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,720
giving out seeds trading seeds to

302
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,000
finding people in your community or

303
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,000
finding websites finding forums finding

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,198
any way you can to connect Facebook

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,159
groups you know uh discords to make

306
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:41,639
these these connections and trade and

307
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,039
you you know I mean with the Hop L that

308
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,959
throws a little bit of a thing into it

309
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,240
but trade seeds then like um and really

310
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,559
PE you know people coming out of the

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,639
woodwork like that's one thing that

312
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,838
inspires me is going on to different

313
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,079
forums even though I'm not really active

314
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,040
because it's just been a little

315
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,319
overwhelming for me um I do love to look

316
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,759
at it and see what people's doing and

317
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,680
even on Facebook there's some wild like

318
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,879
forums even on there people trading and

319
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,000
people coming um out from different

320
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,000
parts of the world and you know as as

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,240
things are getting more and more

322
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,639
polluted and more and more people are

323
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,480
getting interested the education levels

324
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,759
is gone down too and so things are

325
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,879
getting that's going to be problematic

326
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,399
as well because you have all these

327
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,559
people that are so excited and are

328
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,799
getting seeds from people in other parts

329
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,439
of the country and they may think they

330
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,120
have something but it may have already

331
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,320
been five generations down it was mixed

332
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,078
with something else you know kind of

333
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,760
like Mexican genetics you go in you're

334
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:38,359
like oh actually the

335
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:41,759
Narco Force already hidiz that one like

336
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,639
you know 25 years ago with skunk or you

337
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,159
know it's it's really difficult so I

338
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,720
mean the best place too ask your

339
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,519
grandparents ask your friend's Uncle ask

340
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,160
that crazy looking guy at the gas

341
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,839
station ask everybody like hey do you

342
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:58,278
have any old seeds grow them out like I

343
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,639
don't know it's such a the sativa thing

344
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:03,159
is problematic so I think you know maybe

345
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,480
things I love there's like a I'm kind of

346
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:09,759
mumbling a bit but the whole New York

347
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,839
City uh piff kind of Revival and those

348
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,278
guys kind of bringing that all back and

349
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,600
you know with all those older hybrids

350
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,078
and people getting interested in that

351
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,800
way there's these new kind of

352
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:22,679
outcroppings and I come almost see like

353
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:25,198
the the era of land race or pseudo like

354
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:29,519
Heritage farmline land race is kind of

355
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:32,278
over and it's almost this new hype Haze

356
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,560
kind of thing of people coming together

357
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,240
and creating new new sativas with older

358
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,239
thing you know if you listen to the

359
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,759
plants and you go deep you can coax out

360
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,879
all of the the

361
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,278
attributes um that you're looking for so

362
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,240
and then as far as sativas that I really

363
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,399
enjoy you know I I used to like edgy

364
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,919
ones and then you know and now I'm kind

365
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,600
of in this category I call it like

366
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,078
Spirit nourishing I'm looking for

367
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,079
sativas that you don't even really feel

368
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,439
feel like you know what I mean it's like

369
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,239
you I've had a few you smoke and just

370
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,000
like your day is better um maybe your

371
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
music sounds cooler maybe uh it makes

372
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,320
you friendlier maybe it just puts a

373
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,440
little magic tinge like when I was going

374
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,519
through the Vietnamese beans that I

375
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,519
found the Vietnamese 7 and I think doc d

376
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,560
got to smoke some of these the one we

377
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,000
kept was like a classic psychedelic

378
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,198
beautiful Vietnam old school Vietnamese

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,399
but all of its sisters there was ones

380
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:30,559
that had the weirdest effects you know

381
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,000
like ones that would just make music

382
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,758
sound better ones where you would think

383
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,720
you were high but you weren't but your

384
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,399
day just went better almost lubricated

385
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,440
reality or almost was a put out like a

386
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,278
field around you that brought in new

387
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,199
experiences like I'm all about finding

388
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:50,159
these like magical plants that are

389
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,240
almost they're not just you're not just

390
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,159
getting high or stoned or thing you're

391
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,799
creating um you're creating like an ally

392
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,159
to let let it guide you through the

393
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,240
world you know and if you have enough of

394
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,198
these it's like you're each day you

395
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,159
could go walk with one you could go out

396
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:06,359
into the world and you know and you see

397
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,039
what it brings to you so but

398
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,240
traditionally I like if we want to get

399
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:14,958
back to the thing um I love Himalayan

400
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,720
hand rub sativas like your classic you

401
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:21,159
know Nepali and North Indian like those

402
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,800
are something about the bright joyful

403
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:28,679
energy that they bring um I love some

404
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,039
some like uh like maybe like Highland w

405
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,958
hocke in kind of like from either up

406
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,120
high or above wak or kind of the coastal

407
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:40,078
mountains that have that kind of

408
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,799
really sunny kind of fun but psychedelic

409
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,758
eyes what else do I like I love the that

410
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,198
Vietnamese I had I love that big sir

411
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,519
Nigerian was such a cool one it was

412
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,318
so strong and like but it took you and

413
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,560
it was strong but like in a friendly way

414
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:56,360
kind of like a big brother or something

415
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,359
like you were never like scared it was

416
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,959
just like let's do this kind of thing

417
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,919
um I yeah and you know what at this

418
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,639
point there's there's broad now that

419
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,959
we're kind of moved into this new

420
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,199
nomenclature of narrow leaf and Broad

421
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,240
Leaf it kind of frees you up a lot

422
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,038
because there's a lot of uh narrow Leaf

423
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,160
like traditional kind of indicia style

424
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,919
plants that have that experience to that

425
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,798
high and I think the beauty of the uh

426
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,679
the broad leaves is some of the most

427
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,279
like one of my favorites I call it like

428
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
a

429
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,359
um I used to have a term I used to call

430
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,360
it but it was

431
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:39,319
a when you smoke a certain Broad Leaf

432
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,119
that completely relaxes your body and

433
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,159
Euphoria and let your and then lets your

434
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,319
mind go free so like it's almost like

435
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,759
these dreamy like traveling journeying

436
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:52,399
broad leaes where you know your head is

437
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,960
completely liberated and you're and it's

438
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,400
just so Exquisite and beautiful but

439
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,519
you're completely relaxed and I almost

440
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,038
am maybe I'm getting older I really love

441
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:06,720
that too so for me it's it's not so much

442
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:09,240
sativa Inda it's finding these special

443
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,919
effects and each person's different you

444
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,640
know some people smoke indas and they

445
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,120
can't sleep for the next two and a half

446
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,520
weeks and and you know and some people

447
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,239
smoke divas and it totally chills them

448
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,200
out so I think it's you know it's about

449
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,640
growing plants it's about planting seeds

450
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,880
it's about experiencing all these

451
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,400
different things so you can find these

452
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,640
plants just like your friends and family

453
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,240
like I guess you can't choose your

454
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,360
family but you can choose your friends

455
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,480
you can choose your plants you can um

456
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,639
find your Nee you can find what really

457
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,159
um nourishes you and and share that and

458
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,159
and also push it further if there's

459
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,159
something a plant that just you love

460
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,360
then work with it and try and bring that

461
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,760
out and bring and let people experience

462
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:52,158
that and um long-winded answer on what

463
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,798
my favorite sativas are but that's kind

464
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,799
of where I'm at I'm just at just

465
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,200
enjoying the plant Spirit of cannabis

466
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,599
like just really just it's you know it's

467
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,279
it's our plant Ally It's the dog of

468
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,759
plants you know and I know especially in

469
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,158
this day and age it's like we have a lot

470
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,960
of these kind of scientist breeders

471
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,600
telling us that we're doing it wrong oh

472
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,798
you're not using the right words it's

473
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,079
like we've been doing this for 10,000

474
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,480
years okay humans have been working with

475
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,839
with cannabis for 10,000 years we're not

476
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,640
doing anything wrong this is like a

477
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,678
cannabis human love affair that's gone

478
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,679
on for thousands of generations so don't

479
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,320
let anyone tell you you're doing

480
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,400
something wrong that you're not calling

481
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,200
it the right thing it's like it's for

482
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,720
everyone whether it's a grandma trying

483
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,960
to make CBD Auto flowers so that she can

484
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,319
walk down the street to visit her

485
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,480
grandson or is the guy that wants to

486

shoot out to meet the Doon you know it

487

488
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,319
connection to the plan I I love that

489
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,720

490
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,599
nourishment and there's so many things I

491
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,960
have to follow up on with that statement

492
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,918
and the first one is that V at7 it's

493
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,240
it's still possibly the most most

494
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,840
memorable all all of my most memorable

495
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,960
weeds are coming from you honestly um

496
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,399
there's the V7 there's the the tie I

497
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,640
can't remember if it was the lowland or

498
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,400
the Highland it was the Pearl one the

499
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,038
pearls that um the

500
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,919
nl2 um you know so many of the things

501
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,079
you've given me are so so so memorable

502
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,000
but some of our fans also were really

503
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,240
interested in that V7 cuz you know it's

504
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,480
so beautiful the most common question we

505
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,279
got was where did you get that seed

506
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,360
stock from cuz I guess people were so

507
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,158
impressed like is it is there an

508
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,240
interesting story or is it just like no

509
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,760
just you know got some cool seats yeah

510
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,759
there is an interesting story and this

511
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,400
is like something like if you're a good

512
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,279
person you put out a good vibe like good

513
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,960
things happen to you and this it was

514
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:48,399
like I think it was on like icy mag

515
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,038
forever ago and this old guy Alby he was

516
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,559
you know and I've looked for him

517
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,400
recently I can't find any of his

518
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,519
postings maybe someone knows him or

519
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,200
something he kept seeds from like the

520
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,400
70s on or 80s on and um whenever you

521
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,840
would go someplace and he would bring

522
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,120
them back and he's like hey I'm getting

523
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,720
older I have these really cool seeds

524
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,599
would you like them I I see that you

525
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,440
preserve seeds I see that you have a

526
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,158
good rep like do you want these and like

527
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm like yeah I would love them I'll do

528
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:19,000
my best to preserve them to to uh do

529
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,639
whatever I can to you know carry this

530
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,278
you know all the time and energy putting

531
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,000
into collecting them um I would love to

532
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,679
so I got them from him and I I still

533
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,919
have a lot of them I haven't cracked too

534
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,038
many but the vietnames was the first one

535
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,720
that I crapped into and that plant yeah

536
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,359
it really is that classic kind of like I

537
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,519
guess it would be like that late 70s

538
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:43,879
import he got it there but it it's

539
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,200
different than a lot of the new stuff

540
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,760
you know it really still has its

541
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,919
original vibration like I always you

542
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,960
know because nature is the ultimate

543
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,320
selector you know through it's time and

544
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,600
environment and that's it's that's its

545
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,359
hands when it works with cannabis it's

546
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,759
utilizing its environment and its time

547
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,439
and it's like that's that's a lot of

548
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,480
breeding and there's so many unique

549
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,120
inputs like there's the latitude of

550
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,759
ltitude the dirt the people that that

551
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,759
tended it the the de and the inhale like

552
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,558
it's a whole so it's a time capsule it's

553
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,319
like a teaching it's like it's song it's

554
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,119
like it's it's it's almost like it's

555
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,599
living artwork and it's like an access

556
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,079
point like a vibrational access point

557
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,519
where we can explore that culture that

558
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,879
time if we really open up into it and

559
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,639
really feel like what it was also

560
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,159
putting out you know it's like a piece

561
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,000
of art that you get to experience those

562
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,400
those really Timeless undiluted plants

563
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,119
and they're pain in the ass to work with

564
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,798
they're pain in the ass to get they're

565
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:43,278
pain in the ass to grow but and you know

566
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,679
a lot of times uh they don't always when

567
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,558
they grow in a new environment they

568
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,278
don't

569
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:51,000
always have they're there but you know

570
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:53,839
something about point of origin cannabis

571
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,759
and I really encourage people to to

572
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,480
travel to experience these I know it's

573
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,440
traveling is a lot more difficult these

574
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,038
days and expensive but if you can even

575
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,558
travel on Facebook by finding people

576
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:08,000
that are also and just trading seats is

577
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:09,879
yeah is open your pallet like oh grow

578
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,679
all kinds of stuff so you can really

579
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,679
understand what you enjoy and how to

580
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,880
work with it so that's the basic story

581
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,200
on the v87 and and this courageous and

582
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,200
amazing guy I'll be you know I'm gonna I

583
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,960
think now that I have finally have a

584
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,038
place to start up and work again I'm

585
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,079
gonna crack into some of his other seeds

586
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,000
he had some Nepali he had some stuff

587
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,240
from

588
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Jamaica a lot of Caribbeans he had some

589
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,200
pakist he has these pakistanis that he

590
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,679
said oh these are better than that stuff

591
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,798
the kids are growing now and I've tried

592
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,919
to pop those and I can get them to crack

593
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,599
but I can't get them to come up so but I

594
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,520
still a lot of those so I'm excited to

595
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,879
you know I have so many seeds I realize

596
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,319
and this is problematic too because it's

597
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,720
time you know I keep them in the fridge

598
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:56,960
but I'm right now I'm trying to figure

599
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,440
out ways to not only preserve them but

600
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,519
to share them like I got a whole I think

601
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,919
I got a plan Brewing about opening up my

602
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,440
collection to people you know I might um

603
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,759
you know where I been kind of thinking

604
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
about it's kind of like even before we

605
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,720
were talking last night like looking in

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,480
my fridge I could never my kids my whole

607
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,640
family this entire town can can Sprout

608
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,880
all these seeds so you know maybe doing

609
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,480
them through narka and people can if

610
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,039
someone wants to choose that one that's

611
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,720
really that they've always wanted to do

612
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,879
then they can grow it make seeds and

613
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,440
maybe send half back to narica and drift

614
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,159
distribute it or if there's some kind of

615
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,679
B seed strain that's really old that

616
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,600
everybody's wanted to try that you know

617
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,759
is extinct I would lovingly give packs

618
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,398
for people to F2 or you know I also

619
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,919
might dig into all the seeds that I've

620
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:43,158
gotten from other people I have so many

621
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,278
different reader packs and I'm thinking

622
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,278
about maybe auctioning some of those on

623
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,519
Great Lakes genetics just to kind of be

624
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,960
able to afford a hoop house for next

625
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:56,519
year so I want to get my collection out

626
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,759
before it's too late and also because I

627
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,398
know a lot of these the know that're

628
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,440
kind of Providence and I know where they

629
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,199
came from and I know how I got them and

630
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
I I can be reasonably sure you can never

631
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,798
know really but I know I can be more

632
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,319
sure from stuff that I got 20 years ago

633
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:14,798
or 10 years ago than I can now you know

634
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,398
and there's a lot of seed reselling

635
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,519
Place get land receipts from all over

636
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,359
world but it's there's no kind of

637
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:21,440
there's no checks and balances so I

638
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,359
applaud everybody that does that but at

639
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,919
the same time I'm like oh this is kind

640
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,599
of this is another problem it's a

641
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,000
beautiful problem you know yeah wow

642
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,158
that's so excting starting to hear you

643
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,798
know I'm sure there's a lot of people

644
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,600
out there who would be very down to you

645
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:38,398
know sort of open populate or F2 in some

646
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,079
capacity some seeds and and give back

647
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:41,558
and gosh we're going to have to loop

648
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,759
back and talk about narica but I just

649
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:44,278
wanted to quickly ask because we had a

650
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,679
few people interested in asking and

651
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,480
you're probably the only person who I

652
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,000
trust to give a good answer for this one

653
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,278
but you kind of touched on it there but

654
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
like what what advice would you give to

655
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:58,440
someone who wants to be for lack of a

656
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,640
better words like a modern ethical

657
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,759
cannabis Adventurer you know they want

658
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,559
that land race experience a where would

659
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,079
you say is a place they could do it but

660
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:08,759
B what are some of the things they

661
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,599
should keep in mind about you know

662
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,879
making sure that they're not

663
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,798
inadvertently doing more harm than good

664
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,840
so to

665
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,759
speak yeah I mean that's hard it all

666
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,480
depends on if it's for personal use or

667
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,759
if they're gon to spread it out I don't

668
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,720
know I wish I wish there you got a

669
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,919
little certificate with each time you

670
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,000
you got one but no I think the number

671
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,399
one thing is find a place

672
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,440
that you've always wanted to go that you

673
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:34,038
have a connection to make sure that they

674
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,480
actually grow cannabis but pretty much

675
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:39,558
everywhere does except the North Pole or

676
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,000
um and then make friends you know spend

677
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:44,359
some time don't just go hey you got

678
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,839
seeds or like um like make friends with

679
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,119
the family that you get the seeds like

680
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,959
make a lasting relationship bring bring

681
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:53,798
pens for the kids bring antibiotics like

682
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,960
topical antibiotics Bing bring some

683
00:26:53,798 --> 00:27:02,398
non-hybridized seeds that are safe for

684
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,919
that area you know uh um share just do

685
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:06,398
whatever you can and make them know that

686
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,320
this is something special to you and it

687
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,798
should be something special to them and

688
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,918
work from there I mean there's not I

689
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,879
mean there's so many great places I I

690
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,480
would you know if number one place if

691
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,000
any I tell anyone to go it's kind of a

692
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,798
Galant but it's not super expensive when

693
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,679
you get there go to Nepal like go go

694
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,798
trekking super easy it's super beautiful

695
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,840
you hike four hours you get to a tea

696
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,000
house these are like these are like

697
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,959
beautiful Pathways going through the

698
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,558
Himalayas they've been there for

699
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,240
thousands of years you stop at all kinds

700
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:38,759
of cool places um there's so much

701
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,200
incredible ganja um you don't have to

702
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,599
have a tent there's always a place to

703
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,640
stay and you just get to blaze and just

704
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,439
see the beauty of Nature and be in these

705
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,320
places and meet cool people and make

706
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,038
lasting friendships and you know smuggle

707
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:57,599
some seeds back wherever you need

708
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:59,679
to and um yeah Nepal is I would say

709
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,319
great I mean you know North India like

710
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,399
the whole parva valley I think that's

711
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:07,558
cool but it's kind of it it's got a it's

712
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,239
got an element that that I I don't think

713
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:11,558
that's maybe seasoned if you really want

714
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,839
to blaze I think Nepal has the biggest

715
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:15,918
heart you know but there's so many cool

716
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,119
places like Thailand is opening up so

717
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,360
much there's so much cool stuff La

718
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:24,239
Vietnam Mexico Guatemala bise um the

719
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,278
Caribbean I mean it's everywhere I mean

720
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,919
the only places that I would kind of go

721
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:33,839
that I want wanted to go to like Molly

722
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,440
in you know um or maybe certain parts of

723
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:40,199
the Congo where it was like more pigy

724
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,480
tribes um where else I'm trying to think

725
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,519
of any place maybe if you could China's

726
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,640
a little rough right now but

727
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,159
shinjan the you know on the other side

728
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,038
of the stands like Afghanistan all those

729
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,519
the other side of the mountains um used

730
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,558
to be a big part of the Silk Road I

731
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,839
think there's still some ancient stuff

732
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,480
there but you know there's not a lot of

733
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,879
places but two another thing is if you

734
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,399
make friends with people that have they

735
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,519
interested in cannabis in Africa in

736
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:07,199
South Africa in Guatemala wherever you

737
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,798
make a friendship with that and they

738
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,120
usually hey why don't you next time why

739
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,359
don't you come visit and you're like

740
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,558
hell yeah go make some friends somewhere

741
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,879
and and smoke it there and you know

742
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,558
proofs in the pudding if it's a feeling

743
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,679
that you really enjoy and you've never

744
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,440
felt it before in the regular stuff you

745
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,440
smoke it probably has a pretty good

746
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,200
amount of heirloom genetics in it but I

747
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,080
think we're also reaching a point where

748
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,519
where things are getting

749
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:36,599
rapidly turned into a giant uh Treasure

750
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,798
Chest so I've never been one been able

751
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:43,158
to do like selections at at scale or at

752
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:45,440
field field scale but I feel like at

753
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,120
some point that's to truly find unique

754
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,519
things we're going to have to get to

755
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,599
that level because there'll be like 500

756
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,278
different strains in one

757
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,918
strain which is kind of cool you imagine

758
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,159
looking through like 2,000 plants to

759
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,840
find the most ultimate plant that that

760
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,840
just popped out of like a a cookies

761
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:08,879
gelato um

762
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:12,759
GMO sherbet runs um strawberry um

763
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,320
Michi Pakistani land rice

764
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,519
like thr that in there too just stick

765
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:20,278
them all in there you know like that's

766
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,399
what you'll find at in the you know the

767
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:25,119
uh the Kaiba pass somewhere oh my God I

768
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:27,199
yeah I mean it's it's true I mean look

769
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,599
at like greenhouse and they some of

770
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
their exploit

771
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,480
I mean it's a little Colonial and it's a

772
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,840
little bit um they're just goofballs

773
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,200
it's not like I don't even think they

774
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,798
they have necessarily like they're not

775
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,679
being malicious they're just kind of

776
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:44,119
like like it's a totally different

777
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,960
mindset um and I wonder I'm like okay

778
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,158
but where did all those seeds go you

779
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,319
guys gave them some really cool um

780
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,640
gelato hybrids but what did you bring

781
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:57,519
back I me yeah I don't I don't know it's

782
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,080
just such a strange new world and it's

783
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,240
beautiful amazing but it is really hard

784
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,158
to

785
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,599
navigate but there's

786
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,679
people I just want to give Big Ups to

787
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:11,439
all of the people you know like Deo and

788
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,360
um all these young people that are so

789
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,720
super passionate that are in you know

790
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,398
it's like there's the guys that Kevin

791
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,200
droy went with in Pakistan and there's

792
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:20,558
that Babu in Afghan all these people

793
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,159
that are really going to these places

794
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,359
that we are never going with a huge

795
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,919
passion and a huge dedication and really

796
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,599
doing the work and writing things down

797
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,600
trying things say saving things in

798
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,079
places that are probably the last places

799
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,158
on Earth that we can still get pure

800
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,720
lines you know and I really think that

801
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,840
is incredible and like there people are

802
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,360
popping up all over the place and

803
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,398
they're like I can do this too and I

804
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,278
think that is really Noble Pursuit and I

805
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,278
think it it is quite amazing and

806
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,359
beautiful that we have these you know

807
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:52,200
these other kind of Expressions popping

808
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:56,119
out of this current situation that is

809
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,880
it's almost like a a Saving Grace in a

810
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,359
way yeah yeah totally totally and I

811
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,639
think one of the things that really

812
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,719
resonates a lot with what you just said

813
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:06,558
is the uh the importance of those

814
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,480
organic friendships I I actually

815
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,240
remember it was uh I think maybe mid

816
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,639
2019 I was talking to deep park irisin

817
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,000
for anyone listening I was like man I'd

818
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,879
love to go walk around Nepal a bit and

819
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,519
we we started chatting about it and then

820
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,000
you know sadly covid-19 hit just shortly

821
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,440
after so never came to fruition but it

822
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,038
speaks to what you were saying like you

823
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,399
know those organic friendships are often

824
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,119
what's going to help sort of get you to

825
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:32,759
you know I love the idea of doing it but

826
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,158
it's such a foreign idea but to have

827
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,599
someone there on the ground like yeah

828
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,320
what a what an awesome thing so that's

829
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,719
uh that that's really cool to hear and

830
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:43,918
you just reminded me the last time we

831
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,440
spoke it was so long ago it was before

832
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,759

833
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,960
yeah can you tell us a little bit about

834
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,759

835
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,440
a minute ago but gosh it seemed cool

836
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,359
yeah that was um so that was the art

837
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,038
Kumba that was like the half Ma and the

838
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:04,359
crazy thing is um in January is the Maha

839
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,398
Kumba again that's the 12year one and

840
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,158
I'm doing everything I can to try and

841
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:12,398
get me and my wife there we'll see what

842
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:17,080
happens the finances are a little um

843
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:19,719
skit but uh if anybody wants to go it's

844
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,798
a great place to go experience but okay

845
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:28,278
but we cycle back so the last half MAA

846
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:31,398
um I met um uh deepo Ariz in and is

847
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:35,759
amazing and super cool friend um what is

848
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:37,359
it it's like deep um snake magic it's

849
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,319
means like deep snake magic I'm always

850
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,439
so bad with names what is it he had such

851
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:44,240
a cool friend like Naga Spirit Realms or

852
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,200
had it's one of I don't know what his

853
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,919
handle but it's like that has snakes in

854
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,759
it and deep and ancient and I met those

855
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,159
guys at the kuma which is for people

856
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,720
that don't know it's it's considered

857
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,720
like the world's largest spiritual

858
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,880
Gathering it's kind of I think it's like

859
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:04,120
250 th000 times no 250

860
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,919
2500 200 times bigger than burning man

861
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,878
wow so d uh I literally had to buy a

862
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,440
bike last time I was there to get around

863
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,519
because it would take me like eight

864
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,480
hours to walk into the middle and I

865
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:18,398
think it has 150 million people come

866
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,599
during the event and it's just it's the

867
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,480
most

868
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,519
incredible place because people are

869
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,800
there it's such a high Vibe because it's

870
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,599
the place all everybody in India is like

871
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,760
the kuma it supposedly it

872
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,079
you bathe on these certain bathing days

873
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,440
in the the rivers it's three rivers that

874
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,560
kind of meet up and it's all

875
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,320
astrological and it removes all of your

876
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:47,119
your karma and really infuses you with

877
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,800
with deep like uh transformational Magic

878
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,119
and I met up with those guys at the

879
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,079
melee and we stayed in the same camp and

880
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,639
they were so cool and we would go out

881
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,480
and go hang out with the Babas and look

882
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,079
for new tents and they brought the most

883
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,679
insane Ash ever like it was blowing

884
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,440
boba's Minds like these people didn't

885
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,279
know what like that Cas all the stuff

886
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,639
you saw them post like the cashm and

887
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,839
stuff just a big bag like the place our

888
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:15,358
camp was a put on by a guy Nam rad Baba

889
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:17,639
he was this amazing old sadu and he was

890
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,358
so stoked he had all of his baba Bubbies

891
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,199
come and they would just get they would

892
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:25,880
Blaze him up and we be singing and um

893
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,759
yeah it it was it was such a good time

894
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,400
it was so

895
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,119
Co meet this m itself I was doing kind

896
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,079
of like I know people are G to be like

897
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,079
kind of a like how do you know when you

898
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,800
collect these seeds but I would do like

899
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,119
Baba we would go to Baba camps and we'd

900
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,880
smoke chilling with them and share and

901
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,838
if we smoke something good they flick

902
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,480
the seeds all over the place when

903
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
they're packing their things I'd be like

904
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,000
where are you from what's your name

905
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,280
where are you from and then I would pick

906
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,760
up the seeds and I would write their

907
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,400
name and write wherever they came from

908
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,640
because they're from all over India

909
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,358
places and they usually don't come out

910
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,519
out of the hills they're using and they

911
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,199
usually have pretty good stuff and stuff

912
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,440
that's way way out so I came back with

913
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,559
maybe 20 different SE Indian seed lines

914
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,679
from all over India from each from

915
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,199
different Babas who that was their own

916
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,879
personal stock or their own personal

917
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,559
best stuff from the area so it's like

918
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,760
this massive like collection point and

919
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,599
just the experience of just going around

920
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,640
and at night it's so wild amazing and

921
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,920
Smoky and there's thousands of these

922
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,519
camps and all different kinds of spirit

923
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,000
Pursuits and like there I don't even

924
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,358
know how to explain it like it's really

925
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,599
unexplainable like you could watch a

926
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,440
video on YouTube and see it but it's

927
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,318
literally like the most ancient burning

928
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,440
man you could ever go to it's it's been

929
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:42,559
they've been doing it for like I think

930
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,039
1500 years and it is incredible and wild

931
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,199
but it's intense like you know everybody

932
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,759
you have to poop everybody's pooping

933
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:51,759
everywhere you gotta use your hands

934
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,560
toilet paper use mud which my my kids

935
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,560
always give me a lot of hassle for oh

936
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:58,480
Dad did you really use your hand and

937
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,000
like it to it super works like use mud

938
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,519
instead of soap it pulls everything off

939
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,920
because it's like it's kind of like

940
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,000
using charcoal on your hands I mean it's

941
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,280
a little TMI but um you know and you got

942
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
to watch out what you're eating and

943
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,680
drinking and you know there's a lot of

944
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,839
Chillum cough going around

945
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,679
um but it's incredible and that was that

946
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:21,358
was that experience and that was kind of

947
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,358
like the bass big one I mean we went on

948
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:28,480
a couple I think I went to Waka with the

949
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,639
atams Stray and dock or no we went to

950
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,240
Guatemala after that you know we've gone

951
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,960
on a couple trips together us three

952
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:39,118
doing collections we went to Guatemala

953
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,400
and then we went to uh Mexico on two

954
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,200
different trips to

955
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,119
collect that's always fun but yeah the

956
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,279
that last big India one that was amazing

957
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,519
I think I posted it on a breed Bay and

958
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,119
maybe uh canak Cabana and a few others

959
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,519
to kind of give people keep keep all bu

960
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,519
but I got a bust into those like I have

961
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,440
so many seeds I collected on my own that

962
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,199
I just popped some uh purple chitry that

963
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,039
are 20 years old I was surprised that

964
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,799
they po but I still have napali seeds

965
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:09,000
from 20 years ago it's like it's time to

966
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,480
everybody that's got old seeds it's like

967
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,679
get them going or give them to someone

968
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,159
that can because Now's the Time we're

969
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,919
reaching and all the old you know all

970

they it's time for their time you their

974
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:30,078
bodies are are finally letting go of

975
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,159
their spirits and with them all those

976
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,000
seeds all that know is leaving and like

977
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,318
I feel like this is the time of the

978
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,119
shake up the big kind of transition

979
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:41,279
point and we really need to as a

980
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:44,358
community come together and and create

981
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,200
something for the future you know yeah

982
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:49,039
yeah totally totally I I too am I'm

983
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,719
looking at cracking into some old seeds

984
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,599
I encourage everyone to do the same and

985
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:55,598
beautiful to hear about the the

986
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,039
pilgrimage that sounds like it was a

987
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,760
blast and bit of a culture shock for

988
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,719
some people like myself I'm sure but to

989
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,599
to follow up on that I saw on your

990
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:08,399
Instagram you posted some photos and you

991
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,119
said oh these are some Rajasthani plants

992
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,960
were they from that trip and what what

993
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,960
were they like because I think of all

994
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,358
the land Racers Indian they they're so

995
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,280
like undocumented and like a lot of

996
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,239
people including myself it's like I just

997
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,640
don't really know what they're

998
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,879
like yeah I mean well that's the cool

999
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,279
like if we were talking about Spirit

1000
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,599
nourishing plants um some of those

1001
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,480
ristani plants are really unique some of

1002
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:38,160
them are duds and some of them are

1003
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:42,000
really incredible like um the I think

1004
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,598
the last time there was a baba that

1005
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,318
was uh R Bob is one of his good buddies

1006
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:49,800
that lived in the area and he brought an

1007
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:52,318
enti he got a car he brought an entire

1008
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,640
truckload of this stuff called Mount Abu

1009
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,079
and they call it like Mount Abu mango

1010
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,639
and that's what they would smoke all day

1011
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,400
long they just sat here at somehow he

1012
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,598
made it all the way there like chichin

1013
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,760
Chong Adventure but they don't really

1014
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,359
mess with sadu but is basically the back

1015
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,280
whole back of his car filled up so he

1016
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,920
could share because you know at the KUB

1017
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,720
you want to bring your best stash it's

1018
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,240
also like the you know Babas are like

1019
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:17,039
kids you know and there's you know 99%

1020
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,279
of the Babas are just uh basically

1021
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,519
Shaggy from Scooby-Doo they don't do

1022
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,880
anything they become babbas and there's

1023
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,599
only like 1% that are super like you

1024
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,000
know that have cities that have powers

1025
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,480
that have these connections to states

1026
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,119
that we don't but so it's it's pretty

1027
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,440
fun but this guy had a little bit of

1028
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,200
everything and he connected but he loved

1029
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,679
his gun so the mount Abu mango was from

1030
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:41,358
that that that batch and I think deot

1031
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,679
got some too but I got some seats from

1032
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,239
another Baba called rajani SE car I made

1033
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,759
that rajy space probe with it one of the

1034
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,399
strains I made I think that was like a

1035
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,319
supernatural selection talk about like

1036
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Spirit nourishing that plant it wasn't

1037
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:56,838
it wouldn't knock you down it wouldn't

1038
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,720
make you super high but it just had this

1039
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:02,400
clarity to it like and it had such a

1040
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:05,838
delicate smell like this kind of floral

1041
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,240
incen almost like like nog Champa but

1042
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,960
like um if you ever smelled like

1043
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,439
Magnolia like a red Champa like just

1044
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,000
this beautiful thing and there such a

1045
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,119
beautiful effect effect it was very

1046
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,838
feminine and very like um it just was a

1047
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,960
day brightener but it wasn't you

1048
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,920
sometimes almost not know if you smoked

1049
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,800
it or not um and that you know I'm

1050
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,720
thinking that some of those they're

1051
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,200
pretty Ron's pretty much a desert

1052
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:33,879
that that's a totally untapped kind of

1053
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:38,318
uh genre or like or or section of the

1054
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,599
Indian uh cannabis genan pool that needs

1055
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,159
to be explored and I know in in India

1056
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,960
there's a place I mean sorry in Nepal

1057
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,078
there's a place called The chai It's Lan

1058
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,400
junko they have rhinos and all kinds of

1059
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,519
stuff it looks like kind of like a

1060
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,200
Africa in a way like the savanas and

1061
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:56,719
they have a um the people that live in

1062
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,199
the chitwan and Bia National Forest um I

1063
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,919
forgot where they but they traced

1064
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:04,000
themselves back to gypsies from rajastan

1065
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,480
and they brought their ganja with them

1066
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,920
so there's like a super narrow Leaf um

1067
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:17,000
like a almost jungle ganja plant that

1068
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:20,838
actually at one point was a desert plant

1069
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,199
and over time and environment that plant

1070
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:25,799
that you would get in like just an AED

1071
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:27,558
environment has now turned into a total

1072
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,440
jungle plant so I was really amazed with

1073
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,920
that and that that plant also has a

1074
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,559
really unique effect so I don't know how

1075
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,280
things work but and this is a whole

1076
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,240
another subject about you know old

1077
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,760
plants and new environments but there

1078
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:45,078
are some really amazing plants out there

1079
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,319
just in spots that people haven't really

1080
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,318
looked you know and it's a lot of times

1081
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,920
they don't get you super roasted it's

1082
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:55,039
not like you know that's what hash is

1083
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,358
for they just give your life something

1084
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,159
special you know they're just a little

1085
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:03,480
gift to become part of your culture and

1086
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:06,480
I think that gives them a lot of

1087
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,318
magic yeah totally totally I mean I

1088
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,280
guess it sort of goes without saying

1089
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,159
that you don't know what you don't know

1090
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,000
right there's a lot of stuff that we

1091
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,039
haven't given enough attention to and

1092
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,599
they're just probably not aware of how

1093
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,318
how interesting it is and when you were

1094
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,119
talking about the spirit nourishing

1095
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,719
stuff like one of the things that jumped

1096
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:27,358
to mind straight away was last time I

1097
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:31,598
saw you I was lucky enough you gave me

1098
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:34,440
some pink boost goddess oh my God what a

1099
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,680
what a soul nourishing herb can you can

1100
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,639
you tell me a little more about it I

1101
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,199
only recently learned a little more um

1102
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,519
but I mean I still feel like it's

1103
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,799
criminally under represented and

1104
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,800
underknown within the

1105
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:50,880
community yeah I mean I I don't know

1106
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:53,000
tremendous but I can tell you what I do

1107
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,079
know um you know it's it's one of those

1108
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,079
cultivar that's that's super rich in

1109
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,440
thcv and this amazing woman up I believe

1110
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,720
she's in the Triangle Ava would probably

1111
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,358
Ava knows her would know more she found

1112
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,838
this is kind of the story I was told me

1113
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,358
before she found a plant that she really

1114
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:15,358
liked and she and worked with it and she

1115
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:17,279
Not only was kind of doing a plant uh

1116
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,318
she her breeding process was based in

1117
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,839
science and spirit like she would

1118
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,279
connect to the plants like talk to the

1119
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,199
plants do kind of like a plant spirit

1120
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,839
communication and work in that way and

1121
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,679
then then she would also test your

1122
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,199
plants as kind of a as a backup queuing

1123
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:34,919
and the way she did that as she moved

1124
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:37,838
and she progressed she created this

1125
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:43,400
incredibly High thcv

1126
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:45,159
cultivar um using her her in innate like

1127
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,800
sensing abilities in connection to

1128
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:51,759
Nature and cannabis um along with

1129
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,960
science and yeah it's an amazing it's

1130
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,200
amazing amazing uh I don't know you call

1131
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,679
it cold strain whatever it it is is

1132
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,480
really cool and it had a little bit of a

1133
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:02,719
Heyday because people kind of got smoked

1134
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,280
and like wow but it I haven't heard as

1135
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,759
much about it it's one of those things

1136
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,920
you would think would be everywhere so I

1137
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,680
mean big up to to people that that find

1138
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,599
their passion and their Niche and make

1139
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,000
incredible things for the community but

1140
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,559
yeah that stuff's

1141
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,079
cool yeah yeah totally I mean for me I

1142
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,519
found it like it it just felt like the

1143
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,160
perfect sativa it had just this awesome

1144
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,559
raciness to it and I don't know if

1145
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,279
that's what th CV is like in general or

1146
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,599
if that was just the way it affected me

1147
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,160
but it was it was so beautiful and uh I

1148
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,760
was lucky enough to be talking to Mojave

1149
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,519
Richmond just the other week and I know

1150
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,280
they offer it with the breeder's best so

1151
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:44,960
I was hoping maybe it would make its way

1152
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,079
into like some facilities or something

1153
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,318
but I guess we'll just have to wait and

1154
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,920
watch but this whole topic it gets me

1155
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:55,920
thinking that I think even even now

1156
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,599
really all of the sort of innovative

1157
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,039
strains you know the new strain to

1158
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,160
become the next big popular thing it

1159
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,440
seems like even though big facilities

1160
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,920
have been around for quite a while now

1161
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,960
it it's still comes from like the

1162
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,039
smalltime producer and I guess the thing

1163
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,519
that jumps straight to mind is I know

1164
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,000
that it's been around for forever but

1165
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,039
like you know things like mac and um

1166
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,800
some of these strains like trop cookies

1167
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,759
and all the stuff over the past sort of

1168
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,079
15 years it's all just come from small

1169
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,280
home Growers like it doesn't seem like

1170
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,359
the facilities are you know putting out

1171
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,400
new strin like you'd expect you know I

1172
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:30,880
thought if you're going to have a big

1173
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,400
facility and you pop a bunch of seeds

1174
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,519
you're bound to find something really

1175
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,400
cool I guess my question is I'm now

1176
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:40,280
starting to think that it'll probably

1177
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,160
stay that way that the new cool things

1178
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,480
will come from the homeg grower the

1179
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,920
passionate the smaller operation what's

1180
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,880
your thoughts do you think facilities

1181
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,920
will ever actually start putting out new

1182
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,480
stuff like you know the next big GMO

1183
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,960
strain is like from a facility or do you

1184
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,719
think it'll stay with the passionate

1185
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,880
smaller guys I think I mean all we have

1186
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:01,399
to do is kind of look back in time and

1187
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,559
see where all the best strains have come

1188
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,480
from and it's yeah it's bag seeds it's

1189
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,519
like it's like electric Larry down the

1190
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,639
street who's been sailing since the 70s

1191
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,199
it's like it it's it's these all these

1192
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,078
little Growers it's these people that

1193
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,919
took two packs of their favorite stuff

1194
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,720
and it's like I think it's always going

1195
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,880
to come out of these little pockets of

1196
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,919
of care and creativity you know I know

1197
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,640
there are like

1198
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,760
midlevel um producers that do do pheno

1199
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,558
hunts and are kind of your lines like

1200
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,119
you know like jbz he does all of his own

1201
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,359
things and I think cap he they do a lot

1202
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,280
of fenal hunting and testing I think you

1203
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:39,759
find that but I still think like the new

1204
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,680
new or all or anything that's truly

1205
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,680
unique is going to come out of just the

1206
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:48,759
most the places you would never thinkc

1207
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,000
you know because that's how it happens

1208
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,359
it just it it h it's a Treasures that

1209
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,400
are just needed to be hunted and they

1210
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,440
hide in different spots and creation I

1211
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,240
don't always think it's it's a field

1212
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,280
a field selection kind of thing I don't

1213
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:03,318
you know maybe would if if scientific

1214
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,480
breeding was so cool then why is there

1215
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:07,039
not any cool scientific strains it's

1216
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,639
like they all come

1217
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:13,199
from people that buy seats online or are

1218
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:14,799
traded it's like um I don't know I think

1219
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,159
there's always treasure you just have to

1220
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,559
look it's like panning for gold anyone

1221
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,078
can go down to the river and get and if

1222
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,880
you have a little slle and you find a

1223
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,400
cool spot you'll get it it's like it's

1224
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,160
not it's it's for everyone like cannabis

1225
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,760
has been like that I think if you just

1226
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:34,440
have your heart turned on and your mind

1227
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,319
in a in the right place like it's it's

1228
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,119
rip for picking and I would hope that

1229
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:41,558
new things are going to come along and I

1230
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,519
hope that big facilities will do these

1231
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:45,400
these hunts but all I see is like the

1232
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,039
bigger kind of seed companies and the

1233
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,599
bigger facilities they just kind of do

1234
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,279
goofy things like make triploids or

1235
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,119
things that like you know it's like why

1236
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,160
do we need all these things like we've

1237
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,480
been doing this for 10,000 years I said

1238
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,078
that before it's like we have a love

1239
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,679
affair with cannabis just make out with

1240
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,280
it like it's like do your thing it's

1241
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:08,598
there you know don't listen to all these

1242
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,240
other grof balls that's it's just find

1243
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:14,798
your Niche open your heart Blaze your

1244
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:17,639
way in to a new

1245
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:19,759
world totally I I love that and I I

1246
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:21,719
agree with everything you've said it's

1247
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,680
uh it's certainly the passionate ones

1248
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,239
that are that are driving things forward

1249
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,519
I think it's it's undeniable but

1250
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:29,719
something I wanted to ask while we're

1251
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,559
sort of at that intersection of uh you

1252
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:35,838
know spiritually nourishing plants and

1253
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,200
uh modern hype stuff is there anything

1254
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:41,239
recently even gosh I think the last time

1255
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:44,199
we chatted was about sevenish years ago

1256
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:46,118
so you got a long time for recently that

1257
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,519
sort of impressed you or maybe something

1258
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,440
you didn't expect to be impressed by I

1259
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,480
know that I get lots of messages from

1260
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,838
people who are still surprised that Tom

1261
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,880
Hill said he really liked gelato

1262
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:59,519
41 yeah I mean there certain plants do

1263
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,798
amazing things for certain people you

1264
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:06,358
know and I think that the hype strains

1265
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:08,039
it's I think there's great benefit in

1266
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:11,279
there you know like it's they're really

1267
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,558
good for uh enjoying video games they're

1268
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:18,040
really they're like an

1269
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:20,200
MSG for uh Modern urban um life you know

1270
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,519
they take the edge off you they're fun

1271
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,679
to hang out with your friends it's kind

1272
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,400
of it can be competitive you can grow it

1273
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,798
you have little gardens like you can go

1274
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,720
to The Dispensary like it's

1275
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:31,798
a pop art kind of situation taking all

1276
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,480
different strains and putting them

1277
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:35,440
together and doing this thing and

1278
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,719
hanging out with your friends like I see

1279
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,200
the benefit like that's cannabis is so

1280
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:43,399
multi-purpose like it it's cool like I

1281
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,838
think hype modern hype strengths go for

1282
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,280
it like I think that's super cool that

1283
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:52,159
people are finding joy and finding

1284
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,599
solace in this kind of emergent kind of

1285
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:57,318
uh ultraviolet kind of glossy pop art

1286
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,240
like how many different kinds of Noodle

1287
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:04,639
Soup cans can you make style the same

1288
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:08,039
string like that's that's cool um and

1289
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:10,519
now but to loot back what were we what

1290
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:12,838
was the question I just went into I just

1291
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:15,759
went totally into the hype mode and lost

1292
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,119
my whole train of thought there um what

1293
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,839
what are some strains doesn't even

1294
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,440
necessarily have to be strains what's

1295
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:22,960
some stuff that's impressed you or maybe

1296
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,358
unexpectedly impressed you let me think

1297
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,199
what did I see that I thought was kind

1298
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:30,119
of cool like Oreo's um

1299
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,480
is uh you know it serves its purpose I

1300
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,240
think it's really cool it helps people

1301
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,559
grow in in conditions that are harsh and

1302
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,879
it's quick and it's very frosty um the

1303
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:41,680
smell isn't necessarily my favorite but

1304
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,480
I got to you know sometimes I get to go

1305
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,000
over to when I live by the ocean I got

1306
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,480
to go to Hayes Valley a lot and I get to

1307
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,719
see some of the new stuff and some of

1308
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,199
the Oreos hybrids were really cool I was

1309
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:57,439
I was pleasantly surprised like they had

1310
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:59,519
the frost level but they had new smells

1311
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,000
I like some of the like

1312
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:07,239
um the Burgery stuff kind of like skunk

1313
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,079
Master makes some fun stuff um what else

1314
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:11,679
canavor had some cool ones like Karma

1315
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,240
like I got to see a lot of neat stuff

1316
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:17,480
it's like just people that are finding

1317
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,358
their Niche and not just smashing things

1318
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,119
together and throwing it out but kind of

1319
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,440
finding that plant that they really dig

1320
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,280
and then kind of introducing that plant

1321
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,119
to all of the hype it's kind of like

1322
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,160
taking your nerdy friend friend who's

1323
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,000
super good at something and bring him to

1324
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:33,759
meet a bunch of cool kids and then they

1325
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,440
all you know they all kind of hang out

1326
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,599
and something new happens what else I'm

1327
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,960
trying to think of what I really liked

1328
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,640
there was one what was it called it had

1329
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,318
a Spanish

1330
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:46,078
name i don't know you know I to tell you

1331
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,838
the truth too I've been kind of a Hermit

1332
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,280
these last couple years and it's been a

1333
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,679
little bit challenging so I haven't had

1334
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,319
the exposure that I used to I mean I

1335
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,239
haven't had a garden for the last two

1336
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:59,119
years um so I'm trying to think of what

1337
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,879
really inspires me

1338
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,358
I I don't know I should go back down

1339
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,599
there and see what was the one that was

1340
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,358
really cool recently I don't know the

1341
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,000
last time I was down there it was

1342
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:13,000
getting to smell some Orioles hybrids

1343
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,400
but actually it was a really good use of

1344
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,920
of hybridization like showing that you

1345
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,318
could take a plant that had everything

1346
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,559
except the smell and taste and fusing

1347
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:24,558
them together and actually getting a

1348
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,720
plant that that's that's better than the

1349
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,680
the two parents combin and I love that

1350
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,759
like if you can get two things and put

1351
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,679
them together and you get something

1352
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,280
better than the two like go for it like

1353
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,838
you just you're a big winner there you

1354
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,240
like you did it you know and I think

1355
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:39,599
that's what it's all about is you know

1356
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:41,078
making a mountain out of a mole hill

1357
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,039
totally totally you know you can

1358
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,640
definitely find some really nice crosses

1359
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,519
in in anything really but yeah I agree

1360
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,318
you know Oreo's got big for a reason you

1361
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,880
know it's obviously got some stuff to

1362
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,679
offer earlier on in the answer you you

1363
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,720
referenced the work you do with Hayes

1364
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:59,199
Valley Nursery I'm sure people have seen

1365
00:53:55,719 --> 00:54:01,759
it on your Instagram uh it's cool to

1366
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:03,519
have the collaboration ability with them

1367
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,040
to see what you can do at scow you know

1368
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,920
do you have any plans to give them any

1369
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:10,838
stuff to to see them run through it or

1370
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,720
how what's your thoughts on future do

1371
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:15,159
you want to try to get any anything in

1372
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,199
particular you want to see on big scale

1373
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:18,519
I mean well they're rerunning a lot of

1374
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:20,159
the stuff that was the best like the

1375
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:21,559
cream of the crop from last time and

1376
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,279
then I gave them a lot of seeds it's

1377
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:26,839
harder since I I moved to kind of get

1378
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,440
it's it's like four hours away now so

1379
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:30,239
it's a little bit more difficult but I

1380
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,720
would love to go down soon and see how

1381
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,759
the new trials are coming along they do

1382
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:36,039
those late season trials um but yeah

1383
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,480
they are so kind and they're such

1384
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,880
amazing beautiful people and they have

1385
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,960
their heart in the right place and they

1386
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,760
just do it for like the love and passion

1387
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,358
like it's this huge Bay and it pretty

1388
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,880
much they don't can't do it's just the

1389
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:50,039
labor of love growing all these old and

1390
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,798
ancient and plants that are barely

1391
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:54,039
finishing you know like just getting to

1392
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:57,318
see them and experience them like it's a

1393
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:59,798
huge uh Financial uh

1394
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:01,358
issue but they do it for the love like

1395
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:04,639
that's the way I think it it should be

1396
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,239
you know and there's so many things um

1397
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,639
yeah I pray that I always work with them

1398
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,358
they're good friends and good family and

1399
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,960
I love what they're doing and you know

1400
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:13,719
and they kind of saved me in a way like

1401
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,519
when I didn't have a garden that was one

1402
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:18,639
of the few places I could go and be with

1403
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,639
the plants you know and really uh and

1404
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:23,199
people good-hearted people and just be

1405
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:26,038
there and look you know around put you

1406
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,960
know got their little piece of colored

1407
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,200
plas that they around think I was pink

1408
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,199
and someone else is yellow and so you

1409
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,519
can mark the plants that you liked and

1410
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,199
kind of watch them progress and like so

1411
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,480
you know it's it's such a mental health

1412
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,598
boost to be with plants and then you get

1413
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,880
all the oxygen you know it's like plants

1414
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,079
are healing if you hang out with a lot

1415
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,880
of cannabis plants like it's like going

1416
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,559
into a hyperbolic oxygen chamber and

1417
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,960
just the the vibe like it's so soothing

1418
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:55,640
and calming and there so much so rich

1419
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,079
with volatile essential oils that are

1420
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:58,759
just doing you who knows what they're

1421
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:00,880
doing to your system but you feel good

1422
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,240
it's like you know the the notion of the

1423
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,200
Japanese have that Forest bath where

1424
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:07,038
they go on Hikes through the like high

1425
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,919
pining forest and they just come out and

1426
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,839
it's like it's better than prac for

1427
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,760
these people they go in having a hard

1428
00:56:10,838 --> 00:56:14,279
day they walk out the end of their hike

1429
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,839
and they feel great because they're

1430
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,160
getting the oxygen they're getting the

1431
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,759
pining which is all stimulating and

1432
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,639
enlivening like being around plants is

1433
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,079
just you know I think that's one of the

1434
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,279
greatest gifts that we have as humans is

1435
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,200
to be able to tend Gardens you know this

1436
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,760
is that going back to the original

1437
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,838
Garden this is the garden planet where

1438
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,599
the stewards you know it could be Adam

1439
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:38,000
and Eve it's like or Adam and Steve

1440
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,920
whatever you're into but just make it

1441
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,119
yeah make it happen totally totally

1442
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,920
that's that's so cool to hear that you

1443
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:46,160
are still able to get that fix you know

1444
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,480
shout out to Ryan I was uh lucky enough

1445
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,440
to hang out with him a few times when

1446
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,519
he's been down under yeah um that's that

1447
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,679
that's awesome to hear you know look

1448
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,318

looking at going forward um well now I

1455
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:13,358
mean it's kind of like I have to kind of

1456
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,400
do the backstory and to be able to sell

1457
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:19,159

1458
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:23,559
try and you know I I'll try and make it

1459
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:25,798
quick so uh take take your time how I

1460
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:26,798
explain this um it's been about three

1461
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:29,639
years

1462
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:32,159
and you know massive Transformations and

1463
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,279
challenges for B seeds and friends and

1464
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:40,159
family and you know we had to leave the

1465
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:42,920
farm and we did a mass Exodus to the the

1466
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,679
Sierra Foothills which is about four

1467
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,039
hours away so we used to be in the Santa

1468
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:50,038
Cruz area um in the red for forest and

1469
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:51,559
now we're up in the Oak Forest you know

1470
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,200
and there's a lot of trials and

1471
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:56,480
tribulations a lot of losing plants

1472
00:57:54,199 --> 00:58:00,199
losing hair losing my eyesight losing

1473
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,318
dogs and kids Farms um what else my

1474
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,480
musical equipment the B seeds computer

1475
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:05,838
like there was a lot of surrender and a

1476
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,400
lot

1477
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,078
of um I don't know it was kind of like I

1478
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,720
almost felt like some of the families

1479
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,318
that felt that would go um start in like

1480
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:18,318
Oklahoma and make that trip in the

1481
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:20,199
covered wagons to California to uh um

1482
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,079
pay for gold or go to Gold Country and

1483
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:23,679
now we're in Gold Country so after you

1484
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,640
know all these trials and tribulations

1485
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,519
and not having a garden and doing a lot

1486
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:29,960
of unique things along the way like the

1487
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,679
cookies experience that was that was

1488
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,838
brought on by that whole

1489
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,118
Exodus yeah so through through many

1490
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:39,159
trials and tribulations we made an a

1491
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,119
massive Exodus um to the foothills of

1492
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:42,960
the sieras and we're here now um we

1493
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:47,559
moved here with my mom who we took care

1494
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:50,760
of while she was passing um and now we

1495
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:53,440
have this beautiful piece of land um

1496
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,480
it's kind of a diamond in the rough uh

1497
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,559
we grew our first little outdoor fruits

1498
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,358
and veggies Garden um it's quite hot

1499
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,880
here like I definitely have never been

1500
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:05,960
in this kind of heat like I thought hot

1501
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,519
was 85 de down in Santa Cruz but we had

1502
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:12,159
some days that were in the hundreds and0

1503
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:14,759
and you know the joys of that is like I

1504
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,078
I really dug it but you know plants

1505
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,760
that's hard to keep bugs at bay that's

1506
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:20,920
hard to keep things going like you know

1507
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,079
cannabis loves hot temperatures but I

1508
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,559
was something I wasn't

1509
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:28,960
super ever experienced or exposed to so

1510
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,000
I have a workshop now and I up some

1511
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,599
tents in there the workshop stays about

1512
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,798
99 degrees which is you know I get a

1513
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,519
little bit of a it's like a sweat lodge

1514
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:40,239
combination you know I sweat out a lot

1515
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:43,920
of toxins while I work which is kind of

1516
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:47,598
cool and just got her first little first

1517
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,559
round of um kind of test plants gone off

1518
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,440
and you know hav had a haven't had a

1519
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,760
space in two years the only times got to

1520
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:01,679
really had a had a space um oh sorry

1521
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,400
someone just texted me right in um but

1522
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:07,279
basically um diamond in the rough got a

1523
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,559
great uh new spot and hopefully next

1524
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,240
year we'll uh generate enough income to

1525
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,839
create like some outdoor space like a

1526
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:16,118
little hoop house or um to really get

1527
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,880
some projects going because before we

1528
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:19,400
moved there was so many visions and

1529
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,760
dreams and projects that were ongoing

1530
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,039
just about to kind of kick into gear and

1531
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,359
everything we want to do and then you

1532
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:29,640
know life changes and and life

1533
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:32,199
progresses and life takes you in so many

1534
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:35,519
amazing places you never thought you

1535
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:37,279
would it would take you and that's it it

1536
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,719
teaches you things it makes you a better

1537
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:43,039
person it creates the the the you know

1538
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:45,000
the true essence of who you are and so I

1539
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,960
feel so honored to be someplace where I

1540
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:52,280
can finally start and restart all those

1541
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:54,358
visions and dreams and projects and yeah

1542
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,240
wow you know I'm I'm sorry to hear about

1543
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:59,279
your your mom passing Six Month months

1544
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:01,639
ago it just sounds like as you said a

1545
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,119
truly a transitionary sort of time for

1546
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:06,519
you in general and I guess we're all

1547
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:08,318
just so appreciative that you're sort of

1548
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:10,960
feeling that you're coming back to us

1549
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:13,159
and I know everyone would be more than

1550
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,880
happy to get on board with any projects

1551
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:17,598
you launch in the near future uh in

1552
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,200
consideration of how it would fund

1553
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,119
future project goes without saying I'd

1554
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:24,399
love to hear you know what might be

1555
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:27,358
something people can get excited about

1556
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,519
in the near future cuz I'm sure even

1557
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,239
even just beyond the fact that we we're

1558
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,000
hearing it's going to go towards further

1559
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:35,159
projects I I know people are just keen

1560
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,358
on your work just just for the inherent

1561
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:39,279
genetic projects what sort of stuff

1562
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,159
would you have in mind do you do you

1563
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,359
have some of the Old Faithful males or

1564
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:45,879
have you moved on from some well you

1565
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:48,838
know I lost a tremendous amount of

1566
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:51,519
plants trying to take them from Santa

1567
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:52,440
Cruz here through the different houses

1568
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:56,920
that

1569
01:01:52,440 --> 01:02:01,599
we um had to inhabit on the weight here

1570
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:04,119
it's just oh I don't yeah it it was a

1571
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,278
it's always hard to lose plants but you

1572
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:09,798
know I always feel like losing plants is

1573
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:12,199
an opportunity to move on and maybe move

1574
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:14,639
into something that is that's you know

1575
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:16,239
just waiting for you like just the a

1576
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,558
thing that's truly going to inspire you

1577
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,399
and I always think you know if you lose

1578
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,760
parent stock it's time to move on and

1579
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,278
there's and it lives on in all its

1580
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,119
hybrids and stuff you know so most all

1581
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:28,318
the males are gone old males which is

1582
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,559
good too because you know they were

1583
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,038
getting old and I was a little worried

1584
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:33,559
about the hplv and you can never tell

1585
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,000
when plants are getting super old what

1586
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:38,200
unless you testing what's really going

1587
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,519
on so um let me think what you know a

1588
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:41,318
few plants have made it the funny thing

1589
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:44,119
is the plant I think I've had the

1590
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:46,159
longest um Stevie Wonder I call it

1591
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:47,798
Stevie's Wonder or now I call it Saints

1592
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,558
Crossing just so I don't get busted by

1593
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:52,679
Stevie Wonder's estate even because I

1594
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:56,000
like Stevie Wonder M with him um I've

1595
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:58,719
had that one for 20 plus years I think I

1596
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,559
think it got made in 2005 so that's one

1597
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,639
of my that's my oldest clone that I

1598
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:06,480
still keep so that's going strong um but

1599
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:08,118
not really none of the old males make it

1600
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:14,480
it's all new males and all the new stuff

1601
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:14,480
that I'm going through so what um like I

1602
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,838
think I'm trying to think of like what

1603
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:21,480
we're really the basis of what we're

1604
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:26,278
trying to do is to kind

1605
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:28,719
of preserve and Inspire like um preserve

1606
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:32,400
all of those special plants that that

1607
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:35,838
are maybe in the fridge or um and then

1608
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,880
also inspire people to to utilize those

1609
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,679
plants and to really follow their path

1610
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,440
because I always feel like it's like a

1611
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:43,639
you know a strain or Cult of our is kind

1612
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,679
of like an Afghan rug it's like

1613
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:47,598
everybody it's like you it's a weave

1614
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,118
it's like you start it and you kind of

1615
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,838
pass it on someone works on the other

1616
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,480
family part and someone else it's like

1617
01:03:50,838 --> 01:03:54,000
we're a big family we're all working on

1618
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,240
everybody's working on each other's work

1619
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,960
and I think that's the beauty of it it's

1620
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:59,439
this cry that moves through lives and

1621
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,440
you know I've done a lot of line work

1622
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,318
and I make a lot of tools for myself but

1623
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,159
predominantly I always would make

1624
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:07,400
hybrids you know because I thought it

1625
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:09,358
was the best way for people to kind of

1626
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,880
get involved and get evolved with it is

1627
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:14,759
just is grow this out see how cool it is

1628
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,760
if you like it or not if you don't let

1629
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,720
it go if you do then move forward take

1630
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,599
it to F2 like really break it down see

1631
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,399
the parents see what's going on if you

1632
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:24,318
like what you're seeing then move it in

1633
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,160
the direction that you really love and

1634
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:30,038
get it out like experiences like take it

1635
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:33,440
you know it's like put your own outfit

1636
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:37,000
on it it's like make it yours and really

1637
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,838
I don't know just just go I I don't

1638
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,239
think cannabis should ever be there

1639
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:44,519
should be no limits there should be

1640
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,078
no shackles there should be no one

1641
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:48,278
saying oh you can't do this you can't do

1642
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,079
that I don't think it's fair if you sell

1643
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:53,480
like f2s for profit but if you sell f3s

1644
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:56,839
go for it or you know it's like just put

1645
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,838
your spin on it um

1646
01:04:56,838 --> 01:05:01,838
I don't

1647
01:04:58,838 --> 01:05:03,920
know I'm having my you know when you get

1648
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:06,318
in your head so much that you're your

1649
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:11,119
it's like when the Mind opens the mouth

1650
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:13,920
closes um yeah no that's that's good I I

1651
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:17,920
love that and I guess look just just a

1652
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,838
quick one like is it is it the case that

1653
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,240
uh if there's a certain strain out there

1654
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:26,038
from say you know the 88 G13 male that

1655
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,278
someone was really fond of like you

1656
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:30,000
should probably go buy that if you can

1657
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:31,039
find it because it's it's not it's

1658
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,719
there's no

1659
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,440
more yeah there's a limited stock that

1660
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:37,199
left like I don't I think know lot of

1661
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,838
strains that are extinct but you know

1662
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,000
what's cool like on over and grow and

1663
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:42,358
stuff they have whole I this is like big

1664
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,719
up to all these people like this is

1665
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:48,159
incredible there's like a b Co-op F2

1666
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:49,959
group that f2s all kinds of rare packs

1667
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,639
I'm like that is the radest thing I've

1668
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,760
ever heard of or seen I'm like it's so I

1669
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,798
think that's one of the most awesome

1670
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,440
things I want to like send old packs and

1671
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:00,079
be like hey are you guys looking for

1672
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,760
this if you want to fire up this pack

1673
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,160
yeah go ahead preserve it like I think

1674
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,480
that's the best like I can ask for a

1675
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:09,159
better compliment than that like people

1676
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,920
wanting to preserve work that that I've

1677
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:13,038
done and it's just I'm just one hand

1678
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,039
like I'm literally it's like I made it's

1679
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,839
almost like

1680
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,720
making uh rice and saying hey now it's

1681
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:20,838
your turn to like add the CER you know

1682
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:23,038
it's like it's like that's kind of a

1683
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:24,759
weird analogy but it's it just feels

1684
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,559
good to know that people want to

1685
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,240
preserve something you made and then

1686
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,559
with that be able give that out give it

1687
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,439
out for free do whatever you want trade

1688
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,359
um and then people make new stuff with

1689
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,480
that I mean that's the very essence of

1690
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,519
what our cannabis culture should be it

1691
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,639
should be this caring

1692
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:44,400
inspirational uh Cooperative like

1693
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:46,920
working together to to give everybody

1694
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,400
everything they need to create exactly

1695
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,200
what their heart desires and their

1696
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,559
creativity affords you

1697
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:57,358
know yeah of course that I think that's

1698
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:59,119
the best way to to to get noticed as

1699
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:00,639
well for anyone out there who's like

1700
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:04,599
looking to build their

1701
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:07,519
rep I uh I I wonder then have you have

1702
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:09,519
you got anything that's sort of piqued

1703
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,119
your interest in terms of males you've

1704
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,880
got at the moment or is it just still

1705
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,960
very much in that initial phase of you

1706
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,640
know not nothing standing out quite yet

1707
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,880
still searching through things um you

1708
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,239
know today I was in the mail and I was

1709
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,358
going through all stuff and I counted I

1710
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:29,118
have about 50 new males but you know I

1711
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:30,798
need to whittle them down to about 12 or

1712
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,480
so but there's so many cool things I've

1713
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:36,278

1764
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,640
big hunt to find something that I really

1765
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:48,359
wanted because I would like to have I

1766
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,960
don't want to get that that seedline to

1767
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:52,560
just get lost in in the shuffle I want

1768
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,359
you know I decided I'm going to find a

1769
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,280
really killer specimen and let it out

1770
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,439
into the wild so can actually I think

1771
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:02,759
that was a a really cool line it just it

1772
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:04,319
just you know had a hard release and to

1773
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,920
get that out I think I might even offer

1774
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,679
it back up to cookies saying hey this is

1775
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,880
here's your baby you know this was a

1776
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:13,199
special time in history um so they can

1777
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:17,119
have what else I've been doing um oh

1778
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,879
I've been doing the new dragon soul work

1779
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,399
which I really like it's the pine Soul

1780
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,480
um dragon's blood I'm trying to think

1781
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:25,719
all the different weird stuff there's a

1782
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:29,119
lot of um older lines like to skin te I

1783
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:32,239
have going some purple kush uh old

1784

mother gani that looks really cool um I

1785
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:39,198
did some purple kush King's

1786
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:41,560
cross and then the next round is more

1787
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:44,198
kind of like preservation like the

1788
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,880
purple chitri from Nepal and then

1789
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:49,319
getting into some of my old stock that

1790
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,719
that I found with the you know with docy

1791
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:53,519
and stray when we went went on our two

1792
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:56,960
hunts like a lot of some of the

1793
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,480
Guatemalans and some of them um W

1794
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,800
Hawkins and then so much cool stuff I've

1795
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:04,119
been going through my seed collection

1796
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,119
like breaking it down like

1797
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:10,439
what think people like to use that I

1798
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:12,600
might not use like so many cool things

1799
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:15,079
you know all kinds of old JJ that people

1800
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,880
would like I have the original cap you

1801
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:19,600
know Mac I have so many packs of Billy

1802
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,719
Goat stuff like all the old stuff all

1803
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:25,000
the U all the old breeders from the

1804
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:28,800
overgrow days you know like I think we

1805
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,079
have um three little birds and JoJo Rizo

1806
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,640
and um so many old lines that are just

1807
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:36,439
so were so cool that just need to come

1808
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,679
back so it's just been a big you know

1809
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:40,238
whenever I get down I just go and I bre

1810
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:42,000
take out the seeds and I like to just

1811
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,238
dig through seeds and I get excited when

1812
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,679
I see some of those packs I haven't seen

1813
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,759
in a long time but it's like a I don't

1814
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:51,800
want to be like golum like seed golum

1815
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,639
like my precious like you know I might

1816
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,639
I'm going to keep like a tenth of my

1817
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:59,480
collection to work on but

1818
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:01,520
yeah I want people to be able to find

1819
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:05,319
cool stuff and I think that was the

1820
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:07,120
whole the whole reason that that that

1821
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:09,238
went through the cookies experience like

1822
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:10,559
that was a that I thought that was going

1823
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:12,519
to be the coolest thing ever like

1824
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,840
extreme possibilities like F1 hybrid

1825
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:17,760
which taking the best the best

1826
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,119
infrastructure or the best whatever you

1827
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,560
call that that like

1828
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:25,719
um where they have the most reach

1829
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,960
there's a name for it um

1830
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:30,760
well cookies is a marketing

1831
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,800
force and I F thought if I could bring

1832
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,320
in these plant these totally new plants

1833
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,960
we could

1834
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:41,279
basically kind of like a gravitationally

1835
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,679
blast away from this

1836
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,039
uh conglomeration of plants that were

1837
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,000
just taking over the planet and we could

1838
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:50,319
create something really special new um

1839
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,800
yeah we could talk more I know people

1840
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:53,759
always want to know about that I'm sure

1841
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,360
we could talk more about it and um and I

1842
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,480
know a lot a lot of Street Credit on

1843
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:00,719
that one but um yeah I had to see beyond

1844
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:02,879
uh the whole experience or maybe we'll

1845
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,039
just talk about that in a little bit um

1846
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,119
and I can start from beginning because I

1847
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,679
know that's something people always ask

1848
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:12,599
me about but back to the original

1849
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,199
question of what I was doing um yeah

1850
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,600
that's the current stuff and then I have

1851
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:20,519
a lot of cool um Medicine Mountain lines

1852
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,120
and that's kind of my like s work also

1853
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,719
working on a secret new company um

1854
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,319
called I guess if I call tell you what

1855
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,560
it's called it's not secret but it's

1856
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:31,079
called yum and it's kind of going to be

1857
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,400
like it's like a hype company like I'm

1858
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:34,000
going to try and make really cool new

1859
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,279
hype things out of totally different

1860
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,639
plants than anyone else has and try and

1861
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:43,359
squeeze them into that uh the general

1862
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:46,440
popul community and see if we can't like

1863
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:48,759
get some new flavors and fresh new funky

1864
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,678
stuff happening you

1865
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,679
know that sounds super exciting is it is

1866
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:56,199
it just yourself in that one is it is it

1867
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,480
pronounced yam

1868
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:00,399
yeah Yama is like it's a I like it it's

1869
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:03,879
a funny word it's a it's in kind of

1870
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:06,158
Buddhism it's the it's the the mixture

1871
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:09,359
of wisdom and compassion and you usually

1872
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:11,920
see it as as uh it's usually like a

1873
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:14,599
female yogini and a male and they're

1874
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,679
sitting on each other's laps kind of

1875
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,960
like in a in like a love making position

1876
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,399
I don't know if you seen it it's like

1877
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,399
looks like a you'll see like a a lady

1878
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:27,279
Buddha sitting on the like a in they're

1879
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:29,519
in Lotus and he's kind of sitting on her

1880
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,238
lap and they're in this kind of H it's a

1881
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,480
basically it's like a coidal metaphor

1882
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:36,599
for uh the the fusion of wisdom and

1883
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,359
compassion so and it has such a funny

1884
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,800
and fun name so I thought that's great

1885
01:14:38,359 --> 01:14:43,679
yum yum I love that I love that oh so

1886
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,719
we've got something to be excited about

1887
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,319
then yeah and that's like a little side

1888
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,319
project I think the

1889
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:52,599
first I might even send out some testers

1890
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,198
of those to people like in the community

1891
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,239
just so I could you know get some really

1892
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:58,079
good feedback on that Edge because we

1893
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,599
haven't had a tester so program in so

1894
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:03,039
long and I tend to like think every

1895
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,400
plant is cool so like I always try and

1896
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,399
find there's always a redeeming

1897
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,279
character in every plant I look at I

1898
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:10,158
like oh wow I love the smell it'll be

1899
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:11,639
like you it'll it have like you know you

1900
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:13,439
get like a gram out of a whole plant I'm

1901
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:14,359
like oh this is really cool but it's

1902
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:16,879
like you

1903
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:17,880
know there has to be a balance but yeah

1904
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,560
I think the

1905
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,039
first the first seeds are already done I

1906
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,199
made three different hybrids with this

1907
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:27,600
male that is kind of going to be the the

1908
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:29,599
first flagship of this new

1909
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,520
Endeavor and then what else and more

1910
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,039
medicine Mountain those just take

1911
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,480
forever because you're working with like

1912
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:37,279
these long flowering sativas it's a

1913
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:39,279
little bit more of a labor of loving I

1914
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:40,840
think this year next season um I can

1915
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,960
braid the heat a lot of those will be

1916
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:46,000
coming out and I also want to do a lot

1917
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:48,279
of uh um preservation work like I have a

1918
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,679
few Charlie's lines I Les his heart I

1919
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:51,599
don't I guess I don't know I haven't

1920
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,000
heard from him in a long time I mean he

1921
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,360
I thought he might be in Columbia or

1922
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,238
stuff I don't know if he's still around

1923
01:15:54,359 --> 01:16:00,238
but I would love to let people try some

1924
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:01,759
of those you know like skiny and mexa

1925
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,119
and I have a bunch of different lines

1926
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,000
from him some you know the the uh

1927
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:11,039
Vietnamese black from Billy Goat is an

1928
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,238
amazing line um I have so many cool

1929
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,119
things that I'd love to just you know

1930
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:16,839
people that I respect that I feel like

1931
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,559
their their lines are kind of

1932
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:21,239
Disappearing you know people never it's

1933
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,239
like it kind of it's like a gray area

1934
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:27,879
you know where people um is people

1935
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:30,359
weren't around in the like early 2000s

1936
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:33,880
they don't really

1937
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:39,000
understand or even in the 215 era how

1938
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:41,760
much more cultivars and how much more uh

1939
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,679
variety we had it's kind of like a the

1940
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,079
Fruit Market at fruits and vegetable

1941
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,679
markets at the turn of the century like

1942
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:51,359
what was there like 126 apples in 19 or

1943
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:53,639
1895 or something and now we have six to

1944
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:56,119
eight apples in stores you know because

1945
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:57,679
they're the ones that don't bruise they

1946
01:16:56,119 --> 01:16:59,599
they stay on the shelf longer they

1947
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,239
things they're not the tastiest not this

1948
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,239
we've totally totally eliminated our

1949
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:08,000
gene pool for convenience and capitalism

1950
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:10,399
so I'd like to just bring back some

1951
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,399
variety and really allow people to

1952
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:16,679
experience I could I think that's the

1953
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:18,479
best education is experience and I pray

1954
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:20,079
that you know I see a lot of other

1955
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,759
people doing it too and I think this is

1956
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,399
one of the ways that we can uh progress

1957
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:29,360
into the future where we have a very

1958
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:29,359
vibrant and magical cannabis jepol

1959
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:34,000
again yeah totally totally and I I think

1960
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,480
something that really resonates with

1961
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,399
what you said at the end there is you

1962
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:40,279
really do have to experience it because

1963
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:43,198
a lot of the most memorable experiences

1964
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:45,719
that have really change my perceptions

1965
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,719
and thinking wow like some of these land

1966
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:50,719
races can can actually be just so

1967
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,840
otherworldly it it it can't be

1968
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,399
articulated really you know and and

1969
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,119
you're trying to explain it to someone

1970
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:59,039
but you just

1971
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:01,359
you know words words aren't enough so I

1972
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:04,079
agree that's that's awesome on on all

1973
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:06,479
fronts and I want to ask you uh you

1974
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,800
mentioned a few times we'll we'll loop

1975
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:09,399
back to the cookie stuff but I want to

1976
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,360
ask you you've mentioned the big so

1977
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:12,920
Nigerian a few times we had a few people

1978
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,319
who were really interested to hear a

1979
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,719
little more about it I know it's a

1980
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:20,840
strain that's shrouded in a lot of sort

1981
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:22,800
of um mystery can you just tell us a bit

1982
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,079
of the backstory and what it smells and

1983
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,639
looks like cuz I know you made a few

1984
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,359
hybrids with it maybe for anyone who's

1985
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:30,960
eying those

1986
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:32,439
off yeah so um another good resource for

1987
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,600
this too is Mojave because he grew up

1988
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:36,719
there and he knows all about these

1989
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:41,280
things but basically um I had a friend

1990
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:42,960
Mike who kind of uh was a friend of a

1991
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:43,920
grower down there and what was that

1992
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,840
other guy I don't know if I'm supposed

1993
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,920
to say his name but there was a lot of

1994
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:54,079
people amazing um Growers That Grew down

1995
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:58,158
on The Ridges over big sir and Mike got

1996
01:18:54,079 --> 01:19:02,279
these seeds in the I think mid 80s and

1997
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:03,479
he had him forever and um he he's an

1998
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:07,319
older guy I think he's probably in his

1999
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:10,039
80s now he found these somehow in his

2000
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:12,399
old stuff and he had three seeds he got

2001
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:13,960
two up in his little house he has a

2002
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:16,799
little low rent house he put him under

2003
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:19,760
like a little fluorescent light um and I

2004
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,279
think one of them went up and then

2005
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,600
another one went up it said it said he

2006
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:27,479
took him about a month in a little

2007
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:29,280
flower pot and um he one of them died

2008
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:30,879
shortly after but he brought me down

2009
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,960
this one to kind of preserve he's like

2010
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,800
hey I have this this uh this big S this

2011
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,439
Nigerian Sea that we used to grow uh in

2012
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,840
the 80s and I've got it up it's like

2013
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,000
it's a miracle it's like I don't know

2014
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:43,279
how I did it like and so he gave it to

2015
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,439
me and I I kind of nursed it back to

2016
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,960
health and nursed it up and it was one

2017
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:51,599
of the coolest plants like it was it was

2018
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,319
relatively quick you know I think like

2019
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,480
12 weeks maybe you know you could take

2020
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:59,559
it at 10 it such a beautiful amazing

2021
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:01,039
structure like so loves outside so

2022
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,840
beautiful like you could tell like it

2023
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:07,158
love my area cuz I'm pretty close to

2024
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:11,480
big and just this wild kind of like

2025
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:14,839
metallicky kind of herbal meaty Herbs de

2026
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:18,359
provant kind of sage

2027
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:20,360
brushes um smell but just kind of smell

2028
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:23,799
dangerous like it just

2029
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:25,158
smelled powerful and it was like it just

2030
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,400
had the greatest

2031
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:29,399
effect like it was so powerful was so

2032
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:31,679
great in hybrids like it would really

2033
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,039
just take over in a good way and you

2034
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:35,760
know when anytime I really wanted to

2035
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,399
kind of get out there on like on a Ledge

2036
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,320
I would I would smoke it and you know I

2037
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:42,079
had it for a while and it you know did a

2038
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:43,279
couple different hybrids and using a lot

2039
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,000
of different things because I loved it

2040
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:48,079
so much and you know I tried everything

2041
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,880
I I could but eventually I lost it you

2042
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:55,198
know along with the7 a lot of plants had

2043
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,400
the house that we moved

2044
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,759
uh

2045
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:02,519
from after the farm was in this amazing

2046
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,840
beautiful house and it held everybody in

2047
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,719
and we could have the animals there and

2048
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,920
stuff but it was the worst place to grow

2049
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:10,198
there was this little garage it was so

2050
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,239
damp and it was so funky and it was so

2051
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:14,439
impossible to clone and do anything

2052
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,919
there and I think it died in a tray like

2053
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:18,678
I would take like 20 cuts of all my

2054
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,039
favorites just so that I'd know i' get

2055
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:23,920
like one out of the deal and I think

2056
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:26,399
that was one of the times that some kind

2057
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:28,279
of it got infected or something but I

2058
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:31,039
lost a whole tray of like my favorites

2059
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:33,880
it was just like a it was really tragic

2060
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:37,560
so it lives on in hybrids um it's just

2061
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:39,319
one of those original old 80s Big Sir

2062
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,320
Africans you know they had I believe

2063
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:43,960
that they grew quite a bit of Africans

2064
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:45,479
and Mexicans I mean there's a I I'm you

2065
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,119
know I didn't grow up there and there's

2066
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:50,119
people that know a lot more but from

2067
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:54,679
what I've heard um you know strings like

2068
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:58,559
Dolores and chamba and this Nigerian

2069
01:21:54,679 --> 01:22:00,158
and uh I know we used to get u a silver

2070
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,199
Pearl that came out of there and they

2071
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:04,319
had a Durban that came out of there when

2072
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:05,919
I first moved to Santa Cruz like you'd

2073
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,559
always get really special stuff that

2074
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,199
came from Big Sir it was people that

2075
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,520
really did it for the for the love and

2076
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:15,158
you know it had it was a very special

2077
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:18,600
environment you know so it made really

2078
01:22:15,158 --> 01:22:22,599
cool plants but basically to the gist is

2079
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:25,280
it really cool old African that

2080
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:28,120
climatized itself and big S um brought

2081
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:31,119
back to life by a really great guy um

2082
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:32,960
who lived in that area in that time

2083
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,760
that's some really cool backstory and

2084
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,719
you know people have to pop those Seas

2085
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:40,639
it's it's got to live on for sure and

2086
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:42,119
yeah uh another question that you you

2087
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,920
know you sort of referenced it in the

2088
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:46,079
past answer when you were talking about

2089
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,000
various males we had a lot of people who

2090
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:50,719
were Keen to hear more about this

2091
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,238
lavender lemonade mail what what can you

2092
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:55,079
tell us about it well that's kind of

2093
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:56,919
cool like you know when I

2094
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:59,479
I started to get you know as I went to

2095
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:00,880
more and more to Wallflower I mean to

2096
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:03,839
radio Ridge which turned into Wallflower

2097
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:07,960
to turned into Haz Valley um all the

2098
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:12,880
same people uh just that

2099
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:14,359
that that um that journey of sharing

2100
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,000
with them and sharing clones and getting

2101
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:17,599
to understand nurseries and like

2102
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,880
everything it was so fascinating it

2103
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,800
really opened my eyes to the whole world

2104
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,639
of like commercial production like I my

2105
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,760
brain was never really in there I was a

2106
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:29,800
hermit like I wasn't creating plants for

2107
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,880
nurseries or for commercial production I

2108
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,600
was just kind of following my Bliss and

2109
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,000
trying to bring out the best possible

2110
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:40,039
plants from where my connection to the

2111
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
plant was but I got fascinated with like

2112
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:43,719
you know plants that had to finish in a

2113
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,198
certain time that had to look a certain

2114
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:49,079
way that had to be resistant to these

2115
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:50,479
things that had to be able to even

2116
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:52,198
though one thing that really blew my

2117
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:55,119
mind is oh this has to go through a

2118
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:56,399
trimmer I'm like oh so I this plant I

2119
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:57,359
thought oh this plant's Super Rad

2120
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:58,519
everybody's going to want this and

2121
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,479
they're like oh it's not going to go

2122
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,440
through the trimmer right I'm like what

2123
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,000
what kind of you know I just had all

2124
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:06,519
these epiphanies so I started on uh

2125
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,520
making trying to make kind of a line

2126
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:11,480
that I thought would be really cool for

2127
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,840
uh for Big Time

2128
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:16,839
production and so I know that was back

2129
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:19,520
when the TP the everybody was like Ted

2130
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,119
up Supreme like everybody wanted like

2131
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,159
the very you know all everything at hot

2132
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:24,960
was like citrus and like you know orange

2133
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:28,638
and lemon and lime you know cuz we come

2134
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:31,359
from the land of lemon tree and um

2135
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:33,639
everybody just that seemed to be the

2136
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,319
thing so I'm like oh cool I'm you know I

2137
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:38,920
could do lemon tree and wook two

2138
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:40,799
extraordinarily turpy strains and try

2139
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,679
and make something that would Encompass

2140
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,039
both of those but even better like I

2141
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:46,199
really wanted to get the structure down

2142
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:48,118
like I always you know structure is

2143
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:50,719
great and all but it wasn't always on

2144
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:52,479
the top of my list for for breeding so

2145
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:55,439
that one was like it was primarily

2146
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:59,238
making something that was structurally

2147
01:24:55,439 --> 01:25:01,319
easy to to grow and also to have the

2148
01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:03,359
look and the smell that everybody wanted

2149
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:04,880
so I worked on it for a while and grew

2150
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,359
out different ones and we even had a

2151
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,199
couple really cool phenos that went

2152
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:12,439
around and and

2153
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:16,279
um and it kind of culminated eventually

2154
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:19,638
in you know into the line that I thought

2155
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:21,399
would be perfect for for cookies they

2156
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:23,639
could you know like they they were B

2157
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:25,158
they're so big on you know Aromas and

2158
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:26,560
tastes and flavor

2159
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:31,399
that it could be something that could re

2160
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:34,320
really Revitalize uh part of their their

2161
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:37,479
uh their stick kind of like their their

2162
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:39,479
jam and so that's how it kind of worked

2163
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:41,359
into that and so a lot of these under

2164
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:43,238
lemonade hybrids that are coming out

2165
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:46,839
were kind of

2166
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:48,678
made in really thinking kind of like the

2167
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,360
commercial Market or the nursery Market

2168
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:53,800
or just allowing people to have plants

2169
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:56,039
that maybe have these really exotic chps

2170
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:59,159
that are going to just flop over and

2171
01:25:56,039 --> 01:26:00,118
just you know something I don't know

2172
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:01,719
it's just something new I'm always

2173
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:04,279
trying to push myself into these new

2174
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:07,319
places and new Realms to you know to

2175
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:09,840
really see what I can do and it it was

2176
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:12,238
kind of my version of my first kind of

2177
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,880
foray into like kind of making something

2178
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:16,238
like hype like something that everybody

2179
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:18,800
would like that could be moved through a

2180
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,959
commercial

2181
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,880
situation and also that was kind of when

2182
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,719
I was losing the farm too so I was also

2183
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,679
thinking of other ways to like well how

2184
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:29,239
can I apply myself I I can't I'm not

2185
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:32,079
growing like how can I apply myself to

2186
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:34,000
be the best thing I can for the

2187
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,880
community and and also be able to

2188
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,719
generate income to do the projects like

2189
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,039
what what can I what can I move into and

2190
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:42,039
I really thought for a while like I was

2191
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:43,920
really into I'm like strain design that

2192
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:45,760
sounds so cool I don't have you know

2193
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,440
it's it's kind of a labor of love making

2194
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,360
seeds and having big mom rooms like you

2195
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,839
don't ever get to do anything and you

2196
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:53,039
know anytime I'd ever travel I'd always

2197
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,960
lose like so many cool plants like it's

2198
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:58,039
kind of like but it just have to it just

2199
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,319
has to happen sometimes so the strain

2200
01:26:58,039 --> 01:27:03,039
design part was was really a cool

2201
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,118
Challenge and it it really opened my

2202
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:07,279
mind and allowed me to see deeper into

2203
01:27:05,118 --> 01:27:09,198
the Cannabis as a whole I I I realized

2204
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:11,039
that was kind of my opic just being a

2205
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:13,719
little bit hermetic and not focusing on

2206
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,800
the bigger picture and by moving into

2207
01:27:13,719 --> 01:27:17,760
that commercial space you know it was

2208
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,880
fascinating and I kind of I enjoyed

2209
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,560
pushing myself and and learning about it

2210
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:25,800
and and creating something for it yeah

2211
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:28,600
yeah definitely and I can I can see 100%

2212
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,679
where that comes from you know I I think

2213
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm I'm exactly just as guilty as you

2214
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:35,440
you know sometimes I've I hang on to

2215
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,719
these plants that are just nightmares to

2216
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:41,039
trim and uh and people tell me and we're

2217
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:43,560
not even in the commercial

2218
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:47,079
setting I want to ask you a bit of a a

2219
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:50,320
random one quickly it's it's almost

2220
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:53,479
undeniable that the General market

2221
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:56,000
demand and Trends has shifted very

2222
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:58,118
significantly towards feminized seeds

2223
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,920
especially over say you know it's been

2224
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:02,359
happening for a while but I I think in

2225
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,279
the past 5 years there's been a dramatic

2226
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:06,880
shift even among home Growers and

2227
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:09,960
generally speaking their willingness to

2228
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:12,199
grow regulars I think you're probably

2229
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:15,520
quite immune to that because you've got

2230
01:28:12,198 --> 01:28:17,839
a a very specific sort of clientele who

2231
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,320
who enjoy regulars and there's always

2232
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,000
going to be like pretty much anyone

2233
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:22,840
listening to this show is always going

2234
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,359
to be happy to grow regulars because

2235
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,520
we're just like you know that sort of of

2236
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:30,639
Enthusiast level but I do Wonder have

2237
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:33,719
you thought any more about feminized at

2238
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:36,639
all um you know it's just it's it's just

2239
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:38,279
not my thing I guess I'm just old school

2240
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:42,199
I'm kind of coming from like the Luther

2241
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:44,238
Burbank style I um there's so many

2242
01:28:42,198 --> 01:28:46,599
amazing breeders that do it it's I think

2243
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,678
it's a really cool tool especially on

2244
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,159
Old plants that you may maybe you only

2245
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:53,039
have a female and you want to uh

2246
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:56,000
preserve it it's really cool to open up

2247
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:58,519
the the of a plant to see what it

2248
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,158
possibly could be and to search out its

2249
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:05,080
parents like it's the ultimate kind of

2250
01:29:01,158 --> 01:29:07,158
like um Crack the Code like go in and

2251
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:08,439
and you know it's like a forensic tool

2252
01:29:07,158 --> 01:29:10,799
you know like I always think like

2253
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:13,479
inspector like he's he's the probably

2254
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:18,440
the best the most

2255
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:22,238
uh uh devoted and Brilliant and

2256
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:24,238
uh uh you know S1 worker that I know of

2257
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:25,718
like he really does an incredible ARR

2258
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:27,759
and vast amount of work and he does a

2259
01:29:25,719 --> 01:29:29,359
good job and that's his thing and like I

2260
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,360
respect people that they find their

2261
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:34,238
Niche and they find uh what they can do

2262
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:36,279
well and they go with it but yeah I'm

2263
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:37,919
just the I'm kind of just like the old

2264
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:40,519
wizard on the hill and just do it the

2265
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:43,760
oldfashioned way and you know I thought

2266
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:47,679
at one point when the um when there was

2267
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,920
the I guess the bandid S one pcon or

2268
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,440
something like that and there's all that

2269
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,880
ho I thought oh that might be fun to

2270
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:55,960
like partner up with someone and and do

2271
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:58,039
some like uh Band-Aid Haze feminized

2272
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:01,399
like with all kinds of the cool

2273
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:04,920
sativas um I think I even talked to uh R

2274
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:07,000
Ridge maybe I'm sorry D I still call him

2275
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,560
radio Ridge because it's go all the way

2276
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,600
back to that um hay Valley um all those

2277
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,560
cool sativas that we found in the last

2278
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:16,280
big hunt kind of mixing it up with the

2279
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,520
band 87 but you know I don't know that

2280
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:21,880
just we haven't really moved for on that

2281
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:24,199
and I don't know I'm just not a big S S1

2282
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:26,239
guy

2283
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:29,678
yeah maybe I could just shorten that up

2284
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:32,919
and just say yeah just I I appreciate

2285
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:35,319
all the directions that people go and

2286
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:38,239
and I have great respect for all the

2287
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:40,158
people that find their Niche and that's

2288
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,439
femin just isn't mine and I think it's

2289
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:44,279
amazing I have been known back I think

2290
01:30:42,439 --> 01:30:47,238
it was 20 years when I got the stuff on

2291
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:49,279
eBay and I mixed it up all the STS and I

2292
01:30:47,238 --> 01:30:51,319
just basically roasted the hell out of

2293
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:54,359
all my plants and I thought well that

2294
01:30:51,319 --> 01:30:56,118
was no fun you know I I don't know I

2295
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:59,198
don't like to mix up chemicals I don't

2296
01:30:56,118 --> 01:31:00,920
you know Alchemy I do like inner Alchemy

2297
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:01,960
but outer Alchemy is not one of my

2298
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:05,399
strong

2299
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:07,800
suits and yeah the coolest part about it

2300
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:09,198
is I realized is you know if you have

2301
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:13,520
two verified

2302
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:15,198
Cuts you can make the same seeds as like

2303
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,800
you you have a thousand people get the

2304
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:21,319
you know get runs and and cookies the

2305
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,760
two cuts and feminize them and everybody

2306
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:24,519
will have the same

2307
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,280
seeds yeah

2308
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,960
I think that's how it would work so I

2309
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:30,960
mean that's kind of cool like it really

2310
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:33,118
levels the playing field you can uh you

2311
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:37,639
know I think maybe in the

2312
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:40,079
future now I'm just rambling but um s1's

2313
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:42,760
super cool I mean no actually not super

2314
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,639
cool I how about I'm not gonna do any

2315
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,800
s1s in the future but I really

2316
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,960
appreciate everybody that's involved in

2317
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,920
that work and I think it's kind of cool

2318
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,239
doing the S2s and threes and all that

2319
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,118
and I know that's how they do it in

2320
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:57,039
scientific reading but I just like two

2321
01:31:54,118 --> 01:32:02,719
plants making love and getting to

2322
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:02,719
experience all their kids when they come

2323
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,759
out tot no totally totally I I love what

2324
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:11,239
you said there like I mean I myself I I

2325
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,400
make F and I do weird stuff like that

2326
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:16,158
but you know what's interesting like it

2327
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:18,960
took me a while I I had a bit of the

2328
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:23,039
like hippie guilt about like I've come

2329
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:25,399
to accept that like yourself you know I

2330
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:28,519
like f1s you know I'm happy to do it as

2331
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:30,799
a f but I like that F1 generation the

2332
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,400
most I've toyed around with others and

2333
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,840
there's just something magical about

2334
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:38,039
that first recombination with especially

2335
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,880
diverse genetics coming together you get

2336
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:42,319
something really interesting there and

2337
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,279
that's what I love the most for sure so

2338
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:46,639
I I'm definitely on board with you in

2339
01:32:44,279 --> 01:32:48,279
that sense and and in and amongst that

2340
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:50,800
answer it's it's come up a few times

2341
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:52,960
actually you mentioned the uh the the

2342
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,719
guys running pcon and I guess by

2343
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,800
extension you know the the the Cuban

2344
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,679
black Haze which has really had a

2345
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,639
massive Resurgence over the past say

2346
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:04,000
three or so years and and shout out to

2347
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:07,199
the guys who run pcon it's one of the

2348
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,800
few successful like he events though I

2349
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:11,158
haven't been to it but everyone I speak

2350
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,560
to who's gone is like yeah it's it's

2351
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:14,319
like really it's like what the emerald

2352
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,520
cup was doing back in the day you know

2353
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:20,799
just like cool people really good herb

2354
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:22,440
um unique effects and then when you also

2355
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,800
put this in contrast with the fact that

2356
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:26,519
you got people like uh you know Tom

2357
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,159
Hills recently come out with his Haze

2358
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:31,239
Todd McCormack's doing his thing with

2359
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:34,000
the haze and and top dog is also doing

2360
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:36,559
some Haze and um you know very Haze

2361
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,118
heavy sort of work what's your thoughts

2362
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:42,039
on the Resurgence of haze specifically

2363
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:44,039
and in my mind I think it's either down

2364
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:46,880
to like Cuban black Haze or super silver

2365
01:33:44,039 --> 01:33:48,519
haze is going to sort of become the new

2366
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,359
front runner they're definitely both

2367
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,080
really Rising back up do you have any

2368
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,238
thoughts over which one might be the

2369
01:33:53,079 --> 01:33:57,319
bigger of the two contenders to be

2370
01:33:55,238 --> 01:34:00,759
reinjected

2371
01:33:57,319 --> 01:34:02,759
yeah I don't know I mean there's so many

2372
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:05,600
fresh new minds and heads and people

2373
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,280
creating these new hazes I think it's

2374
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,199
amazing I think it's so cool I think

2375
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:13,679
that you know piif con that is people

2376
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:15,000
rallying up for like heady highs like

2377
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,600
that is incredible and it kind of

2378
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,158
hearkens back I think we talked about

2379
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:23,159
this a long time ago about how those uh

2380
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:25,039
heirloom sativas coming in when Hip Hop

2381
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:26,439
was first starting and in New York like

2382
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:30,840
a lot of that

2383
01:34:26,439 --> 01:34:35,158
early hip-hop culture was was fueled by

2384
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:37,079
these like Colombians and uh Mexicans

2385
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:39,118
and these like Haze you know Haze type

2386
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:41,359
plants like that were really you know

2387
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:43,439
that were sparking the minds and and

2388
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:45,799
really filling the streets and like

2389
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:48,678
having that it's just like another

2390
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:51,239
expression of people it's Heritage it's

2391
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:53,399
basically it's a cultural it's a

2392
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:55,399
cultural treasure hazes in New York and

2393
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:58,839
I think what an amazing beautiful place

2394
01:34:55,399 --> 01:35:01,519
for that uh that pipc con to happen and

2395
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:03,400
how cool is that I mean what what hazes

2396
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,600
are going to be popular in the future I

2397
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:08,399
don't know I think ones that have the

2398
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:11,000
most uh unique effects like super silver

2399
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:12,679
haze it is like that if that is kind of

2400
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,399
like the working

2401
01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:17,480
man's Haze like there's nothing quite

2402
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:19,198
like it just the smell the structure the

2403
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:21,599
way it is I mean maybe it's not the

2404
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:24,238
headiest but it's just it checks all the

2405
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,159
boxes it's a truly extraordinary

2406
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:29,678
and then by default like Neville's Hayes

2407
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:31,960
which is kind of like the the more crazy

2408
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,520
grandpa there that you know it's hard it

2409
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:36,198
takes longer it's harder to uh grow and

2410
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,360
it you know it has that more a little

2411
01:35:36,198 --> 01:35:41,198
bit more refined and then the Cuban

2412
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:43,319
black that we grew that that was such a

2413
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:45,079
wild plant like it was so big but it

2414
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:47,039
would take a while but it would get so

2415
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:49,639
big and it was it had that Unique Kind

2416
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:53,198
of effect of like it still had some of

2417
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:55,000
its northern lights um in it you know

2418
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:58,198
giving it that big structure but it had

2419
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,198
such this beautiful kind of buoyant head

2420
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:03,960
space um but I think the future of Haz

2421
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:06,399
is going to be in people doing really

2422
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:08,000
cool stuff like you know doc d Works

2423
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:10,118
does a lot of cool hay stuff and like

2424
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,639
nobody's Nursery they do it I know all

2425
01:36:10,118 --> 01:36:13,399
those piff guys like they're all kind of

2426
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:15,880
pushing your art JJ comes up with cool

2427
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:19,319
stuff like and I see a lot of the people

2428
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:21,279
overseas like yo Sammy and like um some

2429
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:24,079
of the Gold Guys on icy mag and then

2430
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,880
there's the guy The White Buffalo guys

2431
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,880
in Canada those guys are awesome what

2432
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:32,960
they're doing like those yeah it's it's

2433
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:35,639
a it's a really incredible and Tom Hill

2434
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:38,158
of course he you saw his pictures of him

2435
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:40,000
pumping out his new round

2436
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:41,839
like it's beautiful it's very

2437
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,560
heartwarming and it's very cool to see

2438
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,159
that there's s that that's kind of

2439
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,480
bubbling up I don't know what's going to

2440
01:36:45,158 --> 01:36:50,399
be the best um you know and and people

2441
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:53,039
like you know I read some of the

2442
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:54,920
comments like band7 that's not even a

2443
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:56,479
haze and it wasn't about Haze I guess

2444
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,480
the pcon is about piff piff snort and

2445
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:01,638
lights Haze I don't think I don't think

2446
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:04,079
bandid s is necessarily that exciting of

2447
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:07,760
a haze but what it is is it's a it is

2448
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:10,238
like an A1 Primo working man's sativa

2449
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:13,079
guys like bread and butter like kind

2450
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:15,638
it's like the steak of haze is prolific

2451
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:17,158
it smells good it has a a stoning effect

2452
01:37:15,639 --> 01:37:20,199
you can work on it it's for people that

2453
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:22,000
smoke a lot of gun I think it hits just

2454
01:37:20,198 --> 01:37:24,039
right and I you know and in this state

2455
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,719
and in this environment

2456
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:27,960
the states and Holland and New York and

2457
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:30,239
all these places like the new

2458
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:33,279
environment that's putting the selective

2459
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:35,839
pressure on it is the youth the culture

2460
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:38,399
the like you know the music the the

2461
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,880
underground and I think uh I think it's

2462
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:43,479
going to be this cultural icon that that

2463
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:46,359
really serves as this vehicle to really

2464
01:37:43,479 --> 01:37:49,198
move people into a positive direction

2465
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:52,279
for the future with for um for really

2466
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,519
heav herb so kudos to everybody involved

2467
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:56,279
I think is so awesome in rad I think

2468
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:58,040
everybody should grow some hazes at some

2469
01:37:56,279 --> 01:37:59,479
point and I think we should have them

2470
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:01,198
back in the marketplace and I think

2471
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:05,439
people should be striving to make

2472
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:07,719
greater and greater versions and unique

2473
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:10,839
offshoots and whatever because yeah I

2474
01:38:07,719 --> 01:38:12,719
think hazes is one of the truly it's one

2475
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,679
of the greats that we have in our

2476
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,079
cannabis

2477
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:20,079
Heritage yeah 100% and uh you know

2478
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:22,599
obviously shout out to our former

2479
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:24,519
episode guest you know Tom the The White

2480
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:26,560
Buffalo guys and y Sammy those guys

2481
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,639
obviously doing killer work with the

2482
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,639
haze while we're talking about haze just

2483
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:32,679
a quick little cheeky one I remember

2484
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,359
ages back I was talking to you and you

2485
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:37,000
sort of joked around about the idea of

2486
01:38:34,359 --> 01:38:39,359
doing a haze Recreation with snow high

2487
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,599
and kagu have you have you thought about

2488
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:44,319
it because as time goes by I I'm just I

2489
01:38:42,599 --> 01:38:47,360
I ruminate on that thought I'm like oh I

2490
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:48,960
really hope they do that yeah yeah I

2491
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:52,238
think we've been doing it for about 15

2492
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:55,118
years now it's like every year it's like

2493
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:57,079
okay we I think Michael like K he's he's

2494
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:59,238
the most gung-ho on it he's like so yeah

2495
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:01,158
you got you got your plant ready for the

2496
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:03,678
things you know John did his two years

2497
01:39:01,158 --> 01:39:06,158
ago like he is he's a force of nature

2498
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,679
he's always getting everybody to uh get

2499
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:09,638
involved I'm like uh I don't know I just

2500
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,199
moved like I always have some like you

2501
01:39:09,639 --> 01:39:13,800
know I some it's like supposedly we're

2502
01:39:12,198 --> 01:39:15,519
like handing off plants and I think it's

2503
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,880
going to do it in its own time but it's

2504
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,960
definitely it's been started and it's

2505
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:21,800
gone through a couple iterations but I I

2506
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:24,359
think I might have dropped the ball here

2507
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:27,719
and there and I think John probably drop

2508
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:30,559
drop a ball but it is it is it you know

2509
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:33,039
it's out there it's in the ethers it

2510
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,800
full it hasn't fully germinated yet but

2511
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:37,158
it is something that that is close to

2512
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,960
our hearts that we should be working on

2513
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:40,719
so thank you for putting a fire under my

2514
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:44,520
butt on that

2515
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:46,279
one no no I'm sorry I I I agree with you

2516
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,159
it's still it's still happening it's

2517
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:50,198
just it's just progressing at the rate

2518
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,519
it needs to progress at yeah you got to

2519
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:53,919
have a lot of space and you got to have

2520
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,360
a lot of um oh yeah time and you got to

2521
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,039
have the right environment people think

2522
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:59,839
that don't that I think get turned off

2523
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:01,880
about hazes is hazes you got to look

2524
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,319
through a lot of hazes like that's

2525
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,159
that's why hazes are so cool it's not

2526
01:40:03,319 --> 01:40:07,039
like hazes are you get a pack and

2527
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:08,759
they're these awesome plants hazes is

2528
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:11,560
like the ultimate treasure hunt it's

2529
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,039
like the it you know if you want to find

2530
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,560
a good Haze you're gonna have to look

2531
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:17,679
through a lot of plans and that turns a

2532
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:19,920
lot of people off and you know I don't

2533
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,520
to give me like if you gave me a vial of

2534
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:25,520
a thousand original haast seats that's

2535
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:27,719
not that not something that I want to do

2536
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,560
you know I don't want that's a lot of

2537
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:32,840
work so I think

2538
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:35,480
also finding these special Cuts is going

2539
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:38,440
to be very beneficial because yeah it's

2540
01:40:35,479 --> 01:40:41,079
a lot

2541
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:42,799
of the one and I think that's the one

2542
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:44,800
reason why H really caught on it's a

2543
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,119
pain in the

2544
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:50,000
ass yeah of course that's a big

2545
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:52,000
commitment to make and uh it's

2546
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,520
understandable on the Practical scale

2547
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,920
people are a bit apprehensive

2548
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:58,760
in in the last answer when we were

2549
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,920
talking about pcon I I wanted to ask

2550
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,599
because there's there's this interesting

2551
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:05,440
situation that play in New York where

2552
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:07,360
there's undeniably this huge Renaissance

2553
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:08,759
with cannabis especially in regards to

2554
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:11,399
like talking about the piff and some of

2555
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:15,920
those guys in the real he scene but at

2556
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:19,198
the same time the sprayed pack phenomena

2557
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:21,279
tpine infused cannabis is also clearly

2558
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:24,359
got a stronghold in New York there's a

2559
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:28,319
lot of people more so the average Hunter

2560
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:31,198
acknowledge uh who are very very much

2561
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:33,039
into this sprayed pack cannabis and the

2562
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,479
thing that I find the most interesting

2563
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:37,279
about the spray pack phenomena is that

2564
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:39,279
people are not oblivious to it like

2565
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:41,399
they're very aware that that's cuz that

2566
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:44,079
was the immediate kneejerk reaction was

2567
01:41:41,399 --> 01:41:46,319
like oh they don't know but a lot of

2568
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:50,039
them are in fact almost everything I've

2569
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:52,799
seen on it says that people are aware um

2570
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:54,880
and it's interesting there's a podcast

2571
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:57,000
out there it's just specifically about

2572
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:59,800
rating various sprayed packs I thought

2573
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,479
that's a sign like that's how mainstream

2574
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:05,159
this is so I'd love to know what's your

2575
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:07,799
thoughts on the sprayed pack

2576
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:09,319
turps I isn't that amazing is that the

2577
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,560
craziest wild thing that you've ever

2578
01:42:09,319 --> 01:42:13,799
heard I mean I think it's a I mean then

2579
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:16,639
also you have all like the th what is it

2580
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:20,039
Delta 8 or was it you know all

2581
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:22,279
the I think that's wild like it's a

2582
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:24,560
slurpie culture it's like it's junk food

2583
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:27,039
it's like fast food it's like it it's

2584
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,599
like pop art it's like you know people

2585
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:31,679
don't care what they put in their body

2586
01:42:29,599 --> 01:42:34,319
so why would they care what they put

2587
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,960
into their lungs I mean I think it's

2588
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:37,719
it's cool and you can come out with the

2589
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:39,480
weirdest wildest thing I don't even know

2590
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:41,239
what do they use real T beIN they use

2591
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:43,718
real essential oils like what do they

2592
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:46,359
spray them with like do you just get

2593
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:49,158
some f or do you like go get some some

2594
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:51,198
like you know like some Citrus olve or I

2595
01:42:49,158 --> 01:42:55,439
mean what they is there companies that

2596
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:57,839
sell the spray like up I mean I guess

2597
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:59,638
I'd love to like the the my tongue and

2598
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,000
cheek answer is is this just not what

2599
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:03,359
people were doing back in the day when

2600
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,479
they chucked orange peels in with bags

2601
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:10,359
yeah serious yeah tortilla tortillas and

2602
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:14,678
orange peels right right but uh no so I

2603
01:43:10,359 --> 01:43:16,399
I I recently um had uh sticker Farmer on

2604
01:43:14,679 --> 01:43:18,399
um the new show I've I've been doing

2605
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:19,879
with me and Jean and he's tied in with

2606
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,039
the guys who sell this stuff so he knows

2607
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:25,079
all about it and he said that the stuff

2608
01:43:22,039 --> 01:43:27,719
they spray on it is is the same flavored

2609
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:30,920
solution people use for like nicotine

2610
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:32,840
solutions for Vaping so you get like so

2611
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:36,520
it's just that same like

2612
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:38,199
viscous food grade artificial flavoring

2613
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:41,520
and there's like a machine that sprays

2614
01:43:38,198 --> 01:43:44,238
it on it so yeah not not like plant

2615
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,520
derived or anything like that that's so

2616
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:49,198
wild

2617
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,800
they wow I mean I wonder what do they

2618
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:53,198
what kind of gunch do they spray on just

2619
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,079
like just just the just the booth or

2620
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:58,559
like is there a special strain that they

2621
01:43:55,079 --> 01:44:00,399
like to use interestingly enough what he

2622
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,119
said was that of course yep there are

2623
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:04,439
definitely people trying to you know

2624
01:44:02,118 --> 01:44:06,158
sort of Polish a turd but he said the

2625
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:09,638
companies that are doing the best are

2626
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:12,079
actually putting quality product in and

2627
01:44:09,639 --> 01:44:14,480
then spraying it which is really quite

2628
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:15,800
sort of perplexing well I know like

2629
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:17,559
companies like app like some of the big

2630
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,039
tpine companies like what like abstract

2631
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,920
sector what all those different ones

2632
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:23,880
that sell or what was the old clear

2633
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:26,319
water or what those places that sold t

2634
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,118
mixtures um and you could add them to

2635
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:30,359
your carts or butt or whatever I guess

2636
01:44:28,118 --> 01:44:34,359
that's the same kind of

2637
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:36,439
thing but so what does that do if if

2638
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:39,079
they're spraying it so I always say like

2639
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:41,919
the chirpings are the plant story you

2640
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:46,158
know it's it's what it's it's trying to

2641
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:47,920
tell you so by spraying it I don't know

2642
01:44:46,158 --> 01:44:50,198
I mean you want to maybe we should try

2643
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,199
and get you some so you can do a um you

2644
01:44:50,198 --> 01:44:54,519
could do some bio essaying and tell us

2645
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:56,559
if you notice any differ it it kind of

2646
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,280
like remember when like all those uh

2647
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,599
research canabo like

2648
01:44:58,279 --> 01:45:02,759
jw18 and all those different Wild Ones

2649
01:45:00,599 --> 01:45:05,000
and people would smoke those like what

2650
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,199
if you use that and the spray together

2651
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,800
and do put it on like those old High

2652
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:12,319
Times 80s like a centerfold remember the

2653
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,679
fake buds you could buy in the back of

2654
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,000
the

2655
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:19,239
magazines yeah like on you could just

2656
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,800
spray fake canono and then uh the spray

2657
01:45:19,238 --> 01:45:23,718
and then put it on like Moline or some

2658
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,320
kind of like real healthy lung herb

2659
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:27,000
you know I feel like we've we've sort of

2660
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,079
cut out the middleman there and it's at

2661
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,198
the point now where I hear that many of

2662
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:36,198
the like the the cheapest sort of carts

2663
01:45:32,198 --> 01:45:38,559
you can buy are essentially like mostly

2664
01:45:36,198 --> 01:45:40,359
tpin and some sort of filler and a

2665
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,520
little bit of Delta 8 or like you know

2666
01:45:40,359 --> 01:45:43,000
what I mean like it's almost at the

2667
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,320
point where it it's what you're

2668
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,719
describing it's like there's nothing

2669
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:48,319
real there well it's like cheap beer I

2670
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,639
mean I think we just reached that we'

2671
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:53,319
reached the lows of kind of like or just

2672
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:56,039
the capitalistic lows of of of a product

2673
01:45:53,319 --> 01:45:58,719
you know people want the the cheapest

2674
01:45:56,039 --> 01:46:00,279
possible experience and then people also

2675
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:01,960
want the highest like Pinnacle of

2676
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:03,759
experience and so we have the complete

2677
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:07,079
bandwidth to work with

2678
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:08,679
now yeah I I wanted I wanted to ask you

2679
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:10,399
I've been I've been very much thinking

2680
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:11,800
about this idea for a while and I've

2681
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:14,039
been sort of slowly getting more and

2682
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,840
more into wine and the thing I think

2683
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:19,560
about the most is like how come no one

2684
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,719
breeds in wine anymore and then um I

2685
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,520
started thinking about that in the

2686
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:23,960
context of cannabis and I'm sort of

2687
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:26,960
thinking do you think like we're going

2688
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:30,399
to get to the stage where everything

2689
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:34,000
will be so bred to specifically suit a

2690
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:35,920
certain production style that like over

2691
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,560
a longer period of time not a short

2692
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,560
period of time but a longer period of

2693
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:42,320
Time commercial production turns into

2694
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,760
like what wine production is where it's

2695
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:48,759
like there's just like these 30 or 40

2696
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:51,079
recognizable varieties and even of those

2697
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:53,960
it's like eight of them are just by far

2698
01:46:51,079 --> 01:46:56,279
the most common of them all and it's

2699
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:58,920
just what is considered you know and

2700
01:46:56,279 --> 01:47:01,118
it'll be like OG will be like chardonay

2701
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,079
and run is like Merlo you know what I me

2702
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:05,079
it's just like there's just a few things

2703
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:07,079
do you think that is like a possible

2704
01:47:05,079 --> 01:47:09,039
risk or do you think like it's it's too

2705
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:11,000
variable it won't ever get like that I

2706
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:12,880
think it kind of is like that I think

2707
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,520
it's just that it rotates a lot faster

2708
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:17,520
than than grapes and stuff you know is

2709
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:21,320
like it sends we it seems like there is

2710
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:23,400
like 60 Main cultivars and they go on

2711
01:47:21,319 --> 01:47:26,079
kind of in and out and they kind of

2712
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:27,559
cycle through and go into the you and

2713
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:29,039
they're always kind of cycling out I

2714
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:32,080
don't because we don't have a v there's

2715
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,719
not a vast pet or maybe we're rapidly

2716
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:35,880
moving into that stage I mean it's the

2717
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:37,439
same thing that we have happen with all

2718
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,599
of our fruits and vegetables it just

2719
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:42,479
gets to the point where profit takes

2720
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:43,960
hold and you know I mean we're I think

2721
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:45,158
we're kind of doomed in that regard I

2722
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,399
think the only way we're going to be

2723
01:47:45,158 --> 01:47:53,319
able to get out of this is to just get

2724
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:53,319
everybody everybody in the

2725
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:59,118
just arrows every everything just throw

2726
01:47:55,639 --> 01:48:02,039
SE do this and then also you know maybe

2727
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:03,679
a new model like a like a dra to consume

2728
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:04,719
where small farms that have grown like

2729
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:06,039
something really beautiful they had in

2730
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,039
their family for so long and they're

2731
01:48:06,039 --> 01:48:08,679
really proud of it and they do all

2732
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:10,319
organic inputs they can have a little

2733
01:48:08,679 --> 01:48:13,118
website and seller their story and sell

2734
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:14,599
Direct in the mail to someone that

2735
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:17,039
really wants to experience that or

2736
01:48:14,599 --> 01:48:19,560
farmers markets or you know I think

2737
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:22,359
we're in we' set it we're like we're

2738
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:24,599
basically set up to fail and we kind of

2739
01:48:22,359 --> 01:48:28,198
just have to ditch the whole system and

2740
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:29,760
go back to like you know before uh

2741
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:31,638
prohibition cannabis prohibition

2742
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,560
everybody grew it ganja it was

2743
01:48:31,639 --> 01:48:35,239
everywhere it was used for everything

2744
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:37,520
10,000 years it's been used for

2745
01:48:35,238 --> 01:48:40,079
everything it's like why not let's just

2746
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,520
go back to that make it make it our you

2747

front lawn do ornamentals do CBD plants

2749
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:49,759
do whatever don't don't get don't let

2750
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:51,520
the the government take a hold of this

2751
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,960
one or big business like do people

2752
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,679
really want I mean it's cool to go to

2753
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,920
dispensary and see everything but even

2754
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,520
if you have a friend you always have

2755
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:00,000
that funny friend guy that has the

2756
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,880
garden in the back oh check out my

2757
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,800
tomatoes like you know there's always

2758
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:07,760
someone in your group and that's that's

2759
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,520
gonna want to grow so I don't know I

2760
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,840
think that it's just Grass Roots at this

2761
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:13,639
point is to and just kind of grow down

2762
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,880
Babylon it's like it's not going to get

2763
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:18,679
any better and it's only G

2764
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:22,840
to I don't know I it's I used to have a

2765
01:49:18,679 --> 01:49:26,118
lot of faith that you know that there

2766
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:28,760
would be people that do it so much for

2767
01:49:26,118 --> 01:49:30,198
the love that they were willing to take

2768
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:32,199
the biggest Financial hit barely make

2769
01:49:30,198 --> 01:49:33,799
any money but produce this most amazing

2770
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:35,598
stuff at the top and then then there

2771
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,279
would people big corporations that would

2772
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:38,719
make the most boof stuff at the bottom

2773
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:41,238
and it would just wipe out the whole

2774
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:43,920
middle but I think it's just everything

2775
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:45,559
is it's just erased to the bottom and I

2776
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:49,319
don't see things getting better and I

2777
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,440
don't see any legislation that is

2778
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:53,279
helping at

2779
01:49:50,439 --> 01:49:55,879
all it's it's sad so yeah to answer that

2780
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:57,319
question I mean spraying packs is that

2781
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:00,639
that's just a natur that's just a

2782
01:49:57,319 --> 01:50:02,840
natural expression of where we're at you

2783
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:05,239
know and it's it's fascinating it's kind

2784
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:08,279
of cool it's it's kind of avant guard it

2785
01:50:05,238 --> 01:50:11,000
people love new stuff you know if

2786
01:50:08,279 --> 01:50:13,279
they're lungs melt or something from I

2787
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,800
just wonder what's in it you know what

2788
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:16,759
and what kind do they use what do they

2789
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,639
use as a carrier like propylene glycol

2790
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:21,840
or something really

2791
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:24,800
gross yeah certainly certainly I I share

2792
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,719
some similar concerns and and and you

2793
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,560
know the race to the bottom sentiment is

2794
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:33,239
is a real concerning one as a super

2795
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:35,719
quick followup do you do you think that

2796
01:50:33,238 --> 01:50:38,319
that rescheduling of things to schedule

2797
01:50:35,719 --> 01:50:41,279
3 made any real difference and and do

2798
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,840
you think that Federal legalization is

2799
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:45,519
is going to make much change because it

2800
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:47,840
seems like it's coming pretty

2801
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,360
quickly yeah I mean with all this

2802
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,199
everybody and the who knows with the

2803
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:52,639
election every all the different

2804
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:54,598
political figures are saying they're

2805
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:57,199
going to do this and that I think they

2806
01:50:54,599 --> 01:50:59,039
should deschedule like just make it back

2807
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:01,118
to a plan again rescheduling it to the

2808
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:03,519
pharmaceutical like kind of level is

2809
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:04,759
going to screw everything up but it's

2810
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:06,440
also you know I try always trying to

2811
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:09,239
find a silver lining it also gives

2812
01:51:06,439 --> 01:51:10,799
everybody that wants to grow a lot more

2813
01:51:09,238 --> 01:51:12,919
freedoms because it's not going to be

2814
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,599
like it it takes it down a few notches

2815
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:18,239
for enforcement like you're not going to

2816
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:21,199
get so shafted at at three as you would

2817
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,598
at schedule one so it kind of gives

2818
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:25,000
everybody a little more freedom to just

2819
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:26,840
go berserk and just grow gon everywhere

2820
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,158
do whatever they want because it's going

2821
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:29,679
to be un it's already kind of

2822
01:51:28,158 --> 01:51:31,319
unenforceable we're re reaching that

2823
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,880
Omega point where so many it's so part

2824
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:34,759
of our society now the cats out of the

2825
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,159
bag it's like taking it to three is

2826
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,599
going to suck it's going to mess up

2827
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:39,158
everything it's going to be so bad for

2828
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:41,279
all the people that spent so much time

2829
01:51:39,158 --> 01:51:42,598
and energy to get to where they're at

2830
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:46,399
but it's also going to give everybody

2831
01:51:42,599 --> 01:51:49,360
more freedom to to just you know who

2832
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:50,839
cares about all the laws just go for it

2833
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:53,719
just do what you

2834
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:55,319
want totally totally totally it feels

2835
01:51:53,719 --> 01:51:57,840
like we're at that point almost you know

2836
01:51:55,319 --> 01:51:59,759
it won't be long before before every

2837
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:02,319
state it's legal and and then I'd really

2838
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:04,360
be interested to seeing what the mass

2839
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:06,078
sort of producers are doing you know

2840
01:52:04,359 --> 01:52:09,559
when the opportunity to be in every

2841
01:52:06,078 --> 01:52:11,238
petrol station is uh is gas station is

2842
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:13,960
is suddenly an option you have to

2843
01:52:11,238 --> 01:52:15,879
imagine there'll be there'll be like

2844
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,920
supply issues at first and then they'll

2845
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:20,199
be making the big facilities and it'll

2846
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,239
be interesting yeah I mean isn't the

2847
01:52:20,198 --> 01:52:25,759
Delta eight market like bigger now than

2848
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:27,839
the than the um the regular Market isn't

2849
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,440
it it's some crazy amount like there and

2850
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,199
there it's because they're it's

2851
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:34,319
everywhere every gas station you can go

2852
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:39,719
to in United it seems like in the whole

2853
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:41,599
country has some kind of fake G

2854
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:44,039
substitute

2855
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:45,480
so I mean they might it just legalized

2856
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:46,880
nature they just just go back it's the

2857
01:52:45,479 --> 01:52:48,479
only way things are going to anything's

2858
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,118
going to happen it's like they it's just

2859
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:51,959
getting weirder and weirder the more

2860
01:52:50,118 --> 01:52:54,399
they do these stupid things and it's

2861
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:58,359
going to get so absurd and dangerous and

2862
01:52:54,399 --> 01:53:00,078
dumb it's just like just re just

2863
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:02,399
legalize the thing it was it's part of

2864
01:53:00,078 --> 01:53:04,439
everybody's life before what Harry

2865
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:08,078
anslinger got

2866
01:53:04,439 --> 01:53:10,479
involved yeah to totally I mean hey on

2867
01:53:08,078 --> 01:53:12,439
on that topic I I know that you know

2868
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:15,319
cannabis isn't isn't the only

2869
01:53:12,439 --> 01:53:17,078
ethnobotanical plant in your life and a

making the oils and blending is kind of

3002
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:41,800
like a combination of music and breeding

3003

song it's a tapestry it's like the

3016
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:15,880

3017
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:17,760
level like you know there's I heard the

3018

3028
01:59:41,719 --> 01:59:45,520
that those are distilled it's different

3029
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:47,199
because of different weather patterns

3030
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:49,560
different soil different people that

3031
01:59:47,198 --> 01:59:51,039
cultivated the plants like it's just

3032
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:52,280
this I don't know I think a

3033
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:54,920
well-prepared

3034
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:58,078
perfume or atar or Galia or whatever you

3035
01:59:54,920 --> 02:00:00,560
want to call it is like a symphony of

3036
01:59:58,078 --> 02:00:04,198
life that's enclosed in time and space

3037
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:06,920
like it's a interactive uh I don't know

3038
02:00:04,198 --> 02:00:09,279
it's like a I can't even explain so yes

3039
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:12,279
to answer that I am super jived I have

3040
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:13,840
about 12 ones that have been aging and I

3041
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:15,759
want to get back into it I mean it's

3042
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:18,360
just you know how I got into UDS really

3043
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:20,239
hardcore and that just that is not a

3044
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:22,479
good hobby for someone on a budget let

3045
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:25,678
me tell you so I I stopped

3046
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:28,678
UDS even though I love UD I think UD is

3047
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:30,319
like the grand wizard uh tpine

3048
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:34,199
experience like if you really think

3049
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:36,639
you're like the TP uh wizard like moving

3050
02:00:34,198 --> 02:00:39,719
into UDS and really experiencing UDS for

3051
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:42,199
all that nature can create smell wise as

3052
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:44,920
like as things volatilize and evaporate

3053
02:00:42,198 --> 02:00:47,399
off and smell that smell Journey like

3054
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:49,960
that oods are one it like that's a you

3055
02:00:47,399 --> 02:00:53,158
know people want a tip on really if they

3056
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:57,800
enjoy scent enjoy smelling to get into

3057
02:00:53,158 --> 02:01:00,799
maybe like not not um age not more like

3058
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:02,760
a new Farm dudes not like the uh um the

3059
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:05,800
older wild dudes which can be too

3060
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:08,639
expensive to initiate but yes to I'm the

3061
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:11,279
landscape of Desire all the smells uh

3062
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:12,480
will be coming out as soon as I can get

3063
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:14,880
enough time to kind of put them on an

3064
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:17,879
Etsy store or make a a

3065
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:20,039
thing um but yeah I love scent and I

3066
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:22,039
love working with this with essential

3067
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:24,078
oils

3068
02:01:22,039 --> 02:01:27,399
I'm I'm excited and I know others are

3069
02:01:24,078 --> 02:01:29,479
too I think uh a fair few of our patreon

3070
02:01:27,399 --> 02:01:31,279
members actually have messaged me and

3071
02:01:29,479 --> 02:01:33,519
they've told me know I got Hive as well

3072
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:35,039
so that's that's uh that's cool to hear

3073
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:36,719
that there's some more on the horizon

3074
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:38,039
and and as's a quick little thank you I

3075
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:40,078
don't know if you can see I've still got

3076
02:01:38,039 --> 02:01:43,118
this bit of Eagle Wood you gave me years

3077
02:01:40,078 --> 02:01:46,479
ago and it's my goto I have it right

3078
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:49,319
here ready to go cuz I I hit it with uh

3079
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:51,479
this little blowtorch and uh I love it

3080
02:01:49,319 --> 02:01:54,519
you know like I've obviously gotten into

3081
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:56,919
UD on your recommendation but even just

3082
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:59,119
you know something like pal Santo or you

3083
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:01,800
know Eagle would like people will love

3084
02:01:59,118 --> 02:02:03,639
it give it a go guys dive in head first

3085
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:04,880
and and while we're on that train of

3086
02:02:03,639 --> 02:02:07,520
thought you know we were sort of talking

3087
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:10,118
about it earlier but just for for more

3088
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,960
specifics like we had a few people who

3089
02:02:10,118 --> 02:02:14,279
were like hey I've gotten into

3090
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:16,480
meditation and more sort of spiritual

3091
02:02:14,279 --> 02:02:19,039
stuff and just increase awareness while

3092
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:21,158
I'm in the garden and I want to I want

3093
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:23,359
to know from bod like what's a strain

3094
02:02:21,158 --> 02:02:25,759
that he feels complements that you know

3095
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:28,479
that maybe is good for meditation or

3096
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,880
yoga or you know in the garden what's

3097
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:32,279
something you

3098
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:34,039
like um you know it's hard because it's

3099
02:02:32,279 --> 02:02:35,840
so individual it's kind of finding it's

3100
02:02:34,039 --> 02:02:37,960
kind of find you know there's like it's

3101
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:41,119
finding that strain that works for you

3102
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:42,800
to to uh be mindful you know because

3103
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:45,158
cannabis kind of enlivens the mind and

3104
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:48,320
you know in meditation you're trying to

3105
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:51,399
kind of tame the mind or at least not

3106
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:53,359
attach to all the all the chatter that's

3107
02:02:51,399 --> 02:02:55,359
going on

3108
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:57,960
so I'm trying to think of

3109
02:02:55,359 --> 02:03:00,238
what it's funny because all the Babas

3110
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,880
smoke and they meditate I I've had

3111
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:03,198
really good experiences smoking and

3112
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:04,639
meditating and then I've had times where

3113
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:07,198
I'm like oh I shouldn't have smoked like

3114
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:07,920
it's just not happening but let me think

3115
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:11,598
I

3116
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:14,158
mean like a that's a hard one it's I

3117
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:16,400
think it just it goes back down to just

3118
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:18,319
try a lot of strains and you know ride

3119
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:19,559
your bike on them hike on them go de

3120
02:03:18,319 --> 02:03:22,840
with your stuff with your kids play

3121
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:25,360
sudco meditate kind of map those strains

3122
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:26,840
in your life that that uh help you in

3123
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:29,399
those instances and then another thing

3124
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:31,760
it's like people with medical conditions

3125
02:03:29,399 --> 02:03:33,198
um map those strains that really help

3126
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,679
you with your medical conditions so you

3127
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:37,039
can share them you know they don't

3128
02:03:34,679 --> 02:03:40,199
always work for everybody but there are

3129
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:41,960
tend to be strains that kind of work

3130
02:03:40,198 --> 02:03:43,678
better for certain conditions you know

3131
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:45,599
like the Sunshine Daydream of mine

3132
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:47,920
always people always tend to say that it

3133
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:50,920
works really good for neurological

3134
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,199
conditions and pain um you know and

3135
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:54,599
there's strains that work for people

3136
02:03:52,198 --> 02:03:56,719
that have kidus it's like I it's hard

3137
02:03:54,599 --> 02:03:58,719
for me to tell you what's going to be

3138
02:03:56,719 --> 02:04:00,679
good for meditation but if you want to

3139
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:03,599
maybe do something historical and more

3140
02:04:00,679 --> 02:04:07,399
of a Heritage base do you know maybe uh

3141
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:09,760
look to some uh hash or hand rubbed or

3142
02:04:07,399 --> 02:04:11,479
stuff from the Himalayas or India places

3143
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:14,119
where they've traditionally smoked and

3144
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:17,678
meditated at the same

3145
02:04:14,118 --> 02:04:20,039
time that's fantastically practical

3146
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:22,800
advice I I love that you know definitely

3147
02:04:20,039 --> 02:04:24,519
you know India is it's uh it makes

3148
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:27,920
perfect sense of course the stuff there

3149
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:37,199
and nearby would complement that sort of

3150
