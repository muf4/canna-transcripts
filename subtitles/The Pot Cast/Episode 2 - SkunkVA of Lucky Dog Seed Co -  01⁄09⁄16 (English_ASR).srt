00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,730
in this episode we're joined by skank VA

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,710
who was kind enough to give us some

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,359
in-depth history on the scene as well as

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,100
a killer account of how he came to

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,899
acquire the ninety one cutting his

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,850
general plans for the future and some

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,058
general thoughts on the scene so without

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,039
further ado I'd like to welcome our next

21
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,058
guest on to the show skunk VA you know

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,079
thanks so much for taking the time to

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:54,599
talk to us today and so before we get

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,609
into it I'm just gonna basically remind

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,070
everyone that for this interview we're

26
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,820
gonna refer to the man chem dog as mass

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,180
G or just G and the strain has chem dog

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,769
or 91 or the VA coding just so we can

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,540
hopefully avoid some confusion because

30
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,789
that's something which comes up a lot

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,189
when talking about this type of stuff

32
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,210
and the other thing I was gonna say is

33
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,559
for this interview I think kind of the

34
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,089
most fitting way to start it would be to

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,769
actually kind of start at the middle and

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,420
then go back to the start just so that

37
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:25,739
people kind of have an understanding of

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,978
where you fit into the whole scene so so

39
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,019
far the story online seems to be what I

40
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:31,759
gather pretty inaccurate but this is how

41
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,099
it goes

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,438
essentially you met mass G online on

43
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,199
overgrown the to use chatted became

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,839
friends use ended up trading clones you

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,049
got the ninety one off him and he got

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,670
the skunk from you or the super skunk

47
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,850
some years later Kim got raided

48
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,978
he lost his clones eventually you guys

49
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,798
met back up and you gave him the ninety

50
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,170
one back and here we are a few years

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,750
later how accurate is that story in

52
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,700
general there's definitely pieces of

53
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,500
that that add up or that are true but

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,368
that's not really the timeline uh I

55
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,539
didn't meet G until 2006 I got the chem

56
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,830
dog in in 1995 a few days before Jerry

57
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,030
Garcia died nog

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,780
in July of 1995 rest in peace Jerry yes

59
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,280
absolutely

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,490
yeah it's a been a big way I'm going to

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,039
see going to Maclaurin Park tomorrow in

62
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,659
San Francisco it's Jerry Garcia day at

63
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,310
the amphitheater that's actually called

64
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,030
Gerry Dorsey amphitheater pretty excited

65
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,860
about it but it

66
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,680
yes rest in peace Gerry and thanks for

67
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,780
everything out there of course but um so

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,680
what happened was I'm just gonna start

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,560
from the beginning

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,439
how I came how I came into the chem dog

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,069
it was you know I'm from Virginia

72
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:50,280
originally and lots of us people lots of

73
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,689
us young folks from Virginia my age we

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,370
ended up on Grateful Dead tour because

75
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:57,109
that's what was going on in America at

76
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,069
the time you know like 1988 1989 1990

77
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,209
seems like every time they passed

78
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,219
through they would take a whole nother

79
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,840
wave of us with them you know and uh and

80
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,949
for some reason when you were on tour

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,509
there was a lot of people from Virginia

82
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,739
I can't really explain it to you but

83
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,039
there was a lot of people from Virginia

84
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,110
for some reason and I found myself

85
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,780
following the Grateful Dead around and

86
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,430
and pretty much left Virginia to do that

87
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,500
and it was kind of a full-time thing for

88
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,879
me and what that means is and of course

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,560
there's not a show every night there's

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,569
not a you know a tour going on

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,489
constantly there's three or four tours a

92
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,620
year and then a bunch of other Jerry

93
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,689
Garcia Band a Grateful Dead shows that

94
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,909
you would I'm Jerry Garcia Band shows

95
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,489
you might catch and those were always

96
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:39,689
centered around San Francisco in the

97
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,489
early 90s and so you know in between

98
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:46,050
tours you would find yourself in the Bay

99
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,489
Area California um you know waiting

100
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,769
around for the next show basically and

101
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,489
and you know one of the ways that we

102
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,780
would kind of put food in our mouths and

103
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,189
you know when when you look at the

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,780
Grateful Dead show is really easy to

105
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,739
make money when he was in the air I mean

106
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,199
anybody who's you know 35 or 40 or older

107
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,090
knows what I'm talking about and but

108
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,030
between shows life could be kind of hard

109
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,650
and you know I found myself in San

110
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,039
Francisco hanging around the Panhandle

111
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,168
Park and back then of course marijuana

112
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,969
was very difficult to find at times

113
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,488
especially in the summertime before

114
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,680
harvest and there just wasn't the type

115
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,889
of endured volume going on you know as

116
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,569
we have today obviously and you know odd

117
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,870
prices could be anywhere

118
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:33,000
you know 400 to 450 dollars for Wade

119
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,740
outs and to get away doubts for that

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,459
price you're you're getting cooked up by

121
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,230
your friend you know so what we would do

122
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,489
is we would get ounces and we would

123
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,200
break him into what we caught hates

124
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,720
which were like two point eight grams

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,569
and get a couple little extra ones out

126
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,360
of there and then basically find

127
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:54,029
customers in the park who were honestly

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,520
80% of those people were ill you know

129
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,109
you could see sometimes it more than

130
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,979
often that there was something going on

131
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,500
with them and that's where they would

132
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,259
come and there was a shady transaction

133
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,879
every time because the you know selling

134
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,680
marijuana was a felony and was we were

135
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,629
just kids in the park it was we were

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,350
like you know fish in a barrel if you

137
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:15,899
know what I mean and basically that's

138
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,300
what was going on so I was down there

139
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,849
and when I was grown from Virginia we

140
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,009
smoked stuff like the Super Skunk it was

141
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,560
called the 86 Super Skunk later on which

142
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,379
was also later called the mask skunk the

143
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,769
mass Super Skunk I'll get to that a

144
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,180
little bit but so we the things that we

145
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:38,639
were growing were a lot of things out of

146
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,650
the super sativa seed bank catalog from

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,539
you know he put I don't know one that

148
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:45,149
started coming out forward but I've got

149
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,620
a few of them digitally archived I'm

150
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,329
really happy about that because they had

151
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,769
the numbers and what they were and that

152
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,079
was the fella who went all around the

153
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:54,269
world and you know bloodied up with

154
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,689
people in the Jewish mountains in

155
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:59,430
Afghanistan or Africa or you know even

156
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,899
the United States and somehow he had

157
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,259
this network of readers all over the

158
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,939
world and I think in Virginia that was

159
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,860
probably one of his seed producers

160
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,350
because you know we always seemed like

161
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,970
we always had like the cream of the crop

162
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,970
of what the stuff was coming out of this

163
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,160
out of this uh catalog and there was

164
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,260
some even for instance the Beatrix

165
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,160
choice which is was always my favorite

166
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,899
before I left my hometown and it was

167
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,270
very brittle it was like the Holy Grail

168
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:30,269
you know it was like oh my god you got a

169
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:32,939
bag of Beatrix choice and even in the

170
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:35,089
catalog I think in the 87 version he

171
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:40,290
actually mentioned central Virginia so

172
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:41,728
but anyway so yeah in between so ninety

173
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,460
like I think you were

174
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:46,978
it was it must have been January of 1993

175
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:50,189
I was in the park and I was kind of

176
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:52,860
always away from the crowd I was kind of

177
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:54,449
a I don't know kind of morph I was I

178
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,830
didn't like doing this kind of thing it

179
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,720
may be very uncomfortable but this is

180
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,300
kind of what we did you know to make it

181
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,759
get a hotel that night get a four space

182
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,228
that night get us some food in our belly

183
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,120
whatever you know just kind of make it

184
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:08,719
to the next day so we can you know be

185
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,370
around when the next show start and

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,020
basically I was sitting on the bench and

187
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,399
this guy comes walking down I'll never

188
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,829
forget this moment it was a big moment

189
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,359
of my life and I knew it at the time but

190
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:21,120
this guy comes walking down the sidewalk

191
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,449
and and he's got this grin on his face

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,370
he's got a ponytail and he comes back

193
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,960
and he's got me locked in his eyes and

194
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,689
comes walking through the Panhandle

195
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,879
walks right up to me I knew I was like

196
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,719
this guy either really really needs a

197
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:41,219
sack of weed or maybe maybe just maybe

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,259

199
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,440

200
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,240
York accent and uh we started talking

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,300
and this guy was like the quintessential

206
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,509
heaviest net New York accent it's kind

207
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,639
of funny and I was like wow and I just

208
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,500
knew so because he had that he had that

209
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,810
look I had growers all over the nation

210
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,399
you know I every where we went you would

211
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,139
look for those familiar faces the guy

212
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,839
you saw somewhere in that area last time

213
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,329
you know a little you know set of shows

214
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,310
four or five or six in Ohio area you see

215
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,810
this guy you know maybe even don't

216
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,509
remember his name but you know his face

217
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,939
and he's always got the kill and when

218
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,979
you were on tour that was really a big

219
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,050
part of your day was you had to make

220
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,759
some money you had to get a ticket for

221
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,079
the show and these are not necessarily

222
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,740
in this order because the ticket always

223
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,778
came first

224
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,060
and you had to find yourself some heads

225
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,889
- and it was the heads - was always the

226
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,119
most challenging part and if you were

227
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,708
like me and he didn't really have your

228
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,730
own ride you had to find a ride to the

229
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:49,828
next show you know he saw anyway so he

230
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,079
we started talking he goes listen man I

231
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:54,778

there in the city at those days but it

279
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,939

280
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,830
the early 90s like this and it was

281
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,570

300
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:22,998

himself up a few joints and we we got

327
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,129
some books and some other things we

328
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,689
found his van and we made a can ice

329
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:20,360
little level spot we started weighing

330
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:22,428
the bugs up and so the thing went well

331
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,438
all day long I just kept running back up

332
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:26,028
and forth down the street and I hope the

333
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:30,019
statute of limitations has run out on

334
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:32,178
that crime but I think this was I think

335
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,709
January I I have our time with this

336
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:35,988
particular Dayton in my own little

337
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:40,278
personal timeline here because but I

338
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:42,199
pretty sure it was January 1993 and so

339
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,739
anyways I made a pocket full of money

340
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:47,808
and a big fat sack of killer and or head

341
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:49,399
stash and this guy really had some of

342
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,918
the best enjoyed I've ever seen so far

343
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,239
am i right and I'd seen quite a bit I

344
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:57,019
was fortunate enough to see quite a bit

345
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:58,879
and he told me he goes man I I'm I'm so

346
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,678
appreciative he was I was very

347
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:05,058
appreciative but he was tenfold

348
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:06,889
appreciative I mean he was like I it was

349
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:08,118
out of proportion how appreciative it

350
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,409
wasn't he kept talking about and I'm

351
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,660
like man it's no problem do you I was

352
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,338
like I'm gonna go sleep it down downtown

353
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,868
and I'm not going out to the marina and

354
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,959
crashing on the floor I'm gonna go get

355
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:22,309
my own damn room the night you know and

356
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,639
so anyway he said listen to me I live

357
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,199
here

358
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,639
because Jerry Garcia pleased the worker

359
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,970
that's the whole reason I move out here

360
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,769
I don't you know California is a dream

361
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,649
to me but I came here to see Jerry

362
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,389
Garcia as much as I can and you know

363
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,129
just in case you Brown doesn't know what

364
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,600
that means like Jerry Garcia at the war

365
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:42,289
field was like church to a Deadhead

366
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,480
that's that's like that's you get you

367
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,279
get as close as possible back then you

368
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,920
know concerts Grateful Dead concerts for

369
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,019
big events you know three days in a

370
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,419
stadium with 90,000 people in it you

371
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,129
know no problem sold-out and probably

372
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,589
another 20,000 people who don't even

373
00:13:55,129 --> 00:14:00,289
have tickets it was a mayhem so to see

374
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,120
Jerry Garcia at a roughly I think I

375
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:03,709
think the war fields like twelve to

376
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,389
sixteen hundred people maybe it's a

377
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,389
pretty small theater it's an old theater

378
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,919
in San Francisco it was a very special

379
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,809
thing you know and playing his music

380
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,209
that he wanted to play us I mean it was

381
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:17,119
amazing and you know he would play on

382
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,610
average there three to six shows of

383
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,259
every month it I think if you average it

384
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,889
out you know so it was a lot you know

385
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:27,830
and they had these tables there and he

386
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,899
said living he goes hey I haven't ate I

387
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,850
get up in the morning at the crack of

388
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,669
dawn at 5:00 a.m. I go down in the

389
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,350
Warfield I sit in line I have a whole

390
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:38,779
group of friends that I know just from

391
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,940
sitting in this line just so I can get

392
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,009

396
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,090
down and I was like sure man

397
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:53,419
and I'm sure there was some shows coming

398
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,730
up and any and so I did I went down

399
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,929
there and sure enough the man he it was

400
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,920
almost like you couldn't wait to see me

401
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:03,349
you know and I get there and that's my

402
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,089
spot you know for for the rest of the

403
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,629
time the Jerry was alive I always went

404
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,580
sat that chair next to him and and it

405
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,259
was it was an amazing experience just

406
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,540
being there because you know this guy

407
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,610
was quite the networker himself as far

408
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:18,319
as growers around the nation and went

409
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,700
you know deadhead just travel well

410
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,870
obviously you know we'd go all over the

411
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,950
place to see the stuff we did still and

412
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,450
growers from all over the country would

413
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,640
come and they would link up with him and

414
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:31,190
come set the table or bring their wares

415
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,110
bring their their ganja you know like

416
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,810
there's their best buds you know and

417
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,490
Steve Parrish

418
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,729
come from behind the stage he was Jerry

419
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,440
Garcia's tecsound guitar man probably

420
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,090
his bouncer or you know every he was

421
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,830
everything to Jerry and the professional

422
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,389
setting you know he was the guy who

423
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,250
wiped down George guitar between

424
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,949
separase and he would come out right

425
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,230
and he would smoke this ramrod came out

426
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,528
a couple times he was visiting to see

427
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:59,278
Jerry show he was a another roadie of

428
00:15:56,528 --> 00:16:02,980
the Grateful Dead and Bob Snodgrass and

429
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,750
Maria Snodgrass would come out also late

430
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,480
there Bob Snodgrass is the guy who

431
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,139
probably blew the very first glass

432
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,430
marijuana pipe you know and this is

433
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:16,120
where I get the time line I look

434
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:18,189
confused because it might it seemed like

435
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,570
back then we were young and I probably I

436
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,210
would imagine everybody feel this way

437
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,520
but back when we were young like a month

438
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,379
or like a season could seem like a year

439
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,850
in your memory as you look back in your

440
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,220
life you know you're like how could that

441
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,019
much stuff happen in my life and that

442
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,879
short period of time as I got older I've

443
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:37,269
always kind of tripped out on that you

444
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:39,100
know yeah and so it wasn't too long

445
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:40,809
after I met him though and like I said

446
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,379
Jerry was always playing there that I

447
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:45,699
asked I asked this guy I said hey yeah

448
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,049
hey man it's okay my friend I'll be

449
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,680

450
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,088

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,440
own discussions you know to me and they

488
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,090
started chit-chatting and the thing

489
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,430
about people from Virginia and I don't

490
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:11,720
know if tonic diligence or yeah I guess

491
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,430
he lived it you don't really need that

492
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,400
he doesn't need to tell you but it's a

493
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,960
harsh place for people who who uh you

494
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,990
know involved with cannabis and they'd

495
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,309
fit any facet smoking anyway I mean it's

496
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,670
you can get yourself in a lot of trouble

497
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,339
there

498
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,160
with the law yes so of course that leads

499
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:30,619
to culture of a lot of quiet you know

500
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,779
reserved you know you gotta watch who

501
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,849
you talk to you've got a really watch

502
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,430
your step and keep your business to

503
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:38,959
yourself if you want to you know even

504
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,279
just grow some head stash for yourself

505
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,930
there and that's how those guys work

506
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,059
they didn't talk about with anybody and

507
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,470
that even the right I knew they smoke

508
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,169
they didn't talk about with me you know

509
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:51,380
meaning and and I was okay okay with

510
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,880
that cuz I understood so I was surprised

511
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,560
that they you know they opened up to

512
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,690
each other and it was cool you know and

513
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,059
you know they came back out for another

514
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,490
set of shows we got to all know each

515
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,440
other over that weekend and uh finally

516
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,809
some of the boys from Virginia said to

517
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,000
me they said hey listen your body from

518
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,710
New York he he asked us stuff about if

519
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,089
we could get him Super Skunk cuttings I

520
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,600
was like oh yeah what did you tell him

521
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:16,129
and he goes uh you know we kind of kind

522
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,689
of didn't really answer we wanted to

523
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,220
talk to you I want you know this guy and

524
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,890
I was like well you know I haven't known

525
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,990
abroad long but he you know I know a lot

526
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,560
about him I know that you know he's an

527
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,450
all right guy and they took my took my I

528
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,919
feel like they went out on a limb

529
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,960
because they took the 20 or one year old

530
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,880
you know advice that hey this guy's okay

531
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,990
man it's okay talk come a little bit and

532
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,880
get to know and exchange phone numbers

533
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,710
and stuff which was a really big deal I

534
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,750
mean today it seems silly to think about

535
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,230
that but it was a really big deal at the

536
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:48,200
time and so they did and uh you know

537
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,680
quick-quick order you know the action

538
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,720
went went went in the process and and

539
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:57,140
what the plan was was he was gonna bring

540
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,509
a couple of cuttings out from Sonoma

541
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,500
County fly them out to New York where

542
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:03,680
he's from

543
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,869
and get a couple of Khem dog cuttings

544
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,370
and he was gonna meet them they were

545
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:10,339
gonna drive up from her genuine some

546
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:13,579
super skunk cutting as a couple and then

547
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:15,230
and then make an exchange and they were

548
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,539
gonna take the chem dog back to Virginia

549
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,309
or I think you know what they could back

550
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,740
I think they were actually going for

551
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,539
this thing he had called the Francine it

552
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,039
was I don't advant see in years it was

553
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:26,659
the only one ever shared it's really

554
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,359
nice it's beautiful like a Northern

555
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,950
Lights kind of thing and they really

556
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,699
liked it that's the one they wanted and

557
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:38,180
when he went back there he got a couple

558
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:43,670
of Khem dog cuttings this is in 1993

559
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:46,130
still it had them in 1993 and and he

560
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,289
took a key went back and got a couple of

561
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,400
Kim dogs local locally from that area

562
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,899
and he was tied into that whole Kim dog

563
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,900
family that was there they used to grow

564
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,050
kim dog and apartments using peters and

565
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,269
had these killer like 10-pound harvest

566
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,220
from just a few lights you know and they

567
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:06,680
would so they would sell the stuff from

568
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,170
Central Park for $800 an ounce and it

569
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,210
was legendary you know what I mean it

570
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,490
was crazy but he was tied in that to

571
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,049
that crowd so somehow he got some come

572
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,210
to out cuttings and then they came up

573
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,480
with Super Skunk a name in exchange and

574
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,759
then in order to kind of pay whoever

575
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,349
helped him out he gave them a Super

576
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,119
Skunk cutting there and then so he

577
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,399
brought back the Kim dog and the Super

578
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,069
Skunk back to the west coast the guy the

579
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,750
New York guy right yeah so that's how he

580
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,569
got out here and that's that was the

581
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,430
trade that that eventually as far as I

582
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,559
know and the way I understand it is

583
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,750
that's where the mask on became the

584
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,629
mascot was that Super Skunk coat cutting

585
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,809
that came up from Virginia right yeah so

586
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,610
and then I don't know all this because I

587
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:51,289
wasn't there for that you know I I know

588
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:53,000
that's what happened because you know I

589
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,940
knew our people grow but I don't know

590
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,710
what happened with super Scott a hundred

591
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,240
percent but I'll definitely have seen

592
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,610
pictures of the master Super Skunk and

593
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,890
without a doubt that's the mask um I

594
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:06,019
mean I'm sorry the Super Skunk the 86

595
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,490
super sativa C Club Super Skunk

596
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:09,289
without a doubt it was the most

597
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,299
distinctive bud because it always had

598
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:14,240
this one little pregnant belly that

599
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,519
would pop off on not all around the bud

600
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,259
only on one side and not necessarily on

601
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:22,099
the side the light was on but only on

602
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:25,099
one side and if you look at its a in

603
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:28,519
that 86 catalog or the 87 one of the two

604
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:30,409
it's very distinct that picture it looks

605
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,150
exactly like the seed that was popped to

606
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,100
where I grew up and it was the same one

607
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,559
that they called the mascot no I saw

608
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:38,119
later on I mean all this stuff you know

609
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,440
I like to say that like you know back

610
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,449
then like of course we didn't really

611
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,460
have cell phones we had sky pagers was

612
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,200
the brand new thing where you could get

613
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,970
a page anywhere in the United States it

614
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,069
was cutting-edge revolutionary you know

615
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,779
what I mean but there was no Facebook

616
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:53,089
there was no Instagram there was no

617
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:56,210
email there's no cell phones obviously I

618
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:57,859
mean it's amazing what the Grateful Dead

619
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,069
did to connect people around the United

620
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:03,109
States and to you know keep these things

621
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:05,359
alive that we're trying to be stamped

622
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:07,009
out by the government at the height of

623
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,479
the drug war the United States and it's

624
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:10,549
just you can't

625
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,940
it can never be like overemphasize like

626
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:17,149
how much that community had a role in

627
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,400
making sure that cannabis kept evolving

628
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,950
through those years those dark years in

629
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,500
the United States you know that was

630
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,150
actually with that sorry I was gonna say

631
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,429
that was gonna be the next question I

632
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,170
was gonna actually ask was you know in

633
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,000
the end of the day how much do you think

634
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,590
the Grateful Dead did influence the

635
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,420
cannabis scene you know like when I look

636
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:36,558
at it I tend to think that if they

637
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,080
weren't around you could almost argue

638
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,879
that you know like none of this would

639
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,439
exist in terms of you know I mean you'd

640
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,540
have your skunk number one and that but

641
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,190
you know in terms of the cam dog and all

642
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,569
the og cush and everything that

643
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,350
delineate it out from it you just

644
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,529
wouldn't exist

645
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:54,289
do you agree I totally agree it's no

646
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:56,359
doubt about it I mean anybody my age or

647
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:59,089
order or even younger a little bit knows

648
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,979
that you know it had there was nothing

649
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,509
going on in America like this I mean

650
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,630
there's nothing wrong I mean the drug

651
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,250
war had a huge when an act like it's

652
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,290
over it's not over but it's definitely

653
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,269
we're on the other side of it now it's

654
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,460
waning now like our side has now made

655
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:14,960
its case that hey man you know you're

656
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,610
destroying people's lives you've taken

657
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,259
people whose family and crushing them

658
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:20,119
and it's just for a plant we're

659
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:22,279
definitely got her we've definitely got

660
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:24,369
America's of attention now about what an

661
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,649
atrocity occurred during those years but

662
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:28,129
you know from from this 1970 from the

663
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,720
early

664
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,250
seven days when this home when they

665
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,170
basically scheduled drugs in the United

666
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,210
States and put cannabis in the schedule

667
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,490
one category meaning it has no medical

668
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,160
value whatsoever and they still work out

669
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:44,089
to that day you know all the way through

670
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,040
until basically until 9/11 I would even

671
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:47,599
say because I think maybe that took a

672
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,359
lot of the resources away from the drug

673
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,219
war I mean it was dark in America it was

674
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,839
hard like you you had to really be

675
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,019
committed to these types of things there

676
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,519
was no you know there was no you didn't

677
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,259
take these things lightly because I mean

678
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,990
if you did you were playing with fire

679
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:04,400
and you know you really could be find

680
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,549
yourself in for a big surprise you know

681
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,410
and there's a wonder there's one saying

682
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,659
you know as far in grateful to Atlanta

683
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:15,200
is that in the land of darkness thought

684
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,330
the the carriage of the with them in the

685
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,100
land of darkness the carriage of light

686
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:20,960
is drawn by the Grateful Dead you know

687
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:24,439
that's kind of what it was like you know

688
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,090
yeah they literally they're mister their

689
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,920
mission from the get-go was to go into

690
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:29,809
the dark [ __ ] corners of the United

691
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,430
States and the world but really United

692
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,500
States because this is this is about it

693
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,900
this this band and this culture was

694
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,490
about America it was about you know

695
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,350
where's the freedom you know like

696
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,789
where's the adventure that we all read

697
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:43,309
about like is it over and we're just

698
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:46,099
we're just spectators of the past you

699
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:47,899
know like it just it was right now and

700
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:50,869
it was happening and it was it was they

701
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,700
took this circus into every dark corner

702
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:54,919
of this country and they found kids like

703
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,069
myself who were just like really this is

704
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,120
it this is your freedom that I've been

705
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:01,039
getting caught about in fourth grade

706
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,049
this is [ __ ] you know like they

707
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,970
really think that you know when I say

708
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:06,799
they I'm not talking about a guy playing

709
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,200
a guitar I'm telling the whole thing I'm

710
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,879
talking about me everybody who was part

711
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,970
of that you know and the movement and

712
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,770
the band of course was atlest and people

713
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,940
who put it all on the line because of

714
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:18,500
what they believed and that's really

715
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,690
what it boiled down to it was never

716
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,910
about money it was never about it was

717
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,590
just about you know I don't really know

718
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,660
what is about it's about just trying to

719
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:28,730
make a more free world where you can be

720
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,250
yourself you know and I think that's I

721
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,750
think that cannabis played it was a big

722
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,720
part of that you know I think that was

723
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,549
just a it was all it was a you know it

724
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,960
was in the background but it was also in

725
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:40,220
the foreground it was a big part of that

726
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,660
you know I mean that's that's where

727
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,009
growers met each other that's where you

728
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,420
learn

729
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:45,129
that's where you met a guy in the park

730
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,930
you know that's how you meet a guy in

731
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,430
the park in San Francisco and you're 21

732
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,480
who's eventually gonna give you the chem

733
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,350
dog that's how it worked

734
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,150
you know yeah and so I'm sorry for

735
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,779
getting sidetracked yeah no it's not a

736
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,810
problem

737
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:00,730
getting back to this story just to

738
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,500
clarify because I think some people may

739
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,509
not have picked up on it when you said

740
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,519
the New York guy that's how he got the

741
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:09,789
Super Skunk that's master you're

742
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,289
referring to right no no no this this

743
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,460
guy I'm gonna leave this guy's name out

744
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:15,490
of it for now because I haven't talked

745
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,750
about you know talk yeah that's no

746
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,519
problem sir I just wanted to clarify for

747
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,930
everyone so yes I knew a friend has got

748
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,460
this super skunk now yeah and so and I

749
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,500
and he like I said he brought one

750
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,660
cutting back to the west coast and he to

751
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,099
hit with him so because that's what you

752
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,840
know he's doing it for and he left one

753
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:34,209
with the people his friends in New York

754
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,740
right yeah and then eventually that got

755
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,240
up to Massachusetts as the story goes

756
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,029
that that eventually got up the

757
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,799
massachusett I think I think G has

758
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:44,500
talked a little bit about that I'm not

759
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,500
sure he could probably tell you more

760
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,150
about like what how did that get from

761
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,130
Staten Island let's go ahead and say

762
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,450
Staten Island up to where he was there I

763
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,000
mean he was tied in with those folks

764
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,309
because their whole thing was the chem

765
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,930
dog so I don't know how he was connected

766
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:01,240
to those because I didn't to those guys

767
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:03,610
I just don't know you know yeah like I

768
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,509
said I've ever met that guy until 2006

769
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:09,789
so I want and then going forward from

770
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:11,379
there so he brings it back and he's like

771
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,319
man you know he starts growing it here

772
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,270
in Northern California and he basically

773
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,799
I'm like look the only thing I ask

774
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:20,650
because every time you harvest sell me

775
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:22,509
all the week and he would sell me these

776
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,130
stuff wears a week not even in a bag and

777
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:26,769
me and my friends would just smoke at

778
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,350
all I was no it was just for us you know

779
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,789
and it was it was amazing it was like I

780
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:32,529
can't believe this have what a great

781
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,379
life I'm smoking my favorite weed the

782
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:36,639
Super Skunk and I'm like you know it's

783
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,620
just too many grew up better than

784
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,590
anybody you know this guy knows what

785
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:43,839
he's doing so anyways yeah so we became

786
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,789
closer friends and then as we got a

787
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,769
little closer he said to me one day good

788
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:50,019

809
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,000

815
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:49,659

she was going to Sonoma State University

819
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,890

822

place up there now this is before Jerry

823
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:10,299

835
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,670
here and he he's like alright that's it

836
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,589
I'll bring it over to you and so they

837
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,870
bring me over my super Scott you know

838
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:40,899
and he brings over the ken-dog and that

839
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:42,909
was it and I already brought over like

840
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,320
with some her niece Edie pop that was

841
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,259
the other thing back then we never ever

842
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:49,299
the one of the things was that the first

843
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:51,549
thing I heard was if you ever find any

844
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:53,019
seeds in your pot from way eat them

845
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,119
don't grow them there will always be

846
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,289
[ __ ] you know of course they'd only

847
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,289
found out that's not necessarily true

848
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:04,750
because he goes through and he does all

849
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,490
that he literally this all happened like

850
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,099
the week before Jerry died he died on

851
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,599
August 9th 1995

852
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:13,629
he brought all the stuff over to me

853
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,129
these plants and and he filed three

854
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,760
showed me what to do and we hit he had

855
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,580
some pretty even today cutting-edge

856
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,140
methods of organic growing you know and

857
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,668
he showed me everything and and the

858
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,070
stuff came out the first one came out

859
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:28,570
just like it's you know there's my

860
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:30,129
precedent he was a good teacher and

861
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:31,928
thought the number one thing you taught

862
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,610
me I'll never forget was don't ever

863
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:35,410
think you know it all always pay

864
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:36,909
attention everyone else's do you know

865
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,470
who's willing to tell you anything no

866
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,900
matter what their skill level is no

867
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,038
matter how long they're doing this

868
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,630
always always try to keep learning

869
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:44,558
because once the minute you think you've

870
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,059
got all figured out

871
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,889
is the minute that when you'll have a

872
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:50,529
problem and you won't have any idea what

873
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:54,788
the big you know yeah there's really

874
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:59,349
good advice and yeah I got the books and

875
00:31:54,788 --> 00:32:00,669
started it out and so he always told me

876
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:02,829
he told me what he gives me the Kim dog

877
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,720
he says alright and you know he never he

878
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:07,058
only it always had like a very small

879
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,710
amount of its he never had like like I

880
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:11,230
said he would sell me a quarter pound of

881
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,450
head stash would all be Super Skunk you

882
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,490
know all the tops the best buds and then

883
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,740
he would any he would like smoke a few

884
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,900
joints and give me an up chem dog that

885
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,640
was always a thing you never had like an

886
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,990
ounce or two of it or whatever you know

887
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,370
and I asked if I was like what's the

888
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,470
deal with them and it's the best one

889
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:28,719
clearly I mean he's a killer you know

890
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,669
all the strains he had he had some

891
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,250
really nice ones this was the best one

892
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,370
and he gave us dude it's it's a [ __ ] to

893
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,558
grow it's so hard to grow it won't root

894
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,538
you know it's thick heavy accident you

895
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,899
know it doesn't yield you can't count on

896
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:44,319
it

897
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:47,230
and I was like whatever man he goes I

898
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,759
was like in in other words he was like

899
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,960
you know really want this when he gave

900
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,308
it to me is like you don't really want

901
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,860
this you can have it but I know you're

902
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:55,058
not gonna be able to do much with it and

903
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:57,250
because I can't really do a whole bunch

904
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,109
with it and it's just it was like that

905
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,880
you know and I was like whatever dude

906
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:05,589
that's the best one that's the one I

907
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,809
want and it gives do me and the first

908
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:09,369
one was a was a crop of Super Skunk all

909
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:10,750
hundred-percent Super Skunk and that

910
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:14,349
little harmony learn that he gave me and

911
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,058
then and then the next one I was gonna

912
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:17,678
you know take a bunch of cuttings off

913
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:20,558
that got this Kim dog mother going

914
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,880
pretty good and he told me he goes hey

915
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:22,898
man I'm telling you right now you know

916
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,969
it's better to stick with this

917
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:26,949
Super Skunk at roots in ten days and you

918
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:29,409
know it's got a quick vid by blah blah

919
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,788
that's like man I'm just gonna give it a

920
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,979
shot you know what's the worst thing out

921
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:34,329
so I took a bunch of cuttings out of it

922
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:37,179
and made sure enough it burned in like

923
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:38,858
14 days and I was like well so far so

924
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:40,839
good so far what he told me is not true

925
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:43,718
and another thing he told me I'll never

926
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:46,178
forget he says the chem dog is for the

927
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:48,820
night he goes and his heavy accent he's

928
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:51,239
like and never smoke in a bubbler before

929
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,239
11 a.m.

930
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:56,858
I just got a smoked joint after joint

931
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:59,528
after joint this is advice to me right

932
00:33:56,858 --> 00:34:01,028
I'm like alright so I probably pulled

933
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:02,618
out a bubbler right then loaded it up

934
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:06,098
and smoked in his probably before 11

935
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:08,980
a.m. I don't know but anyway so and it

936
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:10,179
came out really nice like I did I grew

937
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,769
and it came out really nice and I was

938
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,329
like all right you know the super skunk

939
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:14,949
is definitely a bigger Guilder

940
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:16,778
that was very important to me and you

941
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,628
know so I'll just have a few of these

942
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:21,789
and that's the way it went so the years

943
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:23,108
went by and you know that's the way it

944
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:24,760
wasn't like I said you know we we

945
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:27,009
weren't very connected back in growers

946
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,679
it was it was very sparse and sporadic

947
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,000
and unusual and rare when you would get

948
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,220
a chance to like trade things with

949
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,559
people and of course the other thing he

950
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,778
told me I should say was never ever ever

951
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,629
give this to anybody I'm giving this to

952
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:42,548
you and I shouldn't be you know I'm

953
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:45,219
doing it and as I'm giving this to you

954
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:46,719
I'm violating my French trust me not to

955
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,098
give it to anybody and I'm telling you

956
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,378
don't do that to me

957
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,210
don't ever give this day by and I was

958
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:54,639
like alright yeah no problem you know my

959
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,250
word my word is my honor so yeah I'll do

960
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,309
that and and the years went by

961
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,588
you know kids came and you know life was

962
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:04,329
pretty settled down and you know life

963
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:06,250
was really different when Jerry died and

964
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:09,430
I was a lot of adjustment for people

965
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:12,579
like me and just kept on growing the

966
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:16,838
killer and trying to learn as I was

967
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:20,980
going wrong and then in 2005 fast

968
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:23,199
forward 2005 I looked at a high Times

969
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,298
article a friend recommend he goes you

970
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,098
won't believe this but this guy okay so

971
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:31,420
let me back up a little bit I met a

972
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:33,220
fella on tour who we became French to

973
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,659
the pot you know like talking about this

974
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,169
blood talk about that book showing each

975
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:39,098
other broads would be fine you know

976
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,210
you know kind of sore type things and uh

977
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:42,670
you know he became a good friend of mine

978
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,858
he started talking to me about

979
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,630
coincidentally you know before Jerry

980
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:50,630
died he started talking about this hot

981
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,818
chem dog you know that he would grow

982
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,440
that he that he would smoke when he was

983
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,298
young you know the same kind of way I

984
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,220
talked about the super Scott put up in

985
00:35:56,298 --> 00:36:01,579
New Hampshire and Massachusetts area

986
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:03,169
where he's from and you know it kind of

987
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:04,910
went in one ear I went out there at the

988
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,809
out the other at the time but I

989
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:08,088
definitely remember that

990
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:10,849
well we became really good friends and

991
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:12,469
even better friends after Jerry died and

992
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:18,068
he's actually still really one of my

993
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:21,500
closest friends to this day and and I'll

994
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:23,088
see how it was when I started like when

995
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,858
Jerry died there was a big disconnect

996
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:27,078
like we lost contact with each other

997
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:29,000
like I said we didn't have cell phones

998
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,190
and stuff and for a minute for you know

999
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,539
a year it was like it took a minute to

1000
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,920
get ahold of everybody and find

1001
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:36,199
everybody because there was no events

1002
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,119
going on it was the next thing didn't

1003
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,009
happen so it just took a while and I

1004
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,849
link back up with this fellow who I'm

1005
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,559
talking about

1006
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:47,210
and uh he I had the kim dog now and I

1007
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:49,790
smoked it with him and he's like dude

1008
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,380
this is the [ __ ] chem dog I was like

1009
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:52,880
oh yeah that's right that's right you

1010
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,440
you smoked this when you were young you

1011
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,380
were always told me about your friend G

1012
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,179
and I was because he knew G I guess you

1013
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,180
know I mean I know he did they were

1014
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:04,818
there real close actually you know back

1015
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:06,409
when I guess they met at a Phish show or

1016
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:08,989
something like that you know back in the

1017
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:12,108
early 90s and or late 80s and had become

1018
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:14,118
good friends and so it was kind of cool

1019
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:16,429
as a little connection and and uh you

1020
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,500
know he lived up in Tahoe he moved up to

1021
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:20,779
Tahoe and and I'd go up their business

1022
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,219
snowboarding and bring him dog and you

1023
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,990
know he started a little thing and he

1024
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:25,459
you know I give the kid I gave him to

1025
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:27,439
Kim dogs I'm figuring hey you know that

1026
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,329
guy who cracked the seed cuz he told me

1027
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,579
the story he's like yeah my friend

1028
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,470
cracked this yet he had the 13 or the 12

1029
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,970
whatever the seeds and you know I

1030
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:36,709
started to on this tour and I'm like wow

1031
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:41,078
that's what a coincidence if I actually

1032
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:44,030
ended up with this cutting you know so

1033
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,390
so then I guess gee at one point made

1034
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:49,640
these t-shirts right and he made a Super

1035
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:51,108
Skunk and a chem dog and we're at these

1036
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,239
it was like this light green almost the

1037
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:56,210
color of the chem dog's shirt and had

1038
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,768
that this dog with the joint smoke this

1039
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,329
dog on the back smoking to join this

1040
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:01,759
little emblem he made for chem dog

1041
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:03,680
instead chem dog since 91 and then they

1042
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,809
have Super Skunk and it said Super Skunk

1043
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,548
since 1993 because that's when he got it

1044
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:09,980
you know yeah and they were kinda cool

1045
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:11,449
yeah and so one day I got there to go

1046
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,869
snowboarding my friend gives me this

1047
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:17,028
chem dog shirt and a super scum shirt I

1048
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:18,740
was like wow did you make these he's

1049
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,690
like no my friends G made these back

1050
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:22,129
east and and he sent me a few and I

1051
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,510
think he's like you got to have one I

1052
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,260
was like yeah me I love it

1053
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:30,528
still got to the day you know and so

1054
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,359
that was probably like in 1998 97 when

1055
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:36,260
that was going on and then fast forward

1056
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:39,108
now to 2006 2005 I see this High Times

1057
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,359
article and it's a it's a it interview

1058
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:43,400
of Qi talking about the Kim dog right

1059
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,068
and they had actually gone into his

1060
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,869
garden or and taking pictures of his

1061
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:49,730
plants and they were like in 5-gallon

1062
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,430
like Home Depot bucket type buckets you

1063
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,619
know and and really beautiful plants you

1064
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:57,199
know and they were showing some pictures

1065
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:59,150
of the sister what they said was the Ken

1066
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,538
dog but clearly to me it was not the

1067
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,700
same plant that I had and then and then

1068
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:06,200
some Kim something else I might have

1069
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:08,118
been to Kim D but it was definitely the

1070
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,038
sister the Syst they called it his

1071
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,798
sister I'm sure you've heard of it it it

1072
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:15,049
was it called my yeah it's like I went

1073
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:18,469
to my buddy's sister is um actually the

1074
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:21,768
number I write I think that's it yeah

1075
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:23,298
and I was like I gotta have that so it's

1076
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:24,739
my buddy I was like and they talked they

1077
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:25,969
were they were they were good friends I

1078
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,768
was like dude I just saw this nautic

1079
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:30,500
with your buddy and I was like what do

1080
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:32,358
we got to do I mean what can I do for us

1081
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,608
to go out there and get that cuz you

1082
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,078
know I'm not sure he's even got the chem

1083
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:37,788
dog anymore we could give him the chem

1084
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,160
dog back and then you know maybe he'll

1085
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:41,930
trade and actually I'm sure we'd

1086
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:46,068
probably talked about going to get other

1087
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:48,558
strains before that time but so I I was

1088
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:50,239
having a problem I was uh I was the

1089
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,089
first time I'd ever seen powdery mildew

1090
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,250
right and I was had it on my plants and

1091
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,159
I and I was like what the hell is this

1092
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,989
so I started like kind of searching you

1093
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,568
know now we have computers now and cell

1094
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:03,500
phones and [ __ ] but not like we still

1095
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,269
not like we do today

1096
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,769
I got on the computer and I started like

1097
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,509
kind of trying to find out what I could

1098
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:11,269
find out about it like someone said it's

1099
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,160
called mildew or powder no doer downy

1100
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:16,460
mildew and I started you know trying to

1101
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:19,869
figure this stuff out and it led me to

1102

1180
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,059
sure that we knew who are talking to and

1181
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:16,788
I'm sure he called my friend and made

1182
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:20,239
sure that you know it all lined up and

1183
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:21,619
it did so I took a couple of chem dog

1184
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,028
cuttings in New York put him on the

1185
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:26,690
plane with me and flew him out to New

1186
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:29,869
York and got a place the Soho Suites

1187
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,380
down in Soho and and the night I got

1188
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:32,769
there

1189
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:35,809
biggest snowstorm they've had since like

1190
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:39,318
1953 or 43 or softened it was amazing

1191
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:41,269
and but it did delay our meeting and we

1192
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:44,028
eventually met up and he brought me over

1193
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:45,649
he didn't give me the sister and I'm not

1194
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:47,150
really sure never really got to never

1195
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,639
have still this day never talking about

1196
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,459
that but but he did bring me to CEM deep

1197
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:54,858
you know and then and then to my

1198
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:57,018
surprise and to my joy he actually

1199
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:59,208
brought the Super Skunk which we had

1200
00:43:57,018 --> 00:44:02,118
lost out here we had lost that like in

1201
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:04,278
1997 my buddy was getting a house

1202
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,289
inspection by the landlord and he had

1203
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:07,789
the one mother not my friend from Staten

1204
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:11,920
Island in New York the guy I was talking

1205
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:15,680
about earlier at the work field and he

1206
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,639
he basically had this plan to box and it

1207
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,129
just didn't make it through the

1208
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,608
inspection you know you so we hadn't had

1209
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,949
it in a while

1210
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:23,808
and so he gives that back to me and I

1211
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:26,420
was really happy you know and it was

1212
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:29,089
really cool so I take that back and then

1213
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,860
at this point me and my friend in Tahoe

1214
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:32,659
his our mutual friend

1215
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,870
mutual friend we had our own place and

1216
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:37,699
we were you know we were we grew the Kim

1217
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:40,670
D now we had to Kim D on the west coast

1218
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:44,480
you know it to me it wasn't it wasn't

1219
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:46,340
like it's not really my I don't love the

1220
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,469
Kennedy as much as I think the public

1221
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,630
loves I'm more of a Kim dog guy but uh

1222
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:52,519
but it but nonetheless the Super Skunk

1223
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,890
was back and it was the Super Skunk it

1224
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:57,380
was the same exact cutting definitely at

1225
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:59,239
age cuz the Super Skunk got that seat

1226
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,530
had gotten cracked in 1988 so it's

1227
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,179
actually been around longer than the

1228
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,010
chem dog you know if it's still out

1229
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,629
there I don't have it I don't know

1230
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:09,200
anybody who's got that cutting anymore

1231
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:10,820
per se but I definitely you know this is

1232
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,219
what we're the side story goes off

1233
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,380
because the guy who cracked that seed

1234
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:18,049
that super strong seed in Virginia back

1235
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:22,340
in 98 he's one of my closest friends now

1236
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:24,350
you know and he was well a friend so I

1237
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,630
know it's a really it's a really special

1238
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:29,299
thing to me because that's actually a

1239
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,190
Facebook story you know like a Facebook

1240
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,570
modern-day kind of computer store that

1241
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,010
link back up to him and I'm really

1242
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,309
grateful to have that man back in my

1243
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:40,100
life because he he was he's older than

1244
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:43,070
me you know he's like an elder to me and

1245
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:44,539
I look up to him and it's just really

1246
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:47,090
special but it's like I can't believe

1247
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:49,039
the circles you think you've come you

1248
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,870
know all the circles are all now

1249
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,000
complete and all of a sudden boom one

1250
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,609
day you got this whole other part of

1251
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,699
your past is back in your future back in

1252
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:00,769
your present and especially you know but

1253
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:03,469
yeah but what the reason I was jumping

1254
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:06,170
that's because he actually has not the

1255
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:09,319
Super Skunk but we we now have back the

1256
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:10,940
parent the Super Skunk was that I didn't

1257
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,250
know this until recently but the super

1258
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,110
Scott actually wasn't just a crack from

1259
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,449
Neville seeds from the super city this

1260
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:19,760
evening it was actually cross that he

1261
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:22,639
made with Super Skunk and that he got

1262
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,280
he's actually croc took to Super Skunk

1263
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:28,789
season crossing together so did

1264
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,860
something else it might have been I

1265
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,539
don't know the exact detail I don't want

1266
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,360
to get quoted on that quite yet because

1267
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,710
it was something like that but he has

1268
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,090
one of the parents to that Super Skunk

1269
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,380
which to me is that's awesome you know

1270
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,480
we'll see what we can do with that too

1271
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,099
you know sorry I was gonna say maybe

1272
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,019
we'll get back into that I just want to

1273
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:46,480
go back to the camera

1274
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:49,420
for a second so when you said that um

1275
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,760
you saw immediately the chem sorry

1276
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,610
Master II didn't have the chem dog that

1277
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,630
was what now is referred to as the jobra

1278
00:46:54,610 --> 00:47:02,289
and cutting him I write this this is

1279
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:03,579
this is before now you'd have to ask Jie

1280
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,809
about this but I I'm under the

1281
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:06,940
impression that this would have been

1282
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:08,860
before they went back up I'm not sure

1283
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,150
100% sure about that but it might it

1284
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,920
might have been you know link back up

1285
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:16,420
after their original meeting back at

1286
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:19,269
Deer Creek in 91 yeah yeah it wasn't it

1287
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:21,130
to me it looked like it might have been

1288
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:23,139
Kim D I'm not really sure what it was

1289
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,880
but I can't really remember I'm sure the

1290
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:26,170
High Times article still around but I

1291
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,809
don't remember what it was and it was

1292
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,460
just I just noticed that either there

1293
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:33,369
was a picture that wasn't actually Kim

1294
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,619
dog or also it could have been it was

1295
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:37,179
just conspicuously missing from all

1296
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,699
these photos you know what I mean I

1297
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:42,339
think you might even been that okay

1298
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:45,250
as my memories a little frog cumin I and

1299
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,840
probably actually still have it the

1300
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,800
pictures are beautiful like the sister

1301
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,539
just unbelievably nice you know I was

1302
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,000
gonna say so if we were to compare say

1303
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:58,420
the chem sister and the chem D and the

1304
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,800
chem 4 and the 91 you kind of mentioned

1305
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,460
earlier that the ninety one was your

1306
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,230
favorite

1307
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,920
why do you think it is then for example

1308
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:09,699
that people like JJ and Rose choose to

1309
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,349
work with the D kind of as their you

1310
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:16,419
know to work those lines out over say

1311
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:21,969
the 91 I made a guest from what I can

1312
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:23,650
see is that I think that I mean I'm

1313
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:26,859
going on a limb or saying that maybe

1314
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,840
they didn't have the 91 you know yeah I

1315
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,970
mean I have to say that's probably what

1316
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,970
it was you know or they had that fake

1317
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:35,379
Jill Brandt 91 which you know I knew

1318
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:39,339
even I was even around when that

1319
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:42,760
happened so yeah you know that's my

1320
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,980
guess I don't know I mean I also it may

1321
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,270
be I'm so biased that I have to come up

1322
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,880
with something like that because I can't

1323
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:50,710
understand why I mean I have the Kim D I

1324
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,780
think it's it's guys place in life but

1325
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,929
it's it's so far different than the Kim

1326
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,380
dog it really is you know it's not I to

1327
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:59,929
me it's not even close to this

1328
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,700
same not not just the level of quality

1329
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:03,500
but the same type like in the same

1330
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:05,329
ballpark like comparable even you know

1331
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,460
what I'm saying like it's way different

1332
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:10,759
like that that fuel smell is really

1333
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,309
different on the chem dog 91 compared to

1334
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,780
the Kennedy to me it's just you could

1335
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,759
put totally be in bubbles want to not

1336
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,580
even care about the other and I guess

1337
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,050
what I'm saying is maybe the it's just

1338
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:23,029
the opposite for other people maybe they

1339
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,910
just see a different I understand I met

1340
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,760
people later in life here too lately

1341
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:30,289
like the Instagram and I think he

1342
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,660
mentioned that to me that he likes the

1343
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:34,670
chem dog be better the chem d better

1344
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:38,119
than the chem dog too so I think it's

1345
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:39,740
just I'm so heavily biased about chem

1346
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,119
dog that I love it so much I think that

1347
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:44,000
maybe it's hard for you to understand

1348
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,889
why that would happen you got upset yeah

1349
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,570
so I'm I guess it kind of goes without

1350
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:49,250
saying cuz you kind of alluded that you

1351
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:52,550
weren't fully aware but I guess just to

1352
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:54,889
kind of rule the story straight when G

1353
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,960
did go down from all that res business

1354
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:58,730
were you aware that you were the only

1355
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,889
one with the 91 cutting or it wasn't

1356
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:02,449
until you saw that high Times story and

1357
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:07,879
then it kind of dawned on you that you

1358
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:09,500
were the only one who had it I don't

1359
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,450
think I was the only one with it because

1360
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:15,800
there's like back to the Staten Island

1361
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:18,279
crew I I got to hang out with him one

1362
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:22,730
point in Tahoe when they came to visit

1363
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,440
interesting crowd and they they I think

1364
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:26,750
they had I'm pretty sure they had some

1365
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,519
chem dog and I have no idea what any of

1366
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,739
those guys are up to these days but they

1367
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:31,909
definitely had it so I never really feel

1368
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:33,500
like I was the only one that had the

1369
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:36,230
chem dog during those years you know to

1370
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,719
me yeah and I didn't really know what

1371
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,219
happened to gee like it wasn't like my

1372
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,869
buddy even though he was closely and it

1373
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:43,579
wasn't like he was sitting around give

1374
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:45,619
me the blow-by-blow what's going on that

1375
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:48,170
guy cuz that was our only encounter he

1376
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:50,449
came to my hotel we hung out we traded

1377
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,530
some stories we going if I had to do it

1378
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:52,939
over again we would have had a lot more

1379
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,800
to talk about I just didn't know how

1380
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,829
much how much in common we had with

1381
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,200
people and things and stuff in life but

1382
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:01,699
um but that's all that's all we did we

1383
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,199
did the trade and I came back and

1384
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:05,449
brought the Kennedy and the Super Skunk

1385
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,949
back and and I gave him two really

1386
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:10,000
beautiful cuts of the chem dog you know

1387
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:12,009
and he was just as happy as I was but

1388
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,688
yeah

1389
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:16,398
so that was the only reason I did that

1390
00:51:14,688 --> 00:51:19,068
thing on overgrow though that was the

1391
00:51:16,398 --> 00:51:21,048
only reason is to try to get that trade

1392
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:22,969
just to do it but you know it seemed

1393
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:25,068
like an opportunity for me to get some

1394
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:28,579
other genetics out to the west coast in

1395
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:30,409
my life and I I you know that was the

1396
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:32,269
whole reason I did it to me like I said

1397
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:33,919
I'm kind of an introverted person when

1398
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:35,508
it comes to this stuff I was trying to

1399
00:51:33,918 --> 00:51:37,938
break out of my shell and step into the

1400
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:40,849
right so to say and and to start like an

1401
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:43,158
internet account and like give myself a

1402
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:45,709
name and put pictures of my garden on

1403
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:47,898
the internet that was like insane to me

1404
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:49,759
that was my perspective that was the

1405
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:52,308
most insane thing I could do but it

1406
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:57,019
worked you know and I never really went

1407
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:58,489
back over to overgrow and I was I wasn't

1408
00:51:57,018 --> 00:52:00,108
blown away by the kindy and I still

1409
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:01,548
didn't have the sisters maybe I was kind

1410
00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:04,098
of had a little bad taste in my mouth a

1411
00:52:01,548 --> 00:52:05,929
little bit it was no big deal I think it

1412
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:07,909
was pretty cool how it all happened and

1413
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:09,380
it happened and you know we ended up

1414
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:10,640
having to Kim D on the west coast we

1415
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,709
didn't have that before that was cool

1416
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:16,308
you know it got spread all over the west

1417
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:18,768
coast you know so so that that's what

1418
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:20,298
happened and then and then over girl of

1419
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:22,008
course got shut down I don't know the

1420
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:24,199
details that story but I know every girl

1421
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:25,548
got shut down and I think the government

1422
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:27,229
shut him down and they took their

1423
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:30,349
servers and all this other stuff and so

1424
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:31,638
just compounded my belief that hey you

1425
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,929
need to keep your business your stuff

1426
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:36,039
and certainly don't go to the internet

1427
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:40,309
with it you know yeah so

1428
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:43,009
2012 I had another problem obviously in

1429
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:44,419
my garden I couldn't solve and you know

1430
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:47,478
I had these plants that look like they

1431
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:48,858
were being poisoned with salt water you

1432
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:50,989
know and I'm flushing home and I'm

1433
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:54,078
looking through the see the root balls

1434
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:55,789
with a microscope and you know now I'm

1435
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,439
going back to the internet now it's back

1436
00:52:55,789 --> 00:53:00,739
six years later I'm back on the internet

1437
00:52:57,438 --> 00:53:04,188
and and I I Google like you know

1438
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:05,898
cannabis for them and you know what's

1439

1465
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:08,699
back in my head I'd completely forgot

1466
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,349
about this I mean really like I had not

1467
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:12,118
really thought about this overgrow thing

1468
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:14,849
and years at this point

1469
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,640
hey it's went right into my head and I

1470
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:19,200
started talking this one guy who was

1471
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:21,389
clearly paying attention to the chem

1472
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,828
dog-bite ah you know telling me what he

1473
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:25,199
knew about the story and stuff and he

1474
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:28,140
was repeat and he goes are you skunky

1475
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,298
and I'll say I mean I guess so because I

1476
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:32,368
mean that was that's you know I was on

1477
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:34,710
the overgrown skunk bein it all pop back

1478
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,970
on my head and I was like holy [ __ ] cuz

1479
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,429
it freaked me out when all these people

1480
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:39,989
started texting I was like or you know

1481
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:42,149
messaging me on this thing you know and

1482
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:46,229
and it was kind of it was really funny

1483
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:48,778
was really surreal and so anyways ended

1484
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,789
up that I had broad mites and you know

1485
00:54:48,778 --> 00:54:53,579
had to go through that and learn that

1486
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:54,960
and you know take the brunt on that so I

1487
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,609
could tell everybody else well learn

1488
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,068
about it how to get rid of that [ __ ] so

1489
00:54:56,608 --> 00:55:00,900
and there anyways that's kind of that's

1490
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:03,719
kind of were yeah that's where I met G

1491
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,519
and you know now we're all kind of

1492
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:07,139
getting linked up and it's really cool

1493
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,420
it's a really special thing to be part

1494
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:12,420
of you know it's and uh for me this year

1495
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,059
of the 21st year I've had it the chem

1496
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,519
dog cutting and you know she's been in

1497
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:19,740
my care every single day every single

1498
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,420
one of those days and I ended up giving

1499
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:22,769
I think I counted on my hand I ended up

1500
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,159
giving it over these years I ended up

1501
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:29,038
giving it to five people several of

1502
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:31,078
those people a couple of those people

1503
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,619
more than once a couple of those people

1504
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:37,019
a bunch of times and then a couple of us

1505
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,950
gave it to a once no reason ever gave it

1506
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:41,030
to anybody because

1507
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:43,949
I took that very seriously and I and I I

1508
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:45,450
you know I had friends question our

1509
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:46,798
friendship because I wouldn't give it to

1510
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:48,899
him that time but I

1511
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:50,880
it wasn't anything because I told my

1512
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,670
friend I never worked you know and then

1513
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,068
in the end that are you know that that

1514
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:58,710
seemed kind of silly now so I mean but

1515
00:55:56,068 --> 00:56:00,298
that's that's really how it was I mean I

1516
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:02,639
really felt that way you know I told my

1517

1521
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,809

couple years ago and Kim dog was it was

1523

1535
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,588
I need you to come up and check it out

1536
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:47,099
and go up there and see you know a giant

1537
00:56:43,588 --> 00:56:49,558
forest of giant outdoor 150 outdoor

1538
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,690
plants you know and then after tell them

1539
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,059
said no I'm sorry I mean this isn't the

1540
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:56,280
Sour Diesel what it looks a lot like two

1541
00:56:54,059 --> 00:57:00,210
Sour Diesel but it's definitely not the

1542
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,369
chem dog it and turns out that that was

1543
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:06,809
that that Jobi thing that happened you

1544
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:08,519
know uh my cat hole makes up I I have

1545
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:11,250
the whole details on how that happened

1546
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:14,429
because you know my my good friend was

1547
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:16,949
there and and it was a big mix-up there

1548
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:18,298
and and but I think I'd rather leave

1549
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:20,368
that out of it because I haven't really

1550
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:22,469
talked him see how much he wants people

1551
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:24,720
to know about you know how that happened

1552
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:27,058
stuff like that and yeah whatever so

1553
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,219
I'll just leave that but uh but that's

1554
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:31,890
when that's what as I understand and

1555
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:33,629
according to him and he knows he knows

1556
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:36,690
who he gave it to and what the mix-up

1557
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,220
was and and and he knows how that

1558
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,960
happened and I guess that was that Joe

1559
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:42,659
be cut with chem dog that was out here

1560
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,358
and probably elsewhere too in that two

1561
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:50,879
thousand seven two thousand six or seven

1562
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:51,449
or a tear right there and so put but

1563
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,550
when I'm saying

1564
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:54,960
like so you might you know as someone

1565
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,420
who loves chem dog and you're growing it

1566
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,800
you know trying to get by and life and

1567
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,269
stuff you know you're like hey I've got

1568
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,490
some chem dog would you be interested in

1569
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:04,019
looking at that you know whoever it was

1570
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:05,219
would it eventually got to the point

1571
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:06,509
where people would didn't want look at

1572
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:10,289
it because they had already seen it and

1573
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:12,180
liked it but they never saw it got so

1574
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:14,309
bad sometimes where I would show it to

1575
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:16,289
people you know finally said no this is

1576
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:17,759
chem dog and in their mind they had

1577
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:19,679
already made up their mind about what

1578
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,970
they thought Kim dog was and their

1579
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:22,319
opinion about it and they would just

1580
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:24,779
brush it away and I'm like this is

1581
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,690
killer pot what are you what's wrong

1582
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,820
with you you know so for like four years

1583
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,470
I was the only one who write kim dog you

1584
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,800
know maybe my couple friends you know

1585
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:36,750
and then recently because of the

1586
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,539
internet or or because breeding is

1587
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:41,190
becoming you know a more prevalent thing

1588
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:43,469
in the United States maybe the chem dog

1589
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,750
is making its comeback now and people

1590
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:47,669
are more willing to stop and pay

1591
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:51,449
attention to the deal with the come down

1592
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:53,280
and you know how how what it's it's it's

1593
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:54,989
the backbone of contemporary camp

1594
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,730
cannabis and you know I think in the

1595
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,919
world now I mean I live here in

1596
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:00,630
California and you know it definitely is

1597
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,280
I mean every strain that you see has got

1598
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:06,110
something to do with ken dog at some

1599
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:11,700
point you know and and then you know a

1600
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:14,309
2003 I had a short-lived partnership

1601
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:17,969
with a person and here in Sonoma County

1602
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:19,259
and and this person had Sour Diesel and

1603
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:21,839
this was the first time I'd seen Sour

1604
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,670
Diesel I was like good lord this stuff

1605
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,640
smells familiar you know I mean it had

1606
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:29,010
all my favorites in it come to find out

1607
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,949
most likely you know as the story goes

1608
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:34,050
some point back then one of those guys

1609
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:35,489
in Staten Island somehow I don't know

1610
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:37,050
what happened I mean I've heard so many

1611
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,209
different versions like I said I wasn't

1612
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:41,100
there but somehow someway the Super

1613
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:43,829
Skunk that they got from my front of

1614
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:47,309
Virginia and that Kim dog got tangled up

1615
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:49,199
in a harming fest and and I think that's

1616
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:50,909
how the Sour Diesel came about so I

1617
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,439
thought that was kind of cool I I really

1618
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:55,170
I think that because I mean it clearly

1619
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,940
that's it's not the I mean that's got to

1620
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,920
be the most you know famed

1621
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,380
strain of we don't you know on the

1622
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,800
planet you know yeah sir I was actually

1623
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:05,200
gonna ask you do you ever feel like you

1624
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,970
kind

1625
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,379
don't get any credit where you should

1626
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:09,578
for that because I was gonna say you

1627
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,490
know a lot of people don't realize that

1628
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:13,990
yeah the Sauer D is the 91 getting

1629
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:16,868
thrown a bit of pollen on the Super

1630
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:18,189
Skunk do you feel like you should get

1631
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:19,930
some credit that or do you think you're

1632
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:22,510
kind of too far removed because when I

1633
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:24,489
think about it both of those strains are

1634
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:30,010
very much attributable to yourself in a

1635
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:31,509
lot of ways but I would give I know this

1636
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,740
sounds like some hippy [ __ ] but I would

1637
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,589
give the Grateful Dead credit because

1638
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:38,649
like I said I I just I just introduced

1639
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:39,820
some a couple of my favorite Gro first

1640
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,588
with each other that's literally all I

1641
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,690
did you know I mean they did all the

1642
01:00:41,588 --> 01:00:45,190
hard work they flew out met each other

1643
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,990
you know they did all that stuff so I

1644
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:49,150
don't I'm not I don't really want credit

1645
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:50,519
but and I'm not you know I understand

1646
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:53,289
that there's another story out there

1647
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:55,480
where they went to Amsterdam and got

1648
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:57,190
some Super Skunk so maybe maybe they had

1649
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,380
another Super Skunk who knows you know

1650
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,150
but I definitely know that my my friends

1651
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,088
from New York he he definitely left a

1652
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:06,309
Super Skunk behind with them and and

1653
01:01:03,088 --> 01:01:08,619
like I said I got that cut that they

1654
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:11,409
think that the Sour Diesel when I got

1655
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:14,230
that one the super Scott from and

1656
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:16,480
actually he didn't she knew somehow he

1657
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,068
knew that that was the same cut he

1658
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,380
somehow he was kind of the one that even

1659
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:22,269
told me you know what I mean that yeah

1660
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,280
the super sculpey he was giving me was

1661
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:26,949
the same one that he that he got back

1662
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,900
then which was the same as the mascot he

1663
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:31,659
says to you I'm calling the Super Skunk

1664
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,900
but they call it the mask on cure you

1665
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:36,699
know Sam and then coming home I grew it

1666
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,630
and sure as [ __ ] it was a super Scott no

1667
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:39,578
doubt about it

1668
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:40,869
all the little features were there like

1669
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:43,420
I said that pregnant belly

1670
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:46,059
the smell is unforgettable you know it's

1671
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,010
it's loud like the Sour Diesel it's it's

1672
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:51,068
it's unforgettable I mean it smells just

1673
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:53,079
like stuck on the road from about a

1674
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:56,949
hundred fifty yards you know it's it's

1675
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:58,480
son I'm just unmistakable I don't know

1676
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:59,739
exactly happen out and I don't really

1677
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,480
want any kind of credit for anything

1678
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:03,219
like that but like I said I would give

1679
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,219
Jerry Garcia the Grateful Dead credit

1680
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:07,959
cuz man what a what a what an amazing

1681
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:09,848
connection that is you know but those

1682
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,099
guys made in the Jamaicans trade because

1683
01:02:09,849 --> 01:02:14,019
if they didn't do that and if he didn't

1684
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:16,539
bring the chem dog back I hear my friend

1685
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:17,980
from New York he gave up on the Kim dog

1686
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:19,809
and then I really was

1687
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,699
the only one in my world about it you

1688
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:23,139
know to me yeah and that's why I ended

1689
01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:24,399
up giving other people because I wanted

1690
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:27,159
to make sure I wasn't it's something

1691
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,690
happened to me you know or my place I

1692
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,980
didn't want anything that and I didn't

1693
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:31,510
want that I understood the gravity of

1694
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,789
the situation that this could go away

1695
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:35,470
forever so I always made sure that

1696
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:38,139
someone else had it you know and then

1697
01:02:35,469 --> 01:02:40,118
you know ended up being over the years I

1698
01:02:38,139 --> 01:02:42,460
gave it that I think five people total

1699
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:44,920
and only really one of them ever really

1700
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,720
kept it and he's my my good friend who I

1701
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,260
knew from Tahoe like I'll talk about

1702
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:52,809
earlier you know so yeah I was gonna say

1703
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:56,650
so when we see breeders these days you

1704
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:58,690
know notably we've got a body and also a

1705
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:01,180
swerve of the Kelly con claiming to be

1706
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:03,070
breeding with the skunk VA cutting that

1707
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:04,779
I mean I guess you've kind of already

1708
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,250
alluded to the answer that that they're

1709
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,400
obviously not getting it directly from

1710
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:11,079
you do you think that when people see a

1711
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,150
breeder claiming to be breeding with the

1712
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,730
skunk VA cutting they should kind of

1713
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:17,559
view that with an eye of caution or do

1714
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:21,340
you think it's probably legit just come

1715
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:25,840
through someone through someone well

1716
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:27,250
I'll say this I'll say that you know the

1717
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,690
way I look goes like this because you

1718
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,760
know you could go and you could you

1719
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,800
could get into this tit-for-tat with

1720
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,869
this and it you know it does matter

1721
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,780
you know the truth matters it really

1722
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:40,480
does I truly believe that I believe that

1723
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:42,400
what you say and the truth it you know

1724
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,349
it should line up you know and if your

1725
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,880
story is is that you did some stupid

1726
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:47,819
little shady deal in the back room to

1727
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,950
get the cuts you have or whatever it is

1728
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,660
you know you know that's your story you

1729
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:54,099
know stick you gotta you got to go that

1730
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:55,989
it's gonna come out at some point you

1731
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:58,480
know and and the way I look at it is

1732
01:03:55,989 --> 01:04:01,449
this is that as we go forward I do think

1733
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:04,119
it matters because you know at some

1734
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:05,679
point we're all gonna be completely it I

1735
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:07,210
believe this this is my opinion I

1736
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,679
believe that all of us here in the

1737
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:11,769
United States we're gonna be completely

1738
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:13,569
you know out in the open and you're

1739
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:15,219
gonna have your story you know how did

1740
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:16,750
this happen to you you know why did you

1741
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:19,269
choose to do this why did you choose to

1742
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,889
risk your freedom to do this and then

1743
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:22,630
and then what are the details it is

1744
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:24,519
interesting I mean this is really cool

1745
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,710
stuff I mean it's like prohibition is

1746
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:29,259
ending and it's taken a while for shirt

1747
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:30,639
and vote I got to say back when you know

1748
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,420
I turned on the lights for the first

1749
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:33,819
time

1750
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,920
I didn't I never ever thought we would

1751
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:38,590
get this far so this thing's going

1752
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:42,010
quicker than any of us thought and you

1753
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:43,240
know if your stories of lie then you're

1754
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,950
gonna have to pay you're gonna have to

1755
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:46,359
you're gonna have to deal with that it's

1756
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:48,339
not anything for me to have a big

1757
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,750
opinion about you're gonna have to deal

1758
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,130
with that if that's what's going on in

1759
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,349
your life you know what I mean not you

1760
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,750
of course but whoever does you know I I

1761
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:58,509
kept it above the board you know and and

1762
01:04:55,750 --> 01:05:00,099
like I did my part you know the thing

1763
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:03,640
that people don't realize I think in

1764
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:05,349
this you know world of marijuana growing

1765
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:09,099
consultants that we live in and that's a

1766
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:11,409
joke is that you know like you know we

1767
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:13,299
don't we don't we don't this plants not

1768
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:15,309
doing this for us you know like we're

1769
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,200
not we're not the stars of the show here

1770
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:19,599
you know what I mean we're that we're

1771
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,519
tools our toolbox for the plant the

1772
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,650
plant doesn't have eyes the plant

1773
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:25,269
doesn't have feet for certain you know

1774
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:27,160
the plant it needs protection

1775
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:29,500
and the reason cannabis of my opinion is

1776
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:32,739
evolved so quickly in the last 20 years

1777
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,300
30 years is because you know it's

1778
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:36,429
speaking to people and we're listening

1779
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,280
and we're doing what we're being told

1780
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:41,109
you know we're following the we're

1781
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,790
following what needs to happen to make a

1782
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:45,010
and B happen you know make the thing

1783
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:46,269
happen and the plant thanks us for it

1784
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:48,700
and it gives back to us and that's what

1785
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:50,469
I believe I think that we work for the

1786
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:52,719
plant you know that's that's what I

1787
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:54,819
think i think that the kim dog needed

1788
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:56,289
somebody kim dogs a powerful plant you

1789
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,960
know my friend from new york he used to

1790
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:59,380
tell me I don't know man he used to say

1791
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,269
to me

1792
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,860
I think it's tied into the stars cuz

1793
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:04,480
sometimes he'd have really good luck and

1794
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:07,930
he was just like this guy was skilled he

1795
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,130
made he grew fast and sometimes he

1796
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:10,509
didn't work out with him the kim dog

1797
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,950
just like for me it doesn't work I mean

1798
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,660
sometimes like what happened here you

1799
01:06:11,949 --> 01:06:14,739
know it's not going like it did the last

1800
01:06:13,659 --> 01:06:16,480
time what's going on

1801
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:18,219
it's finicky a little bit you know and

1802
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,679
he used to tell me he used to be

1803
01:06:18,219 --> 01:06:23,409
convinced as a very like you know

1804
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:24,940
mechanically minded like nuts and bolts

1805
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:26,829
kind of guy he was telling me I think

1806
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,240
it's lined up with the Stars and I would

1807
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:30,519
look at like what are you talking about

1808
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,229
because I don't know it's just it's you

1809
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,909
never know it's just gonna I think it

1810
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,769
has a lot do with the star alignments

1811
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:37,539
and and the moons and the cycles of the

1812
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:39,789
you the galaxies and the solar system

1813
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:42,099
and it's affecting the ken-dog and I'd

1814
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:44,480
be like dude you sound like Sean like

1815
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:46,639
you're on drugs man what is American

1816
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,719
but that's kind of how it is though you

1817
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,029
know what I mean it's kind of it's a

1818
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:52,219
very very powerful plant and it's it

1819
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:54,470
found it's safe havens it did you know

1820
01:06:52,219 --> 01:06:59,118
I'll share a little story with you you

1821
01:06:54,469 --> 01:07:01,159
know uh you know like the chem dog right

1822
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,019
so it's it's it's being grown at house a

1823
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:05,449
I'm gonna keep this like non personal

1824
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:08,809
this part it's growing in house a right

1825
01:07:05,449 --> 01:07:10,969
and then you know and then the guy who's

1826
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:13,159
in house a he has like you know he

1827
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:14,689
hasn't seen a lot of his friends for

1828
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:16,339
years or maybe he hasn't seen some key

1829
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:18,349
friends and some years you know like

1830
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,680
life gets busy and then they randomly

1831
01:07:18,349 --> 01:07:23,480
bumped into each other right at like

1832
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:26,089
that one of those cannabis cups the

1833
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:28,250
Emerald cup you know yeah here in Sonoma

1834
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:29,510
County right and they reconnect change

1835
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,070
phone numbers you know phone numbers are

1836
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,240
changing and sometimes you lose connect

1837
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,740
with people especially if they're not on

1838
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,769
social mediums though

1839
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:39,439
and then hey man I don't have the chem

1840
01:07:36,769 --> 01:07:41,659
dog person B says the person a can you

1841
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,400

1842
01:07:41,659 --> 01:07:45,319
know what I mean of course I'm glad you

1843
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,050
asked come on over as soon as you can't

1844
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,880
I have cuttings for you so person

1845
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:52,789
becomes a person days house he gets the

1846
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,579
plant from them super grateful thank you

1847
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:57,230
and then person a gets arrested a week

1848
01:07:55,579 --> 01:07:59,840
later and they kill off his chem dog

1849
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:01,639
plants that's a true story you know I

1850
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,519
mean that's that's magic to me you know

1851
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:06,710
that plant had some sort of like in my

1852
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:08,000
opinion this is some hippie [ __ ] but in

1853
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:09,530
my opinion that plant had some

1854
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,289
forethought of what was getting ready to

1855
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:15,050
happen and somehow someway somehow

1856
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:17,600
cosmically it found itself out of a bad

1857
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,770
situation you know what I mean I mean

1858
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,509
yeah that's a true story

1859
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:23,150
you know that was a recent story that

1860
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:25,670
happened that long ago and I mean you

1861
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:26,988
know so what I'm trying to say is I

1862
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,190
think that you know we should be more

1863
01:08:26,988 --> 01:08:30,019
humble when we talk about our

1864
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:31,639
contributions to this and just remember

1865
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,200
that we're we're just part of the puzzle

1866
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,140
we're just part of the toolbox of this

1867
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:39,048
plants using to a ball because you know

1868
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,759
cannabis and cannabis use is you know

1869
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:42,798
it's it's through the roof I mean

1870
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:45,199
everybody uses cannabis now I think they

1871
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:47,269
got President Obama's kid on phone the

1872
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:50,809
other day smoking a joint it's it's a

1873
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:52,400
big cannabis to me is in the

1874
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:56,000
relationship it has a human's it's

1875
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:57,358
symbiotic it's it's uh you know we live

1876
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,520
in a stressful world we're pull

1877
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:03,900
yourselves we've got we're bombarded

1878
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,730
with negative news and bad media and

1879
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:07,229
just you know it's just a weird world we

1880
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:08,759
live it's not I love it here the let

1881
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:10,408
think planet Earth is an amazing place

1882
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:12,600
but we got our challenges here and it's

1883
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:14,638
stressful yeah of course stressful just

1884
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,489
put food table I think that cannabis

1885
01:09:14,639 --> 01:09:19,859
really truly helps people get through

1886
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:21,868
that make it okay and beyond now we're

1887
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,909
now we're doing cancer research with it

1888
01:09:21,868 --> 01:09:25,139
and you know they're doing research and

1889
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:27,269
Alzheimer's all the things and I think

1890
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:30,270
that it's a big part of our evolution

1891
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:32,759
and in the end as we look back in

1892
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,799
history for many years from now say 30

1893
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:38,009
40 50 years we're gonna I think

1894
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:41,880
society's gonna recognize that that this

1895
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:43,859
plant you know evolved quickly at the

1896
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,810
right time for us so that it become a

1897
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:47,190
useful tool for us in the world that

1898
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:48,420
we're creating for ourselves if that

1899
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:51,298
makes any sense you know what I mean

1900
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,940
yeah it's the people who the people who

1901
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:55,800
are doing the things say me and gee you

1902
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,779
know meeting the guy in the parking lot

1903
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,279
that's some Grateful Dead [ __ ] right

1904
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:01,500
that's what I'm talking about meeting a

1905
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,729
guy in a parking lot and you know 25

1906
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,319
years later we're sitting here talking

1907
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:06,599
about chem dog you know what I mean it's

1908
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:10,019
amazing you know but I think the plant

1909
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,880
is the the motivator and all that and a

1910
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:14,100
you know it's like any symbiotic

1911
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,469
relationship in nature in the universe

1912
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,900
is you know one organism needs the other

1913
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:21,389
so it does what it needs to help that

1914
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:25,079
organism that organism benefits from

1915
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:27,000
that aid so it returns the favor back to

1916
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:28,800
the you know in this sense the caretaker

1917
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,960
the other organism and it just keeps

1918
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,929
going round and round and then in that

1919
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,510
process and it's an evolution of two

1920
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:38,279
organisms becoming better beings because

1921
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:41,100
of that relationship and I think that's

1922
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:44,158
what our you know but to answer your

1923
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,600
question you know I I don't I I don't

1924
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,599
know those guys have never met those

1925
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,460
people before you know I don't I don't

1926
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,840
know what their motive is I don't know

1927
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,980
what they're doing but I do know that at

1928
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,539
the end of the day when we're all

1929
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:55,198
sitting around the table and this war is

1930
01:10:54,539 --> 01:10:57,149
finally over

1931
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:58,469
raaah gonna have stories and some of

1932
01:10:57,149 --> 01:11:00,299
them are gonna be a lot more interesting

1933
01:10:58,469 --> 01:11:01,770
than others so I can tell you about that

1934
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,310
you know what I mean yeah

1935
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:07,710
so the ninety one is cutting over the 21

1936
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:09,420
years you've had it do you think kind of

1937
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,739
on that same theme of evolution we're

1938
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,250
just talking about do you think it's

1939
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:13,169
fair

1940
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:16,050
typically kind of changed at all like I

1941
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:18,659
guess kind of when you took it back to G

1942
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:20,489
D was it just like he just instantly

1943
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:22,349
recognized it or do you think it's

1944
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:24,210
trying to kind of change just a little

1945
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:25,800
bit over the years you'd had it and when

1946
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:27,689
you took it back like he knew it was the

1947
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,949
91 but it was just a little different

1948
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:32,699
when he had it what do you think it was

1949
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:34,590
the same I think that I think that I

1950
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:36,479
would agree that there's definitely been

1951
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:38,250
some jeneggener it over the years a

1952
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:42,109
little bit there are definitely some

1953
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:46,710
traits that have waned the drug traits

1954
01:11:42,109 --> 01:11:48,420
as as as Duke would call them I like

1955
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:50,039
that I like that phrase I could stick

1956
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,020
with it but the drug traits have not

1957
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:56,430
changed that they're as strong as

1958
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:59,550
everywhere the the the flavor trait is

1959
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:05,190
definitely taken back a step over the

1960
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:06,600
time it has now sometimes I've noticed

1961
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:08,219
I'd done because like I said there was

1962
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,490
other cuttings out there and they are

1963
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:12,150
one by one every now and again I don't

1964
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:14,519
know how many there were

1965
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:15,629
clearly there wasn't very many but every

1966
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,370
now and again you'll see something

1967
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:19,560
you're like that's the Kim dog and then

1968
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:21,750
you'll smoke it you go that does not

1969
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,850
taste like the chem dog you know like

1970
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,020
the one I got you know what I smoked so

1971
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:26,100
I don't know how that works I don't

1972
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,300
really know how that works I'm actually

1973
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,750
it's something I'm really interested in

1974
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:33,150
right now is is is is what we can do

1975
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:35,789
about that to slow that process down or

1976
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:37,139
even hopefully repair that process and

1977
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:39,600
you know I'm working on that right now

1978
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:42,930
but I did some digging around on your

1979
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,090
Instagram and it was approximately 63

1980
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:46,380
weeks ago someone asked you were you

1981
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,539
gonna release the chem Doge to the

1982
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:51,000
public in seed form and your reply was

1983
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:54,119
I'm working on it you want to tell us a

1984
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,100
little more about that well yeah sure I

1985
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:58,470
you know I got a company it's called

1986
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,980
Lucky Dog seed company and uh you know

1987
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:03,630
I'm in the process of basically what I'm

1988
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:06,929
doing is I'm developing a mail that I

1989
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:09,060
feel represents the kim dog and that i

1990
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:11,150
can breed with and makes make hybrids

1991
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:14,100
with and and then every now and again

1992
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:17,279
release some some backcrosses with

1993
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,960
itself you know and i'm pretty I've

1994
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,269
gotten I have had a lot of luck with it

1995
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,770
and I've gotten I think you know project

1996
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,940
like that could if you really do it I

1997
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,989
think most breeders would tell you that

1998
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:27,419
could take ten years

1999
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:29,578
to get that exactly right and lots of

2000
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,710
testing and the thing about testing but

2001
01:13:29,578 --> 01:13:33,328
all that I've learned because this is

2002
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:35,698
new to me this I haven't really done a

2003
01:13:33,328 --> 01:13:38,248
lot of reading before it but it's it's

2004
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:43,649
going really well I really enjoy and I

2005
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:46,828
had a little like kindness come back to

2006
01:13:43,649 --> 01:13:48,689
me in seed form from some things that I

2007
01:13:46,828 --> 01:13:50,969
did in the past I gave it I gave the cut

2008
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:53,669
to someone many years ago I'm just a

2009
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:55,170
wimp it was a it was so I when I said

2010
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,519
only one person ever gave they were they

2011
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:59,639
I got a backup that would be two people

2012
01:13:56,519 --> 01:14:01,260
cuz he definitely he was breeding and he

2013
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:04,139
was talking to me about breeding and he

2014
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:06,570
was like blah oh my it's like 2004 I

2015
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:09,239
think and I gave him a car the chem dog

2016
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:11,729
and then Sears it

2017
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:13,558
two years ago we ran back into each

2018
01:14:11,729 --> 01:14:15,868
other we lost contact and he actually

2019
01:14:13,559 --> 01:14:18,809
gave me some seeds that he worked with

2020
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:20,399
that cut of chem dog I gave him and had

2021
01:14:18,809 --> 01:14:21,869
some good success with it he gave me

2022
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,359
some stuff back that I could get going

2023
01:14:21,868 --> 01:14:26,549
with and it actually it actually was uh

2024
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:28,139
was really helpful it got me gave me a

2025
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:30,900
good head start on what I was trying to

2026
01:14:28,139 --> 01:14:32,420
do and so it was kind of cool to me it

2027
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:35,129
was really it was kind of cool cuz I

2028
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,719
never expected that like it was just I

2029
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:38,969
knew he was gonna do something good with

2030
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,130
it I gave it to him and then you know a

2031
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:43,319
bunch of handful of ten ten years later

2032
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:45,868
he gives them back some seeds back to me

2033
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:49,469
and it's really it's turning out to be

2034
01:14:45,868 --> 01:14:52,920
something so uh yeah I don't want to put

2035
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:55,920
anything out there that I don't 140% you

2036
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:58,380
know stand behind and and but I feel

2037
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,248
like I feel like by the beginning of

2038
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,170
this next year we're gonna have

2039
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:03,059
something going here no we also we don't

2040
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:04,649
wanna just have two or three things I

2041
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:06,989
want to have a nice meal that I can make

2042
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:08,998
a bunch of hybrids with with so my

2043
01:15:06,988 --> 01:15:11,129
favorite strains and then you know give

2044
01:15:08,998 --> 01:15:11,939
that to the public and yeah so that's

2045
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:14,130
where that's at

2046
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:15,388
yeah also that was actually kind of

2047
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:17,400
leading into the next question I was

2048
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:20,038
gonna say it's kind of a two-parter so I

2049
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:22,888
noticed you had those seeds which were I

2050
01:15:20,038 --> 01:15:26,099
think you said you used a silverback og

2051
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:28,769
male if we think about res dogs work and

2052
01:15:26,099 --> 01:15:31,170
JJ's work they use the Hindu Kush and

2053
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:33,510
the Afghani respectively what do you

2054
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:35,038
think is the ideal male to compliment

2055
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,900
the chem one because the thing which

2056
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:37,738
stood out to me is that I know that JJ

2057
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,899
and rez

2058
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:41,908
is the chem D but there was still kind

2059
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:43,828
of that commonality within the Afghan

2060
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:46,259
land race they decided to use for the

2061
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:48,808
mail do you kind of agree with that or

2062
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:52,619
do you think maybe the more cameo cheese

2063
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:54,449
is a better suited mail for this well I

2064
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:58,170
think that's the same thing because I

2065
01:15:54,448 --> 01:16:00,479
look at that I would agree with that and

2066
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:03,118
I feel like I'm doing the same thing in

2067
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:06,748
the sense that the in my opinion the og

2068
01:16:03,118 --> 01:16:08,670
pushes is uh there's an Afghan occur

2069
01:16:06,748 --> 01:16:11,219
type of strain just like the Kim dog is

2070
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:15,859
it's a clearly I think it's a high

2071
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:19,019
elevation cooler nights lot more used to

2072
01:16:15,859 --> 01:16:21,799
withstand like a lot more UV light than

2073
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:23,519
a lot of the lower land strains would be

2074
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,219
something that grew at a high elevation

2075
01:16:23,519 --> 01:16:27,510
you know the very bright Sun was a lot

2076
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:29,099
less protection making its own

2077
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:30,599
protection I think that's where those

2078
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:32,880
Afghan ACCA's strands that's where they

2079
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:35,900
get that glossy dark green leaf I think

2080
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,889
it's uh I think it's protection on the

2081
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:40,618
natural environment that they came from

2082
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:42,809
where they were exposed to extremely

2083
01:16:40,618 --> 01:16:45,299
we're not hot days definitely not hot

2084
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:47,670
days and certainly some cool nights but

2085
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:51,690
also some very intense sunlight you know

2086
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:52,078
yeah so I would say that I agree with

2087
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:54,178
that

2088
01:16:52,078 --> 01:16:55,558
and but I think that oh gee cush falls

2089
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:58,618
into that category I feel like it's

2090
01:16:55,559 --> 01:17:01,440
clearly an Afghan ik you know cush

2091
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:02,998
strength and uh so I think that that's a

2092
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:06,419
good place to start and that is kind of

2093
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:09,988
what I'm doing I'm working I took the

2094
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:11,788
back cross og cross og cush back cross

2095
01:17:09,988 --> 01:17:13,229
that I've been working on it and now

2096
01:17:11,788 --> 01:17:15,899
that's what I'm working on developing

2097
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:18,718
this male with you know so like I said

2098
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:19,799
just released uh well I'll just name

2099
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,109
this dream

2100
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:26,519
it's called kim crush with a k and it's

2101
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:29,429
it's a nice marriage of OG cushion Kim

2102
01:17:26,519 --> 01:17:31,230
what heavy heavy chem flavor and smell

2103
01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:34,230
to it you know a very chunk it's

2104
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:35,578
beautiful pot and it's got that gloss on

2105
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:38,368
the on the families that I was looking

2106
01:17:35,578 --> 01:17:40,319
for and and everything and and and to

2107
01:17:38,368 --> 01:17:43,439
back up a little bit it's actually the

2108
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:45,960
silver back of OG you're talking about

2109
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,788
the silver camp that's from our icy

2110
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,979
collective here in the oak Oakland and

2111
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:51,238
the Bay Area that's a plant that that's

2112
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:51,630
a strain to develop that's actually a

2113
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:55,888
femine

2114
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:58,469
seed that was a chem dog feminized cross

2115
01:17:55,889 --> 01:18:00,889
with a silverback og which I've never

2116
01:17:58,469 --> 01:18:03,960
seen I've never seen the silverback og I

2117
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:06,270
think that's what that's silver silver

2118
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,880
chem is it's a it's a it's just a one

2119
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:12,090
single plant from some feminized seeds

2120
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,789
my friend made I see collective yeah

2121
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:16,829
okay and so if you did I get this mail

2122
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:18,658
what would be some of the other clone

2123
01:18:16,829 --> 01:18:20,189
Owen leaves you'd want to made it with

2124
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:21,629
like what are some of your favorite

2125
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:27,829
clonal is we kind of haven't talked

2126
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:34,409
about that's a good question right there

2127
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:36,988
well it's not very it's not very I don't

2128
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:39,988
have a lot of favorites you know like I

2129
01:18:36,988 --> 01:18:41,459
really only smoke chem dog I smoked my

2130
01:18:39,988 --> 01:18:42,658
new one is my favorite one the chem

2131
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:45,420
crushes turned that's what I've been

2132
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:48,000
smoking all summer it's my favorite one

2133
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,609
but after that it's chem dog and then

2134
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,960
you know I'm going to experiment with

2135
01:18:50,609 --> 01:18:54,299
cross and with some of these feminized

2136
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,698
seeds like taking some like for this

2137
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:58,139
instance the silver cam and then there's

2138
01:18:56,698 --> 01:19:00,059
another one called the chem Scout I'm

2139
01:18:58,139 --> 01:19:01,440
definitely going to try that but I'm

2140
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:03,060
gonna be really rich or a bit cautious

2141
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,579
with that you know cuz I want out I'm

2142
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:08,090
gonna be worried about Hermes although I

2143
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:10,408
don't see any harm ease on those plants

2144
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:11,639
I'm learning as I'm going here and I

2145
01:19:10,408 --> 01:19:14,129
understand that the community is

2146
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:17,190
concerned about you know feminized seeds

2147
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:22,079
in that regard you know so but that and

2148
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:23,729
then you know the ultimate goal really

2149
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:25,710
is to get the back cross the Kevin dog

2150
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:27,209
back cross in the sim form that's really

2151
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:29,539
what I'm shooting for so I can release

2152
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:34,469
that to the public and say this for sure

2153
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:36,029
100% in my is Kim dog you know whatever

2154
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:39,000
it ends up being a back cross blah blah

2155
01:19:36,029 --> 01:19:41,698
blah and this came from a chem dog 90

2156
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,469
wanna cut for sure you can guarantee it

2157
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:45,388
there's no question mark about there's

2158
01:19:43,469 --> 01:19:46,800
no weird story behind where you're gonna

2159
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:48,480
find out later on they don't have that

2160
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,340
that's exactly what is I think that's

2161
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,169
what the public is would like to have

2162
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,270
and I and I think certainly by the time

2163
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:56,940
I get this thing where I want it to be

2164
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:59,790
that's gonna be the demand I think so

2165
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:01,829
that's you know to to name off a bunch

2166
01:19:59,789 --> 01:20:03,060
of strains I have a bunch but I don't

2167
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:04,769
really know where I'm gonna go with that

2168
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,160
so I can't really tell you yet you know

2169
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:08,580
what I mean

2170
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:10,680
yeah no problem and so um kind of the

2171
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:12,510
inspiration to start all of this did

2172
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,789
that kind of get lit up when you kind of

2173
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:17,610
notice that um some of the older people

2174
01:20:14,789 --> 01:20:18,810
from the overgrown forums for example

2175
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:20,670
we're getting more active in the same

2176
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:23,490
like for example we've seen Oregon kid

2177
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:25,829
and mr. Sol they're both getting things

2178
01:20:23,489 --> 01:20:27,719
slash have gotten things back underway

2179
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:29,729
was that kind of a bit of a catalyst for

2180
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,310
you to think iock now is the time for me

2181
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:35,729
to get my head in the seed game

2182
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:37,140
absolutely yeah i it's it's it's it's

2183
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:39,959
interesting to me like the the

2184
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:42,720
possibilities are endless and I I see

2185
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,430
that it kind of clicked with me and you

2186
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,930
know I just feel like that it's it's

2187
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:48,390
just the next step for me it's something

2188
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:50,220
that I can contribute back and and

2189
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:55,530
that's what I want to do you know and

2190
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:57,720
and I feel like I've you know I can I've

2191
01:20:55,529 --> 01:21:01,609
got the growing of cannabis down I can

2192
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:04,110
it's it's it's like a machine you know

2193
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:05,189
there's not much more I can do to tweak

2194
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,719
it I mean of course there's always gonna

2195
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:08,789
be some new things that come along new

2196
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,289
technologies I would guess and things

2197
01:21:08,789 --> 01:21:11,760
like that but it's there's really not

2198
01:21:10,289 --> 01:21:13,859
much room for me to grow in that area

2199
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,750
I'm getting what I want from that and

2200
01:21:13,859 --> 01:21:17,219
and I just want to take it to the next

2201
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:20,520
step and see what I can do you know I've

2202
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:22,980
got the tools and like I said you know I

2203
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,020
have to you know a bunch of years after

2204
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:27,449
two decades of doing this I I can see

2205
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:31,080
when this is leading me in a direction

2206
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:33,960
you know ya know and I've gotten I've

2207
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:35,760
gotten the signs that that's where this

2208
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,069
is going and I'm just kind of going with

2209
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,440
the flow I feel like I feel like

2210
01:21:38,069 --> 01:21:42,119
genetics when I was a kid in the early

2211
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:43,439
eighties I feel like genetics the

2212
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:44,849
old-school genetics I feel like they

2213
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,739
were in some ways a lot better than what

2214
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:48,329
we had these days and I don't know if

2215
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:50,880
that's perception necessarily but it

2216
01:21:48,329 --> 01:21:52,829
definitely is my perception and I don't

2217
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,440
know that's all it is but I would like

2218
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:56,789
to get things more isolated again and

2219
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,819
that's that's for my more my

2220
01:21:56,789 --> 01:22:02,239
contribution to do it to be is to get

2221
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:05,449
things more isolated so that you know

2222
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:08,189
you know when people in you know

2223
01:22:05,449 --> 01:22:10,949
whatever people in the next state that

2224
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:12,539
legalizes wants to grow their six plants

2225
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:14,220
or whatever their big brother allows

2226
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:17,399
them to grow I want them to be able to

2227
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:18,449
like not have to spend 20 years or ten

2228
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,859
years or five years

2229
01:22:18,448 --> 01:22:21,419
trying to find what they're looking for

2230
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:22,768
you know they should be able to get what

2231
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,569
they want you know they should be they

2232
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:26,039
they know what they like they like og

2233
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:27,389
cush they would they want to get that

2234
01:22:26,038 --> 01:22:29,158
they like that flavor they know what

2235
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:31,440
they're looking for you know and so I

2236
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:32,759
want to get that I want to I would like

2237
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:34,319
to try to get that to the point where

2238
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,449
we're isolating things back you know I

2239
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:38,189
want to get those skunks back those

2240
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:39,569
skunk smells back there I think they're

2241
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:41,998
missing I don't think that we're really

2242
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:43,859
there's big notes when I feel like

2243
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,998
someone shows me what they are talking

2244
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:47,279
about skunk and I'm using this

2245
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:48,719
countenance example because I think that

2246
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:50,809
we all when we were young I think that

2247
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,248
was all you know our favorite we do we

2248
01:22:50,809 --> 01:22:56,029
kind buds that we fell in love with you

2249
01:22:53,248 --> 01:22:58,260
know and but I don't smell that

2250
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:59,639
specifically anymore when I smell when

2251
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:01,708
I'm out in the world checking total

2252
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:05,699
plants out beautiful pot not saying it's

2253
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:07,229
not great strange super high THC and

2254
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:08,788
those things are great but I also think

2255
01:23:07,229 --> 01:23:10,440
we need to isolate those flavors and

2256
01:23:08,788 --> 01:23:11,788
those smells back out so we don't lose

2257
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:14,098
them forever and they're still in there

2258
01:23:11,788 --> 01:23:15,448
they're in there and it's if you work

2259
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:16,860
hard enough I think and if you go

2260
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:18,958
through enough of it I think you can

2261
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:21,179
isolate and a lot of luck of work I

2262
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:22,979
think that you can isolate those traits

2263
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:25,050
back and we can we can reintroduce them

2264
01:23:22,979 --> 01:23:26,639
back to the population and and if people

2265
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:28,079
want to get a muddy back up again that's

2266
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,609
their that's their business they can do

2267
01:23:28,078 --> 01:23:32,399
that but you know I think that somewhere

2268
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:34,649
it needs to be you know in other words

2269
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:37,589
like taking those memories I have of

2270
01:23:34,649 --> 01:23:39,779
that mouth-watering cannabis that I

2271
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:41,279
haven't seen in a while not to say like

2272
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:43,529
I said that we don't have a lot of great

2273
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:46,139
things these days because man people are

2274
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:47,670
making some amazing things I've seen but

2275
01:23:46,139 --> 01:23:50,130
getting those things and I slid in the

2276
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:51,538
back to where you know we can kind of

2277
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,159
reset the button and start over and

2278
01:23:51,538 --> 01:23:55,859
start working them again and see what we

2279
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:57,958
can do when we're not you know hiding in

2280
01:23:55,859 --> 01:24:00,868
our basements you know from from the Big

2281
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:01,979
Brother you know what I mean and and at

2282
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:04,198
each other even you know what I mean

2283
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:06,030
yeah that makes sense but that's that's

2284
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:07,649
kind of my vision that's kind of my goal

2285
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:10,259
that's what I want to do and that's that

2286
01:24:07,649 --> 01:24:12,359
I hope and that's what I can my next

2287
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,849
step can be in this kindness in this in

2288
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:17,069
this process you know yeah well I mean

2289
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:19,139
as someone from Australia who's in that

2290
01:24:17,069 --> 01:24:20,788
position of where Big Brother is kind of

2291
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:23,038
looking at the possibility of letting us

2292
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:24,658
do some things it's it's definitely

2293
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:26,728
great to be able to have people like you

2294
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:27,958
who are looking to kind of get things

2295
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:30,630
back to kind of their true breeding

2296
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:32,399
forms in that same kind of idea of how

2297
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:34,739
things were better in the pie

2298
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:36,539
if we go back to kind of the the Super

2299
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:39,719
Skunk and where it originated from the

2300
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:42,810
SSC do you think that like breeding was

2301
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:44,760
so much better back then that like the

2302
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:46,980
the clone that is now that it was the

2303
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:48,900
Super Skunk that was just kind of a

2304
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:50,789
common occurrence like if you got a

2305
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:52,199
couple packs of SSC you would likely

2306
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:54,000
find something that good or do you think

2307
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:56,609
it was like a one-in-a-million thing

2308
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,140
because these days to get a clone only

2309
01:24:56,609 --> 01:25:00,989
it's considered like one in a million

2310
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:02,610
but back in the day people talk of SSC

2311
01:25:00,989 --> 01:25:09,539
for example as though like it was just a

2312
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:12,359
common thing well yeah I do I think that

2313
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:15,029
well I what my take on it is is that

2314
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,619
when the man traveled around the world

2315
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:19,500
and he collected all this stuff for our

2316
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:22,140
enjoyment to to make his business and to

2317
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:24,899
break that catwalk I think what he what

2318
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:29,280
he was finding was what evolution you

2319
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:31,710
know God knows the way I'd kind of the

2320
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:34,439
way I look at would helps me kind of put

2321
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:37,920
it in a visual pictures imagine going to

2322
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,979
Afghanistan right and and during by the

2323
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,100
way not to mention during the U at the

2324
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:47,849
Soviet invasion and teaming and you know

2325
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:49,350
kind of befriended like you know guys

2326
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:52,380
who are hiding in a mountain or like

2327
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:54,390
their life is war and their families are

2328
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,449
producing hash and cannabis to survive

2329
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:58,800
right and they are doing breeding their

2330
01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:00,300
breeding up there they're making seeds

2331
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,860
for every year just like farmers have

2332
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:03,840
been doing for thousands of years and

2333
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:05,099
somehow this man you know befriends

2334
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,250
these people to a point where he takes

2335
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:09,780
into their village to their homes and to

2336
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:12,600
their stash spot and they've given

2337
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:17,759
things to take out into the world I mean

2338
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:21,840
so I think that maybe just by default I

2339
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,489
think that the people that were you know

2340
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,840
we're all these original land race

2341
01:26:23,489 --> 01:26:26,670
strains or whatever you want to call my

2342
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,380
think that the people who were

2343
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:30,600
caretaking informed for god knows how

2344
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:32,550
long their families have been taking

2345
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,960
care of him for 100 years maybe who

2346
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,880
knows you know for as long as you can

2347
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,649
imagine I mean I went to Ireland want

2348
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:39,510
someone to the Guinness Factory and you

2349
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:42,210
know they showed us the vase we'll take

2350
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:45,210
that I'm sorry the safe where they keep

2351
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:45,998
their 30 string and it's the same thing

2352
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:48,130
it's the same

2353
01:26:45,998 --> 01:26:49,899
we got a starter and they have the same

2354
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:52,179
one going back to the beginning of the

2355
01:26:49,899 --> 01:26:54,339
Guinness brewery or to the last fire or

2356
01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:56,498
whatever and they keep it under

2357
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:58,719
safekeeping you know and it's don't

2358
01:26:56,498 --> 01:27:00,099
their business and their you know people

2359
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,948
all over the world drink Guinness beer

2360
01:27:00,099 --> 01:27:04,538
for whatever it's worth and it all comes

2361
01:27:02,948 --> 01:27:06,879
from that strain of yeast that they have

2362
01:27:04,538 --> 01:27:08,768
there at their at their facility so I

2363
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,328
feel like I look at that the cannabis

2364
01:27:08,769 --> 01:27:14,019
went through the same thing it just

2365
01:27:10,328 --> 01:27:16,118
didn't have the benefits of of safes in

2366
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:19,719
Dublin Ireland it had the benefits of

2367
01:27:16,118 --> 01:27:21,549
you know maybe arm you know dudes not

2368
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:24,069
Afghanistan who you know we're trying to

2369
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:25,900
keep their families fed and do something

2370
01:27:24,069 --> 01:27:27,578
that their fathers or mothers showed

2371
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:30,009
them and grandfathers and others showed

2372
01:27:27,578 --> 01:27:31,929
them so I think that breeding had been

2373
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:35,079
done it was just done differently wasn't

2374
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:36,788
like on this fast-paced thing like

2375
01:27:35,078 --> 01:27:38,738
trying on everything you can and hope

2376
01:27:36,788 --> 01:27:40,538
now you catch the right thing

2377
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:43,808
that were kind of caught up now it was

2378
01:27:40,538 --> 01:27:45,998
more of like you know this this village

2379
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:47,288
and family was isolated from this family

2380
01:27:45,998 --> 01:27:49,929
in the Lord so maybe they just never

2381
01:27:47,288 --> 01:27:51,399
crossed their strains they just did the

2382
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:53,380
families were working on their own thing

2383
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:56,348
you know maybe they had products that

2384
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:57,460
their own that whatever whoever powered

2385
01:27:56,349 --> 01:28:00,069
was working with her or consumed

2386
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:01,510
themselves or selling it more likely and

2387
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:03,308
making hash with it and selling it more

2388
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,719
likely you know they were looking for

2389
01:28:03,309 --> 01:28:06,489
traits and so they were breeding you

2390
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:10,090
know just like humans have learned how

2391
01:28:06,488 --> 01:28:12,998
to do for years so and I think that when

2392
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:15,849
the world got smaller and everything got

2393
01:28:12,998 --> 01:28:17,618
moved around you know I think we did

2394
01:28:15,849 --> 01:28:19,179
what we would normally do we would try

2395
01:28:17,618 --> 01:28:20,380
to take two of our favorite things and

2396
01:28:19,179 --> 01:28:23,199
cross them together and make something

2397
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:25,840
better and the results have been you

2398
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:28,138
know they've been kind of hit or miss a

2399
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:32,590
lot of myths you know so I think that

2400
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:35,559
you know when we when I was young and

2401
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:38,050
throughout my life you know I've smelled

2402
01:28:35,559 --> 01:28:39,519
cannabis tasted cannabis and there's

2403
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:41,498
traits that I fell in love with and

2404
01:28:39,519 --> 01:28:43,119
that's imprinted in my head it's in

2405
01:28:41,498 --> 01:28:47,828
praying and my brain just like every

2406
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:50,139
other you know pot head and you know I'm

2407
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:51,939
I have those those things in there when

2408
01:28:50,139 --> 01:28:54,279
I come across like I talked about the

2409
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:56,799
Beatrix choice earlier I actually that

2410
01:28:54,279 --> 01:28:59,018
friend that I'd befriended that I ran

2411
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,900
back into in life lately he actually

2412
01:28:59,019 --> 01:29:02,390
gave that back to

2413
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:04,789
and so I just took it down for the first

2414
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:07,789
time and I'm trying to now I'm going

2415
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:09,380
through files in my memory from 1992 was

2416
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:11,810
the last time I smoked that stuff you

2417
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:13,760
know I got a sack of it as I was going

2418
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:15,800
up to Buffalo New York to this summer

2419
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,329
tour and it was the last sack of it I

2420
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,070
ever got was my favorite my favorite

2421
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:21,710
weed when I was a kid growing up in

2422
01:29:19,069 --> 01:29:23,779
Virginia and now I'm just sitting there

2423
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:26,239
going is it it I'm smelling it I'm

2424
01:29:23,779 --> 01:29:29,119
looking at it and it's got like a heavy

2425
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:32,269
grape like artificial grape bubble gum

2426
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:35,359
flavor to it which I love that excuse me

2427
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:37,550
that uh just makes my mouth water I love

2428
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:39,170
it you know having smoked the exes it's

2429
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:40,909
drying right now but I'm smelling and

2430
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:42,949
I'm like I sure [ __ ] smoked great

2431
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:44,659
bubblegum in here I sure [ __ ] you know

2432
01:29:42,949 --> 01:29:46,429
it doesn't look like it to me but my

2433
01:29:44,659 --> 01:29:49,609
memory of what it looked like I just

2434
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:50,930
don't have a very you know developed

2435
01:29:49,609 --> 01:29:52,880
memory that I have a more developed

2436
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:54,890
memory of the flavor of it so I'm really

2437
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,659
excited I can't wait to smoke it you

2438
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:58,250
know what I mean so yeah that's kind of

2439
01:29:56,659 --> 01:30:00,170
an example I'm talking about it's taking

2440
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:02,659
those those memories of those traits

2441
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:03,949
where I formed the opinion that yeah

2442
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:07,399
that was better than what we got today

2443
01:30:03,949 --> 01:30:08,750
and trying to like recreate that you

2444
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:09,829
know just based off a memory because

2445
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:12,739
that's what that's all I got

2446
01:30:09,829 --> 01:30:14,359
you know that's yeah I don't know if

2447
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:15,979
it's gonna work out I guess the world I

2448
01:30:14,359 --> 01:30:17,809
mean you you have to tell me in me out

2449
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:20,299
on that we'll see I hope so

2450
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:23,390
so far so good don't worry I'm keen to

2451
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:25,579
go out so be sure to let you know so did

2452
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:33,380
you ever happen to have any run-ins with

2453
01:30:25,579 --> 01:30:34,579
the infamous roadkill skunk well Duke do

2454
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:39,619
we call him Duke is that what we like to

2455
01:30:34,579 --> 01:30:42,559
call ya he's been talking about the

2456
01:30:39,619 --> 01:30:44,779
roadkill skunk and I never heard anyone

2457
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,850
call anything particular gone Virginia

2458
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:48,559
the roadkill skunk now we had like skunk

2459
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:50,930
number one and then we had what what

2460
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,930
they called the basic five if I recall

2461
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:56,210
that was the heaviest gunk one the super

2462
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:59,659
skunk and then we had Northern Lights

2463
01:30:56,210 --> 01:31:01,369
which the Northern Lights to me if I had

2464
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:03,319
to say the Kemp like people compared the

2465
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:05,779
chem dog to the og cush that and other

2466
01:31:03,319 --> 01:31:07,519
and ways and say they must be related I

2467
01:31:05,779 --> 01:31:09,409
don't really feel that way I don't feel

2468
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,420
like I see I don't get the impression

2469
01:31:09,409 --> 01:31:13,260
there's a direct relationship between it

2470
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:15,630
too

2471
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:17,970
my buddy swears to God that the og cush

2472
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:19,890
came from a bag of might like a bag

2473
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:21,270
seeped out of one of my units years ago

2474
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:22,860
and I laugh out of murders you might

2475
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,840
hear that but I don't I just don't I

2476
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:26,579
don't really feel that that they're that

2477
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,319
connected but there's Northern Lights

2478
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:31,529
that I used to smoke that came out from

2479
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,939
the catalog I want to say Northern

2480
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:34,139
Lights number five but I don't really

2481
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:36,089
know if that's what it was we just

2482
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:37,980
called it Northern Lights it had that

2483
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:42,210
same color as the chem dog and it's had

2484
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:44,309
that loud like molecule penetrating you

2485
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:46,529
smell that the chem dog has so whenever

2486
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:49,289
when I when I first smoked the Kim dog I

2487
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:51,149
immediately that memory of that Northern

2488
01:31:49,289 --> 01:31:54,869
Lights popped up you know that we used

2489
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:55,349
to smoke and so you know had that same

2490
01:31:54,869 --> 01:31:56,760
color

2491
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:58,980
I don't even where else going with that

2492
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:01,170
but what was your question again I'm

2493
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:04,889
sorry did you ever get to run across the

2494
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:07,140
road kill skunk no no I never actually

2495
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:09,600
ran anything called roadkill skunk in my

2496
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:13,050
life I have they do kind of turn me on

2497
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,760
to that that term and he talks much

2498
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:17,550
about it and he's told me a lot about it

2499
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:19,140
you know and for the skunk's when I was

2500
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:21,270
a kid that super skunk was at the very

2501
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,310
top of the list mainly because you had

2502
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:25,290
more exposure to it and then right after

2503
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:26,850
that if you were lucky this the basic

2504
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:29,220
skunk or there are the skunk five I

2505
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:31,440
think is what they caught it and and

2506
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:33,600
then there was a skunk number one which

2507
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:35,460
was similar to this basic five or

2508
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,020
whatever but those were pretty much the

2509
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:40,670
skunk strains when I was that I've been

2510
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:43,410
it's that I've been around exposed to

2511
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:45,810
yeah no worries so if we keep with that

2512
01:32:43,409 --> 01:32:47,189
same theme of like kind of comparing

2513
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:50,130
some of the older strange to some of the

2514
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:52,019
new ones on your Instagram there was a

2515
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:53,699
nice frosty looking photo of some Girl

2516
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:56,760
Scout cookies but one of the hashtags

2517
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:58,470
you use was hash tag yarn is this kind

2518
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,390
of a bit of a reference to how you feel

2519
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:02,579
about some of the new strains versus the

2520
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:05,730
older ones do they stand up or the old

2521
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:07,979
ones just crush them I think that I

2522
01:33:05,729 --> 01:33:10,169
think that I don't understand how the

2523
01:33:07,979 --> 01:33:14,009
Girl Scout cookie got so popular I

2524
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:15,659
really know it to me I think I've peaked

2525
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:18,659
it I've grown it and I've peaked it out

2526
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:21,750
you know and my friend at IC collect if

2527
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:23,039
he made the the Kim Scout which it got

2528
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,270
really popular really quick especially

2529
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:25,800
here in the Bay Area

2530
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:26,920
he won a couple of it and stuff like

2531
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,300
that

2532
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:30,550
I like that one better of course it has

2533
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:32,260
chem dog in it but it's really really

2534
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:35,590
much more similar to the Girl Scout with

2535
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:37,510
just a lot more just I want to say a lot

2536
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:40,810
he's got a couple more notes of odor to

2537
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:42,730
it and flavor too I just I just never

2538
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:44,650
was impressed with that and I'm like I

2539
01:33:42,729 --> 01:33:45,909
think you I'm sure you know it's like

2540
01:33:44,649 --> 01:33:48,699
when I hit the streets here in

2541
01:33:45,909 --> 01:33:50,800
California just was like wow you know

2542
01:33:48,699 --> 01:33:52,989
like you know you were selling units

2543
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:55,600
someone would could be so units like I'm

2544
01:33:52,989 --> 01:33:59,019
a wholesale market for say in California

2545
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,789
they were getting like 22 to 26 but they

2546
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:03,340
at there was a period a couple years ago

2547
01:34:00,789 --> 01:34:06,909
for two years even where the Girl Scout

2548
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:08,829
was on that same market going for 35 and

2549
01:34:06,909 --> 01:34:11,109
I was like wow I can't wait to see this

2550
01:34:08,829 --> 01:34:12,609
stuff finally a great stream let's see

2551
01:34:11,109 --> 01:34:14,829
it you know because people show you

2552
01:34:12,609 --> 01:34:16,029
streams you know and you're like wow

2553
01:34:14,829 --> 01:34:17,649
it's real nice and then you pull out of

2554
01:34:16,029 --> 01:34:19,479
the psychic m'dog and they're like holy

2555
01:34:17,649 --> 01:34:22,239
[ __ ] you know they're like wow that's

2556
01:34:19,479 --> 01:34:24,639
like ten times better than this earth

2557
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:27,039
it's just so much better it's like you

2558
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,750
know so I couldn't wait to see it and I

2559
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:30,819
gotta be honest I was disappointed with

2560
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:32,260
it it's not it's not my it's not that I

2561
01:34:30,819 --> 01:34:34,059
don't think it's good I understand it's

2562
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,739
good I actually think it's great for the

2563
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:38,020
daytime if you guys you know business

2564
01:34:35,739 --> 01:34:41,079
meetings or whatever people do in a day

2565
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:42,520
time but i think that uh i don't where's

2566
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:44,470
the taste where's the smell I don't

2567
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,820
really get it you know I'm missing

2568
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:49,060
something there you know I feel like

2569
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:52,479
I've made up traits to justify keeping

2570
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:53,950
in my life you know and that's that's

2571
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:55,809
not what I'm going for that's a great

2572
01:34:53,949 --> 01:34:57,369
great example you know but yeah that's

2573
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:59,800
exactly what there was it's like

2574
01:34:57,369 --> 01:35:02,739
whatever you know I don't get it you

2575
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:05,500
know it's not but everyone's got their

2576
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:06,609
own I respect and understand and clearly

2577
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,890
seeing that everyone's got their own

2578
01:35:06,609 --> 01:35:10,929
opinions about these things and blue

2579
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:12,250
dream it's another one so I I mean I'm

2580
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:14,590
not gonna smoke that you know what I

2581
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:16,449
mean I got I got so much space in my

2582
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:18,699
lungs for smoke in my lifetime here

2583
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:20,559
however long I get to be here and I'm

2584
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:21,670
not gonna waste it on weed it doesn't

2585
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,160
have a good taste to it you know I mean

2586
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:26,380
just half and I smoke weed is the flavor

2587
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:29,409
I love the flavor that's really the main

2588
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:31,210
thing I get out of it you know yeah yeah

2589
01:35:29,409 --> 01:35:34,359
I can completely agree with that so I

2590
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:36,640
guess just to be fair what would you say

2591
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:38,079
are some of the downsides of the 91 then

2592
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,850
like we've already brought up that she's

2593
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,869
you know she's inconsistent and things

2594
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:42,610
like

2595
01:35:40,869 --> 01:35:44,229
one thing that's commonly brought up is

2596
01:35:42,609 --> 01:35:46,779
she heard you know because a lot of

2597
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:48,789
famous strains are born from that how

2598
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:50,259
easy she'd actually heard me she like

2599
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:51,550
any other strain where like you do need

2600
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:57,640
to actually stress her she quite

2601
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:59,079
temperamental I would say that like I

2602
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,960
said the first time I grew it was in

2603
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:05,920
1995 I think I think the first bit I

2604
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:09,250
smoked was the first first week in June

2605
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,170
the first week in January of 96 and I

2606
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:12,670
found a seed in there and it was there

2607
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:14,529
was no seed in the Super Skunk but there

2608
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:16,690
was a seed in the UH and the chem dog

2609
01:36:14,529 --> 01:36:19,899
and I'm when I say a seat I'm saying

2610
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:22,210
like there was like one or two or three

2611
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:23,649
it was very and it was shocking because

2612
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:25,000
I was learning at the town I was like oh

2613
01:36:23,649 --> 01:36:27,159
my god what did I do wrong

2614
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,840
I explained to me everything about how

2615
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:31,449
her bees happened you know everything we

2616
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:33,520
knew at the time and I went through my

2617
01:36:31,449 --> 01:36:34,899
whole process - I got a lay leak in here

2618
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,060
I mean what's going on do I have enough

2619
01:36:34,899 --> 01:36:40,389
air flows or really choking in you know

2620
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:42,400
what's going on and it just I think I

2621
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:46,150
had I think I had seeds in every single

2622
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:48,819
and I'm saying like say you had five

2623
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:50,799
pounds of weed you'd find five seeds you

2624
01:36:48,819 --> 01:36:52,299
know very very and then every now and

2625
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,909
again you would see one bud that would

2626
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:57,909
have just be I would say full seeds but

2627
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:59,619
relatively speaking you know ten seeds

2628
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:01,119
and bud and you're like holy [ __ ] what

2629
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:02,409
happened here and then you start you

2630
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,670
know going through the whole thing and

2631
01:37:02,409 --> 01:37:04,599
see where else there and then you never

2632
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:09,369
find another one

2633
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:12,220
so I usually don't ever see the males

2634
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:13,390
the the her me flowers I it's very rare

2635
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,730
that I actually see the her me flowers

2636
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:16,840
it's usually I see a seed which I'm

2637
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:19,299
assuming there must have been a flower

2638
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:21,369
at some point but I've tried to go

2639
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,720
through and see if I could find them to

2640
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:24,489
pick them off and I've certainly found

2641
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,650
them in like dried flowers I've

2642
01:37:24,489 --> 01:37:29,050
definitely a few times I've found them

2643
01:37:26,649 --> 01:37:30,549
in there but it must happen real quick

2644
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:32,380
and they must go away real quick as it's

2645
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:35,619
really hard to see it happen you know

2646
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:38,289
I've scoured them but uh the down points

2647
01:37:35,619 --> 01:37:40,329
on the chem dog you know I mean you

2648
01:37:38,289 --> 01:37:42,579
could get that don't know it depends you

2649
01:37:40,329 --> 01:37:44,890
know like you know if you get up in the

2650
01:37:42,579 --> 01:37:46,569
morning and you smoke em dog rosin or

2651
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:50,110
dabs all day you know you're gonna

2652
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:51,399
you're gonna have it's it's need to

2653
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:52,659
personally that's kind of hard you know

2654
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:53,529
what I mean like they had to have a life

2655
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:56,439
and do that

2656
01:37:53,529 --> 01:37:58,449
that's really strong it's medicine and

2657
01:37:56,439 --> 01:38:01,479
I've had lots of patients telling me

2658
01:37:58,449 --> 01:38:03,309
that it you know people consume cannabis

2659
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:05,079
because they wanna the wasting away

2660
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,580
syndrome or they're having a heart you

2661
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,630
know just or stressful or they're having

2662
01:38:06,579 --> 01:38:09,220
you know a lot of people in they get

2663
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:10,480
stressed up they can't eat they lose

2664
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:12,579
their appetite and they you know

2665
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,169
cannabis helps with that I've had lots

2666
01:38:12,579 --> 01:38:17,079
of patients over the years telling me

2667
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:20,050
that not only did this Kym dog help with

2668
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:21,970
their appetite but they really felt that

2669
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:23,529
it changed their metabolism and that

2670
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:26,199
they were able to put more weight on

2671
01:38:23,529 --> 01:38:27,670
without eating much more food you know

2672
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:30,039
what I mean that their body's metabolism

2673
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:34,420
changed where it actually was converting

2674
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:37,000
energy to you know to store so you know

2675
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:38,800
I don't know that I don't say it's a

2676
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,239
negative but that's it that's that's not

2677
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,730
recreational you know when you move

2678
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:44,079
people are you know seem a little heavy

2679
01:38:42,729 --> 01:38:49,629
on the front because they're smoking too

2680
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:51,279
much chem dog but yeah as far as the

2681
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:53,920
traits of the plant itself or the buds

2682
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:58,989
go she looks like a [ __ ] to trim I'm

2683
01:38:53,920 --> 01:39:01,029
just gonna say that it you know if you

2684
01:38:58,989 --> 01:39:03,029
get it right it's the worst thing I

2685
01:39:01,029 --> 01:39:05,979
don't like is the foxtail thing it's

2686
01:39:03,029 --> 01:39:08,019
doing that more the last few years than

2687
01:39:05,979 --> 01:39:09,309
it used to do it used to be more rounded

2688
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:10,660
than what I write so you have one of

2689
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:12,880
those rounded buds I try to get a

2690
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:14,170
picture of it you know cuz it's tough

2691
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,909
for some reason to get them like that

2692
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:17,380
I'm like I always think I figure out

2693
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:19,180
what I can do to make it so they're

2694
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:22,900
consistently all that rounded top which

2695
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:24,430
is just a lovely you know visually it's

2696
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:29,170
just lovely when it turns out like that

2697
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:31,180
but I say that like you know I've got it

2698
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:32,920
down to the point where you know they're

2699
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:35,409
minimal but I don't like that you know

2700
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,239
and I wish that the one thing I've

2701
01:39:35,409 --> 01:39:40,899
noticed with the chem dog is that what

2702
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:42,399
it's always done is that the it has this

2703
01:39:40,899 --> 01:39:45,129
funny thing like people will tell you oh

2704
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:46,899
the chem dogs died day 79 you can let it

2705
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:48,730
go further in fact when my friend gave

2706
01:39:46,899 --> 01:39:50,799
it to me he told me that you can let it

2707
01:39:48,729 --> 01:39:53,949
go forever but you can't you gotta take

2708
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,970
it at some time so take it at day 63 and

2709
01:39:53,949 --> 01:39:56,470
that seemed like a pretty reasonable

2710
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:58,420
thing to me it's like okay yeah that

2711
01:39:56,470 --> 01:40:00,699
makes sense this plant can keep on

2712
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:02,710
getting butter the peak no one really

2713
01:40:00,699 --> 01:40:03,909
knows where the peak is well you know

2714
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:06,489
now we know what the peak is because we

2715
01:40:03,909 --> 01:40:07,090
can test it but it turns out the peak is

2716
01:40:06,489 --> 01:40:09,010
ways

2717
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:12,220
sooner way sooner as far as the THC

2718
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:15,250
levels and oh the the white hairs you

2719
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:19,449
know like so what the Kindle do is it'll

2720
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:21,579
look perfect on day 48 right it'll look

2721
01:40:19,449 --> 01:40:23,409
perfect picture-perfect but obviously

2722
01:40:21,579 --> 01:40:25,809
that's not you know that's not you you

2723
01:40:23,409 --> 01:40:27,159
could take that and you got what 19% Tia

2724
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:29,289
who knows I mean you're not gonna take

2725
01:40:27,159 --> 01:40:32,439
it right yeah so you're trying to get a

2726
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:34,269
little closer to the peak and you keep

2727
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:35,799
going and then after day 48 it does a

2728
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:38,320
little Fox daily and then it puts out a

2729
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:40,270
whole new set of white hairs right and I

2730
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:41,679
don't like that I bugged me that's the

2731
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:43,900
one thing I don't like about the Kindle

2732
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:45,460
you really bugs me because you know I

2733
01:40:43,899 --> 01:40:47,199
would have a lot more pictures to share

2734
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:50,170
the Kim dog I just can never get happy

2735
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:52,630
with them because well cuz I'm weird and

2736
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:54,250
I'm like you know I don't know I'm just

2737
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:56,500
kind of weird about I want to look look

2738
01:40:54,250 --> 01:41:00,069
perfect you know yeah you're perfect

2739
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:03,399
I mean you know you know I'm a control

2740
01:41:00,069 --> 01:41:05,109
freak for sure I think I think every

2741
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:06,279
grower is a control freak event or

2742
01:41:05,109 --> 01:41:09,339
they're doing anyway because that's what

2743
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:11,139
we're doing and but but yeah I don't

2744
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:12,940
like that because it did visually it's

2745
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:16,180
hard but by the end of the whole thing I

2746
01:41:12,939 --> 01:41:17,649
mean and you dry it you curate I mean

2747
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:19,990
there's nothing like it I don't I don't

2748
01:41:17,649 --> 01:41:21,489
have I I personally haven't smoked

2749
01:41:19,989 --> 01:41:23,769
anything better than the chem dog or

2750
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:24,519
stronger has a better flavor as she

2751
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:26,320
stands today

2752
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:30,700
you know that's my opinion but that's

2753
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:32,380
the way I feel and you know the other

2754
01:41:30,699 --> 01:41:34,630
thing is like it's much harder to get

2755
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:36,970
the giant chunk nugs than it used to be

2756
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:40,750
certainly can do it you know certainly

2757
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:41,770
can do it I just got to point 12 I don't

2758
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:43,930
know if I'm allowed to say this but I

2759
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:45,670
just got to point 12 pounds per a

2760
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:47,650
thousand watt light and it was not

2761
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:50,230
because I you know was grown trees it

2762
01:41:47,649 --> 01:41:52,569
was because you know the buds were

2763
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:54,369
chunky really nice shaped and they came

2764
01:41:52,569 --> 01:41:57,340
out perfectly you know sounds really

2765
01:41:54,369 --> 01:42:00,489
good aural yeah yeah and you know when

2766
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:02,739
and when you smoke it you know like you

2767
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:05,739
know my fiance she smoked cannabis daily

2768
01:42:02,739 --> 01:42:07,000
for her for whatever reason she does and

2769
01:42:05,739 --> 01:42:08,260
you know we've got all kinds of weed

2770
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,319
around here and that jar is always the

2771
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:13,840
one that gets open I mean so she she's

2772
01:42:11,319 --> 01:42:15,670
not biased like me she didn't talk til

2773
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:20,560
she met me so it's just that's just her

2774
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:24,720
favor one I don't know to me it still

2775
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:27,220
I hope that we have one day soon a

2776
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,619
catalog of strains that are on that

2777
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:32,530
level in my perception at that caliber

2778
01:42:29,619 --> 01:42:34,329
you know you know me and my buddy at IC

2779
01:42:32,529 --> 01:42:35,710
collective we were talking understand is

2780
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:37,630
like a we don't only people who really

2781
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:41,529
love the camcorder like what you know

2782
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:43,390
because if you seems like it's sometimes

2783
01:42:41,529 --> 01:42:45,189
like arena bubble did we create a bubble

2784
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,750
where this is the queen of all cannabis

2785
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:48,219
and that's just what we think and we

2786
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:54,760
think the whole world agrees with us and

2787
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:57,820
and the wrong would you agree that there

2788
01:42:54,760 --> 01:43:01,090
has seemingly been more success breeding

2789
01:42:57,819 --> 01:43:03,579
the chem dog as her me then as with a

2790
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:06,550
mile I mean I know it's kind of early

2791
01:43:03,579 --> 01:43:08,500
dies but it seems like whenever the chem

2792
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:10,750
throws some pollen whatever it hits

2793
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:13,060
turns to gold whereas whenever you hit

2794
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:15,579
it with an act like for example that no

2795
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:17,890
anyone with a male maybe not as

2796
01:43:15,579 --> 01:43:20,789
consistently producing really Stella

2797
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:25,090
Klein's what do you think about that

2798
01:43:20,789 --> 01:43:28,649
that's what I've seen you know I've been

2799
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:31,480
around a pretty extensive chem dog

2800
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:33,879
feminizing object and you know

2801
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:36,189
feminizing the chem dog hitting so many

2802
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:40,630
different shades and they were all

2803
01:43:36,189 --> 01:43:42,339
winners I mean it was it was I I I don't

2804
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:44,770
think that that's how it normally pans

2805
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:48,250
out you know like like I said the silver

2806
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:50,710
can to come Scout the sky the sky cam I

2807
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:53,590
mean that's the Skywalker with it and

2808
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:55,810
there was the cheese I mean then there

2809
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:58,779
was needed that that sherbert he crosses

2810
01:43:55,810 --> 01:44:01,030
me every single one of those you know

2811
01:43:58,779 --> 01:44:03,489
randomly pick out five seeds out of a

2812
01:44:01,029 --> 01:44:06,309
huge bag Andrew single one of them you

2813
01:44:03,489 --> 01:44:08,260
could keep and does and the clubs that

2814
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:10,000
sell the top shelf in California and the

2815
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:13,270
Bay Area take it you know what I mean

2816
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,010
so like yeah it looks like to me like

2817
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:17,560
you know that has to be explored a

2818
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:21,820
little bit more in further you know and

2819
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:26,020
I don't really I don't like I said I I'm

2820
01:44:21,819 --> 01:44:27,849
not the one to be able to articulate the

2821
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:29,380
community's opinion on feminized seats

2822
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:31,570
you know I'm I had the jury's still out

2823
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:33,300
on me I haven't seen any problems yeah

2824
01:44:31,569 --> 01:44:36,299
that's the thing I I'm wondering

2825
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:39,210
what the because well I guess what I'm

2826
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:41,340
saying is to me my understanding of the

2827
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:43,170
perception of thieves is kind of a shaky

2828
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:45,360
thing or some people are like against it

2829
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:47,099
you know what I mean yeah I would agree

2830
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:48,839
a lot of people seem to be against it

2831
01:44:47,099 --> 01:44:50,670
but I'm the same as you I haven't really

2832
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:52,199
seen too many problems to be honest I

2833
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:55,219
think a lot of the time people who don't

2834
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:58,529
want to face their own growing problems

2835
01:44:55,219 --> 01:45:01,800
yeah I think that's that is definitely

2836
01:44:58,529 --> 01:45:05,340
you know I've seen when I first got the

2837
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:07,650
candy for an example and I grew it like

2838
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:09,510
I was doing things at the time and at

2839
01:45:07,649 --> 01:45:10,948
the time I was over feeding my plants

2840
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:12,510
that was just where I was at in my

2841
01:45:10,948 --> 01:45:16,678
evolution you know I was the last person

2842
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:19,079
to to use and my circles to try to use

2843
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:22,050
any kind of salt mixtures you know and

2844
01:45:19,078 --> 01:45:24,719
uh spaces and I overdid it until I

2845
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:27,329
understood you know what I think the

2846
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:30,929
sweet spot is and I got [ __ ] tons of her

2847
01:45:27,328 --> 01:45:32,819
me flowers on my candy right now I don't

2848
01:45:30,929 --> 01:45:34,859
get any Hermes you know I don't have any

2849
01:45:32,819 --> 01:45:36,988
Hermes there's no literally no Hermes on

2850
01:45:34,859 --> 01:45:39,808
the candy that I grew recently you know

2851
01:45:36,988 --> 01:45:41,519
so I'm using as an example that the

2852
01:45:39,809 --> 01:45:43,170
growing methods have a lot more to do

2853
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:47,210
with that than I think people realize or

2854
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:49,710
give good credit for you know yeah I

2855
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:51,719
like I said you know I've been around

2856
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:53,639
this this project and I'm watching it

2857
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:54,899
unfold and I'm watching the seeds as

2858
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:57,199
they where I'm talking I've been

2859
01:45:54,899 --> 01:46:00,210
watching it for three years now and and

2860
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:02,969
watching the seeds come out and you know

2861
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:05,130
the chem scout did we were suspicious

2862
01:46:02,969 --> 01:46:07,948
the kind of scout was creating some

2863
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:09,420
hermie but you know the Kim dog was

2864
01:46:07,948 --> 01:46:11,939
always in there and that definitely

2865
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:16,170
certainly for surely puts you know some

2866
01:46:11,939 --> 01:46:18,658
some Hermy banana types flowers out so

2867
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:21,480
you know I never saw one on the Kim scow

2868
01:46:18,658 --> 01:46:23,819
and and and even then even in that case

2869
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:26,069
we when I was helping my friend get to

2870
01:46:23,819 --> 01:46:28,558
the bottom of things we did find a

2871
01:46:26,069 --> 01:46:29,729
problem in a section of his groin that

2872
01:46:28,559 --> 01:46:31,829
could have been causing some extra

2873
01:46:29,729 --> 01:46:33,238
stress you know there was a hot spot in

2874
01:46:31,828 --> 01:46:36,210
the corner that wasn't getting the

2875
01:46:33,238 --> 01:46:38,129
proper airflow you know and I we know

2876
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:41,069
for sure that could cause a plant to uh

2877
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:44,730
to try to propagate itself you know so

2878
01:46:41,069 --> 01:46:47,189
yeah I haven't seen it is it clear it's

2879
01:46:44,729 --> 01:46:51,809
been like

2880
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:53,729
why not you know but but but I think my

2881
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:55,020
approach I'm gonna do both I'm gonna

2882
01:46:53,729 --> 01:46:56,429
because I think there's a lot of promise

2883
01:46:55,020 --> 01:47:00,719
there and I think you have way more

2884
01:46:56,430 --> 01:47:03,840
control and I think that in some aspects

2885
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,010
you can you can actually go and get the

2886
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,600
traits you're looking for a little

2887
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:10,230
quicker than going through the

2888
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:12,480
traditional methods yeah and and so I'm

2889
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:14,459
gonna do both because I my goal like I

2890
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:17,309
said I want that male or those couple of

2891
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:20,000
males that you know is like Dennis's

2892
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:22,680
yeast where that's okay this is where

2893
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,630
this is our base right here from this

2894
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:26,610
point everything either gets better or

2895
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:28,859
it goes away it's not gonna we're not

2896
01:47:26,609 --> 01:47:30,899
gonna very eat for this I think as I'm

2897
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:32,639
learning to breed and I'm learning you

2898
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:34,439
know I'm learning out what it mean

2899
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,640
really is just knowing the plan is I

2900
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:37,619
think is we're bringing all this is

2901
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:41,280
knowing the plant and being able to at

2902
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:44,399
any point in the plant's life stages in

2903
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:46,409
each age the plants life say you know

2904
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:48,119
I'm feeling like this plants got this

2905
01:47:46,409 --> 01:47:49,948
trade or this trade of that trait you

2906
01:47:48,119 --> 01:47:51,390
know I think that's really what a good

2907
01:47:49,948 --> 01:47:52,710
breeder can do really you know I mean

2908
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:57,000
what else is what else are you really

2909
01:47:52,710 --> 01:47:59,399
doing besides that you know yeah so in

2910
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,659
order for that to be successful that you

2911
01:47:59,399 --> 01:48:02,279
got to really know the plant that you're

2912
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:03,809
working with you got to really know it

2913
01:48:02,279 --> 01:48:06,509
you're not just met it but really know

2914
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:08,460
it you know so I think for me what I

2915
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:11,159
want to do is take that knowledge I have

2916
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:14,159
my favorite strain the chem dog and and

2917
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:15,809
put it in the seed form and oh and see

2918
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:18,750
where it goes from there but make

2919
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:21,110
hybrids and eventually release back

2920
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:23,430
crosses with itself that are you know

2921
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:25,198
cubed to the point where it's guaranteed

2922
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:27,150
you're gonna get what you want you know

2923
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:30,960
or the berries or the variation

2924
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:33,359
yeah for sure so I guess kind of my

2925
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:35,369
ultimate question in regards to the 91

2926
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:37,948
in terms of both working and breeding

2927
01:48:35,369 --> 01:48:39,750
with it is do you think for this plant

2928
01:48:37,948 --> 01:48:41,159
specifically I think the answer might be

2929
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:43,710
a little different for other plants but

2930
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:46,198
do you think for the 91 working with it

2931
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:48,750
is more of an art or a science because

2932
01:48:46,198 --> 01:48:53,939
it seems to not behave quite like the

2933
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:56,039
regular plan in some aspects let me

2934
01:48:53,939 --> 01:49:01,019
think about our stairs and there do you

2935
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:03,210
think yeah so do you think that like it

2936
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:05,040
you can consistently get results from it

2937
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:06,779
or do you think it's it's not the type

2938
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:08,939
of thing where you can have your kind of

2939
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:10,679
playbook and know if I do this it'll do

2940
01:49:08,939 --> 01:49:14,309
that do you think it's it's a bit

2941
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:17,430
unpredictable in some ways I used to

2942
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:19,440
think that and then as my understanding

2943
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:22,770
of what I'm actually doing let whatever

2944
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:24,479
method I'm using at that time I tried

2945
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:25,890
different things at different times to I

2946
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:32,159
don't always do the same thing you know

2947
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:35,400
I definitely feel like I've got a you

2948
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:36,659
know a process that is guaranteed to

2949
01:49:35,399 --> 01:49:38,729
produce what you want I don't really

2950
01:49:36,659 --> 01:49:40,170
have very much variation anymore from

2951
01:49:38,729 --> 01:49:42,629
crop to crop with chem dog in the

2952
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:44,310
beginning what my friend told me about

2953
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:45,900
the hit or miss and the Stars it

2954
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:48,450
definitely was true but as time went on

2955
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:49,920
in my understanding I want to say skills

2956
01:49:48,449 --> 01:49:52,470
that I don't really know if that word

2957
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:55,199
applies to what I'm saying but those you

2958
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:56,909
know learning from my experiences and

2959
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:59,519
applying what I'm learning to what I'm

2960
01:49:56,909 --> 01:50:01,109
doing I think that just that kind of

2961
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,420
went way it's very consistent now it's

2962
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:07,259
consistent like I said you know I had

2963
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:10,980
these new ones to kim crush i had you

2964
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:14,039
know a sour band in there which is and I

2965
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:17,489
had beatrix choice and some silver kam

2966
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:18,930
on one side say half that and then on

2967
01:50:17,489 --> 01:50:20,789
the other half had chem dog and I

2968
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:23,220
crushed it on the chem dog side you know

2969
01:50:20,789 --> 01:50:25,199
I got more of a yield on the chem dog

2970
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:27,090
side you know yeah I got you know it's

2971
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:29,309
always better pot to me so I'm not gonna

2972
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:30,900
say that but you know it's very

2973
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:32,820
consistent very nice you know it's

2974
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:35,039
tricky it's very tricky planted it's

2975
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:37,799
a-you know the nuts and bolts of it or

2976
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,659
is it consumes itself at the end of its

2977
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:41,130
life it really does and and you have to

2978
01:50:39,659 --> 01:50:43,529
let it do that because that's what it's

2979
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:45,810
going to do anyway and you know time is

2980
01:50:43,529 --> 01:50:47,909
of the essence and you know this is just

2981
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:50,160
the clock of the plant well it's hard to

2982
01:50:47,909 --> 01:50:51,779
watch you know it consumes itself you

2983
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:54,449
know it takes every little bit of its

2984
01:50:51,779 --> 01:50:56,369
nutrient out of its body and eats it you

2985
01:50:54,449 --> 01:50:57,779
know and you can watch you do it it's

2986
01:50:56,369 --> 01:51:00,029
very interesting right next to it you're

2987
01:50:57,779 --> 01:51:01,259
like you know if you're the first time

2988
01:51:00,029 --> 01:51:03,059
you ever come walking into a grown

2989
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:05,159
you're gonna go and without using your

2990
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:07,950
nose okay you're gonna be like what the

2991
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:09,359
hell happened those plants and then

2992
01:51:07,949 --> 01:51:12,000
these over here they're all Russian

2993
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:13,949
green and stuff but you know the Kim dog

2994
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,939
is just you know for whatever reason and

2995
01:51:13,949 --> 01:51:16,500
it does do that more

2996
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:18,988
than used to going back to that question

2997
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:23,609
you asked earlier about the changes it

2998
01:51:18,988 --> 01:51:25,649
does do that more like the best chem dog

2999
01:51:23,609 --> 01:51:30,319
I ever grew was organic and I think the

3000
01:51:25,649 --> 01:51:32,969
reason that was was big it is because

3001
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,948
you're never ever really just running on

3002
01:51:32,969 --> 01:51:36,569
water you know when you're doing it that

3003
01:51:34,948 --> 01:51:39,269
with the method I use with that I always

3004
01:51:36,569 --> 01:51:41,880
had like this certainty I was making

3005
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:45,719
this like I used to make so we didn't

3006
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:50,460
call it compost tea we called it the bat

3007
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:54,810
katieb of that bat and I had like you

3008
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:56,489
see yeah like this net this is this was

3009
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:58,920
the whole thing you know you take your

3010
01:51:56,488 --> 01:52:00,959
back Alana's a couple different kind you

3011
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:03,779
know you take a seabird guano high fiber

3012
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:07,739
Senor high phosphorus bat guano you put

3013
01:52:03,779 --> 01:52:09,420
in a little maxi crop you know you had a

3014
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:10,919
little sugar and then you put one of

3015
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:12,449
those not just an air bubbler in the

3016
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,069
bottom but and these things were really

3017
01:52:12,448 --> 01:52:15,389
hard to get back then it was really hard

3018
01:52:14,069 --> 01:52:18,659
to find his but I would go find these

3019
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:20,850
fish pond or I'm sorry these big

3020
01:52:18,659 --> 01:52:23,099
saltwater fish tank pumps where they

3021
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:25,050
actually sucked the water up at a very

3022
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:26,400
high volume bring it up to the top of

3023
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:28,079
the pump head which is kind of hanging

3024
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:30,389
on say like the edge of a trash can or

3025
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:32,789
whatever you got the VAT you know and

3026
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:34,260
mixes it with air and actually had a

3027
01:52:32,789 --> 01:52:35,939
tube going out of it I think it's just

3028
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:39,270
like a I don't know what they call them

3029
01:52:35,939 --> 01:52:44,009
but and and the idea was it was creating

3030
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:45,420
like a vigorous and a you know actually

3031
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:47,550
sucking action so it's got its like

3032
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:50,069
agitating the our waters agitating right

3033
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:52,619
but it's adding air to it right this

3034
01:52:50,069 --> 01:52:54,269
thing when the power would go off this

3035
01:52:52,619 --> 01:52:56,010
would be the first thing the generator

3036
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:57,420
would get though this would be the first

3037
01:52:56,010 --> 01:53:00,210
thing that I'd plug into the generator

3038
01:52:57,420 --> 01:53:02,039
was this pump right because when this

3039
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:03,779
thing was Harmon and I would never use

3040
01:53:02,039 --> 01:53:05,609
more than half of it was the rule this

3041
01:53:03,779 --> 01:53:07,170
is all the stuff my friend originally

3042
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:10,500
showed me this is all his tricks and it

3043
01:53:07,170 --> 01:53:12,869
man it was i got 72 ounces of chem dog

3044
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,880
off with two 1000s on light tracks a

3045
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:16,710
long time it was I I brought everybody

3046
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,810
ID over to my house people drew from

3047
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:22,770
four hours away to come see these buds

3048
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:25,110
you know what I mean it was crazy you

3049
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:26,610
know I would go every time I water my

3050
01:53:25,109 --> 01:53:28,500
plant so I would stick my hand into that

3051
01:53:26,609 --> 01:53:29,279
now would only you just sing once every

3052
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,710
two weeks

3053
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:34,529
right and and do a lot of table

3054
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:36,389
dressings and I would take my hand and I

3055
01:53:34,529 --> 01:53:37,859
you know I'm an electrician I work with

3056
01:53:36,389 --> 01:53:40,409
my hand I'm always doing some sort of

3057
01:53:37,859 --> 01:53:41,969
physical project messin with tools I've

3058
01:53:40,408 --> 01:53:44,308
always got some sort of nick on my hand

3059
01:53:41,969 --> 01:53:46,679
always even right now and I would take

3060
01:53:44,309 --> 01:53:48,809
my hand I would stir it up and then by

3061
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:50,849
the time I would be done by the time I'd

3062
01:53:48,809 --> 01:53:53,219
water my plants just with the with their

3063
01:53:50,849 --> 01:53:54,869
regular regiment the regular water that

3064
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:56,279
little cut on my hand would be nice and

3065
01:53:54,868 --> 01:53:58,078
red and looking like it's already

3066
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:01,198
infected just 20 minutes later you know

3067
01:53:58,078 --> 01:54:03,179
to me I'd be like all right tomorrow at

3068
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:06,299
its ready you know and then I will only

3069
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:07,679
use half of it no matter how I had to no

3070
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:09,210
matter how much I had to spread it how

3071
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:11,219
many plants I had to spread it over I

3072
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:13,590
would never use more than half of it you

3073
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:15,359
know and then I was held back up and I

3074
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:17,340
was very careful of course to make sure

3075
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:19,049
that the water was you know not letting

3076
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:20,880
him chlorine or anything like that and

3077
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:22,349
it were great and it was basically some

3078
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,739
sort of compost tea action we were

3079
01:54:22,349 --> 01:54:28,199
getting with it you know but um but the

3080
01:54:25,738 --> 01:54:30,238
end consistency thing it doesn't really

3081
01:54:28,198 --> 01:54:32,339
happen anymore you know it just doesn't

3082
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:35,459
it just it pretty much comes out say I'm

3083
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:38,300
not saying it looks as pretty on day 56

3084
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:41,099
as silver Kim does but it definitely

3085
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:42,210
it's still my favorite man and a lot of

3086
01:54:41,099 --> 01:54:43,288
people around me it's their favorite

3087
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:47,069
ones too you know

3088
01:54:43,288 --> 01:54:49,139
so yeah cool so if we keep on that same

3089
01:54:47,069 --> 01:54:52,500
topic of like our kind of technology in

3090
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:54,059
the garden what are some updates what

3091
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:56,340
are you running nowadays have you

3092
01:54:54,059 --> 01:54:59,070
converted over to our you know your nano

3093
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:01,529
locks / kavita mm bulbs or are you still

3094
01:54:59,069 --> 01:55:05,819
a simple man with just your tents and

3095
01:55:01,529 --> 01:55:09,710
your HIDs no I'm usually not the

3096
01:55:05,819 --> 01:55:13,259
computers but I'm using the the

3097
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:15,420
Hydrofarm what they called phantoms same

3098
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:18,389
same double-ended yeah it's just a

3099
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,710
different uh I didn't have you know the

3100
01:55:18,389 --> 01:55:23,368
reason I'm doing that is that they have

3101
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:24,929
the right hood I guess you'd call it you

3102
01:55:23,368 --> 01:55:27,808
know the insert the reflector they have

3103
01:55:24,929 --> 01:55:30,599
the right reflector for my space so I

3104
01:55:27,809 --> 01:55:32,190
can't go up I can't raise like I would

3105
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:34,288
need to for the good Vitas to get that

3106
01:55:32,189 --> 01:55:35,939
high over the canopy so I use the

3107
01:55:34,288 --> 01:55:38,250
southern was just a more open pattern

3108
01:55:35,939 --> 01:55:42,500
and then I put it on light movers just

3109
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:44,329
because I mean why not you know yeah

3110
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:46,579
seems to work good it takes the shadows

3111
01:55:44,329 --> 01:55:48,800
out I've always said I've always really

3112
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:51,050
liked those things I got away from using

3113
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,810
them I started off with them and and I

3114
01:55:51,050 --> 01:55:55,610
really liked them because you know it

3115
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:57,170
you know you see some of these these I

3116
01:55:55,609 --> 01:55:59,929
don't really have the type of grower I

3117
01:55:57,170 --> 01:56:01,909
it's a small thing that I have and I

3118
01:55:59,930 --> 01:56:03,860
can't like cover the whole thing with

3119
01:56:01,909 --> 01:56:05,329
light there's gonna be an are way over

3120
01:56:03,859 --> 01:56:07,279
here there's gonna be a cabinet over

3121
01:56:05,329 --> 01:56:09,100
here so you know I used the light movers

3122
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:11,750
to kind of try to compensate for that

3123
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:15,650
lack of total coverage I've got you know

3124
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:17,180
yeah so besides that you know I do

3125
01:56:15,649 --> 01:56:18,500
different things at different times you

3126
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:20,510
know it depends on what it is you know

3127
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,619
we do sometimes we're doing work and it

3128
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:24,860
can sometimes you're doing a little

3129
01:56:21,619 --> 01:56:28,099
mostly some some custom salt mixes we've

3130
01:56:24,859 --> 01:56:29,569
got going on and you know just over the

3131
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:31,550
course of the bunch of years you know

3132
01:56:29,569 --> 01:56:33,139
you just you some things work and some

3133
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:34,340
things some things help you out some

3134
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:38,930
things are just literally a waste of

3135
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:41,029
money you know and uh and I've anybody

3136
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:43,100
out there who's growing or learning I

3137
01:56:41,029 --> 01:56:45,619
did the only thing I could tell you is

3138
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:47,990
less is more and keep it simple you know

3139
01:56:45,619 --> 01:56:49,760
because it's it's really it they call it

3140
01:56:47,989 --> 01:56:51,500
weed for a reason you don't really have

3141
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,840
to do that much to it you know it's sick

3142
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:56,659
it's got to give it a little food and

3143
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:59,390
enough though no tell me what time it is

3144
01:56:56,659 --> 01:57:01,399
and that's pretty much it you know and

3145
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:03,860
then I think that I think most of the

3146
01:57:01,399 --> 01:57:07,819
skill when it comes to growing cannabis

3147
01:57:03,859 --> 01:57:10,279
isn't what you feed what your plant your

3148
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:12,769
your you know your regimen is or

3149
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:15,170
whatever I think it's really on how you

3150
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:17,180
train your plants on how you treat them

3151
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:19,609
in an indoor situation especially I

3152
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:21,350
think it's how you train your plants and

3153
01:57:19,609 --> 01:57:23,750
you know how you shape them I like to

3154
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:24,680
sculpt them you know you have to get

3155
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:27,140
them to where they're gonna bring you

3156
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:28,850
the most for their little space that

3157
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:31,190
they're gonna have with the idea that

3158
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:34,190
that lights directly above them and not

3159
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:35,869
to the side and you know it's not gonna

3160
01:57:34,189 --> 01:57:37,549
move from this point of sky as the

3161
01:57:35,869 --> 01:57:39,079
season changes it's always in the same

3162
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:41,300
spot with that all taken into

3163
01:57:39,079 --> 01:57:44,000
consideration I think that that is the

3164
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:45,890
thing that you can you know give

3165
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,659
yourself better results with more than

3166
01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:50,000
anything else that I've seen you know I

3167
01:57:47,659 --> 01:57:52,460
don't really see you know people going

3168
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,640
on using this now look what happens

3169
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:56,439
wow I don't see that a lot I see people

3170
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:59,260
use what they

3171
01:57:56,439 --> 01:58:01,419
comfortable with their their recipes and

3172
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:03,250
their regiments you know they're you

3173
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:04,630
know Duke who uses all kinds of stuff

3174
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:08,948
over there he tells me things I'm like

3175
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:10,930
you do what now I love these I love that

3176
01:58:08,948 --> 01:58:13,869
guys I've met him recently in life night

3177
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:15,880
he struck him he's an interesting cat I

3178
01:58:13,869 --> 01:58:18,460
like and I like his attitude I love the

3179
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,409
story and I can tell he's good people or

3180
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:22,180
not but yeah he tells me some stuff I'm

3181
01:58:20,409 --> 01:58:26,920
like you do wrong and that sounds like

3182
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:29,460
some how would eat [ __ ] but I guess I

3183
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:32,829
think it mostly has to do it with

3184
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:34,210
remembering that you're in a sprint when

3185
01:58:32,829 --> 01:58:37,029
you're growing cannabis you're not in a

3186
01:58:34,210 --> 01:58:38,739
marathon you don't get today twice you

3187
01:58:37,029 --> 01:58:40,509
only get today once so if you didn't do

3188
01:58:38,738 --> 01:58:42,009
today we had to be done you don't get to

3189
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:43,239
do it tomorrow you just missed it and

3190
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,680
maybe you should jot it down and they

3191
01:58:43,238 --> 01:58:46,629
see them the next time you get a chance

3192
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:49,960
to be sure you do it you know whatever

3193
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:53,619
it is and and then along with that just

3194
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:55,510
you know keep it simple and and like you

3195
01:58:53,619 --> 01:58:57,309
know watch your plants and see so you

3196
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:59,530
see which way there's what they're

3197
01:58:57,310 --> 01:59:00,910
trying to tell you and you know they

3198
01:58:59,529 --> 01:59:02,259
respond quick you know they don't you

3199
01:59:00,909 --> 01:59:03,609
don't it's not like you have to wait

3200
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,079
half your life to figure out what you

3201
01:59:03,609 --> 01:59:06,399
did work you know you get you know a

3202
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:07,689
short period of time you're gonna find

3203
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:11,289
out what your results are

3204
01:59:07,689 --> 01:59:14,019
and I don't beat keep your mind open and

3205
01:59:11,289 --> 01:59:14,350
uh and really look at everything you're

3206
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:16,090
doing

3207
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:17,350
you know don't turn your eyes away from

3208
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:19,810
some things because you thought it

3209
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:21,460
worked in the past you keep it all on

3210
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:24,550
the table under you and try to make sure

3211
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:26,380
that you're fine-tuning everything not

3212
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:28,239
just one aspect like am i feeding my

3213
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:30,520
plants the right thing I see so many

3214
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:32,769
people that get caught up in that and I

3215
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:34,120
just think it's like it's a dead end it

3216
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:36,580
doesn't really matter that much really

3217
01:59:34,119 --> 01:59:38,079
you know you know you can use any of the

3218
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:40,149
tools that are available to so we got so

3219
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:42,250
many of them and if you learn how to use

3220
01:59:40,149 --> 01:59:43,689
them properly I would imagine that you

3221
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:45,819
know you're gonna get good results if

3222
01:59:43,689 --> 01:59:49,000
everything else is working my god my

3223
01:59:45,819 --> 01:59:52,149
buddy said it's light air and water and

3224
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:56,289
food that's it more complicated than

3225
01:59:52,149 --> 01:59:58,210
that I mean yeah so um for this next

3226
01:59:56,289 --> 01:59:59,979
part we just might move on to some kind

3227
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:01,810
of less growing based questions some

3228
01:59:59,979 --> 02:00:06,149
kind of more cannabis scene slash

3229
02:00:01,810 --> 02:00:09,969
community related questions were you

3230
02:00:06,149 --> 02:00:12,250
quick to jump onto the as like a medical

3231
02:00:09,969 --> 02:00:14,079
or were you kind of a bit hesitant and

3232
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:16,238
you just kind of did your own thing

3233
02:00:14,079 --> 02:00:18,880
without really engaging in the medical

3234
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:20,889
community so much and furthermore do you

3235
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,630
think that the kind of the medical scene

3236
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:30,579
in America is working for the people in

3237
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:32,529
general well me I I I'm kind of hardcore

3238
02:00:30,579 --> 02:00:35,050
about all that it when I when I went to

3239
02:00:32,529 --> 02:00:36,819
15 I remember one proposition 215 when

3240
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:38,680
the petition was being passed around I

3241
02:00:36,819 --> 02:00:40,569
remember I went in front of this gross

3242
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:43,239
Safeway or saw him and this guy asked me

3243
02:00:40,569 --> 02:00:45,309
for him to sign it and I said I said no

3244
02:00:43,238 --> 02:00:46,750
and he goes why not and he goes because

3245
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:48,100
I think it should be legal for everybody

3246
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:50,770
I don't think he should because I my

3247
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:52,810
mind I was like you know and that was a

3248
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:54,880
really foolish thing I was when I look

3249
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:57,100
back that was so serious dumb youth

3250
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:58,719
right there but that's that's how I felt

3251
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:01,590
about it I was like you know it should

3252
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:04,989
be legal for everybody and so when

3253
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:07,529
proposition 215 happen I think we all no

3254
02:01:04,988 --> 02:01:09,939
matter what our feeling on it was I

3255
02:01:07,529 --> 02:01:11,619
think that the way that the proposition

3256
02:01:09,939 --> 02:01:13,689
was written I think it was amazing

3257
02:01:11,619 --> 02:01:15,939
because it was so basic and simple and

3258
02:01:13,689 --> 02:01:18,039
it was so vague that it could be

3259
02:01:15,939 --> 02:01:21,129
turpitude to mean basically that you

3260
02:01:18,039 --> 02:01:21,369
know there was no limits you know it was

3261
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,719
just

3262
02:01:21,369 --> 02:01:24,869
I've not planned limits was just no

3263
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:28,210
limitations to this the way they were so

3264
02:01:24,869 --> 02:01:29,890
masterfully vague you know so I think

3265
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:33,880
that we all rejoice when that happened I

3266
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:35,949
mean it was like I think it was amazing

3267
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:37,600
moment and I don't think that me

3268
02:01:35,948 --> 02:01:39,488
personally I don't think I took it in

3269
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:42,250
for what it was worked at the time and

3270
02:01:39,488 --> 02:01:45,879
the reason being is because I feel like

3271
02:01:42,250 --> 02:01:47,920
I just didn't believe it I just did not

3272
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:52,569
believe that that's really how it was

3273
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:56,710
you know until I was at a concert down

3274
02:01:52,569 --> 02:01:59,229
in the South Bay and we had a quite a

3275
02:01:56,710 --> 02:02:01,920
who's-who of people with cannabis came

3276
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:06,698
to a suite we had there one night in

3277
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:08,560
Santa Clara California and I think we're

3278
02:02:06,698 --> 02:02:11,289
either shoreline show and this is you

3279
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,539
know this was just like in 2002 or three

3280
02:02:11,289 --> 02:02:15,819
this is much farther after Jerry died

3281
02:02:13,539 --> 02:02:17,979
you know this is our kids and everything

3282
02:02:15,819 --> 02:02:19,929
and we're all settled down but we're

3283
02:02:17,979 --> 02:02:21,250
anyways read this hotel and we're smoked

3284
02:02:19,929 --> 02:02:23,199
and it was definitely getting a little

3285
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:24,000
hairy and my friend had just given me

3286
02:02:23,198 --> 02:02:26,649
this

3287
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,829
this one of these hand-blown on a lathe

3288
02:02:26,649 --> 02:02:31,210
glass no glass pipe bongs you know like

3289
02:02:29,829 --> 02:02:33,279
though the ones that they spend on the

3290
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:36,189
Lay's very nice piece you know yeah and

3291
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:38,259
so we're that and then then we have a

3292
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:39,759
the the guy with the bubble hash shows

3293
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:41,980
up this is the first guy who ever showed

3294
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:44,020
me bow ass he shows up and he's got his

3295
02:02:41,979 --> 02:02:45,759
throat melt and we're just smoking and

3296
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:48,910
it's just one after another make sure

3297
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:50,829
you know it's just being my buddy in the

3298
02:02:48,909 --> 02:02:52,569
room and the kids are in the back room

3299
02:02:50,829 --> 02:02:54,579
and it's separated we have a door it's

3300
02:02:52,569 --> 02:02:56,319
separating their sleep and then we get a

3301
02:02:54,579 --> 02:02:59,170
that knock at the door you know what I

3302
02:02:56,319 --> 02:03:02,109
mean crack crack like oh god sure enough

3303
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:04,420
the police out there and someone had

3304
02:03:02,109 --> 02:03:05,920
complained you know we're you know we

3305
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:07,449
come from a place where that's really

3306
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,699
not that big a deal up in Sonoma County

3307
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:10,869
I mean you can you can smoke weed pretty

3308
02:03:09,699 --> 02:03:14,079
much in public like you can in San

3309
02:03:10,869 --> 02:03:15,519
Francisco almost now right we're not

3310
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:17,769
there we're in Santa Clara it's a much

3311
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,090
more conservative place sure enough

3312
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:20,380
there was some police at the door and

3313
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:22,150
they opened the door and I went outside

3314
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:23,319
and like we're coming in I'm like not

3315
02:03:22,149 --> 02:03:26,139
without a warrant we go through this

3316
02:03:23,319 --> 02:03:27,519
whole thing and next thing you know I'm

3317
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:29,500
in handcuffs sitting on the floor and

3318
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,140
they're search in the room they find

3319
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:34,000
some pie they find a you know maybe a

3320
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:36,010
scale or something like that it was

3321
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:39,130
nothing much was but it was a big deal

3322
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:42,880
of them you know yeah and they dressed

3323
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:44,829
me and and and you know the next thing I

3324
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,300
know I'm sitting you know later that

3325
02:03:44,829 --> 02:03:48,550
week I'm sitting in front of an attorney

3326
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:52,960
and the first question she asked me is

3327
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:55,989
so do you have your proposition 215 and

3328
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,640
I'm like it was like the most

3329
02:03:55,989 --> 02:04:00,219
embarrassing moment of my life I think

3330
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:01,990
practically I said no she's like well

3331
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:05,380
and she's very professional she's like

3332
02:04:01,989 --> 02:04:07,029
what can i - do i and that was like it

3333
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:09,310
hit me right then I was like this is a

3334
02:04:07,029 --> 02:04:11,949
real thing like I'm sitting from an

3335
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:13,600
attorney that I just paid money and her

3336
02:04:11,949 --> 02:04:16,019
question to me is why don't you have

3337
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:20,020
your 2:15 like I'm paying her to ask me

3338
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:21,400
like well what a fool I am you know what

3339
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:23,350
I mean and I mean I got a little pot

3340
02:04:21,399 --> 02:04:24,909
plants and I got it you know my garden

3341
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:26,440
of course then I got a couple of outdoor

3342
02:04:24,909 --> 02:04:29,319
in the garden up at the house you know

3343
02:04:26,439 --> 02:04:32,109
and at the time and I don't know I feel

3344
02:04:29,319 --> 02:04:36,729
like a fool so this was like in you know

3345
02:04:32,109 --> 02:04:39,399
proposition 215 was in 1996 Malia and

3346
02:04:36,729 --> 02:04:41,769
and I didn't get my medical until I was

3347
02:04:39,399 --> 02:04:44,529
in 1999 so I was good three years later

3348
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:46,660
and that's how it happened she basically

3349
02:04:44,529 --> 02:04:49,149
you know it was like you know you need

3350
02:04:46,659 --> 02:04:50,859
to go see a doctor and you know Michael

3351
02:04:49,149 --> 02:04:52,210
I don't really I'm not sick and she look

3352
02:04:50,859 --> 02:04:54,789
you don't understand how it works it's

3353
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:57,609
not you don't have to be sick do you use

3354
02:04:54,789 --> 02:05:01,239
it for anything besides like you just

3355
02:04:57,609 --> 02:05:02,979
get stoned S or no I mean I mean you

3356
02:05:01,239 --> 02:05:05,559
know traffic irritates me I smoke weed

3357
02:05:02,979 --> 02:05:07,479
you know and like life gets to us and

3358
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:09,940
she goes that's that's a reason that's

3359
02:05:07,479 --> 02:05:11,709
it right there go see a doctor and to me

3360
02:05:09,939 --> 02:05:13,389
it was such an alien idea so I went saw

3361
02:05:11,710 --> 02:05:14,800
the doctor II talked I mean he was like

3362
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:16,060
you know he asked me all the questions

3363
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,659
how much do you smoke we slowed the

3364
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:19,360
floor

3365
02:05:16,659 --> 02:05:20,829
and I tell him and then I suddenly felt

3366
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:25,059
like a patient you know and I was like

3367
02:05:20,829 --> 02:05:26,710
so legit then we took all this to the to

3368
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:28,030
the you know we she did her thing you

3369
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:29,710
know I don't we didn't go to court or

3370
02:05:28,029 --> 02:05:31,300
anything and you know they they ended up

3371
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:32,500
dropping the charges and all that kind

3372
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:36,310
of stuff so that's how it happened for

3373
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:38,380
me it was you know I've you know in my

3374
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:40,210
my years traveling around the Grateful

3375
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:42,130
Dead and everything else associated that

3376
02:05:40,210 --> 02:05:43,960
we we learned how to survive in the

3377
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:45,460
shadows in America you know and and I

3378
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:48,100
kind of got comfortable there and I

3379
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:51,399
think that I think even those things are

3380
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:53,230
you know as we're recreations come

3381
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:54,869
online here in America I think I'm still

3382
02:05:53,229 --> 02:05:56,769
dealing with that a little bit because

3383
02:05:54,869 --> 02:05:59,529
sometimes I see what people are doing

3384
02:05:56,770 --> 02:06:02,650
out there I'm like God dang man you guys

3385
02:05:59,529 --> 02:06:04,000
are over the top and I know what they're

3386
02:06:02,649 --> 02:06:05,469
actually really successful and they're

3387
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,149
putting their dreams together because

3388
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:09,579
they came out of the shadows to do that

3389
02:06:07,149 --> 02:06:12,129
and I just I struggle with that you know

3390
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:13,449
so I think that when I that's it took me

3391
02:06:12,130 --> 02:06:16,449
a while to get my medical because of

3392
02:06:13,449 --> 02:06:22,599
that so and I think as far as medical in

3393
02:06:16,449 --> 02:06:25,059
America I want to say yes but I don't I

3394
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:27,910
I don't know if I have the whole view on

3395
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:30,910
that because of my lack of really

3396
02:06:27,909 --> 02:06:32,229
understanding completely what's how CBD

3397
02:06:30,909 --> 02:06:34,449
works and how it helps people with

3398
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:36,939
various things and not just my lack of

3399
02:06:34,449 --> 02:06:39,039
understanding of just in general so my

3400
02:06:36,939 --> 02:06:41,469
answer would be that it would be great

3401
02:06:39,039 --> 02:06:44,050
if we would just open this up and and uh

3402
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:46,920
in America here and and and try to

3403
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:50,069
figure out what is helping people in a

3404
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:51,989
in situations a B and C and

3405
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:53,909
try to understand it because you know

3406
02:06:51,988 --> 02:06:55,259
that's how I I think that you know I

3407
02:06:53,908 --> 02:06:56,098
just want to see everything from a

3408
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:58,469
science-based

3409
02:06:56,099 --> 02:06:59,878
point of view when it comes to the

3410
02:06:58,469 --> 02:07:02,639
medical side of cannabis like what

3411
02:06:59,878 --> 02:07:05,368
exactly does this help but being careful

3412
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:06,809
with you know we're getting pretty far

3413
02:07:05,368 --> 02:07:09,058
away in America here I'm just

3414
02:07:06,809 --> 02:07:11,909
remembering that it's just a [ __ ]

3415
02:07:09,059 --> 02:07:15,298
plant you know like you know everyone's

3416
02:07:11,908 --> 02:07:17,668
so hype hyped up on yeah yeah regulating

3417
02:07:15,298 --> 02:07:20,219
tax the cannabis you know producer like

3418
02:07:17,668 --> 02:07:22,798
you put an alcohol producer and you know

3419
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:24,868
I and then that brings up that same kind

3420
02:07:22,798 --> 02:07:27,809
of militant attitude I have me it's like

3421
02:07:24,868 --> 02:07:29,719
it's not like alcohol it's a plant it's

3422
02:07:27,809 --> 02:07:33,149
different it's like it's more like

3423
02:07:29,719 --> 02:07:35,189
velarium or it's more like you know you

3424
02:07:33,149 --> 02:07:37,588
know it's more like an herb or something

3425
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:39,899
it's not like alcohol I'll call this

3426
02:07:37,588 --> 02:07:41,788
poison you know I mean yeah you know I

3427
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:44,639
like glass along with it I don't want it

3428
02:07:41,788 --> 02:07:45,809
to get and if and if and since we're

3429
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:48,510
already on this road because you know

3430
02:07:45,809 --> 02:07:50,399
reality is reality since we're on this

3431
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:51,739
road where we're gonna regulate it taxed

3432
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:54,838
like alcohol that's the phrase that

3433
02:07:51,738 --> 02:07:56,908
people are comfortable with okay well

3434
02:07:54,838 --> 02:07:58,679
then treat me like you know treat me

3435
02:07:56,908 --> 02:08:00,478
like a small brewery treat me like a

3436
02:07:58,679 --> 02:08:03,059
winery or something you know don't treat

3437
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:06,539
me like I'm making meth or something

3438
02:08:03,059 --> 02:08:08,729
you're making like you know oxycodone in

3439
02:08:06,538 --> 02:08:10,828
my basement you know to me like treat me

3440
02:08:08,729 --> 02:08:12,599
like I'm making out that's what you're

3441
02:08:10,828 --> 02:08:13,858
gonna do and let me have the same rights

3442
02:08:12,599 --> 02:08:15,599
as those people do because they got

3443
02:08:13,859 --> 02:08:17,189
pulling your right side I'm looking why

3444
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:20,029
in the country I see about what they get

3445
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:22,559
away with you know what I mean and or

3446
02:08:20,029 --> 02:08:24,088
you know just let people leave would be

3447
02:08:22,559 --> 02:08:25,409
like it's a tomato plant you know which

3448
02:08:24,088 --> 02:08:27,538
is the way I would prefer if they were

3449
02:08:25,408 --> 02:08:32,068
just even long let let the market sort

3450
02:08:27,538 --> 02:08:34,488
itself out you know yeah sorry so I was

3451
02:08:32,069 --> 02:08:37,649
gonna say so what are some of the the

3452
02:08:34,488 --> 02:08:39,958
pitfalls that other countries could

3453
02:08:37,649 --> 02:08:41,389
learn from America like surely there

3454
02:08:39,958 --> 02:08:44,038
were some things that happened after

3455
02:08:41,389 --> 02:08:45,899
legalization which in retrospect you

3456
02:08:44,038 --> 02:08:47,219
realize we're negatives but maybe

3457
02:08:45,899 --> 02:08:49,829
initially you thought they were

3458
02:08:47,219 --> 02:08:56,269
positives like what what should we be on

3459
02:08:49,828 --> 02:08:56,268
the lookout for I was a good question

3460
02:08:57,979 --> 02:09:03,230
well

3461
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:06,469
see I guess the one that we asked that

3462
02:09:03,229 --> 02:09:08,119
that comes to mind is uh dispensaries I

3463
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:10,670
mean that's just that's just part of the

3464
02:09:08,119 --> 02:09:12,529
fabric now as part of the see now but in

3465
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:15,829
the beginning and even the people who

3466
02:09:12,529 --> 02:09:18,199
wrote proposition 215 that's exactly

3467
02:09:15,829 --> 02:09:22,189
what they didn't want you know they knew

3468
02:09:18,199 --> 02:09:24,769
that if we allowed if if we allow people

3469
02:09:22,189 --> 02:09:27,769
to so you know cannabis in like a

3470
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:28,910
dispensary situation that's exactly

3471
02:09:27,770 --> 02:09:30,530
where the federal government would get

3472
02:09:28,909 --> 02:09:32,479
involved right there you know right when

3473
02:09:30,529 --> 02:09:34,239
you do that transaction that they would

3474
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:37,579
have a problem with that you know and

3475
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:39,829
they never intended and actually my

3476
02:09:37,579 --> 02:09:43,550
doctor was in the room when they were

3477
02:09:39,829 --> 02:09:46,100
brainstorming 2:15 and he explained list

3478
02:09:43,550 --> 02:09:48,079
I mean he said that uh you know we never

3479
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:50,690
intent we never saw that happening we

3480
02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:52,550
assumed that then when he said when I

3481
02:09:50,689 --> 02:09:54,019
say we am talking like I'm family he

3482
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:55,340
said we never thought that that would

3483
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:58,430
happen we thought that as soon as that

3484
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:59,510
happened and we that the feds will shut

3485
02:09:58,430 --> 02:10:02,450
it down and that wouldn't be a problem

3486
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:04,039
and that we would be left with is you

3487
02:10:02,449 --> 02:10:07,309
know farmers market type things

3488
02:10:04,039 --> 02:10:08,750
exchanges and and but mainly everyone

3489
02:10:07,310 --> 02:10:10,280
having the right to grow their own pot

3490
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:14,359
you know that was really the main goal

3491
02:10:10,279 --> 02:10:17,119
so I think that you know as when

3492
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:19,519
legalization happens the you know did

3493
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:22,250
that they weren't being realistic in my

3494
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,990
opinion because you know not everybody

3495
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:26,539
can grow the wrong you know I mean

3496
02:10:23,989 --> 02:10:27,859
that's just that most people can't

3497
02:10:26,539 --> 02:10:29,449
they're on the space they don't have the

3498
02:10:27,859 --> 02:10:31,549
physical capabilities especially if

3499
02:10:29,449 --> 02:10:33,139
they're a medical patient they don't

3500
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:34,400
have they don't they don't want to learn

3501
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:35,750
their skill just to get something

3502
02:10:34,399 --> 02:10:37,099
they've been using the whole life you

3503
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:40,489
know what I mean just because the law

3504
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:43,250
says that's what you have to do now but

3505
02:10:40,489 --> 02:10:44,960
I think as when legalization happens in

3506
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:47,390
places where it's beginning to happen

3507
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,949
and hasn't even gotten this far like

3508
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:51,020
maybe where you're at or anywhere else I

3509
02:10:48,949 --> 02:10:53,750
think just keeping an eye on that you

3510
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:56,090
know making sure that the structure of

3511
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:59,149
how cannabis gets from the grower to the

3512
02:10:56,090 --> 02:11:01,550
end-user just making sure that that's

3513
02:10:59,149 --> 02:11:03,529
done right and don't don't let any

3514
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:04,820
because that's where all the shady shady

3515
02:11:03,529 --> 02:11:07,489
characters have popped into this

3516
02:11:04,819 --> 02:11:11,269
industry you know in my opinion I think

3517
02:11:07,489 --> 02:11:14,000
that that the lure and and that whole

3518
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:16,160
infrastructure and apparatus is allow

3519
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,729
people who really just want to end for

3520
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:22,059
the money that's given them the door and

3521
02:11:18,729 --> 02:11:25,309
you know you know they've controlled

3522
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:27,410
that basically gave them the keys to the

3523
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:30,050
market you know they decide how much pot

3524
02:11:27,409 --> 02:11:31,639
costs you know and I don't really think

3525
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:33,409
that's I don't think that could have

3526
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:35,630
been we've gotten away with it here and

3527
02:11:33,409 --> 02:11:38,059
it went okay but I think that part could

3528
02:11:35,630 --> 02:11:40,310
be definitely organized better as it's

3529
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:42,710
growing in a place where marijuana is

3530
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:45,050
become legal you know I mean yeah for

3531
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:46,939
sure so I'm just touching back on a

3532
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:48,289
point you made earlier on in terms of

3533
02:11:46,939 --> 02:11:50,000
how you were saying we need to figure

3534
02:11:48,289 --> 02:11:52,159
out whether it's you know maybe the THC

3535
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:54,800
or the CBD for example which is actually

3536
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:56,720
giving the medicinal benefit on your

3537
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,670
just in your personal experience and I

3538
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:01,280
know you mentioned earlier your fiance

3539
02:11:58,670 --> 02:12:05,300
uses for medical reasons do you find

3540
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:07,519
that the high THC strains are actually

3541
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:09,380
for the most people the most effective

3542
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:11,210
because what we're seeing in Australia

3543
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:14,510
for example is that there's a big push

3544
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:18,050
to tell people that CBD is what's the

3545
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:20,360
benefit out of marijuana and that THC is

3546
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:21,860
just this recreational side component

3547
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:23,349
that you don't really need you know like

3548
02:12:21,859 --> 02:12:26,299
do you feel like that's a total

3549
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:29,150
misrepresentation absolutely I think

3550
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:31,880
that there's no possible way that anyone

3551
02:12:29,149 --> 02:12:34,909
could purpose and tell you exactly what

3552
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:37,730
any given individual whether it be a kid

3553
02:12:34,909 --> 02:12:40,099
with seizures or someone who's going

3554
02:12:37,729 --> 02:12:42,289
through chemo what they're getting what

3555
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:44,390
in cannabis is giving them the benefit I

3556
02:12:42,289 --> 02:12:46,399
think that it's an entourage effect I

3557
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:49,039
think is what we agree to the phrase we

3558
02:12:46,399 --> 02:12:51,489
agree on you know I think that there's

3559
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:53,960
simply and now with the introduction of

3560
02:12:51,489 --> 02:12:56,689
you know I was breaking all the terpenes

3561
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:59,560
and isolating them all out understanding

3562
02:12:56,689 --> 02:13:02,389
that like these are powerful powerful

3563
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:04,970
substances terpenes terpenoids and and

3564
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:06,980
we and now we're trying to fit that into

3565
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:09,590
the puzzle so we started off with the

3566
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:10,879
taking the THC out you know you got yeah

3567
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:13,190
I mean I don't know anybody who's ever

3568
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:15,260
used marinol been raving about it you

3569
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:18,259
know so that's not what it was and then

3570
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:19,789
then the CBD and you think oh man we

3571
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:21,050
just saved the whole world of CBD and

3572
02:13:19,789 --> 02:13:23,149
now that's turning out not to be the

3573
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:25,130
case when we isolate it and give that to

3574
02:13:23,149 --> 02:13:26,719
people certainly helps with certain

3575
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:27,359
things I mean there's there's some other

3576
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:29,400
great

3577
02:13:27,359 --> 02:13:32,389
I'm not cover or probably even aware of

3578
02:13:29,399 --> 02:13:34,529
but I think that the whole plant

3579
02:13:32,389 --> 02:13:36,829
concentrated or just the whole plant

3580
02:13:34,529 --> 02:13:41,250
consumed I think seems to be the

3581
02:13:36,829 --> 02:13:42,600
universal you know kind of helps with

3582
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:44,639
everything if you know what I mean like

3583
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:47,000
it seems to me that the people who have

3584
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:50,429
the access to the high tea and see stuff

3585
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:53,010
they seem to be the ones that rave the

3586
02:13:50,429 --> 02:13:54,929
most me in my experience from what I

3587
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:56,369
hear my perception to me about the

3588
02:13:54,929 --> 02:13:57,658
benefits that they're getting from it

3589
02:13:56,368 --> 02:14:00,210
you know what I mean yeah

3590
02:13:57,658 --> 02:14:02,039
yeah cuz only I think that I think that

3591
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:04,948
that's a big misconception I think the

3592
02:14:02,039 --> 02:14:06,779
THC is a very important part of it I

3593
02:14:04,948 --> 02:14:09,960
think that you go back to what I said I

3594
02:14:06,779 --> 02:14:12,599
think that you know these things need to

3595
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:14,039
be broken down in a scientific way and

3596
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:15,719
understood before we start telling

3597
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:18,630
anybody anything about what you know

3598
02:14:15,719 --> 02:14:20,219
what I mean in the meantime millions of

3599
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:22,199
people are having positive effects on

3600
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:24,300
their life and smoking cannabis so they

3601
02:14:22,198 --> 02:14:26,279
should in the meantime while the

3602
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:27,659
government catches up to a society which

3603
02:14:26,279 --> 02:14:28,829
is basically what we're waiting for is

3604
02:14:27,658 --> 02:14:30,779
you know just the other day in the

3605
02:14:28,829 --> 02:14:32,880
United States I'm sure you know that the

3606
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:35,969
DEA after a bunch of fan for the summer

3607
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:38,730
they decided and and I gotta say like

3608
02:14:35,969 --> 02:14:40,350
how do how did what my democracy turn

3609
02:14:38,729 --> 02:14:42,509
into a place where some bureaucracy

3610
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:44,280
decides what's dangerous and what's not

3611
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:45,960
isn't that I mean couldn't we at least

3612
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:48,779
have a vote on that in Congress or

3613
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:52,010
something but yeah you know this that's

3614
02:14:48,779 --> 02:14:55,618
labor rat and they just denied they just

3615
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:57,000
you know almost in a joke you know came

3616
02:14:55,618 --> 02:14:59,158
out and said that they still think that

3617
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,569
there's zero medical benefit to this and

3618
02:14:59,158 --> 02:15:02,609
they're gonna keep it remain they're

3619
02:15:00,569 --> 02:15:04,319
gonna keep it under schedule one you

3620
02:15:02,609 --> 02:15:06,689
know as opposed to schedule two which

3621
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:10,198
would be a recognition cocaine isn't

3622
02:15:06,689 --> 02:15:11,729
scheduled to you know yeah they think

3623
02:15:10,198 --> 02:15:13,769
that that has a medical benefit as

3624
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:16,349
whereas cannabis doesn't along with

3625
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:19,230
heroin and PC and LSD for instance you

3626
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:24,659
know I mean it's

3627
02:15:19,229 --> 02:15:27,419
we're so our research and our main and

3628
02:15:24,658 --> 02:15:30,089
especially our government is is keeping

3629
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:31,800
this stuff moving at such a pace I don't

3630
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:33,869
know if we'll ever know what what the

3631
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:36,119
deal is with cannabis and and what it's

3632
02:15:33,868 --> 02:15:38,279
trying to help us with and and what the

3633
02:15:36,118 --> 02:15:40,259
what the the goal is here with that

3634
02:15:38,279 --> 02:15:41,698
plant you know and and really break it

3635
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:43,320
apart I mean here in America

3636
02:15:41,698 --> 02:15:45,329
that's what we're good at I mean I feel

3637
02:15:43,319 --> 02:15:47,159
like that's what we've been always like

3638
02:15:45,329 --> 02:15:49,050
we take something and we get down to the

3639
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:50,460
bottom of it scientifically we always

3640
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:52,500
have in the past that's what we like to

3641
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:53,939
take tell ourselves when we when we look

3642
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:55,800
at our history you know like we've got

3643
02:15:53,939 --> 02:15:59,399
we put the man on the moon we figured it

3644
02:15:55,800 --> 02:16:00,840
out you know and so you know I would

3645
02:15:59,399 --> 02:16:02,579
love to see us go in that direction I

3646
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:04,289
just don't see it happening and you know

3647
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:07,559
for obvious reasons because it's more

3648
02:16:04,289 --> 02:16:11,939
profitable right now to cage humans than

3649
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:13,620
it is to you know take less meditate

3650
02:16:11,939 --> 02:16:16,019
take people's medicine cabinets and

3651
02:16:13,619 --> 02:16:18,359
empty em and and putting a plan in there

3652
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:20,010
instead you know for many many different

3653
02:16:18,359 --> 02:16:22,939
things is so for some reason it makes

3654
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:26,219
more sense to society right now

3655
02:16:22,939 --> 02:16:28,428
officially to demonize this and

3656
02:16:26,219 --> 02:16:31,439
continuously put people in cages and

3657
02:16:28,429 --> 02:16:34,469
lawyers and judges and kernel clerks and

3658
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:36,718
the whole the whole thing and you know I

3659
02:16:34,468 --> 02:16:38,218
just don't think that I like Florida

3660
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:39,569
comes to mind the way to what they're

3661
02:16:38,218 --> 02:16:41,399
doing in Florida when you talk about the

3662
02:16:39,569 --> 02:16:43,888
CBD thing that they're trying there's a

3663
02:16:41,399 --> 02:16:46,468
lot of states where and at the beginning

3664
02:16:43,888 --> 02:16:48,509
it was a warm fuzzy thing oh we're gonna

3665
02:16:46,468 --> 02:16:50,848
have CBD like South Carolina for all

3666
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:52,679
places that you can you can have CBD oil

3667
02:16:50,849 --> 02:16:55,019
there you can even import it into the

3668
02:16:52,679 --> 02:16:56,879
state I understand my family some of my

3669
02:16:55,019 --> 02:16:58,500
family lives there it's like and it's

3670
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:00,929
like the most backwards conservative

3671
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:03,179
place and then Florida and Georgia and

3672
02:17:00,929 --> 02:17:05,210
to me it's like they're jumping the gun

3673
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:07,739
I understand what they're doing and I

3674
02:17:05,209 --> 02:17:10,619
respect that they're trying to help you

3675
02:17:07,739 --> 02:17:13,138
know I think that that when a when a

3676
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:15,300
small child is having seizures and is

3677
02:17:13,138 --> 02:17:18,029
having a horrible life it compels even

3678
02:17:15,299 --> 02:17:20,638
these guys who can't see past their own

3679
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:22,170
biases towards this plant they can see

3680
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:25,018
past it just enough to help those people

3681
02:17:22,170 --> 02:17:26,219
but they're making laws you know and

3682
02:17:25,019 --> 02:17:29,179
those laws will have to be changed

3683
02:17:26,218 --> 02:17:31,619
they're gonna have to be you know

3684
02:17:29,179 --> 02:17:33,299
rearranged they're gonna have to be you

3685
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:35,729
know revisited it sometime in the future

3686
02:17:33,299 --> 02:17:37,379
as a science comes out so and I just

3687
02:17:35,728 --> 02:17:38,760
think yeah be cautious with that you

3688
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:41,699
know because we don't really know you

3689
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:44,610
know THC is it's powerful medicine and

3690
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:46,860
you know it's it's our bodies receives

3691
02:17:44,610 --> 02:17:49,920
it well so it's got to be something to

3692
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:52,769
it right yeah so do you think that um

3693
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:55,019
for new countries that are just kind of

3694
02:17:52,769 --> 02:17:57,568
writing their own legislation

3695
02:17:55,019 --> 02:18:00,148
think that the most important thing to

3696
02:17:57,568 --> 02:18:01,888
maintain is that you need to be able to

3697
02:18:00,148 --> 02:18:06,658
grow your own medicine or do you think

3698
02:18:01,888 --> 02:18:09,568
that you know it's maybe okay to forgo

3699
02:18:06,658 --> 02:18:12,420
that right just to be able to say get it

3700
02:18:09,568 --> 02:18:13,799
from say a mass supplier because just

3701
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:16,648
for it to give some context to this

3702
02:18:13,799 --> 02:18:18,840
question Australia currently the model

3703
02:18:16,648 --> 02:18:21,090
proposed is looking like you won't be

3704
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:22,949
able to grow it yourself but you know

3705
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:24,929
some big Philip Morris and tobacco

3706
02:18:22,949 --> 02:18:26,939
conglomerate will probably be producing

3707
02:18:24,929 --> 02:18:28,949
a ton of it do you think that we should

3708
02:18:26,939 --> 02:18:30,689
compromise for that or they at the end

3709
02:18:28,949 --> 02:18:34,949
of the day growing your own needs to be

3710
02:18:30,689 --> 02:18:37,229
the end goal I think that well and

3711
02:18:34,949 --> 02:18:38,609
you're saying that they're talking about

3712
02:18:37,228 --> 02:18:41,728
doing this in a medical aspect not

3713
02:18:38,609 --> 02:18:47,609
recreational yes no recreational only

3714
02:18:41,728 --> 02:18:49,340
medical yeah I I and as I get older I'm

3715
02:18:47,609 --> 02:18:51,869
more this way I truly believe that

3716
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:54,568
self-reliance is is one of the highest

3717
02:18:51,869 --> 02:18:57,349
of human qualities you know like growing

3718
02:18:54,568 --> 02:18:59,879
around food making sure that your your

3719
02:18:57,349 --> 02:19:01,558
location the place where you call home

3720
02:18:59,879 --> 02:19:03,238
that's good clean source of water and

3721
02:19:01,558 --> 02:19:05,398
figuring out how to make it clean if

3722
02:19:03,238 --> 02:19:09,029
it's not clean and growing your own

3723
02:19:05,398 --> 02:19:13,439
cannabis as part of that so I I can't

3724
02:19:09,029 --> 02:19:14,819
see it any other way I cannot I you know

3725
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:16,199
companies that you're speaking of like

3726
02:19:14,818 --> 02:19:17,368
that not just feel remorse and those

3727
02:19:16,199 --> 02:19:19,349
types of comments but even like just

3728
02:19:17,369 --> 02:19:22,019
bigger companies that provide things

3729
02:19:19,349 --> 02:19:24,929
that people use every day in life safe

3730
02:19:22,019 --> 02:19:26,250
food and things like this I'm to me it's

3731
02:19:24,929 --> 02:19:30,840
really important to get away from all

3732
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:33,629
that and to find more local sources and

3733
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:35,670
and more importantly produce things that

3734
02:19:33,629 --> 02:19:39,299
you can for yourself you know because I

3735
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:42,328
think that I just think that if we all

3736
02:19:39,299 --> 02:19:43,948
do that life the Machine slows down to

3737
02:19:42,328 --> 02:19:46,859
the point where we can maybe have a

3738
02:19:43,949 --> 02:19:49,260
sustainable spaceship here on earth

3739
02:19:46,859 --> 02:19:50,760
you know and that if if people spent

3740
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:53,130
more time trying to take care of their

3741
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:55,439
more basic needs on their own not like

3742
02:19:53,129 --> 02:19:58,738
oh no you've got to take care of that

3743
02:19:55,439 --> 02:20:00,720
not in a mean way but like as in this is

3744
02:19:58,738 --> 02:20:02,459
what I'm you know this is what we want

3745
02:20:00,719 --> 02:20:04,500
our society to be like people you know

3746
02:20:02,459 --> 02:20:07,709
families take being self-reliant you

3747
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:08,521
know and learning how to like be healthy

3748
02:20:07,709 --> 02:20:11,279
and

3749
02:20:08,521 --> 02:20:13,141
feed themselves without help from the

3750
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:16,650
companies the corporations and the

3751
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:17,880
government and all that so with that in

3752
02:20:16,649 --> 02:20:19,921
mind there's no other way for me to

3753
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:21,720
think about I I really think that

3754
02:20:19,921 --> 02:20:23,280
cannabis plan is no different than the

3755
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:25,439
tomato plant and they you should be able

3756
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:26,761
to grow either one it's just something

3757
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:32,251
you're consuming you know what I mean

3758
02:20:26,761 --> 02:20:33,601
all right with that being said yeah like

3759
02:20:32,251 --> 02:20:36,870
I said before not everybody's gonna be

3760
02:20:33,601 --> 02:20:38,489
able to do that various reasons and I

3761
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:39,751
think that you have to have that right

3762
02:20:38,489 --> 02:20:42,181
to do that though I feel like you have

3763
02:20:39,751 --> 02:20:44,489
to you have to it's just a plant and and

3764
02:20:42,181 --> 02:20:46,591
by the way if you have a system where

3765
02:20:44,489 --> 02:20:49,140
you're not allowed to grow but you can

3766
02:20:46,591 --> 02:20:50,310
buy it from whatever people are still

3767
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:52,470
gonna grow so what did you really

3768
02:20:50,310 --> 02:20:54,810
accomplish you know I mean you just made

3769
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:56,761
some more laws you just you just and

3770
02:20:54,810 --> 02:20:58,470
without even trying you just made some

3771
02:20:56,761 --> 02:20:59,640
more penalties for people in life you

3772
02:20:58,470 --> 02:21:02,189
know cuz people are still gonna grow

3773
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:04,739
their own pot you know I can I can get

3774
02:21:02,190 --> 02:21:07,381
you know [ __ ] I don't even know we're

3775
02:21:04,739 --> 02:21:09,751
trying to think of a good example eggs

3776
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:11,760
right I can get eggs from the factory

3777
02:21:09,751 --> 02:21:13,110
farm at the state ethics store but I

3778
02:21:11,761 --> 02:21:15,301
have my own chickens and I get my

3779
02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:17,431
excellent chicken so I can eat GMO free

3780
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:18,989
eggs you know what I'm saying I should

3781
02:21:17,431 --> 02:21:20,551
have well right you know I shouldn't

3782
02:21:18,989 --> 02:21:22,229
have to be forced to go deal with some

3783
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:24,810
company that has different values of me

3784
02:21:22,229 --> 02:21:28,770
you know yeah exactly

3785
02:21:24,810 --> 02:21:30,091
so if we just kind of sorry going I was

3786
02:21:28,771 --> 02:21:31,471
just say I think that's really important

3787
02:21:30,091 --> 02:21:33,120
actually I think that's really important

3788
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:35,850
to fight against that in it and I think

3789
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:37,290
that they're they're just at one little

3790
02:21:35,851 --> 02:21:39,060
addition to what I was saying I don't

3791
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:41,070
think that you should make that

3792
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:44,011
compromise I really don't I think that

3793
02:21:41,069 --> 02:21:45,779
you know here in California 2010 we had

3794
02:21:44,011 --> 02:21:47,729
a legalization thing I think it was

3795
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:50,730
called proposition 10 or 20 or something

3796
02:21:47,729 --> 02:21:52,560
I can't remember but it failed and it

3797
02:21:50,729 --> 02:21:54,390
failed because it was wrong it in

3798
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:57,001
legalized cannabis but it also created

3799
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:58,560
other laws that more penalties for

3800
02:21:57,001 --> 02:22:00,630
things that people were doing like for

3801
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,251
instance there was uh there was some

3802
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:04,109
sort of clause in there where you had to

3803
02:22:02,251 --> 02:22:08,460
have your you know your cannabis there

3804
02:22:04,110 --> 02:22:10,681
was extra there was new penalties for

3805
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:12,300
for people who had children or children

3806
02:22:10,681 --> 02:22:14,370
around their cannabis grows or a

3807
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:16,529
cannabis situation in some way and it

3808
02:22:14,370 --> 02:22:18,061
lost you know it surprisingly lost

3809
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:19,409
because you know the voters of

3810
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:21,479
California look took all this into

3811
02:22:19,409 --> 02:22:22,209
account and many people in California

3812
02:22:21,479 --> 02:22:24,520
girl Canada

3813
02:22:22,209 --> 02:22:25,989
says you know and it failed because you

3814
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:27,970
know we couldn't make those compromises

3815
02:22:25,989 --> 02:22:30,219
just to have legalization we just

3816
02:22:27,969 --> 02:22:33,789
couldn't do that now here again with a

3817
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:36,279
um a proposition 64 coming in November

3818
02:22:33,790 --> 02:22:38,050
you know it's not doing so well in the

3819
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:40,420
community because people are having the

3820
02:22:38,049 --> 02:22:42,939
same kind of questions or like does this

3821
02:22:40,420 --> 02:22:45,309
protect the small growers or not and and

3822
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:46,720
in the answers are really unclear so you

3823
02:22:45,309 --> 02:22:48,789
go to where the money is and who the

3824
02:22:46,719 --> 02:22:51,699
backers are and it gets even more

3825
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:55,000
unclear so now we don't know and I do

3826
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:57,159
see you know to your point of the

3827
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,600
question that you know there is a

3828
02:22:57,159 --> 02:23:01,000
compromise that has to be made I mean

3829
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:02,229
you have to like you know you use going

3830
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:05,680
to be a compromiser it's gonna be

3831
02:23:02,228 --> 02:23:07,389
winners just gonna be losers right you

3832
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:09,159
don't want to see new penalties and I

3833
02:23:07,389 --> 02:23:11,019
think that anything that says you can't

3834
02:23:09,159 --> 02:23:12,670
grow is a terrible idea because it's you

3835
02:23:11,020 --> 02:23:14,170
really you're really just creating more

3836
02:23:12,670 --> 02:23:16,210
criminals when you do that you know if

3837
02:23:14,170 --> 02:23:17,889
you can't grow plants you're creating

3838
02:23:16,209 --> 02:23:19,419
environment whether it's criminals you

3839
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:21,039
know and when I say criminals I mean

3840
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:22,420
dudes like me I ain't a criminal but you

3841
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:26,500
know people who were breaking the law

3842
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:28,210
you know what I mean yeah and so this is

3843
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:30,700
kind of a little bit of left field

3844
02:23:28,209 --> 02:23:33,459
question but I wanted to ask what's your

3845
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:37,150
thoughts on the concentration community

3846
02:23:33,459 --> 02:23:38,919
and maybe the possible kind of negative

3847
02:23:37,149 --> 02:23:41,949
impact they have on our image in our

3848
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:44,139
last episode Duke reference that you

3849
02:23:41,950 --> 02:23:46,120
know some of the people who are you know

3850
02:23:44,139 --> 02:23:48,279
really heavily on to concentrates these

3851
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:51,700
days more resemble crack addicts than

3852
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:53,530
marijuana users do you think that that's

3853
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:54,640
potentially like a negative thing or do

3854
02:23:53,530 --> 02:23:56,650
you think on the whole we should just

3855
02:23:54,639 --> 02:24:01,809
try to push the stoner image and make it

3856
02:23:56,649 --> 02:24:05,529
more mainstream I know you're saying

3857
02:24:01,809 --> 02:24:10,569
about the image and I think it's kind of

3858
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:12,610
I think it's kind of funny too I it's

3859
02:24:10,569 --> 02:24:14,409
big it's gotten big it's kind of hard to

3860
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:15,880
I don't even know how to put my whole

3861
02:24:14,409 --> 02:24:18,610
opinion on this yet I don't think I've

3862
02:24:15,879 --> 02:24:21,309
even formal opinion but I think that you

3863
02:24:18,610 --> 02:24:23,020
know it it's that's that's not going

3864
02:24:21,309 --> 02:24:25,420
away I can tell you that much you might

3865
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:27,610
get more refined in better processes and

3866
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:29,500
and standards but it's not going away

3867
02:24:27,610 --> 02:24:32,739
that's definitely popular thing you know

3868
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:34,750
I I smoked the rosin I really like that

3869
02:24:32,739 --> 02:24:36,069
and that's it's not because of Vernie

3870
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:37,870
it's not like I'm

3871
02:24:36,069 --> 02:24:40,389
tie solvent or anything like that it's

3872
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:42,340
just I really love it goes back to being

3873
02:24:40,389 --> 02:24:44,109
self-reliant you know I mean like I

3874
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:45,250
don't have time to make hash hole or

3875
02:24:44,110 --> 02:24:47,530
anything like that no I don't really

3876
02:24:45,250 --> 02:24:50,379
have a desire to I've messed around with

3877
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:52,590
it and it's not that interesting to me

3878
02:24:50,379 --> 02:24:55,479
really like I feel like the ceiling of

3879
02:24:52,590 --> 02:24:57,250
what captivates my imagination about

3880
02:24:55,479 --> 02:25:00,789
learning something new I hit it really

3881
02:24:57,250 --> 02:25:02,500
quick it was like oh okay and so Rosen

3882
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:04,060
it's like a self-reliant thinking I love

3883
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:06,159
the fact that I can take my favorite

3884
02:25:04,059 --> 02:25:07,600
strain you said it's smoking someone

3885
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:10,539
else's trim that's been made into a

3886
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:11,620
concentrate right or even luckily if

3887
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:13,630
you're lucky enough smoking they're

3888
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:15,070
fresh frozen live resin I think they

3889
02:25:13,629 --> 02:25:16,539
call it they've made into the contrary

3890
02:25:15,069 --> 02:25:19,059
which I love that stuff you know yeah

3891
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:21,130
and there's amazing products coming out

3892
02:25:19,059 --> 02:25:23,439
they're just mind-boggling it's like wow

3893
02:25:21,129 --> 02:25:26,439
this tastes so good how did you do this

3894
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:28,210
and then but I love the fact that I can

3895
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:30,430
just take one of my own buds

3896
02:25:28,209 --> 02:25:32,289
stick it in some paper and smoosh it and

3897
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:34,271
then do a debt because I really like the

3898
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:35,740
ritual of doing a dab I enjoy that it's

3899
02:25:34,271 --> 02:25:40,900
something I've learned I enjoy night I

3900
02:25:35,739 --> 02:25:42,819
don't like smoke I really have a really

3901
02:25:40,899 --> 02:25:45,789
strong I feel like I have a really

3902
02:25:42,819 --> 02:25:48,670
strong sense of smell and smoke even

3903
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:51,910
cannabis like it a grenades me it really

3904
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:53,649
I had allergies in the spring and so I

3905
02:25:51,909 --> 02:25:55,750
got like a sensitive I feel like a

3906
02:25:53,649 --> 02:25:57,340
respiratory system and smoking anything

3907
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:59,979
is not my favorite thing to do you know

3908
02:25:57,340 --> 02:26:01,420
I mean so now I'm not saying I want to

3909
02:25:59,979 --> 02:26:04,329
eat because I don't like eating cannabis

3910
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:05,710
as much as I like the instant smoking

3911
02:26:04,329 --> 02:26:10,539
the instant effect I like that

3912
02:26:05,709 --> 02:26:12,699
instantaneous effect so I feel like it's

3913
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:14,740
it's it satisfies me in the way because

3914
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:16,510
it's self it's just so for lying like I

3915
02:26:14,739 --> 02:26:18,159
I have everything I need right in my

3916
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:20,649
kitchen just to quickly make up a DAB

3917
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:23,049
and I think it tastes great I love it

3918
02:26:20,649 --> 02:26:24,699
and you know it's not you know and

3919
02:26:23,049 --> 02:26:27,250
people who were hearing us who make dabs

3920
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:30,220
or slabs are gonna go oh god not the

3921
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:31,780
rosin because it's so they're so hard on

3922
02:26:30,219 --> 02:26:34,029
it but it's actually you know it's

3923
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:35,380
pretty damn good and uh you know I get

3924
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:36,730
to smoke the flavors I want to smoke

3925
02:26:35,379 --> 02:26:38,829
instead of settling for some other

3926
02:26:36,729 --> 02:26:40,659
strain that somebody else you know did

3927
02:26:38,829 --> 02:26:43,329
it with and I get to slow you know Kim

3928
02:26:40,659 --> 02:26:46,209
dog you know so but thus far as the

3929
02:26:43,329 --> 02:26:48,459
image goes you know it doesn't look good

3930
02:26:46,209 --> 02:26:49,988
but it's definitely so mainstream now

3931
02:26:48,459 --> 02:26:51,789
that I think that

3932
02:26:49,988 --> 02:26:53,379
the public's perception of its changing

3933
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:56,380
and it doesn't look as bad as it did

3934
02:26:53,379 --> 02:26:58,929
three years ago as long as people don't

3935
02:26:56,379 --> 02:27:03,789
blow up houses continuously that which a

3936
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:05,920
lot of us can go yeah so in terms of all

3937
02:27:03,790 --> 02:27:07,840
the recent breed is kind of coming out

3938
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:10,299
of the Woodworks what's your feelings on

3939
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:11,949
this and I guess more specifically how

3940
02:27:10,299 --> 02:27:16,090
do you feel about kind of companies

3941
02:27:11,949 --> 02:27:17,890
using the chem dog name as a way of you

3942
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:19,779
know trying to boost their product you

3943
02:27:17,889 --> 02:27:20,978
know do you think it's like you know do

3944
02:27:19,779 --> 02:27:22,750
you ever want to call these people out

3945
02:27:20,978 --> 02:27:24,398
or do you just think like look the end

3946
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:25,750
of the day everyone's always going to

3947
02:27:24,398 --> 02:27:28,059
try to say they've got like you know

3948
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:30,010
quote the highest quality ingredients in

3949
02:27:28,059 --> 02:27:31,629
their product and you know by the

3950
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:34,180
natural extension people are going to

3951
02:27:31,629 --> 02:27:35,799
lie and say the chem dog is the real kam

3952
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:38,020
dogs used in their strain when maybe

3953
02:27:35,799 --> 02:27:39,398
it's not or heck I've even seen strains

3954
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:40,930
that don't even have chem dog in it and

3955
02:27:39,398 --> 02:27:43,959
they've got like chem dog references in

3956
02:27:40,930 --> 02:27:46,000
the name oh yeah yeah I got you know

3957
02:27:43,959 --> 02:27:47,409
yeah there's some there's some companies

3958
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,939
that have used that name and they've

3959
02:27:47,409 --> 02:27:50,680
really done well with it you know you

3960
02:27:48,939 --> 02:27:54,430
mentioned earlier and I can think of one

3961
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:56,559
other one and when I first saw that when

3962

but you know and of course it made me

3989
02:28:51,309 --> 02:28:53,978
feel a certain kind of way and it was

02:29:01,449 --> 02:29:05,899
trillion dollars off of

3997
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:09,289
I you know but you know at the end of

3998
02:29:05,898 --> 02:29:11,028
the day I'm not really it's not my mo to

3999

4000
02:29:11,029 --> 02:29:17,479
thing like I said it will all be sitting

4001
02:29:13,699 --> 02:29:19,489
around you know at a table so to speak

4002
02:29:17,478 --> 02:29:21,559

02:29:33,199 --> 02:29:37,998
energy to go around and police that or

4010

4013
02:29:43,369 --> 02:29:47,239

4016
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:53,149
chem dog no you don't look good I mean

4017
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:55,699
how many times does that happen where

4018
02:29:53,148 --> 02:29:58,248
you like you smoke a joint someone tells

4019
02:29:55,699 --> 02:29:59,748
you can dog here like here dudes hit

4020
02:29:58,248 --> 02:30:01,760

4022
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,959
you know that's the chem dog I don't

4023
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:07,609
know why you just smoothly left the

4024
02:30:05,959 --> 02:30:08,989
killed oh so that's kinda what I'm

4025
02:30:07,609 --> 02:30:11,630
saying it's like you know do your thing

4026
02:30:08,988 --> 02:30:14,840
and make you make it happen

4027
02:30:11,629 --> 02:30:17,148
and and if you just tell the truth man

4028
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:18,949
you know like live live live by the

4029
02:30:17,148 --> 02:30:20,568
golden rule and then you don't have to

4030
02:30:18,949 --> 02:30:22,340
lie you don't have to make up a [ __ ]

4031
02:30:20,568 --> 02:30:24,260
weird story for everyone to believe you

4032
02:30:22,340 --> 02:30:25,908
know just you can just tell the people

4033
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:27,619
the truth if you lived your life right

4034
02:30:25,908 --> 02:30:28,908
away you know what I'm saying yeah I

4035
02:30:27,619 --> 02:30:31,100
think you know I think in the end it's

4036
02:30:28,908 --> 02:30:33,828
all it's all gonna sort itself out are

4037
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:35,869
those people crushing it they are there

4038
02:30:33,828 --> 02:30:37,728
definitely are will they be crushing it

4039
02:30:35,869 --> 02:30:40,220
five years from now I don't know but you

4040
02:30:37,728 --> 02:30:42,498
know I just think that you know I think

4041
02:30:40,219 --> 02:30:44,568
that the truth in the end of the day you

4042
02:30:42,498 --> 02:30:45,738
know is it's what people are interested

4043
02:30:44,568 --> 02:30:47,600
in you know they don't want to hear the

4044
02:30:45,738 --> 02:30:48,738
[ __ ] a lot you know I mean there's

4045
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,568
some of these people we've talked about

4046
02:30:48,738 --> 02:30:51,920
you know I mean I'm not here to talk

4047
02:30:50,568 --> 02:30:53,809
[ __ ] about anyway but some of them you

4048
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,639
know some of them you know they [ __ ]

4049
02:30:53,809 --> 02:30:58,038
played and Lily lied and known about it

4050
02:30:55,639 --> 02:31:00,858
and and they've gotten really successful

4051
02:30:58,039 --> 02:31:02,840
and I practically famous for some of the

4052
02:31:00,859 --> 02:31:04,520
you know for their company whatever

4053
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,770
their thing is in their lie or whatever

4054
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:08,689
and I think it just sorts itself out end

4055
02:31:06,770 --> 02:31:12,350
of the day you know I really do I think

4056
02:31:08,689 --> 02:31:15,408
if you're a customer say some dude and

4057
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:16,729
like you know Illinois and you know you

4058
02:31:15,408 --> 02:31:18,681
want to get some

4059
02:31:16,729 --> 02:31:20,959
or something are you gonna go that guy

4060
02:31:18,681 --> 02:31:22,819
that's got funny reputation for her me

4061
02:31:20,959 --> 02:31:24,649
seeds and doesn't really can't really

4062
02:31:22,819 --> 02:31:28,159
tell you exactly where he got this the

4063
02:31:24,649 --> 02:31:29,899
the stuff he says he got you know I mean

4064
02:31:28,159 --> 02:31:32,030
are you gonna go where you know you

4065
02:31:29,899 --> 02:31:34,069
definitely know this dude is like been

4066
02:31:32,030 --> 02:31:35,540
doing this for whatever you're probably

4067
02:31:34,069 --> 02:31:36,890
gonna if you want the chem dog you're

4068
02:31:35,540 --> 02:31:38,750
gonna go where you know the chem dog

4069
02:31:36,890 --> 02:31:42,709
came from you know what I mean yeah I

4070
02:31:38,750 --> 02:31:45,771
guess yeah no don't worry

4071
02:31:42,709 --> 02:31:48,049
people will there be an exodus episode

4072
02:31:45,771 --> 02:31:49,790
so this is a kind of a last extended

4073
02:31:48,049 --> 02:31:53,659
response question then we've got some

4074
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:55,910
kind of more short answer ones so it's a

4075
02:31:53,659 --> 02:31:57,590
bit light-hearted when when talking to

4076
02:31:55,909 --> 02:31:59,989
people about chem dog and all the

4077
02:31:57,590 --> 02:32:01,851
different varieties what do you find is

4078
02:31:59,989 --> 02:32:03,440
the part that gets confused the most is

4079
02:32:01,851 --> 02:32:06,170
it the fact that there's you know

4080
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:08,840
there's the D the three the four the 91

4081
02:32:06,170 --> 02:32:10,521
and and people just confuse the names or

4082
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:12,049
do you think like it's all the different

4083
02:32:10,521 --> 02:32:14,239
aspects of the history which people

4084
02:32:12,049 --> 02:32:16,850
confuse more so like what what do you

4085
02:32:14,239 --> 02:32:18,649
find kind of maybe it's not frustrating

4086
02:32:16,851 --> 02:32:20,720
but when you're trying to talk to people

4087
02:32:18,649 --> 02:32:25,100
about it what do you find gets kind of

4088
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:26,840
you have to correct the most the volume

4089
02:32:25,101 --> 02:32:28,970
of it there's just so much [ __ ] that

4090
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:31,010
it's hard it's almost tiring to hear you

4091
02:32:28,969 --> 02:32:34,159
know let me think

4092
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:35,750
I was just gonna say if you if we

4093
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:37,129
actually look at Leafly at the Mona

4094
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:39,140
which is kind of you know the go-to

4095
02:32:37,129 --> 02:32:42,079
website for people to look up strains it

4096
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:44,119
says that chem 91 was a strain created

4097
02:32:42,079 --> 02:32:46,610
from the original chem dog cross to

4098
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:48,170
skunk I mean I understand that don't

4099
02:32:46,610 --> 02:32:50,659
they have like a big joke about them

4100
02:32:48,170 --> 02:32:53,810
saying that the Sour Diesel is an indica

4101
02:32:50,659 --> 02:32:55,610
or a hybrid and they say it's a sativa

4102
02:32:53,810 --> 02:32:58,310
and iha is trying to get them to make it

4103
02:32:55,610 --> 02:33:01,159
a hybrid yeah yeah that guy so I guess

4104
02:32:58,310 --> 02:33:03,770
there already are like kind of then been

4105
02:33:01,159 --> 02:33:05,420
notable for getting things wrong yeah so

4106
02:33:03,771 --> 02:33:07,040
I feel like they're they're getting

4107
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:08,271
their own kind of reputation in a way

4108
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,590
they're kind of making their own

4109
02:33:08,271 --> 02:33:11,829
reputation they should probably check

4110
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:14,000
their sources i remember remember that

4111
02:33:11,829 --> 02:33:15,620
canna bible do you remember that book

4112
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,659
that was coming out of California that

4113
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:19,311
was yeah you know they had they had the

4114
02:33:17,659 --> 02:33:20,840

02:33:27,681 --> 02:33:29,890
right now and they got the chem dog

4120
02:33:29,390 --> 02:33:32,709
store

4121
02:33:29,890 --> 02:33:34,750
I think that it's I think it's it would

4122
02:33:32,709 --> 02:33:36,039
have been more useful if people would

4123
02:33:34,750 --> 02:33:39,851
have taken their first-hand knowledge

4124
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:41,830
and spread that around as opposed to the

4125
02:33:39,851 --> 02:33:44,319
story they want to believe or the best

4126
02:33:41,829 --> 02:33:45,250
version they heard or however they came

4127
02:33:44,319 --> 02:33:47,409
to these things I think it would have

4128
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:49,120
been more useful to the whole community

4129
02:33:47,409 --> 02:33:51,579
if they would have just used the

4130
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:53,079
first-hand knowledge and maybe now as we

4131
02:33:51,579 --> 02:33:54,310
move forward and people can come out of

4132
02:33:53,079 --> 02:33:58,300
the shadows a little bit more who

4133
02:33:54,310 --> 02:34:00,369
actually you know know what's up do you

4134
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:03,520
know that were there then maybe that

4135
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:05,920
will sort of fix itself too but I I find

4136
02:34:03,521 --> 02:34:08,320
it it doesn't it used to be used to

4137
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:09,700
bother me more than it does now now it

4138
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:11,020
to me it's a slight it's more

4139
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:14,351
entertained than anything you're like

4140
02:34:11,021 --> 02:34:16,061
what you know well it's it's like it

4141
02:34:14,351 --> 02:34:17,829
goes back to the truth is way more

4142
02:34:16,060 --> 02:34:20,739
interesting than fiction it always it I

4143
02:34:17,829 --> 02:34:21,729
mean it's true like the best craziest

4144
02:34:20,739 --> 02:34:24,909
stories you've ever heard are true

4145
02:34:21,729 --> 02:34:26,500
stories you know and it's the same thing

4146
02:34:24,909 --> 02:34:28,181
it's like why why do you gotta make up a

4147
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:30,310
story there's the original distort what

4148
02:34:28,181 --> 02:34:31,899
actually happened it's so mind-blowing

4149
02:34:30,310 --> 02:34:33,879
ly interesting when you look at the

4150
02:34:31,899 --> 02:34:37,000
different the coincidences and the

4151
02:34:33,879 --> 02:34:40,060
chance happening the chance meetings and

4152
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,261
just like the once-in-a-lifetime events

4153
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:43,181
you know like how could that have even

4154
02:34:41,261 --> 02:34:44,979
happen that's so much more interesting

4155
02:34:43,181 --> 02:34:47,761
than you know what everybody's opinion

4156
02:34:44,979 --> 02:34:52,029
about business I can't tell you like how

4157
02:34:47,761 --> 02:34:54,101
I felt when someone questioned my story

4158
02:34:52,030 --> 02:34:56,950
when I when I finally told it to him

4159
02:34:54,101 --> 02:34:58,360
they asked me and they and they uh any

4160
02:34:56,950 --> 02:35:00,490
question like directly but they were

4161
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:02,110
like well what I heard was this it's

4162
02:35:00,489 --> 02:35:03,761
like I just told you like I said before

4163
02:35:02,110 --> 02:35:06,909
I just told you without why are you

4164
02:35:03,761 --> 02:35:10,060
trying to tell me that verse and then my

4165
02:35:06,909 --> 02:35:12,521
one of my favorite one was when the chem

4166
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:15,190
dog was being passed on that hold Jew

4167
02:35:12,521 --> 02:35:17,380
Joe Jade Joe brand thing happened and

4168
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:18,940
that faint chem dog that whatever that

4169
02:35:17,379 --> 02:35:20,739
was it to me I think it was a res dog

4170
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:23,950
Sour Diesel I think is what it was and

4171
02:35:20,739 --> 02:35:25,511
uh it was a chunky Sour Diesel I saw a

4172
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:27,040
lot of it cuz like I said I had to go

4173
02:35:25,511 --> 02:35:36,011
around and give a lot of bad news that

4174
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:37,660
summer and oh you know I would I would

4175
02:35:36,011 --> 02:35:39,220
people that were I don't want to say

4176
02:35:37,659 --> 02:35:40,959
close to me but people that were in my

4177
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:43,299
outer circles you know I would come in

4178
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:44,619
contact with them people who I was

4179
02:35:43,299 --> 02:35:46,809
well enough to talk about this stuff

4180
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:49,479
with they go look I got the chem dog

4181
02:35:46,809 --> 02:35:51,459
check it out and then you go this is not

4182
02:35:49,478 --> 02:35:52,420
the chem dog and then then you have to

4183
02:35:51,459 --> 02:35:54,459
give them a little bit of background

4184
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:57,370
about how you know that of course right

4185
02:35:54,459 --> 02:35:59,169
yeah this is the chem I know this is not

4186
02:35:57,370 --> 02:36:00,250
the Kin dog because of a B and C you

4187
02:35:59,170 --> 02:36:02,710
know like some of the things we've

4188
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:07,780
talked about and then they still call it

4189
02:36:02,709 --> 02:36:09,279
kim dog it's like dude you literally got

4190
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:11,290
right from the horse's mouth

4191
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:13,359
we're told the dis is my chem dog and

4192
02:36:11,290 --> 02:36:13,870
but and for some reason I mean give it

4193
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:15,579
another name

4194
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:18,310
just name it something else now you know

4195
02:36:15,579 --> 02:36:20,350
I'd make soaked them up man you know but

4196
02:36:18,309 --> 02:36:22,059
that's not the kim dog that was really

4197
02:36:20,350 --> 02:36:23,439
that broke me down because those were

4198
02:36:22,059 --> 02:36:26,559
some hard days for me because i'm

4199
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:28,359
telling you man like talk about units

4200
02:36:26,559 --> 02:36:30,309
and where they got to go man like hi

4201
02:36:28,359 --> 02:36:32,020
boys the kim dog has always been my

4202
02:36:30,309 --> 02:36:34,119
thing so if there's some sort of

4203
02:36:32,020 --> 02:36:36,550
confusion there man it really hit me

4204
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:37,120
hard you know what i mean yeah it was

4205
02:36:36,549 --> 02:36:38,648
frustrating

4206
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:40,510
no one point where I was like what do I

4207
02:36:38,648 --> 02:36:42,579
you have this plant for you know what I

4208
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:44,950
mean oh my let me I mean I know I had it

4209
02:36:42,579 --> 02:36:46,840
but as far as the other things are like

4210
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:48,819
you know besides smoking it know like

4211
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:50,109
what am i banging my head against this

4212
02:36:48,818 --> 02:36:53,469
wall for if you know what I mean you

4213
02:36:50,109 --> 02:36:55,960
know so there's other stories and stuff

4214
02:36:53,469 --> 02:36:59,349
you know I hear I'm gonna and I and I

4215
02:36:55,959 --> 02:37:01,559
try to try to see like where they got

4216
02:36:59,350 --> 02:37:03,460
how this do you know like when you're in

4217
02:37:01,559 --> 02:37:04,568
kindergarten and you pass a secret

4218
02:37:03,459 --> 02:37:06,250
around the room and the story's

4219
02:37:04,568 --> 02:37:08,500
different when it gets back over here I

4220
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:11,228
try to figure out how did that story get

4221
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:12,790
to be that way and sometimes I'm like I

4222
02:37:11,228 --> 02:37:14,289
think someone just made this up this

4223
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:17,260
sounds like a bunch of [ __ ] to me I

4224
02:37:14,290 --> 02:37:18,880
don't know and it's always always less

4225
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:20,710
interesting than the truth there's no

4226
02:37:18,879 --> 02:37:22,688
doubt about that I haven't had one story

4227
02:37:20,709 --> 02:37:26,728
that was like wow let's just change the

4228
02:37:22,689 --> 02:37:30,040
story to that that's way cooler yeah

4229
02:37:26,728 --> 02:37:30,909
okay so for the last little bit it's

4230
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:33,819
just some kind of light-hearted

4231
02:37:30,909 --> 02:37:35,530
questions so the first one being if you

4232
02:37:33,818 --> 02:37:37,898
could go to one place on earth at any

4233
02:37:35,530 --> 02:37:39,939
time you know presumably to collect some

4234
02:37:37,898 --> 02:37:45,099
landrace seeds where would you go and

4235
02:37:39,939 --> 02:37:49,030
what era the era that would be hard I

4236
02:37:45,100 --> 02:37:50,920
would say I would say I would like to go

4237
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:52,750
to the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan

4238
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:54,920
the high the high mountains of

4239
02:37:52,750 --> 02:37:57,180
Afghanistan and

4240
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:59,069
and see what they had up there cuz

4241
02:37:57,180 --> 02:38:01,229
that's that's my favorite that's the

4242
02:37:59,069 --> 02:38:03,479
cannabis that speaks to me the most you

4243
02:38:01,229 --> 02:38:06,840
know I would have liked to have been I

4244
02:38:03,479 --> 02:38:09,059
there's a legend that uh the skunk was

4245
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:10,860
found in in the wild you know in the

4246
02:38:09,059 --> 02:38:13,350
Ohio River Valley somewhere in Kentucky

4247
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:14,640
or Ohio and I would have loved to have

4248
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:17,760
been there when that happened you know

4249
02:38:14,639 --> 02:38:20,459
when not necessarily in the wild as

4250
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:24,600
legend goes but knew that it was uh that

4251
02:38:20,459 --> 02:38:26,369
the people that that had it that passed

4252
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:27,870
it on that's what they found it and that

4253
02:38:26,370 --> 02:38:29,400
that there that the legend that they

4254
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:31,320
were going off was that the Native

4255
02:38:29,399 --> 02:38:32,940
Americans there had been working with it

4256
02:38:31,319 --> 02:38:35,219
and they there was a sacred plant to

4257
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:37,500
them I would love him known for that

4258
02:38:35,219 --> 02:38:39,239
see and they're the streets that moment

4259
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:41,610
when that whole realization you know

4260
02:38:39,239 --> 02:38:44,670
happened and and then when I looked at

4261
02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:47,190
the catalog and I see the man standing

4262
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:49,020
in the you know like bunker in front of

4263
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:50,370
all the hash and and I'm looking around

4264
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:52,829
and I'm and I hey like you got this

4265
02:38:50,370 --> 02:38:55,860
white dude you know and and he's like

4266
02:38:52,829 --> 02:38:57,870
standing there with like these you know

4267
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:59,940
these these soldiers warriors you know

4268
02:38:57,870 --> 02:39:04,560
the family men the Warriors fighting the

4269
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:06,840
the the Soviet empire and somehow some

4270
02:39:04,559 --> 02:39:08,699
way this guy gains enough trust to go

4271
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:10,139
and look at the big hedge - you know

4272
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:12,560
look at the spot when they're keeping

4273
02:39:10,139 --> 02:39:14,849
all the hash you know that be I mean

4274
02:39:12,559 --> 02:39:16,229
that's that couldn't imagine a more

4275
02:39:14,850 --> 02:39:17,579
powerful moment than that as far as

4276
02:39:16,229 --> 02:39:19,139
Garrett was because I mean that's just

4277
02:39:17,579 --> 02:39:21,299
that's some that's some serious

4278
02:39:19,139 --> 02:39:23,219
networking that's before email yeah I

4279
02:39:21,299 --> 02:39:25,229
mean that's just like how did that

4280
02:39:23,219 --> 02:39:28,319
happen that's amazing what a

4281
02:39:25,229 --> 02:39:30,689
contribution you know yeah I could only

4282
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:32,399
hope that um one day I'd be out of chat

4283
02:39:30,690 --> 02:39:34,829
to Neville about how that'll happen and

4284
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:35,340
hopefully he'd share so everybody know

4285
02:39:34,829 --> 02:39:38,370
where he's at

4286
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:41,729
yeah he's um he's currently in Australia

4287
02:39:38,370 --> 02:39:43,950
so not too far from me but unfortunately

4288
02:39:41,729 --> 02:39:46,559
he's actually battling some cancer at

4289
02:39:43,950 --> 02:39:49,590
the moment so I'm not too confident he'd

4290
02:39:46,559 --> 02:39:50,969
be kind of up to feeling out to doing it

4291
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:54,239
interview but I'm you know we obviously

4292
02:39:50,969 --> 02:39:56,039
send our best wishes to him yeah you

4293
02:39:54,239 --> 02:40:00,030
know I like what's out there for sure

4294
02:39:56,040 --> 02:40:01,440
because to me that guy he made the

4295
02:40:00,030 --> 02:40:03,600
biggest contribution to contemporary

4296
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:05,399
cannabis that there were there won't be

4297
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:06,780
a bigger contributed contribution than

4298
02:40:05,399 --> 02:40:07,750
that you know just collecting all that

4299
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:10,630
working

4300
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:12,068
and and giving it to the world and to

4301
02:40:10,629 --> 02:40:15,278
heat it in the height of the drug war

4302
02:40:12,068 --> 02:40:18,430
was just I mean thank you you know he

4303
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:20,229
only yeah he certainly I mean him in I

4304
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:22,450
think shanti barber was also done you

4305
02:40:20,228 --> 02:40:23,709
know some comparable amount of work but

4306
02:40:22,450 --> 02:40:25,750
yeah i think they definitely have done a

4307
02:40:23,709 --> 02:40:27,099
lot especially in terms of like just

4308
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:29,648
laying the groundwork for future people

4309
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:31,750
if nothing else yeah i mean certainly

4310
02:40:29,648 --> 02:40:32,349
something to shoot for you know no doubt

4311
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:35,680
about it

4312
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:37,720
yep so on to our next question this one

4313
02:40:35,680 --> 02:40:39,068
more you might have to struggle about it

4314
02:40:37,719 --> 02:40:40,778
cuz i think you might want to give more

4315
02:40:39,068 --> 02:40:43,449
than one but if you could only change

4316
02:40:40,779 --> 02:40:51,460
one thing about the 91 what would it be

4317
02:40:43,450 --> 02:40:54,579
i would want it to go back I would

4318
02:40:51,459 --> 02:40:57,549
it's last I thought talking notes it's

4319
02:40:54,579 --> 02:40:59,859
lost a note or two on the flavor since I

4320
02:40:57,549 --> 02:41:04,988
got it I would like there was this deep

4321
02:40:59,859 --> 02:41:07,180
dark dark earthy flavor that you get it

4322
02:41:04,988 --> 02:41:09,939
but it's it's diminished somewhat and I

4323
02:41:07,180 --> 02:41:13,300
would like for that to come back and but

4324
02:41:09,939 --> 02:41:16,689
overall without going back to something

4325
02:41:13,299 --> 02:41:18,670
that maybe was lost with it I don't know

4326
02:41:16,689 --> 02:41:20,859
I would it's hard for me to say cuz it's

4327
02:41:18,670 --> 02:41:25,450
a it's you know I would like it to be

4328
02:41:20,859 --> 02:41:27,550
more you know chunky and you know the

4329
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:29,109
shape to be a little bit tighter on the

4330
02:41:27,549 --> 02:41:31,988
tops and the edges like we were talking

4331
02:41:29,109 --> 02:41:34,059
about earlier you know I wished uh I

4332
02:41:31,988 --> 02:41:35,559
don't think it's the prettiest spot in

4333
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:37,809
the world you know I don't think it is

4334
02:41:35,559 --> 02:41:40,420
so I would say that you know I think

4335
02:41:37,809 --> 02:41:44,199
that on all the things we judge cannabis

4336
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:46,568
on I think that's probably gets more

4337
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:49,180
attention that deserves the look of it

4338
02:41:46,568 --> 02:41:51,159
you know yeah but uh opposed to the

4339
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:54,130
flavor and the smell and of course the

4340
02:41:51,159 --> 02:41:55,510
drug traits but I would say that that

4341
02:41:54,129 --> 02:41:57,309
would be the one thing that I would want

4342
02:41:55,510 --> 02:41:59,439
to look look just looked a little bit

4343
02:41:57,309 --> 02:42:04,590
nicer you know like more shaped more

4344
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:08,620
shaped buds and more uniform on that yes

4345
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:10,420
okay so when you I'm a big I'm a big fan

4346
02:42:08,620 --> 02:42:12,340
of the chem dog i there's not it doesn't

4347
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:13,870
help answer because i really don't see

4348
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:16,029
how you can make something much more

4349
02:42:13,870 --> 02:42:16,689
better than that you know yeah yeah I

4350
02:42:16,029 --> 02:42:18,609
understand

4351
02:42:16,689 --> 02:42:20,800
so um so when you do get the seed

4352
02:42:18,609 --> 02:42:21,761
company up and running I know that

4353
02:42:20,799 --> 02:42:24,790
you've obviously got

4354
02:42:21,761 --> 02:42:27,610
and personal goals to get done have you

4355
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:28,750
however considered possibly doing a

4356
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:30,221
collab with someone have you ever

4357
02:42:28,751 --> 02:42:32,081
thought like I'd love to get my own

4358
02:42:30,220 --> 02:42:33,880
stuff going and then you know like Dukes

4359
02:42:32,081 --> 02:42:35,911
got some cool stuff going on maybe we

4360
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:37,979
could do a collab or something

4361
02:42:35,911 --> 02:42:41,470
absolutely yeah

4362
02:42:37,979 --> 02:42:43,390
Dukes actually he's uh he's really

4363
02:42:41,470 --> 02:42:46,479
inspired me when it comes to the to the

4364
02:42:43,390 --> 02:42:49,060
breeding like he's opened my eyes to the

4365
02:42:46,479 --> 02:42:51,460
different possibilities with it you know

4366
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:53,529
and it's really kind of inspired me so

4367
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:55,359
you know I would certainly be interested

4368
02:42:53,530 --> 02:42:56,891
in doing that absolutely I think that

4369
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:58,541
those kinds of things are gonna that's

4370
02:42:56,890 --> 02:43:01,569
where the real magic is gonna happen

4371
02:42:58,540 --> 02:43:03,250
when people with their own views get

4372
02:43:01,569 --> 02:43:05,411
together and make something like

4373
02:43:03,251 --> 02:43:07,091
basically a new thing you know like I

4374
02:43:05,411 --> 02:43:08,620
think that's where a lot of the mag's

4375
02:43:07,091 --> 02:43:10,899
gonna happen I look forward to that you

4376
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:13,300
know as we go down the road here yes

4377
02:43:10,899 --> 02:43:16,899
awesome so what do you think are some of

4378
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:18,550
the most overhyped / worst Raelians

4379
02:43:16,899 --> 02:43:22,931
you've ever had / you know biggest

4380
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:24,671
disappointments oh no you're gonna

4381
02:43:22,931 --> 02:43:27,101
you're gonna hate the answer the Kim D

4382
02:43:24,671 --> 02:43:29,201
was definitely my I don't really I'm not

4383
02:43:27,101 --> 02:43:30,371
impressed with that one I'm just not I

4384
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:33,640
don't get it

4385
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:36,279
it is very medicinal I will say I it's

4386
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:37,690
really good for anxiety the people who

4387
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:43,690
are the patients that I'm in contact

4388
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:46,541
with they Kim dog is is Kim dog can

4389
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:48,671
actually if if you're if you're not in

4390
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:52,300
every user Kim dog can actually make

4391
02:43:48,671 --> 02:43:55,720
anxiety worse and in the short term it's

4392
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:57,790
just really strong but that they can the

4393
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:59,710
Kim D have noticed that the patients

4394
02:43:57,790 --> 02:44:01,750
that I'm in contact with who have

4395
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:03,340
anxiety problems which is you know

4396
02:44:01,751 --> 02:44:06,181
you're talking sixty percent of the

4397
02:44:03,341 --> 02:44:08,351
patients you come to that's they're

4398
02:44:06,181 --> 02:44:09,971
understandably they're emmaus they're

4399
02:44:08,351 --> 02:44:12,371
their number one concern with their

4400
02:44:09,970 --> 02:44:14,649
health you know was regards the cannabis

4401
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:16,840
is their anxiety and that one really

4402
02:44:14,649 --> 02:44:17,859
does seem to help because it's I don't

4403
02:44:16,841 --> 02:44:20,021
really know where it comes out on the

4404
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:21,791
THC scale and of course you know I don't

4405
02:44:20,021 --> 02:44:23,621
think THC like we were talking earlier

4406
02:44:21,790 --> 02:44:25,600
is the whole picture I think this dr. oz

4407
02:44:23,620 --> 02:44:28,359
you know you could have a strong THC and

4408
02:44:25,601 --> 02:44:30,371
not have a real psychedelic type of

4409
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:32,771
cannabis like say the can of the chem

4410
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:35,619
dog can be to people so I don't know how

4411
02:44:32,771 --> 02:44:37,000
that's tied and for some reason my fee

4412
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:38,740
back from people is that it's really

4413
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,209
good for anxiety to me it's just

4414
02:44:38,739 --> 02:44:42,549
disappointing I don't like that smell

4415
02:44:40,209 --> 02:44:46,479
you know when you got people describing

4416
02:44:42,549 --> 02:44:57,299
Kim Kim D smell as rotting meat garlic

4417
02:44:46,479 --> 02:44:59,469
it's like I've had a description a lot

4418
02:44:57,299 --> 02:45:02,020
yeah I'm just like why I don't

4419
02:44:59,469 --> 02:45:03,699
understand that one but but then of

4420
02:45:02,021 --> 02:45:06,101
course I smoked something smells like

4421
02:45:03,700 --> 02:45:09,430
you know fuel to people some people

4422
02:45:06,101 --> 02:45:12,370
smell fuel and I don't really quite get

4423
02:45:09,430 --> 02:45:14,950
that but I I kind of understand it but I

4424
02:45:12,370 --> 02:45:16,601
think that the fuel you know

4425
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:18,250
characteristics that come from cans I

4426
02:45:16,601 --> 02:45:20,260
feel like the fuel I think that kind of

4427
02:45:18,250 --> 02:45:22,450
comes more from the name but actually I

4428
02:45:20,260 --> 02:45:24,190
don't really know if people smell diesel

4429
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:26,771
when they're smelling it and I don't I

4430
02:45:24,190 --> 02:45:28,390
don't I don't smell that you know so I

4431
02:45:26,771 --> 02:45:29,950
guess it would be a pinion thing but as

4432
02:45:28,389 --> 02:45:33,159
far as other strains that was really

4433
02:45:29,950 --> 02:45:35,380
disappointing that I grew they were

4434
02:45:33,159 --> 02:45:37,030
mostly there were mostly things that I'm

4435
02:45:35,379 --> 02:45:39,039
not so sure they were worth what they

4436
02:45:37,030 --> 02:45:42,010
said they were there was a master push

4437
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:45,190
that I got so and that was nothing good

4438
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:47,530
and then and that cherry pie that I got

4439
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:49,870
I liked it I loved it but it did it put

4440
02:45:47,530 --> 02:45:51,670
it put ball sacks out early in the

4441
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:53,590
flowering and it was a problem for me I

4442
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:57,670
didn't I didn't enjoy that you know

4443
02:45:53,590 --> 02:46:00,040
because it I didn't really have much

4444
02:45:57,670 --> 02:46:01,569
control over it and going through with

4445
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:05,860
this style that I was growing picking

4446
02:46:01,569 --> 02:46:07,989
through that was kind of tough um trying

4447
02:46:05,860 --> 02:46:09,730
to think I don't know some of my

4448
02:46:07,989 --> 02:46:11,619
favorites that are outside of the chem

4449
02:46:09,729 --> 02:46:13,659
dog family were like the super Silver

4450
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:16,150
Haze I really enjoyed that one and that

4451
02:46:13,659 --> 02:46:18,310
was kind of out of my zone of what I

4452
02:46:16,149 --> 02:46:19,840
like you know what I prefer a cannabis

4453
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:23,500
that was kind of outside of it and I

4454
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:27,851
still liked it a lot yeah that's pretty

4455
02:46:23,500 --> 02:46:30,040
much I you know I I think that as far as

4456
02:46:27,851 --> 02:46:31,480
growers go that I've been doing it as

4457
02:46:30,040 --> 02:46:33,490
long as I've been I feel like I've

4458
02:46:31,479 --> 02:46:34,959
probably grown less strains and most of

4459
02:46:33,489 --> 02:46:37,750
those people have you know I'm saying I

4460
02:46:34,959 --> 02:46:40,719
could the actual count of different

4461
02:46:37,750 --> 02:46:42,399
strains I think is smaller for me when I

4462
02:46:40,719 --> 02:46:46,420
hold it against you because you had the

4463
02:46:42,399 --> 02:46:47,890
best weed on earth I love it I just what

4464
02:46:46,420 --> 02:46:50,920
I meant I got lucky you know

4465
02:46:47,890 --> 02:46:52,209
but so I don't really have me there's

4466
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:53,409
not many there's definitely something I

4467
02:46:52,209 --> 02:46:55,989
haven't met the cut like there's

4468
02:46:53,409 --> 02:46:57,310
definitely been some some that I'd felt

4469
02:46:55,989 --> 02:47:01,659
like I had enough space enough to keep

4470
02:46:57,310 --> 02:47:03,520
but um you know we'll see I don't really

4471
02:47:01,659 --> 02:47:05,829
have too many to say on that one really

4472
02:47:03,521 --> 02:47:08,471
yeah they can't be I really I really

4473
02:47:05,829 --> 02:47:10,601
don't love that one as I much as people

4474
02:47:08,470 --> 02:47:12,011
do and I I gotta say I really don't get

4475
02:47:10,601 --> 02:47:14,141
it and I'm not speaking bad about it I'm

4476
02:47:12,011 --> 02:47:15,729
hoping that it'll dawn on me at one

4477
02:47:14,140 --> 02:47:18,310
point and I'm keeping it for breeding

4478
02:47:15,729 --> 02:47:20,140
because I I think that there's it does

4479
02:47:18,310 --> 02:47:21,879
carry its traits to pretty dense heavy

4480
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:23,890
I've actually seen some crosses that

4481
02:47:21,879 --> 02:47:26,590
were supposedly done with Kennedy that

4482
02:47:23,890 --> 02:47:28,959
more chem dog notes came out of then say

4483
02:47:26,591 --> 02:47:33,280
the chem D itself had so I'm keeping it

4484
02:47:28,959 --> 02:47:34,869
around this time for for that reason I

4485
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:37,150
don't know if we can work something out

4486
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:40,091
with it you know yeah that would be that

4487
02:47:37,149 --> 02:47:42,850
on that list for that answer okay so

4488
02:47:40,091 --> 02:47:46,239
would you ever consider putting any

4489
02:47:42,851 --> 02:47:47,021
feminized lines yourself oh yeah

4490
02:47:46,239 --> 02:47:49,449
absolutely

4491
02:47:47,021 --> 02:47:51,130
I'm gonna go stand before I'm gonna I'm

4492
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:55,450
gonna go take both roads on this I'm

4493
02:47:51,129 --> 02:47:58,930
gonna do I I was all about it and then

4494
02:47:55,450 --> 02:48:02,801
as I got more around the the breeders

4495
02:47:58,931 --> 02:48:04,870
and the breeder are the people who are

4496
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:06,459
buying the stuff for the readers and

4497
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:07,900
what their opinions are just kind of

4498
02:48:06,459 --> 02:48:10,359
looking I like I said I got this

4499
02:48:07,899 --> 02:48:12,011
negative that I had this feeling that

4500
02:48:10,360 --> 02:48:14,829
there was like a negative thing from the

4501
02:48:12,011 --> 02:48:17,409
community on it but to me it's just to

4502
02:48:14,829 --> 02:48:19,329
me it's just like you know I yeah you

4503
02:48:17,409 --> 02:48:21,159
got to you know what I mean so yeah I'm

4504
02:48:19,329 --> 02:48:24,640
gonna check that I think for some people

4505
02:48:21,159 --> 02:48:26,409
that's see sorry going I was just gonna

4506
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:29,739
say I think that you just have to do the

4507
02:48:26,409 --> 02:48:30,940
proper testing and yeah I don't think I

4508
02:48:29,739 --> 02:48:32,229
think when we started if you got a rough

4509
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:34,120
finish that says I think what I've

4510
02:48:32,229 --> 02:48:36,189
learned in this is that you can't just

4511
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:38,141
give seats to people out and call that

4512
02:48:36,190 --> 02:48:41,051
testing and get feedback I think that

4513
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:42,550
that's useful but maybe I'm wrong but it

4514
02:48:41,050 --> 02:48:44,409
might I'm starting to get the feeling

4515
02:48:42,550 --> 02:48:46,420
you got to do your own testing like if

4516
02:48:44,409 --> 02:48:47,709
you really are looking for what you're

4517
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:48,851
looking for you gotta be the one looking

4518
02:48:47,709 --> 02:48:51,669
for it you know what I mean

4519
02:48:48,851 --> 02:48:53,500
yeah we certainly say that with the

4520
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:56,670
likes of Brothers Grimm and swamp boy

4521
02:48:53,500 --> 02:49:00,030
seeds now doing all in-house testing

4522
02:48:56,670 --> 02:49:01,920
just kind of bringing us to

4523
02:49:00,030 --> 02:49:03,810
same point of what the people kind of

4524
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:05,610
want and talk about we often hear this

4525
02:49:03,809 --> 02:49:07,769
talk about people saying you know like

4526
02:49:05,610 --> 02:49:12,030
we need to return to our land race roots

4527
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:14,430
do you have any kind of plans to to work

4528
02:49:12,030 --> 02:49:17,040
with land races and say the cam dog for

4529
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:20,309
example or is your plans more so to kind

4530
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:22,050
of stay with more mainstream things and

4531
02:49:20,309 --> 02:49:27,689
not necessarily looking to reinvent the

4532
02:49:22,049 --> 02:49:30,449
wheel governor look in the reinvent will

4533
02:49:27,690 --> 02:49:33,480
as long as you know I'm trying to I want

4534
02:49:30,450 --> 02:49:36,470
to see I would like to have a catalogue

4535
02:49:33,479 --> 02:49:39,809
of things that are available that that

4536
02:49:36,469 --> 02:49:41,760
remind me of of the strains that I

4537
02:49:39,809 --> 02:49:45,989
smoked when I was a kid the Nigerians

4538
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:47,489
and half the the Afghan crosses and you

4539
02:49:45,989 --> 02:49:49,110
know all those things that we were

4540
02:49:47,489 --> 02:49:51,809
smoking out of the catalogue when I was

4541
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:53,819
a young man I I want to get all that

4542
02:49:51,809 --> 02:49:57,420
variety of flavor back into it I do

4543
02:49:53,819 --> 02:49:59,369
think even with the highest the highest

4544
02:49:57,420 --> 02:50:02,010
quality strains that are out now they're

4545
02:49:59,370 --> 02:50:03,720
all so similar they're also you know let

4546
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:05,040
me half of them are over G crosses you

4547
02:50:03,719 --> 02:50:07,319
know the half of them there's some sort

4548
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:09,900
of variation on og cush you know and and

4549
02:50:07,319 --> 02:50:12,539
I think we need a little bit of more

4550
02:50:09,899 --> 02:50:14,190
variety on that and that's on that level

4551
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:16,350
of quality if you know what I mean

4552
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:18,000
not just more variety but more variety

4553
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:21,149
on that level of quality where like

4554
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:22,709
instead of having Kim dog and og or and

4555
02:50:21,149 --> 02:50:24,510
whatever other ones that would fall into

4556
02:50:22,709 --> 02:50:27,239
that category maybe if we had another

4557
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:30,210
handful of flavors that you know like a

4558
02:50:27,239 --> 02:50:32,369
skunk you know like I don't know a lot

4559
02:50:30,209 --> 02:50:35,129
of people I can't say I can't say the

4560
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:37,290
last time I smoked a isolated skunk

4561
02:50:35,129 --> 02:50:39,000
strain you know like I really can't tell

4562
02:50:37,290 --> 02:50:41,970
you the last time I really smoked a good

4563
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:44,729
quality one you know yeah and I think if

4564
02:50:41,969 --> 02:50:47,250
there's I think it's like everything

4565
02:50:44,729 --> 02:50:49,079
everything people keep running to one

4566
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:51,360
thing everyone runs to one thing at the

4567
02:50:49,079 --> 02:50:53,280
same time all the time I think and so we

4568
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:54,720
keep getting we're kind of running

4569
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:56,130
around in the same circle I think at

4570
02:50:54,719 --> 02:50:58,349
this point you know we've got all these

4571
02:50:56,129 --> 02:51:01,049
different pushes and they're all great I

4572
02:50:58,350 --> 02:51:02,790
mean and there are differences and same

4573
02:51:01,049 --> 02:51:04,709
thing with the chem dog crosses that

4574
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:06,180
we've been making it you know they're

4575
02:51:04,709 --> 02:51:07,469
they're they're very similar to the chem

4576
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:11,430
dog but they are different you know like

4577
02:51:07,469 --> 02:51:13,109
the chem crush it's it's uh it's it it's

4578
02:51:11,430 --> 02:51:13,829
funny because the thing I like about it

4579
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:16,860
is that

4580
02:51:13,829 --> 02:51:19,979
it it does bring back that dark deep

4581
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:22,500
earthy tone it I do taste it in there

4582
02:51:19,979 --> 02:51:24,750
and it really inspires me because I feel

4583
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:26,340
like hey this is possible though jeans

4584
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:27,899
are dirt that there's genetics they're

4585
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:29,670
still in there somewhere we just got to

4586
02:51:27,899 --> 02:51:32,010
get them an isolate and stabilize them

4587
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:33,271
you know and and I think it could be

4588
02:51:32,010 --> 02:51:37,110
done you know I feel like we have

4589
02:51:33,271 --> 02:51:39,510
everything you know everything our

4590
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:41,760
disposal to get this done you know so

4591
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:43,260
that's what I want that's what I want to

4592
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:45,840
see I don't want to read that's the way

4593
02:51:43,260 --> 02:51:48,829
I don't think I don't think I'm even

4594
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:50,909
able to I think that I I just want to I

4595
02:51:48,829 --> 02:51:53,430
want to do what I'm able to do what I

4596
02:51:50,909 --> 02:51:55,110
think I'm able to do is is to find those

4597
02:51:53,430 --> 02:51:58,050
traits that I love that I think that

4598
02:51:55,110 --> 02:52:00,690
everyone really loves and isolate them

4599
02:51:58,049 --> 02:52:03,060
you know cuz I I have a the one thing I

4600
02:52:00,690 --> 02:52:05,250
feel like I've got going for me in this

4601
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:06,840
and davier is that I have those memories

4602
02:52:05,250 --> 02:52:08,219
I have those memories of those smells

4603
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:10,590
and those flavors I can tell the

4604
02:52:08,219 --> 02:52:12,689
difference between the Suttles of what

4605
02:52:10,590 --> 02:52:14,639
we have now and the hints of those

4606
02:52:12,690 --> 02:52:17,220
things and the actual thing I can tell

4607
02:52:14,639 --> 02:52:18,899
the difference it's kind of uh I don't

4608
02:52:17,219 --> 02:52:20,579
know it's like reading or riding a bike

4609
02:52:18,899 --> 02:52:22,139
or something like it's in there you know

4610
02:52:20,579 --> 02:52:24,750
like the Beatrix choice like I told you

4611
02:52:22,139 --> 02:52:27,359
earlier so that's what I want to do

4612
02:52:24,750 --> 02:52:29,280
that's what I think my most interesting

4613
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:31,920
you not intervene or reinventing the

4614
02:52:29,280 --> 02:52:34,860
world but you know bringing back the old

4615
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:37,379
school stuff you know yeah for sure

4616
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:39,420
so what's your opinions on organic

4617
02:52:37,379 --> 02:52:41,369
Vasanth etic you know I think you've

4618
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:43,290
kind of already hinted that you're more

4619
02:52:41,370 --> 02:52:45,570
of a bottled nutrient guy do you think

4620
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:47,460
it's just like a preference thing or do

4621
02:52:45,569 --> 02:52:51,869
you think one kind of is better than the

4622
02:52:47,459 --> 02:52:55,679
other I think that one is better for the

4623
02:52:51,870 --> 02:52:57,540
other in certain environments if if in a

4624
02:52:55,680 --> 02:53:01,860
perfect world everything I grew be

4625
02:52:57,540 --> 02:53:03,750
organic everything I eats organic you

4626
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:06,170
know I don't put funny products in my

4627
02:53:03,750 --> 02:53:10,200
body in my in my head you know Tim

4628
02:53:06,170 --> 02:53:12,090
health-conscious kind of person and like

4629
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:14,700
I said I was the last person in my

4630
02:53:12,090 --> 02:53:16,920
circles to grow with bottled nutrients

4631
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:18,420
you know to even try it I was so against

4632
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:21,090
it I was like there's no boss I was

4633
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:24,810
having moderately at the time very good

4634
02:53:21,090 --> 02:53:27,540
success at the time at today's bar of

4635
02:53:24,810 --> 02:53:29,760
what success is I don't know because I

4636
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:34,860
I didn't I didn't put myself up against

4637
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:37,440
that but I think that when you're

4638
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:39,480
growing indoors and you're growing

4639
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:42,180
organic you're still growing with Bala

4640
02:53:39,479 --> 02:53:44,129
nutrients aren't you I mean I don't see

4641
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:46,530
a lot of people like creating their own

4642
02:53:44,129 --> 02:53:48,149
compost and bringing it in and that's

4643
02:53:46,530 --> 02:53:50,010
truly what organic growing is when

4644
02:53:48,149 --> 02:53:52,139
you're growing with organics you're

4645
02:53:50,010 --> 02:53:54,690
you're not just using products that just

4646
02:53:52,139 --> 02:53:57,199
came from the earth I mean they mined

4647
02:53:54,690 --> 02:54:00,360
minerals out of caves in Jamaica right

4648
02:53:57,200 --> 02:54:03,300
but they mined bat guano off the side of

4649
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:04,650
a cliff where bat we're I'm sorry bird

4650
02:54:03,299 --> 02:54:07,079
guano off the side of a cliff where

4651
02:54:04,649 --> 02:54:08,520
birds migrate to to breed you know

4652
02:54:07,079 --> 02:54:11,280
themselves you know it's it's

4653
02:54:08,521 --> 02:54:14,250
destructive in a different way so as I

4654
02:54:11,280 --> 02:54:15,930
got older and my view the world got

4655
02:54:14,250 --> 02:54:17,760
bigger I realized there wasn't much

4656
02:54:15,930 --> 02:54:20,069
difference that the difference is that I

4657
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:22,590
was holding on to weren't real it wasn't

4658
02:54:20,069 --> 02:54:24,659
like one was more ecologically conscious

4659
02:54:22,590 --> 02:54:26,340
than the other so then you're left with

4660
02:54:24,659 --> 02:54:28,739
you you're your own health which one's

4661
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:30,600
healthier and then after that I would

4662
02:54:28,739 --> 02:54:32,789
say you're talking about flavors and

4663
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:36,239
variations in the quality of the product

4664
02:54:32,790 --> 02:54:38,521
and when you're growing indoors the

4665
02:54:36,239 --> 02:54:40,799
reality is is that it's a sprint it's

4666
02:54:38,521 --> 02:54:43,440
not a marathon it's a sprint things have

4667
02:54:40,799 --> 02:54:45,469
to happen now it moves quick the plants

4668
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:48,899
life cycle is extremely quick and

4669
02:54:45,469 --> 02:54:50,520
growing in organic indoors it can be

4670
02:54:48,899 --> 02:54:52,680
done in a file you see people have

4671
02:54:50,521 --> 02:54:54,271
really good success with it and then you

4672
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:56,430
see people a lot of people grow on it

4673
02:54:54,271 --> 02:54:57,810
organic and you're like well you think

4674
02:54:56,430 --> 02:54:59,460
you're having really good success that

4675
02:54:57,809 --> 02:55:00,029
but honestly this shit's burning my

4676
02:54:59,459 --> 02:55:02,789
throat

4677
02:55:00,030 --> 02:55:04,290
it tastes my heart and I must be missing

4678
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:08,250
something because that's not what it was

4679
02:55:04,290 --> 02:55:10,260
supposed to do and so I think it's like

4680
02:55:08,250 --> 02:55:12,000
I said if I'm growing in if I was doing

4681
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:14,460
a like depth it would be organic I

4682
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,771
wouldn't I wouldn't use though and it

4683
02:55:14,459 --> 02:55:19,739
would be for various reasons one one

4684
02:55:16,771 --> 02:55:21,659
being because I can I can bring compost

4685
02:55:19,739 --> 02:55:24,090
into that situation the other reason is

4686
02:55:21,659 --> 02:55:25,799
because you know actually growing

4687
02:55:24,090 --> 02:55:28,040
organic on a large scale I think is

4688
02:55:25,799 --> 02:55:31,199
actually more cost-effective you know

4689
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:33,230
yeah I certainly think so in terms of

4690
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:35,700
the cost-effectiveness on larger scales

4691
02:55:33,229 --> 02:55:38,069
yeah so I think that when you're

4692
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:39,480
controlling the environment like you are

4693
02:55:38,069 --> 02:55:41,279
an indoor growing room where you have

4694
02:55:39,479 --> 02:55:44,908
complete control over every

4695
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:48,449
err like water food I think your you

4696
02:55:44,908 --> 02:55:51,808
have to be realistic about the plants

4697
02:55:48,449 --> 02:55:53,819
demands which are gonna be I know this

4698
02:55:51,808 --> 02:55:56,128
doesn't make sense they're gonna be

4699
02:55:53,818 --> 02:55:58,078
higher and on the endure situation as

4700
02:55:56,129 --> 02:55:59,519
far as like potential goes in my opinion

4701
02:55:58,078 --> 02:56:01,439
and there's plenty of people are gonna

4702
02:55:59,519 --> 02:56:03,418
disagree with this but I think your

4703
02:56:01,439 --> 02:56:04,859
potentials higher and that you had your

4704
02:56:03,418 --> 02:56:05,939
with as far as what you're feeding your

4705
02:56:04,859 --> 02:56:07,559
plants you're really just playing

4706
02:56:05,939 --> 02:56:09,568
catch-up to what everything else is

4707
02:56:07,558 --> 02:56:11,398
providing you know know the sun's night

4708
02:56:09,568 --> 02:56:14,278
the Sun is way brighter than your grow

4709
02:56:11,398 --> 02:56:15,509
eggs but this the sun's not sitting

4710
02:56:14,279 --> 02:56:17,998
right over top of the plan is perfect

4711
02:56:15,509 --> 02:56:19,138
situation all all day long either you

4712
02:56:17,998 --> 02:56:20,789
know what I mean it's there's a lot more

4713
02:56:19,138 --> 02:56:21,238
variations the temperature is always the

4714
02:56:20,789 --> 02:56:24,449
same

4715
02:56:21,238 --> 02:56:26,519
so the potential in my opinion for

4716
02:56:24,449 --> 02:56:27,959
quality is higher so you're really just

4717
02:56:26,519 --> 02:56:29,309
trying to keep up with that potential

4718
02:56:27,959 --> 02:56:31,769
when it comes to what you're feeding

4719
02:56:29,308 --> 02:56:34,948
your plants and and then going back to

4720
02:56:31,769 --> 02:56:36,599
the fact that I don't think you're

4721
02:56:34,949 --> 02:56:39,179
really growing organic unless you're you

4722
02:56:36,599 --> 02:56:41,549
know you're making compost and you know

4723
02:56:39,179 --> 02:56:44,578
like I used to grow in peat moss with

4724
02:56:41,549 --> 02:56:46,949
organic but the back like I was telling

4725
02:56:44,578 --> 02:56:48,929
you earlier but that's really hydroponic

4726
02:56:46,949 --> 02:56:51,838
growing you know that suppose it was a

4727
02:56:48,929 --> 02:56:53,728
lifeless medium you know and I'm feeding

4728
02:56:51,838 --> 02:56:56,338
a little life into it every every once

4729
02:56:53,728 --> 02:56:58,708
in a while but you know I don't know it

4730
02:56:56,338 --> 02:57:02,248
was amazing I mean it did quality was

4731
02:56:58,709 --> 02:57:04,619
amazing and I often ask myself once you

4732
02:57:02,248 --> 02:57:06,298
give that a shot but you know the life

4733
02:57:04,619 --> 02:57:08,129
life moves at the speed of light around

4734
02:57:06,299 --> 02:57:10,139
here in California and you're kind of

4735
02:57:08,129 --> 02:57:12,409
just doing what you do and I really like

4736
02:57:10,138 --> 02:57:17,278
the product that I come up with it's

4737
02:57:12,408 --> 02:57:19,859
super smooth and high flavor and it

4738
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:21,539
gives me everything I want so but I

4739
02:57:19,859 --> 02:57:23,939
definitely want to check it out on

4740
02:57:21,539 --> 02:57:27,299
experimental little bit more bring back

4741
02:57:23,939 --> 02:57:28,859
some of those old methods I had and take

4742
02:57:27,299 --> 02:57:30,269
what I know now and apply it and see

4743
02:57:28,859 --> 02:57:34,168
what else I can come up with you know

4744
02:57:30,269 --> 02:57:36,779
what I'm saying yeah for sure and so on

4745
02:57:34,168 --> 02:57:39,328
to the next question kind of tying in to

4746
02:57:36,779 --> 02:57:41,609
that what would be kind of the biggest

4747
02:57:39,328 --> 02:57:43,138
mistake you see people making in growing

4748
02:57:41,609 --> 02:57:44,939
or maybe another way to put it would be

4749
02:57:43,138 --> 02:57:46,888
what would be your tip for people

4750
02:57:44,939 --> 02:57:48,988
growing you know do you know for example

4751
02:57:46,888 --> 02:57:51,568
Dukes he always sees people over

4752
02:57:48,988 --> 02:57:53,718
watering what's your kind of take on

4753
02:57:51,568 --> 02:57:53,718
things

4754
02:57:54,568 --> 02:58:02,648
well it's one thing I see a lot of is

4755
02:57:59,828 --> 02:58:04,748
that when people find a problem they

4756
02:58:02,648 --> 02:58:07,028
come at it like they're they bum rush it

4757
02:58:04,748 --> 02:58:09,488
you know like they and then it ends that

4758
02:58:07,029 --> 02:58:11,770
the problem might get slapped but they

4759
02:58:09,488 --> 02:58:14,198
didn't learn anything you could come in

4760
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:16,779
a problem with like an arsenal of things

4761
02:58:14,199 --> 02:58:18,010
and methods and try this and that amay

4762
02:58:16,779 --> 02:58:20,498
there's all kinds of [ __ ] people try I

4763
02:58:18,010 --> 02:58:22,210
mean blows me away he'll make sprays out

4764
02:58:20,498 --> 02:58:23,680
of tobacco for God's sakes I mean I

4765
02:58:22,209 --> 02:58:26,738
could sound that sounds ludicrous to me

4766
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:29,229
so and and instead of just take your

4767
02:58:26,738 --> 02:58:32,228
time do your research think about what

4768
02:58:29,228 --> 02:58:33,698
you're doing and and like try to stay on

4769
02:58:32,228 --> 02:58:34,929
point with the problem don't just try to

4770
02:58:33,699 --> 02:58:36,489
come out with everything because if it

4771
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:37,539
happens again guess what you're gonna

4772
02:58:36,488 --> 02:58:38,978
have to come up with everything because

4773
02:58:37,539 --> 02:58:40,869
you don't know what you actually did to

4774
02:58:38,978 --> 02:58:43,328
fix it you know I'm saying so I would

4775
02:58:40,869 --> 02:58:44,739
say that that would be the thing I see

4776
02:58:43,328 --> 02:58:46,270
that happens the most is that people

4777
02:58:44,738 --> 02:58:48,309
panic when there's something goes wrong

4778
02:58:46,270 --> 02:58:49,899
and instead of just taking their time

4779
02:58:48,309 --> 02:58:52,778
and just breaking it apart plan ahead

4780
02:58:49,898 --> 02:58:54,459
make sure you're not gonna hurt lose you

4781
02:58:52,779 --> 02:58:55,988
know like a strain or something like

4782
02:58:54,459 --> 02:58:57,608
that I could genetic or something but

4783
02:58:55,988 --> 02:58:59,648
you know figure out what the problem is

4784
02:58:57,609 --> 02:59:01,029
and fix it and then then they throw at

4785
02:58:59,648 --> 02:59:03,038
Robins again you can just fix it you

4786
02:59:01,029 --> 02:59:06,130
know so that's what I would say about

4787
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:07,439
that yeah what specifically I think you

4788
02:59:06,129 --> 02:59:09,639
wanted something more specific

4789
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:11,828
specifically I think people over feed

4790
02:59:09,639 --> 02:59:13,629
their plants way too much organic or

4791
02:59:11,828 --> 02:59:16,350
otherwise I see people like it's just

4792
02:59:13,629 --> 02:59:18,998
throwing money down the drain you know

4793
02:59:16,350 --> 02:59:24,640
yeah yeah I see that alone as well

4794
02:59:18,998 --> 02:59:27,010
actually so what in your opinion is the

4795
02:59:24,639 --> 02:59:29,288
worst thing to happen to the American

4796
02:59:27,010 --> 02:59:31,148
cannabis community since the

4797
02:59:29,289 --> 02:59:33,579
medicalization happened so like one

4798
02:59:31,148 --> 02:59:35,618
example would be kind of the new laws

4799
02:59:33,578 --> 02:59:36,788
being proposed in California you know

4800
02:59:35,619 --> 02:59:38,199
you'd be well aware of this you know a

4801
02:59:36,789 --> 02:59:39,850
lot of people are kind of saying that

4802
02:59:38,199 --> 02:59:42,340
there are step back in a lot of ways you

4803
02:59:39,850 --> 02:59:43,689
know what is your what do you think is

4804
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:49,600
the worst thing to happen since

4805
02:59:43,689 --> 02:59:55,328
legalization worse things happened since

4806
02:59:49,600 --> 03:00:03,729
to medical legalization well I don't

4807
02:59:55,328 --> 03:00:06,728
like how this I don't like how the the

4808
03:00:03,728 --> 03:00:08,799
grower the small-time grower is just

4809
03:00:06,728 --> 03:00:11,049
pushed around you know as far as like

4810
03:00:08,799 --> 03:00:13,568
what the what the product goes to market

4811
03:00:11,049 --> 03:00:16,209
for I really think that that it's

4812
03:00:13,568 --> 03:00:18,459
unfortunate that the person who's

4813
03:00:16,209 --> 03:00:21,339
producing the product that everyone's

4814
03:00:18,459 --> 03:00:24,549
you know interested in right now is the

4815
03:00:21,340 --> 03:00:26,020
one that you know oftentimes is the one

4816
03:00:24,549 --> 03:00:28,148
that's working the hardest to make a

4817
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:29,800
living and I think that it's there's a

4818
03:00:28,148 --> 03:00:31,930
lot of factors that have caused that and

4819
03:00:29,799 --> 03:00:34,478
I don't think that's the worst part you

4820
03:00:31,930 --> 03:00:37,539
know I think that I wish that we were

4821
03:00:34,478 --> 03:00:41,788
lived in a situation where growers could

4822
03:00:37,539 --> 03:00:44,979
kind to unionize or create like

4823
03:00:41,789 --> 03:00:47,260
associations where we agree on

4824
03:00:44,978 --> 03:00:49,389
you know what's fair and what's not fair

4825
03:00:47,260 --> 03:00:51,010
for all of us and then and then apply

4826
03:00:49,389 --> 03:00:54,278
that to the market you know I wish there

4827
03:00:51,010 --> 03:00:56,680
was more of that and I think that you

4828
03:00:54,279 --> 03:00:57,880
know you basically got growers competing

4829
03:00:56,680 --> 03:01:00,850
with each other trying to get their

4830
03:00:57,879 --> 03:01:03,459
product to market and you know everyone

4831
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:05,729
who came to the cannabis industry lately

4832
03:01:03,459 --> 03:01:08,608
has taken a huge advantage of that and

4833
03:01:05,728 --> 03:01:11,978
you know I've watched families you know

4834
03:01:08,609 --> 03:01:14,649
struggle for years on end doing what

4835
03:01:11,978 --> 03:01:18,549
they want to do and I feel like with all

4836
03:01:14,648 --> 03:01:20,260
the risk to take and and the and all the

4837
03:01:18,549 --> 03:01:22,028
work and it's a lot of work you know

4838
03:01:20,260 --> 03:01:24,068
this I mean anyone will sue this knows

4839
03:01:22,029 --> 03:01:26,710
it's a lot of work grown canvases know

4840
03:01:24,068 --> 03:01:29,109
nothing easy about it it's a lot of work

4841
03:01:26,709 --> 03:01:30,429
you know if you want to come out right

4842
03:01:29,109 --> 03:01:32,109
it's a lot of work and I see families

4843
03:01:30,430 --> 03:01:33,639
that you know good good people good

4844
03:01:32,109 --> 03:01:35,380
families that work really hard and they

4845
03:01:33,639 --> 03:01:37,959
struggle because they're they're at the

4846
03:01:35,379 --> 03:01:40,420
mercy of this of this dynamic in the

4847
03:01:37,959 --> 03:01:42,459
market where it's like I'm not saying

4848
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:43,809
that you know cannabis should be priced

4849
03:01:42,459 --> 03:01:45,459
at this or whatever like that I'm just

4850
03:01:43,809 --> 03:01:47,139
saying that they have no control over it

4851
03:01:45,459 --> 03:01:49,898
and I think that's unfortunate and at

4852
03:01:47,139 --> 03:01:50,858
the end of the season or you know yeah

4853
03:01:49,898 --> 03:01:51,998
at the end of the season especially

4854
03:01:50,859 --> 03:01:54,100
because those are the ones that really

4855
03:01:51,998 --> 03:01:56,260
get hit you know they end up competing

4856
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:58,119
with each other like in a cup for a

4857
03:01:56,260 --> 03:02:00,760
banner and I and I think legalization

4858
03:01:58,119 --> 03:02:02,289
had a lot to do with that and I'm not

4859
03:02:00,760 --> 03:02:04,960
really sure why but it definitely seemed

4860
03:02:02,289 --> 03:02:07,180
to have gone hand in hand it's got to do

4861
03:02:04,959 --> 03:02:10,209
with the dispensaries and it also has to

4862
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:12,850
do with the fact that everything's more

4863
03:02:10,209 --> 03:02:14,769
on top of the table now so it's easier

4864
03:02:12,850 --> 03:02:17,680
for people to take advantage of that you

4865
03:02:14,770 --> 03:02:19,810
know yeah like shop around for the best

4866
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:20,579
prices and everyone will pass this on

4867
03:02:19,809 --> 03:02:22,590
for less

4868
03:02:20,579 --> 03:02:24,120
yeah just so they can feed their

4869
03:02:22,590 --> 03:02:25,680
families and keep the lights on you know

4870
03:02:24,120 --> 03:02:27,090
I mean you keep to keep the roof over

4871
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:29,430
their head and I just I don't like that

4872
03:02:27,090 --> 03:02:31,020
it bums me out but I mean I guess

4873
03:02:29,430 --> 03:02:33,960
everything in life's like that I guess

4874
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:37,140
you know so yeah that certainly does

4875
03:02:33,959 --> 03:02:39,509
seem like a negative so kind of bringing

4876
03:02:37,139 --> 03:02:41,549
us to our last question what do you

4877
03:02:39,510 --> 03:02:44,430
think is the best way for a kind of

4878
03:02:41,549 --> 03:02:47,068
emerging cannabis medical community to

4879
03:02:44,430 --> 03:02:49,290
develop you know do you think that we

4880
03:02:47,068 --> 03:02:51,449
shouldn't go gun ho on trying to

4881
03:02:49,290 --> 03:02:52,979
legalize everything do you think you

4882
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:55,079
know what what would be your advice just

4883
03:02:52,978 --> 03:02:56,789
you know take things slow look to find

4884
03:02:55,079 --> 03:02:58,289
the best clones first you know I mean

4885
03:02:56,790 --> 03:03:01,859
there's a whole variety of answers I

4886
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:05,280
think that I think the whole term

4887
03:03:01,859 --> 03:03:08,220
medical is kind of I think it's kind of

4888
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:09,569
a it implies something that we got to be

4889
03:03:08,219 --> 03:03:11,879
careful with because when you start

4890
03:03:09,568 --> 03:03:15,959
talking going back to the here in the

4891
03:03:11,879 --> 03:03:18,089
United States the DA to de 8 deciding to

4892
03:03:15,959 --> 03:03:19,919
keep cannabis as a Schedule one drug on

4893
03:03:18,090 --> 03:03:21,568
the flip side of that if they try if

4894
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:24,270
they chose to keep that as a schedule 2

4895
03:03:21,568 --> 03:03:26,129
drug right with medical benefit well

4896
03:03:24,270 --> 03:03:28,260
that sounds rosy that sounds great

4897
03:03:26,129 --> 03:03:29,969
that's what we always wanted the problem

4898
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:31,559
with that is is that all that really

4899
03:03:29,969 --> 03:03:34,739
means is that you know this is the

4900
03:03:31,559 --> 03:03:36,269
United States of course you know but all

4901
03:03:34,739 --> 03:03:39,978
that really means is that the DEA can

4902
03:03:36,270 --> 03:03:42,090
give universities research institutes

4903
03:03:39,978 --> 03:03:44,579
basically pharmaceutical companies

4904
03:03:42,090 --> 03:03:46,290
permission to work with cannabis to

4905
03:03:44,579 --> 03:03:49,709
research it so they can develop their

4906
03:03:46,290 --> 03:03:51,300
own products right so it's a the medical

4907
03:03:49,709 --> 03:03:52,919
thing itself is still common if you

4908
03:03:51,299 --> 03:03:55,590
think because if you start if we start

4909
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:57,600
talented this is actual medicine well I

4910
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:58,920
mean I'm not allowed to make tylenol in

4911
03:03:57,600 --> 03:04:02,370
my house I'm not allowed to make

4912
03:03:58,920 --> 03:04:03,930
oxycodone or or statin drugs in my house

4913
03:04:02,370 --> 03:04:05,130
there's a company that's only allowed to

4914
03:04:03,930 --> 03:04:07,590
do that and they're allowed to do that

4915
03:04:05,129 --> 03:04:09,329
because the DEA gives them permission to

4916
03:04:07,590 --> 03:04:12,450
do that so we have to be careful with

4917
03:04:09,329 --> 03:04:14,549
that because you know that's in one way

4918
03:04:12,450 --> 03:04:16,530
it's an open door it's also another door

4919
03:04:14,549 --> 03:04:18,449
that can close on us pretty quickly you

4920
03:04:16,530 --> 03:04:21,329
know I mean if we're not careful and

4921
03:04:18,450 --> 03:04:23,819
they could say whoa buddy I mean you

4922
03:04:21,329 --> 03:04:25,559
know whiskey's easy to get but you're

4923
03:04:23,818 --> 03:04:27,389
not allowed to make that and if you are

4924
03:04:25,559 --> 03:04:28,529
you certainly are not allowed to sell it

4925
03:04:27,389 --> 03:04:30,568
you know what I mean you got to be very

4926
03:04:28,530 --> 03:04:31,649
careful if you decide to make that and I

4927
03:04:30,568 --> 03:04:34,260
know we're talking about two different

4928
03:04:31,648 --> 03:04:36,180
things but but but it's for

4929
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:37,228
medical only whiskey's not a medical

4930
03:04:36,180 --> 03:04:39,359
anything that's the same that's

4931
03:04:37,228 --> 03:04:40,648
regulated in the same way only certain

4932
03:04:39,359 --> 03:04:43,170
people who've gone through certain hoops

4933
03:04:40,648 --> 03:04:45,989
can produce something like whiskey or

4934
03:04:43,170 --> 03:04:48,059
oxycodone or statin drugs or whatever

4935
03:04:45,989 --> 03:04:51,629
they are that they give people you know

4936
03:04:48,059 --> 03:04:54,180
so it's a it's a it's a dicey thing I

4937
03:04:51,629 --> 03:04:55,469
mean it's definitely a backdoor it's

4938
03:04:54,180 --> 03:04:57,090
like I used to always tell people it's

4939
03:04:55,469 --> 03:04:58,469
like they kept the front door closed for

4940
03:04:57,090 --> 03:05:00,210
so long and let achill marijuana it's

4941
03:04:58,469 --> 03:05:01,619
just us coming through the back door now

4942
03:05:00,209 --> 03:05:04,438
we're just in the living room what are

4943
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:07,140
we gonna do now but you know that door

4944
03:05:04,439 --> 03:05:10,559
can be closed too based on the term

4945
03:05:07,139 --> 03:05:12,389
medical you know so cannabis is a plant

4946
03:05:10,559 --> 03:05:16,559
and and it definitely gives people

4947
03:05:12,389 --> 03:05:18,148
benefits and I wish that instead of

4948
03:05:16,559 --> 03:05:20,939
trying to isolate okay what does

4949
03:05:18,148 --> 03:05:22,858
cannabis help people with and I wish

4950
03:05:20,939 --> 03:05:25,139
that society would just accept that

4951
03:05:22,859 --> 03:05:27,120
cannabis just over helps people overall

4952
03:05:25,139 --> 03:05:29,068
with their hope health you know what I

4953
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:32,130
mean in many different ways there's not

4954
03:05:29,068 --> 03:05:36,000
one particular way so you know it's kind

4955
03:05:32,129 --> 03:05:38,519
of like what would be another thing like

4956
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:40,529
that I mean you know we all agree that

4957
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:41,939
vitamin C is good for store that's not

4958
03:05:40,529 --> 03:05:44,700
really good but like eating fruits and

4959
03:05:41,939 --> 03:05:46,500
vegetables is it's a the same thing oh

4960
03:05:44,700 --> 03:05:48,300
it's a good thing it's healthy for you

4961
03:05:46,500 --> 03:05:51,359
some people juice vegetables to cure

4962
03:05:48,299 --> 03:05:54,688
cancer some people you know consume mass

4963
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:57,540
amounts of CBD have you know cured

4964
03:05:54,689 --> 03:05:59,520
cancer so I mean you know they're not

4965
03:05:57,540 --> 03:06:01,410
gonna start regulating you know

4966
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:03,000
cold-pressed vegetable juice just

4967
03:06:01,409 --> 03:06:04,260
because you get some great benefits and

4968
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:07,500
I could start regulating that like

4969
03:06:04,260 --> 03:06:08,639
alcohol or tobacco or anything so you

4970
03:06:07,500 --> 03:06:10,350
know it's got to be careful because

4971
03:06:08,639 --> 03:06:12,869
we're inviting I think that we don't

4972
03:06:10,350 --> 03:06:15,329
have no choice that regulations coming

4973
03:06:12,870 --> 03:06:17,729
and it's gonna be really unfair there's

4974
03:06:15,329 --> 03:06:20,129
gonna be in some aspects there's gonna

4975
03:06:17,728 --> 03:06:21,898
be winners and losers and I I wish that

4976
03:06:20,129 --> 03:06:24,148
we could get around that and just

4977
03:06:21,898 --> 03:06:26,519
legalize it as a plan say hey you know

4978
03:06:24,148 --> 03:06:28,170
what we have you go around the farmers

4979
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:29,640
market you can buy some broccoli the guy

4980
03:06:28,170 --> 03:06:31,529
next door it's got some cannabis for

4981
03:06:29,639 --> 03:06:33,028
sale I wish it could be like that but I

4982
03:06:31,529 --> 03:06:35,180
know it's not going to because we've

4983
03:06:33,029 --> 03:06:39,420
already gone so far down this road and

4984
03:06:35,180 --> 03:06:40,439
and so that's about it I think medical

4985
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:42,420
you gotta be careful with it's a

4986
03:06:40,439 --> 03:06:44,700
double-edged sword you know I think you

4987
03:06:42,420 --> 03:06:46,529
know now today it's rosy but I think in

4988
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:47,880
a few years they can shut the door again

4989
03:06:46,529 --> 03:06:52,079
on us if they want if they give

4990
03:06:47,879 --> 03:06:53,849
the pharmaceutical company yeah okay so

4991
03:06:52,079 --> 03:06:55,500
I think that that um kind of brings us

4992
03:06:53,850 --> 03:06:57,180
to the end of things actually was there

4993
03:06:55,500 --> 03:07:00,209
any shoutouts or general comments you

4994
03:06:57,180 --> 03:07:02,189
wanted to make no not really I can't

4995
03:07:00,209 --> 03:07:03,449
imagine it was uh this was this looked

4996
03:07:02,189 --> 03:07:04,489
pretty good and it was good to talk to

4997
03:07:03,450 --> 03:07:08,159
you and I appreciate it

4998
03:07:04,489 --> 03:07:10,079
awesome so yeah everyone needs to keep

4999
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:11,520
their eye for I think you said early

5000
03:07:10,079 --> 03:07:14,789
next year they'll be able to get their

5001
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:16,710
hands on some chem crush was it that's

5002
03:07:14,790 --> 03:07:18,270
that's that's that's definitely one of

5003
03:07:16,709 --> 03:07:20,489
them that's kind of just something I'm

5004
03:07:18,270 --> 03:07:24,030
finding along the way onto the end goal

5005
03:07:20,489 --> 03:07:25,559
the thing that the vision is is when I

5006
03:07:24,030 --> 03:07:29,310
when the release happens there's gonna

5007
03:07:25,559 --> 03:07:31,199
be four or five decent hybrids with

5008
03:07:29,309 --> 03:07:35,579
strange that people are already probably

5009
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:37,110
in love with and and then what I cross

5010
03:07:35,579 --> 03:07:39,000
with the chem dog mail that I've

5011
03:07:37,110 --> 03:07:40,710
developed that I really feel like I

5012
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:43,648
could stand behind that's pretty much

5013
03:07:40,709 --> 03:07:45,419
what it's gonna be so and yeah I think I

5014
03:07:43,648 --> 03:07:47,309
think that you know things have sped up

5015
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:49,110
a lot quicker and I thought like I I got

5016
03:07:47,309 --> 03:07:50,398
into this a little late I decided to do

5017
03:07:49,110 --> 03:07:53,610
some of these things a little late and

5018
03:07:50,398 --> 03:07:55,439
uh and I got a little lucky I think I

5019
03:07:53,610 --> 03:07:56,489
jumped ahead a little further with some

5020
03:07:55,439 --> 03:07:58,350
luck so yeah

5021
03:07:56,489 --> 03:08:00,449
maybe January or February I think we

5022
03:07:58,350 --> 03:08:01,800
might actually have some December to

5023
03:08:00,450 --> 03:08:04,350
early so I would I was hoping for

5024
03:08:01,799 --> 03:08:06,840
December at their mock-up in Sonoma

5025
03:08:04,350 --> 03:08:09,750
County but uh we'll see probably

5026
03:08:06,840 --> 03:08:11,010
sometime in early next year awesome

5027
03:08:09,750 --> 03:08:13,350
