you guys enjoy

100
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,079
it let's get into

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,360
it yep I mean yeah I get you and it's

102
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,760
like that you know every so often you

103
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,079
you think back to what it was like

104
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,079
during the early struggle and you're

105
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,400
like oh man I should just be grateful

106
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,040
like well you know the struggle is

107
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,519
different it it's it's so

108
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,479
different and you know there's certainly

109
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,478
things to like better about now and some

110
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:36,120
things to like better about

111
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:37,879
then and of course it's so easy to uh

112
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,639
how should I put

113
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,918
it fantasize about how good things used

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,280
to be because when we're thinking about

115
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,758
the past it's easy to overlook some of

116
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:53,959
the things that uh maybe weren't as

117
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,840
pleasant as they could have been or

118
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,758
maybe exaggerate some of the things that

119
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,560
actually weren't quite as good as you

120
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,639
wanted them to be

121
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,800
totally totally I I think that's a such

122
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,720
a big talking point of the show when we

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,560
talk about like these strains of Years

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:15,880
Gone by right were they really that much

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,160
better exactly and then and then and

126
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,560
then we go to the next level where

127
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,439
people are like I managed to track down

128
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,199
a cut of that strain and I grew it out

129
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,478
now I grew really good and it's and I

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,840
smoked it it's not that good right but

131
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,159
is that the stream's fault is it the

132
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,239
Grower's fault

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,479
or is it actually what it was supposed

134
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:41,199
to be because you know this isn't like

135
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:43,360
uh going to the pawn shop and finding

136
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,240
some rare antique where there's actually

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
some re relatively simplistic means of

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,478
verifying that the thing is what it's

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,240
supposed to be right because there's

140
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,159
pictures there's documentation there's

141
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,918
people that kind of know it not that you

142
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,680
can't potentially now you know send a a

143
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,918
sample off for genetic testing and

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,840
actually verify you can to some degree

145
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,758
but that's also kind of a

146
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,000
pain uh you know I I just find it

147
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
interesting

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,759
how

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,439
anecdotal people's experiences are when

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,160
it comes to

151
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:22,279
strains and rarely do we hear the uh the

152
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,400
context of the

153
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,359
experience uh or how that context may

154
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,959
have really contributed to the overall

155
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,639
experience yeah you know how was it this

156
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,638
uh this dead concert back in the day and

157
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,439
this guy handed me this Fillin the blank

158
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,120
and it was just amazing

159
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,439
well maybe there are some other

160
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,918
contributors to the experience being

161
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:52,360
amazing and and I think that's a huge

162
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:56,839
component when it comes to us as

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,280
humans and our perceptions of our

164
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,758
experiences especially when it comes to

165
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,079
things that might affect how we feel

166
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,879
well when we're in an environment

167
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,959
that tends to make us feel pretty good

168
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,720
to begin with well adding a little

169
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,680
something else that tends to also make

170
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,400
us feel good tends to really be

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Amplified in in such a interesting way

172
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,478
versus when we think about the opposite

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,439
when we're in an environment that really

174
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,560
doesn't contribute positively to us

175
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,680
feeling

176
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,360
good sometimes even the best things they

177
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,478
only raise our level a little bit and

178
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,759
sometimes don't even help us get back to

179
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:39,519
Baseline and I think this is kind of the

180
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,560
premise uh that begins to lead people

181
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,158
down that dangerous path of

182
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:51,360
addiction is trying to get back to where

183
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:54,279
things were using a substance

184
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,560
versus accepting responsibility for the

185
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,638
fact that your life isn't the way that

186
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,720
you want it to be and making the changes

187
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,478
that you kind of know need to make

188
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:09,360
which therefore contributes to having

189
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:11,478
the experiences and having things more

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,840
in line with what you want them to

191
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,120
be I I love what you said there about

192
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,478
that sort of

193
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,560
self-work for a lot of people cannabis

194
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,359
is like a self soothing thing and so

195
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,800
that's like a really hard sort of pill

196
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,080
to even contemplate swallowing but I

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,759
know for me that I I couldn't enjoy

198
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,559
sativas until I did that exact personal

199
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,399
work you said and then once I did it I

200
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,199
didn't feel anxious from them I I felt

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,240
invigorated and and it totally changed

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,160
my perception of

203
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,480
it it's been a really fascinating

204
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,120
experience for me especially over the

205
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:58,000
last you know five six seven

206
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:02,120
years as I'll just say the process

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,240
of waking up has

208
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,759
progressed you know and that might be

209
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,879
kind of a challenging

210
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,879
term it might be bit confusing you know

211
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,799
for those that haven't heard it uh and

212
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,879
so if you don't mind I'll just elaborate

213
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,639
a little bit

214
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,200
because it's uh it's a term that I like

215
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:27,919
to use I'm sure there's others out there

216
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,120
uh but uh I'm not there's not a

217
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,559
particular person that comes to mind but

218
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,039
uh when I use the term waking up what I

219
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,719
really am referring to is the kind of

220
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,039
realization

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,959
that life

222
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:48,599
is our own personal

223
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:52,599
responsibility and if we're not

224
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,839
happy well there's really only one

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,680
person in this whole universe that can

226
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:01,720
do anything about

227
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:05,239
that and it's not someone other than the

228
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,759
person that's thinking this right so if

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,079
we can't take this simple step to wake

230
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:15,120
up and acknowledge that if we're seeking

231
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:15,958
something that we think is going to make

232
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,799
us

233
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,000
happy yet we don't accept responsibility

234
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:26,879
for finding the path to get

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,320
there then it's just simply not going to

236
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,200
happen you know our happiness

237
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,079
is our own personal

238
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,040
responsibility and the realization of

239
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,439
this and the acknowledgement of

240
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:45,159
it it's not exactly

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:50,040
comfortable but it can change everything

242
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:52,120
once we can accept it and start to make

243
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,480
our choices based on that

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,799
knowledge well then things start to

245
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,120
change in a pretty interesting

246
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,919
way I I love these I love these CH I um

247
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,679
I wish I wish I was able to go here more

248
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,879
with guest it's beautiful because you

249
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,479
know it's interesting you mention that

250
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:11,320
and like in the context of

251
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,120
say consuming cannabis people often say

252
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,760
like without it it feels sort of

253
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,919
all-encompassing this this feeling of I

254
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,360
don't know if it's

255
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:26,078
dissatisfaction but it's it's sort of a

256
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,560
difficulty I I I wonder if there is

257
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,479
essentially an inverse relationship

258
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,759
because I've often said to

259
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,560
people if you feel like you're not

260
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,278
getting as much out of cannabis as you

261
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,159
would like you know it's not getting you

262
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,078
to where you want to be why don't you

263
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,799
try actually smoking less and

264
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,159
paradoxically you know you like I think

265
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,240
the rationale is like your tolerance

266
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,600
would lower but like I I've sort of

267
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,120
noticed that like the the more the less

268
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,600
you lean on it the more it's able to

269
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,278
offer you and and I personally during

270
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,360
times when I've taken tolerance breaks

271
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,799
and you come back you're like you know

272
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,639
you're blasted Sky High and you're like

273
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,078
oh wow um you know and it's almost like

274
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:09,278
there's a ceiling put on it

275
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,838
through abuse or using it too much in a

276
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,399
way you know I'm I'm really glad to hear

277
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,800
you phrase it that way

278
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:23,360
um because I very much agree with you in

279
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:25,479
fact this has been uh especially from

280
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,759
the very beginning of

281
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,519
dap kind of a kind of a guiding

282
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,720
principle behind what it is that we're

283
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,560
doing now keep in mind we did just

284
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,440
release a product this past summer you

285
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:41,518
know called the hyperd which is our much

286
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,199
larger capacity product okay well why do

287
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,879
we do that well there's clearly people

288
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:46,399
out there that are looking for more and

289
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,039
whatever those reasons

290
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,198
are are not for us to determine if it's

291
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,759
what they actually need or not that's up

292
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:58,479
to the individual I know that for me

293
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,879
from a personal basis and what I found

294
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,240
tends to be the case for many other

295
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,439
people that I've had a little

296
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,320
opportunity to get to know them a little

297
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,320
bit better

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,079
is less is

299
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,320
more applies in many many cases and so

300
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,679
it's really fascinating to hear you say

301
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,480
that because I found it to be exactly

302
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,239
the same thing for me and the vast

303
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,639
majority of the products that we

304
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,879
manufacture and offer are very small not

305
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,039
just in terms of how they fit in your

306
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,198
hand but the extraction chamber is

307
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,559
actually pretty small too and can be

308
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:33,359
further reduced in most of them uh by

309
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,479
another half or

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,959
50% which makes it a really really

311
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,879
useful tool for micro

312
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:45,278
doing yeah totally you know and it's and

313
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:48,919
it's such a an invogue term that I feel

314
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,039
like sometimes it it loses its value you

315
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,799
know like it's so like thrown around

316
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,679
that it's synonymous with like I got my

317
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,559
coffee got my micro like you know what I

318
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,638
mean right um but but but what you're

319
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,399
saying is is like there's some real

320
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,120
value you in in what you're saying in in

321
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,759
reducing the amount and I I've I've

322
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,159
tried this with a few different things

323
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,039
but um I'd love to hear your thoughts on

324
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,120
it before we move on to the next topic

325
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,958
which I want to ask you about which is

326
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,360
essentially the uh the calculator on

327
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,239
your s but like let's just let's just

328
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,959
talk a little more about like the the

329
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,879
micro doing CU I think I mentioned to

330
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,239
you last time and if I I'm sorry if I'm

331
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,720
repeating myself but if not I want to

332
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,600
make sure I mention it in case I didn't

333
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,120
but I got a buddy of mine and he's like

334
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,399
a proper professional industry like

335
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,759
white collar really really high up can't

336
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,559
be high at work sort of thing and he

337
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,440
talks about like as he's walk into the

338
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,559
train in the morning he h he hits his

339
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,199
little munit and he just wants that

340
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,239
little turp hit yeah and he's like

341
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:51,559
there's zero psychoactive effect but it

342
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,000
just puts you in the perfect spot yeah

343
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,958
um and and to me that speaks volumes

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,320
about what you're talking about okay and

345
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,439
that's really good to hear because

346
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,199
that's that's a big big part of what the

347
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,560
intent was from the very beginning you

348
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,319
know so there's there's two principles I

349
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,559
really want to touch on here you know

350
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,240
the micro do is one of them but the

351
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:15,198
other one

352
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:19,278
is the administration route and Method

353
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:21,599
okay and you know what I mean by that is

354
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,879
you can take a small bit of tincture you

355
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,759
can take uh a tiny little puff off of a

356
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,439
joint or a bowl okay you can also take a

357
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,839
little puff off of a

358
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,920
vaporizer okay but if they're all the

359
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,160
same

360
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,599
strain well there's really only one of

361
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,639
the options that I just mentioned that

362
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
allows you to further

363
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,759
subdivide what it is that you're looking

364
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,360
for and separate it from the things that

365
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,440
you're not and that is a good quality

366
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,399
vaporizer or what we like to call our

367
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,800
products the thermal extraction device

368
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,519
because with a product like this we can

369
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,240
take not just a micro do but we can take

370
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,000
a temperature

371
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:09,079
specific

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,318
dose and what that amounts to is a low

373
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:15,039
temperature dose of the same strain is

374
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:18,399
going to have a profoundly different

375
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:22,120
effect than a high temperature dose of

376
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,559
the same size from the same strain and

377
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,278
so we can get into layers and levels of

378
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:32,078
nuance that just really aren't possible

379
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:35,519
with any other consumption

380
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,758
process oh totally and we need to loop

381
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,480
back to that because I wanted to

382
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,079
actually talk to you about a few

383
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,720
different sort of extraction type

384
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,278
questions specifically but before we

385
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,680
move on I've uh I don't know if you've

386
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:50,000
noticed I've I've been I've been subtly

387
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,078
doing my own little AB here see that I

388
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,679
see

389
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,519
that uh for the for the viewers uh who

390
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,359
are listening in I've I've got uh the

391
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,360
munit in my hand and I've also got uh

392
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,318
one of uh the store and bi units in my

393
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,000
hand the thing that I really have been

394
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,318
noticing recently and I promise this

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,519
isn't just cuz you said it is how big

396
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:15,399
the chamber is on the store and BCL unit

397
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,798
and I have a what is it a venty cuz I

398
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,319
you know there are there are situations

399
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,918
where I think it's applicable but gosh

400
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,959
it bloody chews through the product like

401
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,679
no tomorrow and and what I realized is

402
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,120
it doesn't get you anywhere near as high

403
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,798
as as so to speak like the um the

404
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,000
intensity of effects if you're thinking

405
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,918
like I I want to sit down and have a big

406
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,599
one and shoot into space so to speak

407
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,640
like that's not going to happen on a

408
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:47,319
store and ble unit in my opinion it's

409
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,400
just it's a slow extraction unit whereas

410
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,439
I feel like this for me and this is all

411
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,320
personal you know you're welcome to

412
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,400
disagree I'm anyone listening I feel

413
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,839
like for me this this truly replicates

414
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,880
the hit in a way that

415
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:02,959
is efficient because it it seems to me

416
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,080
like the amount of um material I'm

417
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
putting in the chamber of the DAP is

418
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:11,000
about the amount I would put in the

419
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,319
average cone piece when you say cone

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,720
piece like in like a little a single

421
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,558
little bong hereit just just a little

422
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,000
one hitter yeah just a tiny little one

423
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,480
right because uh you know you most

424
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,759
people when they're when they're using

425
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,519
just just a standard dap M for example

426
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:32,079
they're going to put in usually less

427
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:34,119
than 0.1 grams can you cram 0.1 in there

428
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:38,879
yeah you can but it ends up being pretty

429
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:42,279
tight so a typical load is less than 0.1

430
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,200
so you're talking about minimum of

431
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:48,798
10 fills per gram and the reality is for

432
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,600
most people it's probably closer to

433
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:56,359
15 per gram right and then on top of

434
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:59,079
that you can sip on it right you can

435
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,519
take just one little puff and things

436
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,240
cool down pretty quick put it right back

437
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,679
in your pocket and you can save the rest

438
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,359
for later so it makes for a

439
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:12,759
rather conservative approach for for

440
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:16,079
those that don't have a rather large

441
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,279
stash oh totally and and when I um when

442
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,279
my mates end up like getting a Dap they

443
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,519
ask me like how when do I need to reload

444
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,720
it with fresh material and I always say

445
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,798
that I I think there's like three or

446
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,279
four good deep hits in it before I would

447
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,839
and that's my anecdotal advice do you do

448
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,000
you have an answer for that question

449
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,119
that's like you know three or four or

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,839
something like that and as a quick

451
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,439
followup what's the saving on the you

452
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,359
know with the calculator on the site how

453
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,600
much do you think you save percentage

454
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,798
wise so what what I can comfortably say

455
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,798
is from a savings

456
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:53,038
perspective it's very very rare that we

457
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:55,918
encounter any feedback from any customer

458
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,158
that doesn't say that when they're again

459
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,159
comparing our products to smoking for

460
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,799
example

461
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,720
that their usage hasn't been at at a

462
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:08,960
minimum cut in half

463
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,440
okay but it's not uncommon for us to get

464
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,720
feedback from people that it's quite a

465
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,440
bit more than that where you know here

466
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,000
the same quantity whether it's you know

467
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,159
you know couple grams eth however you

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,720
want to describe your your your quantity

469
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,559
that you consume per week per month

470
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,240
whatever well all of a sudden it's not

471
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,359
that I'm just consuming half but you

472
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,359
know normally I would buy the same

473
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,719
amount every week and so I was in kind

474
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,839
of the habit of doing that you I'm

475
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,360
speaking as a

476
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,519
customer and after I got this product

477
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:42,599
and I started using it

478
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:47,839
well I found out for a couple two three

479
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:50,839
weeks my stash was so big that I had to

480
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,240
completely change what I was doing and

481
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,720
now here I am a month later and it's

482
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,038
getting

483
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,440
old it so it just it became kind of a

484
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:05,119
profound experience that had to change

485
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,038
habits and why

486
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,839
well because my flower was getting old

487
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,599
not

488
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,439
because they feel

489
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,879
like uh oh I can only have a little bit

490
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,880
at a time only have a little bit of time

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,720
no it's not like that at all the the

492
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,000
people that buy the product are actually

493
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,558
kind of shocked at how they find that

494
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,720
they're at or even slightly above the

495
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,038
level of satisfaction that they're

496
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,278
seeking consistently as often as they

497
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,200
would like to be sometimes even more

498
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:43,200
more often than they would than they

499
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,400
were comparatively from smoking because

500
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,798
there's some other advantages because

501
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,200
you don't have the smoke and so you can

502
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,480
be a bit more discreet and you don't

503
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,558
have as much odor

504
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,880
around and still the usage goes

505
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:58,639
down that's one of the biggest things

506
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,919
I've noticed is that it really sort of

507
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,880
hits that satiation point you feel like

508
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,480
you've got to where you wanted to go and

509
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,400
then you're good for ages which I love

510
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,240
um yeah I I I I think for me in my

511
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,840
personal instance it would be more than

512
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,200
more than half this is the other thing

513
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,199
I've noticed with the other Vapes and

514
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,159
you might have a bit insight into this I

515
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,558
noticed that if I load them up they end

516
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,360
up like I've got a it ends up like

517
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,879
condensing in the stem somewhere and you

518
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,959
end up getting a lot of like I don't

519
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,640
know the Vape equivalent of CRC or

520
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,919
something like that and you got to clean

521
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,520
it out right yeah and obviously you

522
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,200
don't get any of that with the DAP so I

523
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,200
think is that just a reflection of the

524
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,759
efficiencies well so there there's a

525
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,679
number of interesting things at play

526
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:54,919
here um one of them

527
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:58,640
is we're we're functioning way more in

528
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,240
an ond demand function uh than most most

529
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,400
of the other products that are currently

530
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,640
on the market okay because again there's

531
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,080
always exceptions and please uh I don't

532
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,278
want to be misunderstood in any regard

533
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,918
I'm not trying to downplay anyone else's

534
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,000
product at all okay there's other

535
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,919
products on the market and some of them

536
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,240
are actually very good you know I even

537
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,679
own some of

538
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,679
them we're just our products have a

539
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,120
little bit of a different approach and

540
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,960
in comparison if you think again just

541
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,158
use the dynavap M because it's one of

542
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,400
our bestselling products

543
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,360
you can go from something that is room

544
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,519
temperature to something that is ready

545
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:41,479
for low temperature extraction in under

546
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:45,000
10 seconds or at the same time for a few

547
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,120
seconds more you can do a near complete

548
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,759
what they like to refer to as a one hit

549
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,000
extraction and strip out almost

550
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,000
everything worth taking from the whole

551
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,400
chamber and one

552
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,759
go and it's cool enough to put back in

553
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,640
your pocket all in under a

554
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,679
minute and why does this matter well it

555
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,559
matters for a couple of reasons the

556
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,919
first

557
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:13,399
is a lot of the active compounds that

558
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:17,480
we're seeking to consume they

559
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,400
degrade at temperature and if they don't

560
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,319
degrade they change character at

561
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,720
temperature and this is a big part of

562
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,759
the reason why Edibles have a different

563
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,798
effect than inhaled compounds of course

564
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,720
you got liver enzymes and other things

565
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:37,759
like that to come into place not trying

566
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:40,200
to misconstrue anything but when we take

567
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,440
material that's been held at temperature

568
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,798
for a long

569
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,399
time it's going to be different than

570
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,798
something that's heated up quick

571
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:49,798
extracted quick and then you're done

572
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:53,038
well if you don't consume all of it in

573
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,879
one go it's cooling back down very

574
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:59,038
quickly which helps to contribute to

575
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,120
that overall conservation okay

576
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,240
the other thing that also really helps

577
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:07,199
is because we can get a very

578
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,759
concentrated output because of the way

579
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,480
that the product works uh we can produce

580
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,558
Vapor that

581
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,079
is very similar in terms of Nature and

582
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:22,000
character and intensity as smoke this

583
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,678
also really helps people with that

584
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,839
transition when they choose that the

585
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,919
time is right for them to inhale less

586
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:33,639
smoke and go for an alternative well

587
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,880
dap can provide an experience that under

588
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,679
most people's opinion is more analogous

589
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,520
to smoking than pretty much anything

590
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,399
else that's out there because you can

591
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:47,200
get that really thick flavorful high

592
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,239
intensity

593
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,440
experience absolutely absolutely and one

594
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,399
of the the questions I I had been asked

595
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,159
by a buddy who had recently got on to

596
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:02,158
vaping as opposed to combustion was he

597
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,159
was sort of saying oh you know I'm just

598
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,720
and and I've heard this before is people

599
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,240
say so there's two things the first is

600
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,200
that they they want their pallet to

601
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,359
readjust straight away and I try to

602
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,880
explain to them that that takes time you

603
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,959
know like that's like a Beer Drinker

604
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,278
having a wine like it's it's probably

605
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,840
going to taste pretty General and you

606
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,440
know you don't pick up on the nuances

607
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,879
like the beer but you know so I'd love

608
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,919
to hear your thoughts on that um but

609
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,559
also about the flavor profile you know

610
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,080
and I just say look the tpin are in like

611
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,398
the first hit and you know you really

612
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,759
just enjoy that um but I was wondering

613
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:39,599
do you think we'll ever get to the point

614
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,558
where we can somehow get the tpin to

615
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,480
sort

616
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,558
of like proportionately come out with

617
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,839
each hit or is it just invariable due to

618
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:49,398
the mechanics that like they're just

619
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,639
going to be in that first hit

620
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:56,918
predominantly okay I really really like

621
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:01,038
that question okay because I mean at the

622
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:03,200
core right what is an Enthusiast in this

623
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,558
space looking for right we're

624
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,440
looking not just for how is this going

625
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:14,639
to make me feel no we're looking for

626
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,759
everything right and the flavor is a

627
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,159
really large component of that right you

628
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:23,440
know if flavor didn't matter people

629
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,360
wouldn't bother with all of these beers

630
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
with all of these flavors in them they

631
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,398
would just simply pour a little bit of

632
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,919
distilled ethanol in some water at the

633
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:35,879
same concentration carbonate it and boom

634
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:39,759
you're going to get the same effect

635
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:43,919
without the flavor okay flavor flavor

636
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:46,440
really really matters right

637
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,919
so how do we

638
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,960
get that beautiful flavorful hit each

639
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,960
time

640
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,278
well there is a

641
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:01,640
way and it's actually not very difficult

642
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:04,640
okay and the fun thing is you're already

643
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,840
either doing it or almost doing it okay

644
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,399
and here's how it works

645
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,839
okay and the results of this might

646
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,439
actually be surprising for people if you

647
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,599
haven't tried this yet I'm going to

648
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,640
encourage you to give it a shot right

649
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,719
and that's this if you have any dnap

650
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,919
that's been manufactured recently you

651
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,880
know an M uh just about anything except

652
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:31,038
the hyperd uh or of course the B and I'm

653
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,640
going to say that because the B is kind

654
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,519
of permanent half Bowl size anyway so

655
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,278
really really small you know

656
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,000
0.5 maximum load even if you're packing

657
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:43,558
it stiff it's it's

658
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,839
tiny

659
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:49,918
okay but if you put the chamber into the

660
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:53,678
smaller position and just do a light

661
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,559
load heat it up and heat middle of the

662
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,559
cap maybe base of the cap you know

663
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,440
closer to the stem so it gets a little

664
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,319
bit hotter

665
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,000
and just extract the vast majority of

666
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,960
what you want in one go and here's how

667
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,159
I'm going to prescribe that you do that

668
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,399
okay as soon as it

669
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,799
clicks put it in your mouth pretend the

670
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:18,000
airport doesn't exist in fact make sure

671
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,720
you do not obstruct it and if you're

672
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,798
going to only for one to two seconds and

673
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
then get your finger out of the way and

674
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:27,720
let the fluid dynamics that have been

675
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,798
engineered into this product do their

676
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,720
magic

677
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:37,000
okay and just do a nice long comfortable

678
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:41,679
inhale and what you're going to find

679
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,240
is something rather surprising okay this

680
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:49,080
product will function in ways that just

681
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:53,038
maybe won't make sense okay and what you

682
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,960
end up with is all that beautiful flavor

683
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,480
for an extended period of time a

684
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,919
reasonably good extraction of everything

685
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,798
that's now in your half chamber and

686
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:08,799
here's the best part you just consumed

687
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:13,079
likely less than 5 hundreds of a gram

688
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:17,359
okay well soon as that cap clicks empty

689
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:19,000
it out save it in your ABV jar reload it

690
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,278
and by the time you get done reloading

691
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,200
it then think to yourself okay how do I

692
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:29,798
feel do I actually want now or did I

693
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,120
just prepare this for my future

694
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:35,158
self I love that a little a little

695
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,839
future gift for

696
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:41,080
me well at least that's how it works for

697
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:44,959
me is that I'll just take a little

698
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,720
taste and I think like many people I'm

699
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,840
always looking for a little bit more

700
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,558
depending on what's going on okay but by

701
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,240
the time I get done going through the

702
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:57,359
process of preparing that little bit

703
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,599
more I take a breath and I think okay

704
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,199
now what am I going to do

705
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:05,480
next and I come to the realization that

706
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,120
actually no I'm exactly where I want to

707
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,639
be right now cool and it just goes right

708
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,199
back in my pocket and the next time I'm

709
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:16,439
craving a little bit of that beautiful

710
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,240
flavor I know it's just a few seconds

711
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,000
away that's epic I I'm going to have to

712
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,278
give that a go and I encourage everyone

713
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,679
to uh to to rewind it back and to to

714
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,240
take a hit just how it's been prescribed

715
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,278
I'm I'm really excited for that

716
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,278
well it's it's it's a really interesting

717
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,159
experience because there's there's a

718
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,519
couple fun things that happen when we

719
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,480
use the product in this way and I'll

720
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,960
I'll try try and do my best to describe

721
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,599
with words you know for those people

722
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,600
that just aren't able to really see

723
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:49,719
because again what am I really going to

724
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:51,759
show okay but with a Dy ofite product

725
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,399
you've got a cap right that covers the

726
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:57,480
chamber that cap has a thermostat in it

727
00:31:54,398 --> 00:32:00,678
okay that gives us a little click or two

728
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,960
to let know when our extraction chamber

729
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,320
or our oven is about at the right

730
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,960
temperature now of course we can adjust

731
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:08,359
that temperature a little bit by how we

732
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,519
heat whether we go a little deeper in an

733
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:13,719
induction heater or by moving our

734
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,278
lighter a little bit more towards the uh

735
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,519
crimp on the cap or a little bit the

736
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,038
opposite direction which you call more

737
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,120
towards the base right heat the tip for

738
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:25,200
a tasty rip or heat the base to go to

739
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:28,319
space and this works particularly well

740
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,880
on the uh the M7 stainless steel tips

741
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,200
you know below the base to melt your

742
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,159
face because it'll give you that highest

743
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,639
temperature in your oven uh with the

744
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,519
without necessarily combustion so you

745
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:42,119
can get everything kind of all in one go

746
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,759
anyway

747
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:47,558
when we leave the

748
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,599
airport uncovered and we simply draw on

749
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:51,440
the device the airports have been kind

750
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,599
of engineered to be of a shape or size

751
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,720
that when you draw on it the way that we

752
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,079
feel most people draw on it you get a

753
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,798
fair bit of air that comes through that

754
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,879
airport which helps to cool and

755
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:05,398
condition that Vapor which makes it way

756
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,080
more pleasant and comfortable to inhale

757
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,239
it doesn't really dilute the flavor at

758
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:12,798
all okay but the other thing that it

759
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,278
does do is it minimizes how much

760
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,558
air goes through the oven or the

761
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,599
extraction chamber and why does this

762
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:22,558
matter it matters because well let's

763
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,918
think about it last time you burned your

764
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:28,638
finger the first thing you did was blow

765
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,000
on it right to cool it off okay well

766
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:31,879
that's not what we want to do to our

767
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,240
extraction chamber we just got done

768
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,159
heating it up we want it to stay hot

769
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,159
long enough that we can

770
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:43,638
extract when we cover the airport and

771
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:48,599
hit it hard we're forcing more air to go

772
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:51,199
through then is necessary to displace

773
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:55,759
The Vapor that's being produced okay

774
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,278
which cools it down faster so here's why

775
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,919
that matters right we leave that airport

776
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,919
open we're able to get a big nice

777
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,240
comfortable draw our extraction chamber

778
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,918
stays at extraction

779
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:15,119
temperature maybe as much as 30 to 40%

780
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:17,239
longer okay so you can get sometimes an

781
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,119
absolutely massive

782
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:23,279
hit even though the airport is wide open

783
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,639
because your chamber stays hot longer

784
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,919
and you can just keep pulling and

785
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,399
pulling and

786
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,078
pulling that's that's also another

787
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,878
brilliant point I um I had I had sort of

788
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,159
anecdotally been playing around with

789
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,878
different settings and hadn't quite

790
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,919
pieced together why some of the hits

791
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:40,118
were working a lot better but I think

792
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,000
you've just sort of helped me to

793
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,960
understand why and it brings us to this

794
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,480
sort of topic I wanted to ask you about

795
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,240
which is one of the things I love about

796
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,838
the dino VAP is for lack of a better

797
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,638
words I think there is like this huge

798
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,759
sort of skill cap in a sense you know if

799
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,200
you want to think of it like a game like

800
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,760
you know you can pick it up and you can

801
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:05,118
do a pretty cumbersome job and still get

802
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,480
where you want but then you can also

803
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,640
like really you know bang out the Mona

804
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,199
liser of hits and just you know get

805
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,879
perfect what what's your advice to

806
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:16,519
people about the skill curve and how to

807
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,200
get better with it okay oh that's that's

808
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,559
so good and I think you put it in a

809
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:24,399
really elegant way uh because I I think

810
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:27,039
it just makes sense right you take the

811
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,200
same tool and you put it in the hands of

812
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,920
someone that's never used the tool or

813
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,358
someone that's been using that tool for

814
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,920
40

815
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:39,000
years you're going to see a different

816
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,000
output right that's just skill and

817
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,760
that's something that as

818
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,679
humans we just develop intrinsically by

819
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,280
doing the things that we do repeatedly

820
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:53,480
right that's what experience is all

821
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:57,119
about okay and that in my opinion is I

822
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,240
think the appeal of the analog device

823
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,960
right

824
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,039
analog

825
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,240
meaning who's in

826
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,599
control the person holding the device

827
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:10,318
right yes we've got all kinds of what

828
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,920
I'm going to call quasi controls on all

829
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:15,000
of the battery powered and digital

830
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,720
devices right we're technically in

831
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,440
control because we're turning them on

832
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,239
right we're technically in control

833
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:26,280
because we're setting the temperature

834
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:27,679
okay but we're only uh indirectly in

835
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,160
control because when we set the

836
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,598
temperature we're just setting some

837
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,759
arbitrary parameters and letting the

838
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,039
electronics do everything else when we

839
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,319
use a product like

840
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:45,358
dynavap we are the control and there's a

841
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:48,719
little something extra that comes from

842
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,799
being the control that is not unlike for

843
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,639
any of you that have ever driven a

844
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,599
manual transmission car or motorcycle

845
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,199
right and understanding the interplay

846
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:03,920
between the throttle and the clutch

847
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:05,399
who's in control right and the finesse

848
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,000
that a person that understands those

849
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,920
controls can apply to a wide range of

850
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,159
circumstances whether it's the hill

851
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,920
start or you know just comfortably

852
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:18,920
changing gears sometimes without even

853
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,119
using the clutch under the right

854
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,039
circumstances because you know your

855
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,880
vehicle and you know that you can

856
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,159
synchronize things and just make it

857
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,519
happen because you're just familiar with

858
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,519
it

859
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,318
totally so I mean I guess as an

860
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,559
extension of that I want to know like is

861
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,358
there what what's your personal routine

862
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,440
for taking a hit is it is it as simple

863
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,719
as like you know I just at the base if I

864
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,679
want to go hard or is there a bit more

865
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,399
finesse and a little extra you do that

866
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,879
you think sort of adds to it all well uh

867
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,079
that that's a fun one

868
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,920
because it depends if I'm doing it for

869
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,519
myself or I'm doing it for someone else

870
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,639
right and so I get the the distinct

871
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,440
pleasure of being able to introduce

872
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,879
people to this product for the first

873
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,599
time occasionally

874
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,358
right and it's really

875
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,559
fun when you know okay you get the

876
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,639
introductions or maybe it's some that

877
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,759
you've known for a while or you're being

878
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,920
introduced by someone that you've known

879
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,960
for a while hey I want you to meet so

880
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,720
and so and you know that they really

881
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,039
like to smoke uh they've tried a number

882
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:26,318
of different options but it's just never

883
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:28,039
really done it for him okay uh all right

884
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:31,159
well that that's great information so

885
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,759
now I know that H I'm going to heat the

886
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:36,358
Bas so this person can go to space and

887
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,160
so they can really understand the true

888
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:43,239
potential of we'll just say this side of

889
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:45,879
the force right

890
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,959
uh it it can be really powerful if you

891
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,119
want it to be but you know for my own

892
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,559
personal preferences well that's the

893
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:59,119
beautiful thing of having the analog

894
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:02,799
product that h right now where I want to

895
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,880
be in a high functioning state so I can

896
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,240
hopefully string together the right

897
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,119
words and the right combination to

898
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,719
communicate effectively and tell a kind

899
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,880
of a fun

900
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:13,959
story I didn't exactly heat the bass if

901
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,760
you know what I

902
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,639
mean uh but there may be other

903
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,640
circumstances where

904
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,720
okay everything that really needed to

905
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,879
get done has now been checked off the

906
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,399
list

907
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,920
okay do I have something to drink nearby

908
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,358
yes cool do I have something to snack on

909
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,639
nearby yes

910
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:42,199
cool H is there something interesting in

911
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,400
front of me to do for the next time

912
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,679
frame where I don't have to change my

913
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,119
physical location

914
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,559
check okay it might take a little longer

915
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,480
to reach the click at this point in

916
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:58,559
time I love that I love that that's

917
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,480
that's beautiful and I mean normally we

918
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,358
we start off with this question but I I

919
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,119
forgot to ask you what have you been

920
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,078
smoking on

921
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,000
recently okay

922
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,960
so this is a really fun one and I'm not

923
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,719
going to remember the names of all of

924
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,400
the strains

925
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:19,439
but uh I was at a

926
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,599
conference gosh it's been two weeks ago

927
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,519
now uh maybe a little bit longer than

928
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,640
that uh and met up with another you know

929
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,119
good friend

930
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:32,598
and he's also kind of a

931
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,119
grower grows some really good quality

932
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,599
stuff and

933
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,200
so I I gotta add more context because

934
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:43,200
it's just gonna really help add the

935
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,239
flavor to why this is just fun right

936
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,318
okay so met up with him haven't seen him

937
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:52,279
gez it's

938
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:56,239
been probably seven eight months right I

939
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:58,960
think I saw him in in Vegas last time

940
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,239
and so we're just kind of catching up

941
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,400
and then he had to go had something else

942
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,000
going on great hey can I leave my bag

943
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,358
you know in your room I like sure no

944
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,280
problem just going out to an event and

945
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:14,039
having bags in an event is just no fun

946
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,240
right it's nice just be travel

947
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,880
light I figured it was going to be late

948
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,118
by the time he got

949
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,318
back and then it was kind of late before

950
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,760
I was finally getting to bed and

951
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,039
everyone kind of left like like 2 a.m.

952
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,240
like all right I'm going to get some

953
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,440
sleep we got a lot to do tomorrow so I

954
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,919
go to

955
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,720
bed and I get a phone call at like 4:19

956
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,480
in the

957
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:41,199
morning it's like hey can I come get my

958

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,639
4:00 in the morning it doesn't exactly

961
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,639

00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,960
like fantastic

988
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:04,239
right now what am I going to do with it

989
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,920
well well what I ended up doing is they

990
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,838
ended up

991
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,000
becoming their own strain because all

992
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:13,679
four of them got mixed up because that

993
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,079
can have kind of a fun effect all by

994
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:19,558
itself and that's that's what's been

995
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:23,839
kind of my favorite here here the past

996
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:27,800
week or two is I've got this like

997
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:31,440
quadruple Entourage mixture

998
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,640
of four really nice strains grown with

999
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,280
love and care by someone that has some

1000
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:39,759
passion for the

1001
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,160
plant oh that's beautiful and I feel

1002
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,480
like you're a mind reader but that I

1003
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,799
mean you know who who can argue with a

1004
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,880
classic gumbo that's just done perfectly

1005
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,559
and that was actually what I was going

1006
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:56,000
to ask you about next which was blending

1007
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,599
both within strains you know two three

1008
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,039
four different strains

1009
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,838
but without going to out in the deep end

1010
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:04,800
I also wanted to ask have you ever heard

1011
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:07,639
from people who have experimented with

1012
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,000
like blending tobacco in there with it

1013
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:12,558
now this is obviously not like any sort

1014
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,079
of you know go smoke tobacco kids or

1015
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,640
anything like that like if you smoke it

1016
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,039
cool um but I I am interested cuz I've

1017
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,279
had other guests on the show notably

1018
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,679
Bodie and he you know he's like a very

1019
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,240
spiritual guy and and I he gave this

1020
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,239
description that really resonated with

1021
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:27,879
me and he says look you know I don't

1022
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,199
smoke with tobacco but like once every

1023
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,318
so often I do and I sort of think of it

1024
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,639
as like a saddle and it's like when you

1025
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,279
put a saddle on a horse you can go to a

1026
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,000
different place than if you didn't have

1027
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,200
maybe a little further or you know

1028
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,880
different terrain sure absolutely I'd

1029
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,199
love to hear your thoughts on blending

1030
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,318
and anything you've

1031
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:51,759
heard so I don't personally use

1032
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:54,599
tobacco on a regular

1033
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,319
basis I'm not going to say that I don't

1034
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,680
occasionally consume a small amount

1035
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,679
the same thing kind of goes when it

1036
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:06,759
comes to you know other things like beer

1037
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:09,358
Etc I think that the human as an

1038
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,079
individual and if we want to say as a

1039
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:15,679
spiritual being benefits and I want to

1040
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,920
really emphasize that word

1041
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:21,598
benefits

1042
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,559
significantly from an occasional shift

1043
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,280
in perspective and change of state of

1044
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,200
mind in fact

1045
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,880
I think it's probably one of the most

1046
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,439
valuable things that an individual can

1047
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,280
do to help them become a little bit more

1048
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,039
of a full person and become a little bit

1049
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,000
more aware of not only who they are but

1050
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:47,279
how they fit into everything else in

1051
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,880
interface with everyone else and

1052
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,160
tobacco when used properly with a little

1053
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,280
bit of

1054
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:57,799
respect can contribute to that okay but

1055
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,680
uh since we're talking about a bit of a

1056
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,559
controversial topic I think it's

1057
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,279
probably worth adding a few additional

1058
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:07,240
words to Define what I mean when I say

1059
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,319
using tobacco with

1060
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:13,759
respect what that what does that mean it

1061
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,838
doesn't mean rolling a spliff that's 50%

1062
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,839
tobacco and that's your typical daily

1063
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:20,960
consumption routine no if that's what

1064
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,400
you do and that's what you choose to do

1065
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,920
I'm not going to pass judgment okay but

1066
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:31,680
that's just doing it because uh it makes

1067
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,240
makes it hit harder okay but if you very

1068
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,399
rarely consume

1069
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:39,159
tobacco a small amount because again

1070
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,480
sometimes less is more can really

1071
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:44,358
function as an

1072
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,679
amplifier and bring out some

1073
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:48,279
characteristics and some Nuance in a

1074
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,679
strain that you might be very familiar

1075
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:55,200
with that all of a sudden you're in a

1076
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:58,078
very different state or a very different

1077
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:00,558
place but not necessar in an unpleasant

1078
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,760
way and I think this is one of those

1079
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,760
things that tobacco can contribute and

1080
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,960
you'll find other interesting examples

1081
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,880
of this especially from uh some of the

1082
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,720
South

1083
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:16,680
American uh natives okay who was kind of

1084
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:19,399
where tobacco originated uh in terms of

1085
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:23,239
its introduction into we'll call it the

1086
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:26,519
current modern world right this this

1087
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:27,399
plant really revered for what it could

1088
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,559
do

1089
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,160
it wasn't consumed you know multiple

1090
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,280
times a day every single day by those

1091
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,199
people it was consumed on an occasional

1092
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,480
basis okay if you've ever heard the term

1093
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,039
peace pipe you know this wasn't the

1094
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,559
thing that people were doing all the

1095
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:43,400
time you know cigarettes didn't exist

1096
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,640
you

1097
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,680
know cigarettes just make things way too

1098
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:53,279
easy too convenient and I think they

1099
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,759
contribute to the dependency but I think

1100
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,480
like many other things whether it's

1101
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,599
alcohol cannabis and you know we can uh

1102
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,599
insert many other things into this

1103
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:07,000
category when they're used respectfully

1104
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:10,599
in a reasonable amount on an occasional

1105
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,480
basis they can contribute positively to

1106
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,039
the overall impact that that experience

1107
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,519
can have for the individual or

1108
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,079
potentially the group of people that are

1109
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,400
kind of getting

1110
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,800
together you know likely for some sort

1111
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,000
of Celebration or Community or gathering

1112
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,839
or what have you

1113
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,199
totally totally totally I um it's

1114
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:35,199
interesting you know cuz I I was like

1115
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:37,679
one of those guys who used to mix it

1116
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,639
consistently when I was very young and

1117
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,199
and it was so difficult to get off it

1118
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:42,879
and I realized I was inadvertently

1119
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,480
addicted to Tobacco just through the way

1120
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,400
I smoked it with weed but I I never

1121
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,679
considered myself like a tobacco smoker

1122
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,798
really cuz I never smoke cigarettes I

1123
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,838
just mix it but but I realized I had

1124
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:55,000
certainly got addicted anyway so for a

1125
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:57,078
long time I was super hesitant to go

1126
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,358
back despite hearing this sort of thing

1127
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,440
because I was like oh man I don't want

1128
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:02,279
to get addicted but I'll reassure

1129
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,480
everyone you know you can certainly do

1130
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,280
it if it's just once every so often it's

1131
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,159
it it's really you know like I don't

1132
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,839
want to say it's like doing psychedelics

1133
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,838
but it kind of is in the way that you

1134
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:15,000
like you know you sort of not that

1135
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,119
you're going to have some sort of

1136
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
psychedelic experience but you're hoping

1137
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,119
to gain something from this as like a

1138
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,519
sort of spiritual thing as opposed to

1139
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:27,000
just like oh I'm just getting high with

1140
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,838
tobacco tonight um and I wholeheartedly

1141
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,960
I wholeheartedly agree as a quick

1142
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:32,960
followup do you know is it possible to

1143
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,798
use a Dap to do that or do you think oh

1144
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,240
it's it's not going to work the way

1145
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:40,000
you'd want it no it it actually works

1146
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:43,439
really really well uh so here's a bit of

1147
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,798
fun history right so when I was in the

1148
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,639
early stages of developing some of the

1149
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:50,480
initial products you know for

1150
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,239
dynamap there there's a couple key

1151
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,358
principles that I established early on

1152
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:59,000
that were part of

1153
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:02,798
the were that constituted the goal right

1154
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,719
and and what I mean there is okay before

1155
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:08,280
dap existed really as a company I was

1156
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:11,318
just uh you know sitting on the couch

1157
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,680
you know one uh one evening uh with a

1158
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:16,358
couple people I like hanging out with

1159
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,679
and we were using what at the time was

1160
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:20,798
my first vaporizer a little butane

1161
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:24,279
powered iite made by uh a company in

1162
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:26,440
Ireland right really neat little thing

1163
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,319
uh and it makes for a really Pleasant

1164
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,559
EXP experience but it's big it's bulky

1165
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,000
it's expensive and so we're talking

1166
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:34,440
about it as we're enjoying it it's like

1167
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,639
you know why do these things need to be

1168
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,480
so big and so expensive and you know is

1169
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:43,719
is the future going to be a place

1170
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,000
where a lot fewer people light their

1171
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:47,838
flower on

1172
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,119
fire and more people simply bake it

1173
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:54,199
instead of burning

1174
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:56,200
it and it's like you know I think so but

1175
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:57,639
not if it's going to be this expensive

1176
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,879
it's just not going to be practical you

1177
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,920
know except for people that have access

1178
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,519
to a lot of

1179
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,920
resources

1180
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:07,159
and I was just thinking like well that's

1181
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,519
kind of sad because here you've got

1182
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:11,798
something that can be so

1183
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,920
impactful but it's just not accessible

1184
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:15,719
in a way

1185
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,880
that's not

1186
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:22,078
harmful okay so that kind of was the

1187
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,440
impetus for for doing all of this and

1188
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,760
once uh that question was planted well

1189
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,720
you know how big and how expensive does

1190
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,000
a vaporiser need to be well let's try

1191
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,879
and make one and find out all right well

1192
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,838
then the next questions start to follow

1193
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,559
suit and like okay well if we're going

1194
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:39,558
to make something that is really geared

1195
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,079
towards a product that is applicable to

1196
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:45,000
as broad a range of people from as many

1197
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,920
walks of life as possible to have as

1198
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
positive an impact on society in general

1199
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,960
as we can to make it so that smoking

1200
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,480
becomes more of a a choice than a

1201
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,760
necessity you know for a route of

1202
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,119
administration because really even some

1203
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,640
of the most poor people could afford you

1204
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,720
know a product like

1205
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:08,000
dap where here you could buy this thing

1206
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,719
yeah it might cost you a week's pay but

1207
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,400
it'll last you your whole

1208
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:16,598
life and it'll actually pay for itself

1209
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,000
over and over and over again just in

1210
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,039
what it saves you in terms of what

1211
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,199
you're consuming on top of the fact that

1212
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,880
you're going to be consuming a lot less

1213
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:27,919
harmful things so it can have a a

1214
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,280
multiplied effect of positivity on the

1215
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,480
individual as well as the people around

1216
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,400
that individual okay well how do we get

1217
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,798
there and how do we make something

1218
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,119
that's that form factor that just makes

1219
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:39,838
sense and it's familiar because we're

1220
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,358
already going to be changing the the

1221
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:45,599
whole approach here by not lighting

1222
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,798
things right by now we got to heat them

1223
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,200
instead of light

1224
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:53,639
them and people don't change easily

1225
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:55,759
readily well so the answer to that

1226
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:57,920
question is we need to do everything we

1227
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,359
practically can to

1228
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:05,720
emulate the

1229
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:08,679
ritual of smoking okay so the very first

1230
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:11,039
prototypes were aimed at making a

1231
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,598
product that was as similar and as

1232
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:17,558
analogous to smoking as we practically

1233
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,880
could and even so far as when I started

1234
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:23,760
working with some of the the glass like

1235
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:27,599
well I want to use glass that's got an 8

1236
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:30,359
mm inside diameter because then

1237
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,480
people that are smoking cigarettes can

1238
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,960
simply insert the end of a cigarette and

1239
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:40,400
snap it off and literally use a

1240
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:45,119
cigarette as a multi-use cartridge to

1241
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:48,200
fill their dap device with their

1242
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,680
tobacco and maybe just a couple times a

1243
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:54,239
day they'll use dap instead of lighting

1244
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:57,679
the cigarette and find that wow I can

1245
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,759
thermally extract one Chambers Worth or

1246
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,879
generally near about A fifth or sixth of

1247
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,559
a

1248
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,119
cigarette and get near the same level of

1249
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,519
satisfaction that I get from smoking a

1250
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,000
whole cigarette experience some harm

1251
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,559
reduction some cost savings a whole

1252
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,440
different flavor profile and just do it

1253
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:18,000
simply and easily so long answered your

1254
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,079
question there dap absolutely will work

1255
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,760
with traditional

1256
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:26,880
tobacco uh in fact for those people that

1257
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,920
really have we'll call it a relationship

1258
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,838
with

1259
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:35,358
tobacco some good quality pipe

1260
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:37,920
tobacco is actually quite delightful

1261
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,440
because I mean think I've rarely run

1262
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,440
across a person that doesn't actually

1263
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,440
like the way pipe tobacco smells both in

1264
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,760
raw form when you open the bag and even

1265
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:50,358
being burned it actually smells quite

1266
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,920
nice doesn't taste quite as nice as it

1267
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,679
smells until you put it into your

1268
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:59,920
thermal extraction device and then you

1269
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:03,279
find that wow it actually tastes like it

1270
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,599
smells and that became a lot more

1271
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,240
apparent to me you know during those

1272
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:09,119
early days of development where I would

1273
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:11,798
actually take a little bit of pipe

1274
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,318
tobacco because I wanted to

1275
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:17,358
understand okay the applicability not

1276
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,440
only towards tobacco but across the

1277
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:19,798
whole board because I didn't want to

1278
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,079
just make a product that was just geared

1279
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:24,280
towards cannabis the goal was to uh if

1280
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:27,000
you've ever seen it in some of our

1281
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,039
marketing stuff you know our

1282
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,119
our goal as a company our mission is to

1283
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,039
uh make smoking history

1284
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:37,519
right

1285
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:39,760
and so and I like that because we can

1286
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,960
interpret it multiple ways okay and I'm

1287
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,559
not saying that one way is the correct

1288
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,039
way because maybe it's

1289
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:48,720
both okay or all

1290
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:51,200
three and it's not just smoking cannabis

1291
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,399
right it's if we have a product that

1292
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,159
allows a person to get what they're

1293
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,760
looking for from the plant matter that

1294
00:55:55,159 --> 00:56:01,279
they choose to get it

1295
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,079
from well great now you can get what

1296
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,359
you're looking for without lighting it

1297
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:08,880
on fire and you can preserve what in my

1298
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:12,038
opinion is probably one of the most

1299
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,280
important aspects of consuming that

1300
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,400
material that there is and the consuming

1301
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,480
of the material is not the most

1302
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,000
important

1303
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:24,159
thing it's the ritual of consuming that

1304
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,079
material that matters the

1305
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,719
most that might sound a little bit odd

1306
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,119
to you

1307
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:32,879
no not at all I mean I I think if you if

1308
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,640
you haven't heard of settin setting

1309
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,160
where have you been under a

1310
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:40,358
rock yeah no it it uh it it makes such a

1311
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,279
profound

1312
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:47,358
difference and I think here again this

1313
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:50,798
is another contributor to when people

1314
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:54,279
are having challenges with substances

1315
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:58,119
right the the ritual can either help or

1316
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:01,960
can hinder things okay

1317
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,880
because the ritual is all of those

1318
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,318
actions and those motions that we go

1319
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:11,160
through in preparation for what we're

1320
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:13,279
going to experience when we consume okay

1321
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:16,318
and that's whether we're going to the

1322
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,680
fridge grabbing a beer cracking it open

1323
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,880
and getting that first smell and taste

1324
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:23,838
okay this is ritual right or grabbing

1325
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,240
your pack of cigarettes and tapping it

1326
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,880
three times pulling out the lighter

1327
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:29,639
putting the cigarette in taking a little

1328
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,000
bit of a taste before we light it and

1329
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,639
all of these things that happen in

1330
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,679
sequence right the actions that happen

1331
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:41,078
in sequence especially the the ones that

1332
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:41,078
tend to

1333
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,079
be not just two or three seconds long

1334
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,760
but minutes long okay sitting down at

1335
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:50,519
the table grinding things up and

1336
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,640
preparing to roll up a joint or a spliff

1337
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:55,000
or whatever you want might want to do

1338
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:59,960
okay where it takes a little bit of time

1339
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,039
this time calms the Mind It prepares the

1340
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,199
mind and the body for what's about to

1341
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,440
happen Okay it actually sets forth a

1342
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,558
whole cascading chain of chemical

1343
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,159
reactions in the brain and the releasing

1344
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,559
of various neurotransmitters before

1345
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,838
anything's actually been consumed

1346
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:20,000
because we have trained

1347
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:22,358
ourselves the process we've trained

1348
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,960
ourselves a ritual and we've trained

1349
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:28,440
ourselves about what is going to happen

1350
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:32,880
next and so going through this ritual

1351
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:39,079
sets those wheels of anticipation in

1352
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:40,760
motion and they are so powerful that uh

1353
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:42,079
I'll use some stories that I've heard

1354
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,760
from the the

1355
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,119
community okay that people will sit down

1356
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,480
and go through the ritual and will heat

1357
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,798
up their their VAP cap get the click

1358
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,760
take a good long

1359
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,679
poll

1360
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,960
and think

1361
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:00,118
well didn't taste as strong as I thought

1362
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,480
it was going

1363
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:07,640
to but okay and exhale out little to

1364
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,760
nothing feel

1365
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:11,798
better and then when the cap clicks and

1366
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,559
cools off we'll take off the cap and

1367
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:19,239
look inside to find that there's nothing

1368
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:23,720
there but yet that empty

1369
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:26,558
chamber provides a surprising amount of

1370
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:29,598
relief and why is that

1371
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,079
well you've just given yourself a near

1372
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:34,838
Placebo right very little active

1373
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:38,280
compound but you

1374
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:40,000
have executed the most important part of

1375
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,798
the administration that's not the

1376
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,159
consumption it's the

1377
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:48,599
ritual totally and and you see this in

1378
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:50,798
even more extreme examples I've read

1379
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:52,440
about people trying to get off heroin

1380
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,559
and and they'll say that you know they

1381
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,720
they inject saline just cuz exactly what

1382
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,920
you said going through that ritual

1383
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,038
it's so

1384
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,079
dopaminergically related that it is it's

1385
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,920
hard to quantify and you know I found

1386
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,880
this to be most evident in two

1387
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,599
situations first of all when I first

1388
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,519
switched to vaping what I didn't realize

1389
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,079
like so when I first switched to vaping

1390
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,159
it was like when you were a kid and I

1391
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:19,200
don't know if you remember this but like

1392
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,719
you would smoke and it would actually

1393
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:24,960
take like three to five minutes before

1394
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:26,639
you really sort of became super aware

1395
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,440
that you were high

1396
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,480
and then I'm like oh my God okay so when

1397
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,559
I used to hit a bong and I would feel

1398
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,798
good straight away that first few

1399
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,960
minutes that was just all the ritual cuz

1400
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,759
like I know that it takes a little bit

1401
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,679
of time to actually and the same thing

1402
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,000
happens to a friend who doesn't smoke

1403
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,960
and you give them a hit they're like At

1404
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,159
first they're like I don't really feel

1405
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,159
it and then a few minutes later they're

1406
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,558
on the couch and um exactly and yeah so

1407
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,480
it really goes to show it and then the

1408
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,920
other thing I was going to quickly

1409
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,079
mention cuz when you were talking it's

1410
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,680
all I could think about like as you were

1411
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:57,559
discussing it is I was um I was recently

1412
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,679
on holiday and so like you know I was in

1413
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:02,160
a different state and out of my normal

1414
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,679
environment and I found pretty

1415
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:08,078
consistently I was hitting the dnap

1416
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:10,759
twice a day whereas I'm now at home with

1417
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,599
the same herb back to my normal grind

1418
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,480
and I could hit the DAP a couple times a

1419
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,480
day and so when I was away I was like

1420
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,798
wow like this is what it should be but

1421
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,400
it's just that I'm in my normal

1422
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:25,920
environment I feel like it's all a bit

1423
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,440
same Samy um it's really interesting and

1424
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,559
but now I'm trying to push myself to be

1425
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:34,240
like you know I know that I can get by

1426
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:36,559
with X you can right you know to a

1427
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:39,598
degree and and I don't mean this in a

1428
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,400
negative way we become

1429
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:45,680
numb to the day

1430
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:50,000
today and this is

1431
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:52,480
why people generally tend to benefit I'm

1432
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,199
going to say emotionally psychologically

1433
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,159
from taking a trip and when I say a trip

1434
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,598
I'm not talking necessarily about taking

1435
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:02,038
you know a psychedelic trip okay I'm

1436
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,200
talking about traveling somewhere you

1437
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:04,520
know going someplace that you haven't

1438
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,798
been before some place that you've been

1439
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:09,480
a long time ago that you really enjoyed

1440
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:11,119
or going someplace completely new and

1441
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,079
having some new experience and meeting

1442
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,960
some new people okay it broadens your

1443
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:20,400
perspective

1444
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:23,559
well the adage trip doesn't necessarily

1445
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,639
have to apply to travel or just to

1446
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:26,798
psychedelics okay you know we're talking

1447
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:28,159
about tobacco we're talking about

1448
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:29,119
cannabis we're talking about a wide

1449
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,038
range of

1450
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,760
things changing your state of mind is

1451
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:39,599
really the

1452
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:42,319
goal and when we're in a very familiar

1453
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,960
environment changing our state of mind

1454
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:49,679
is actually harder to do because we're

1455
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:52,519
in a very familiar environment that has

1456
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:54,318
an effect on who we are what we're doing

1457
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:57,079
what we're thinking what our choices are

1458
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,358
all this stuff and it engages different

1459
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:02,000
parts of our brain in our thought

1460
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:06,119
process versus when we force oursel to

1461
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:11,079
get out of our comfortable environment

1462
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:15,358
well things are functioning differently

1463
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:17,400
right it just changes everything and you

1464
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,480
know same situation where we're talking

1465
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,720
about earlier about mixing the

1466
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,639
strains well it changes things up and I

1467
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:27,480
think anyone that's had a little bit of

1468
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:29,719
experience with cannabis will tell you

1469
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,679
that changing

1470
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:35,480
strains whether it's after a day or

1471
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:38,358
after a week or even the same

1472
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,679
day it

1473
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:43,440
matters I used to say it's like a

1474
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:46,639
tolerance reset no

1475
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,079
way well whether you want to call it a

1476
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:51,239
reset or you want to call it a

1477
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:52,039
shift I'm going to completely agree with

1478
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,919
you

1479
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:56,319
because when we

1480
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,880
think what's really going on when we

1481
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:00,798
consume a different strain well of

1482
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,400
course the active compounds the ones

1483
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:06,719
that everyone knows about they're all

1484
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,920
there okay the other compounds whether

1485
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:12,038
we call them synergies or synergistic or

1486
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,559
you know Entourage whatever terms you

1487
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:18,119
want to use the reality

1488
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,680
is the fact that it's very easy to do a

1489
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:24,079
comparison personally if if if you're

1490
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:26,318
interested you know go to your local uh

1491
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:32,599
supplier right and and get yourself a

1492
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:34,079
cartridge that's 90 plus% THC okay and

1493
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:35,920
if you don't have a high tolerance well

1494
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,839
I want to caution you but just take a

1495
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:44,720
tiny tiny tiny little hit

1496
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:47,239
okay and write it out okay and then take

1497
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:50,078
a hit of just some raw

1498
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:52,759
flow and just do a comparison and what

1499
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:56,720
you're going to find is it's just not

1500
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,400
the same it's not just th see that

1501
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,519
contributes to what the overall

1502
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,079
experience is it certainly has a role

1503
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:05,679
there's no question okay but it's not

1504
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,760
the only

1505
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:09,879
thing not even close and it's not even

1506
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,319
just the compounds that are the only

1507
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:16,318
thing it's your state of mind it's your

1508
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:19,798
location it's what's going on in your

1509
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:22,920
world it's the people you're around

1510
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:25,079
right I guess with that in mind I I

1511
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,680
wanted to quickly ask you sometimes I

1512
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:30,200
talk to people they

1513
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:32,598
say I want to get more of like a sativ

1514
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:34,000
effect so I'm just going to do the tip

1515
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:35,760
or I'm just going to vape it low

1516
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
temperatures I'm going to try to avoid

1517
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,839
getting some of those other sort of CBN

1518
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,679
type compounds that maybe you know bit

1519
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:48,199
sedating do you feel that you can

1520
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:51,078
actually achieve that in the in the DAP

1521
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:54,318
or do you think like it's it's hard to

1522
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:57,839
sort of fractionally distillate it to an

1523
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:59,519
extent uh I would actually say it's

1524
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,798
extremely

1525
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,719
easy okay and and and and I would say

1526
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:08,798
that

1527
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:11,239
because uh who's in control right the

1528
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:14,000
the person applying the heat is in

1529
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:17,318
control and since we've got an analog

1530
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,199
device that analog device provides the

1531
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:23,159
person that's using it with the

1532
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:26,639
opportunity to really get familiar with

1533
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:28,598
it and get comfortable with it and

1534
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,879
understand it like they do their

1535
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:32,720
favorite razor when they're shaving

1536
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,480
their face okay their favorite writing

1537
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,439
utensil when they're writing a letter

1538
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,719
their favorite paintbrush right when

1539
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,159
they're trying to add the detail to

1540
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:42,000
their painting okay or whatever that

1541
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:45,920
tool might happen to be you get familiar

1542
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,480
with it so you can really make your

1543
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:52,440
experience almost to a tea exactly what

1544
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:57,039
you want it to be okay because you're in

1545
01:06:52,440 --> 01:07:00,119
control it's I think almost that

1546
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:02,760
simple yeah you can take that light tury

1547
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:05,880
tasty rip okay or you can heat the base

1548
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,880
and go to space and all from the same

1549
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,278
strain yeah and that's that's something

1550
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,519
that's good to hear cuz that was my

1551
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:14,440
suspicions because I I feel like you

1552
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:16,440
know I mentioned a bit earlier I love I

1553
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,480
love the sativas and I think that that's

1554
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,119
one of the versatilities of the unit you

1555
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,798
know you can almost take any strain and

1556
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:27,880
to an extent Coes out a more saish sort

1557
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:29,960
of expression of what you've got you

1558
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,358
know it's obviously not going to turn

1559
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,159
100% indicor into 100% sativa but you

1560
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:38,318
can try to push it a bit in that

1561
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:41,278
direction well it it allows for what I

1562
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:44,480
would refer to is a much more indepth

1563
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:47,159
exploration of what each strain has to

1564
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,559
offer and when we're when we're using

1565
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:51,480
the small size of our chamber to do

1566
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:56,519
little

1567
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:58,519
tasty uh rips right well how fun is this

1568
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,239
when we can just micro do a tiny little

1569
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:03,838
bit do a low temperature extraction put

1570
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:05,278
it down and if uh we happen to be one of

1571
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,480
those exceptional people that has more

1572
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:09,440
than one dynamap we can have another one

1573
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,880
loaded up with a different strain and

1574
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,200
whether it's a few minutes later an hour

1575
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,119
later we can pick that up do a little

1576
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:18,679
tasty

1577
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:19,759
rip and H wow interesting and and really

1578
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:22,158
compare those

1579
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,600
differences and then at the same time

1580
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,278
you can heat a little bit lower and do a

1581
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,480
much more thorough extra action and

1582
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:34,799
really enjoy how nice and soft the couch

1583
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:38,198
is and having Kitty on your lap is just

1584
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:41,119
fantastic right now yeah yeah I I can

1585
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:43,439
get down with that um in in one of the

1586
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:46,358
previous answers you you mentioned you

1587
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:49,559
know go out grab a cart see how it goes

1588
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:51,679
I I wanted to ask you about the rise of

1589
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,279
pens in the market and specifically

1590
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:57,480
about the younger generation who just

1591
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:59,799
seem to be really quite locked into sort

1592
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:00,879
of Vape card and Associated type

1593
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:04,119
products you know they're all sort of

1594
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:06,359
similar right from my point of view and

1595
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:09,960
the young people I've spoken to it seems

1596
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:13,159
to be primarily driven by

1597
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,719
convenience yes I I think that many of

1598
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:16,639
the convenience like you know the

1599
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,359
ability to have it quite discreetly and

1600
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,400
it's small and you can use it really

1601
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:22,560
quickly like as you've discussed they're

1602
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:26,479
they're all like the vend diagram is

1603
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:29,960
pretty big with dap so I wonder what's

1604
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:33,439
your thoughts on how we can maybe try to

1605
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:36,119
get some of these people over to

1606
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,079
experiencing the flower cuz my concern

1607
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:41,079
is that there's a whole younger

1608
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:43,559
generation of people who haven't got to

1609
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:46,679
experience the what I consider to be a

1610
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,039
slightly more nuanced experience of each

1611
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:51,920
strain um when you get to consume the

1612
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:53,920
Flow versus just a a quite a highly

1613
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:57,679
refined end

1614
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:00,000
product okay well so there's there's a

1615
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:03,480
couple things that come to mind there

1616
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,198
the first one is uh of course the

1617
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:11,319
convenience plays a massive factor in

1618
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:14,639
this okay uh but it's not all bad

1619
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:15,799
because it is nice because especially

1620
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,039
for some people depending on how you're

1621
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,279
wired or if you're contending with some

1622
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:25,119
other circumstances having a quick easy

1623
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:27,679
discreet access to even if it's a bit

1624
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:30,599
more more of a refined extract can

1625
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:32,359
actually be be very impactful in a

1626
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:36,600
positive way to that person's quality of

1627
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:39,759
life okay and the other good part of

1628
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:43,679
this is I've been noticing that some of

1629
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:45,440
the uh pens are really starting to get

1630
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,199
into the range of having much higher

1631
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:53,000
quality and much more full-bodied

1632
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:56,319
extracts that aren't just 94% THC with

1633
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
just enough other things to keep liquid

1634
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:02,920
right and it's not all about how high

1635
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:05,158
can I get how quickly no it's because

1636
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:08,560
the the people that really care about

1637
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:11,519
what's going on have come to the

1638
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:14,159
conclusion I think quite accurately that

1639
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,320
it's not just about THC it's about

1640
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:18,799
providing an overall more balanced

1641
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,920
experience and I've even seen just

1642
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,279
recently some carts now that have are

1643
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,119
starting to push the lower boundary

1644
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:31,519
limit of actual THC it's dropping down

1645
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:33,359
into the 20% range which is going to

1646
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,440
provide an experience that's much more

1647
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:38,719
on par with flour because you can

1648
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:40,559
actually find flour that has your THC

1649
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,480
content in the 20%

1650
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,039
range so there's some good options that

1651
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:49,519
are there and are becoming a bit more

1652
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:53,679
prominent but for people that have never

1653
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,760
experienced the real power of just raw

1654
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:59,399
unadulterated flower well

1655
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:03,960
well here's another goal for us as a

1656
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:05,559
company to make that kind of experience

1657
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,880
accessible

1658
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:11,440
because our goal is to have very

1659
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:14,319
inexpensive yet highquality durable

1660
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:16,638
products that are very approachable and

1661
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,399
easy for people to acquire without

1662
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:20,159
having to make a massive commitment

1663
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:23,238
without having to have a huge learning

1664
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:25,839
curve and so that they can experience

1665
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:29,319
what it's like to you know take their

1666
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:34,199
cookies just right you know respect the

1667
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:36,639
click have that experience right and it

1668
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:39,519
doesn't have to uh come from batteries

1669
01:12:36,639 --> 01:12:40,840
and be kind of in control of it and I

1670
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,080
find that uh there's even some

1671
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,319
applicability for the people that uh get

1672
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,679
a little bit of satisfaction from the

1673
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:50,599
fidget spinners for example right we

1674
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:53,119
make product that it fits in that

1675
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,719
category it's it's fun to hold it's it's

1676
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,039
got a little fidget ability to it

1677
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:00,239
it doesn't take up a lot of space it

1678
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:04,039
fits in your hand and at the same time

1679
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:07,000
it's a tool that you can use likely for

1680
01:13:04,039 --> 01:13:10,560
decades to kind of fill that Gap in your

1681
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
life and and then and finally the carts

1682
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,320
super convenient you know these

1683
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
disposable vaporizers and whatever you

1684
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:19,559
want to call them a lot of laws going in

1685
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,840
place because of the uh you all the all

1686
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,679
the batteries and electronics and

1687
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,319
everything else going to the

1688
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,920
landfill our company has the very

1689
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:30,759
opposite approach and it has from the

1690
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:33,000
very beginning let's let's see where the

1691
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,679
actual boundary is how durable a product

1692
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,198
can we actually make can we make a

1693
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:39,760
product that literally is generational I

1694
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:43,039
mean how cool is that right and a

1695
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,920
product that brings the

1696
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:49,359
ritual back from the convenience while

1697
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,359
not being

1698
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,439
inconvenient I I love that I love the

1699
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,960
fidget spinner sort of analogy it

1700
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:58,919
definitely makes sense and and the idea

1701
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,560
of making this you know essentially sort

1702
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,920
of indestructible item you got me

1703
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,520
thinking has anyone ever contacted you

1704
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,199
guys and like sent you in like a Haggard

1705
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,440
little unit and they're like I swear to

1706
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:13,359
God this is just wear and tear I haven't

1707
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:15,079
run over it with my car like cuz I have

1708
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,839
to imagine the answer is probably no

1709
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:19,039
like no one's ever actually legitimately

1710
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,119
broken it through wear and

1711
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:25,679
tear uh well it it has happened

1712
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:26,840
occasionally um you know

1713
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,319
there have been a few people that have

1714
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,480
run over it with their car and the one

1715
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:35,119
in particular and this was years back I

1716
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:37,759
think 2017 you know shortly after we

1717
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:39,439
launched the M uh you know they sent

1718
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,880
pictures ran over the

1719
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:45,839
car and all they were asking for was a

1720
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:48,800
new cap because it was kind of dented

1721
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,760
from the tire actually pressing the cap

1722
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,560
in between the fins right it didn't

1723
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,400
damage anything else there's a few Nick

1724
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,039
marks you know from the the the the

1725
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:59,279
cement you

1726
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:01,880
know and you know the metal being run

1727
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:05,880
over by the car so we sent him a new cap

1728
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:07,319
and you know that was cool so that and

1729
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,079
it's not to say that our products don't

1730
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:12,399
break okay they can break they may break

1731
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:13,800
you know a lot of them still have

1732
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:17,359
O-rings

1733
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,440
right uh they don't last forever but

1734
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:20,599
they don't cost very much and they're

1735
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:25,119
not hard to

1736
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:27,360
replace and and here you got all these

1737
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,439
individual parts of our products that

1738
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,559
are easy to take apart easy to clean

1739
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,960
easy to

1740
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,880
reassemble and just easy for the

1741
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,800
consumer to

1742
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,960
maintain and if necessary do a little

1743
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,560
bit of repair work and that I think

1744
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,439
actually

1745
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,400
contributes at least from what I read in

1746
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,039
a very positive way to the

1747
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:52,000
overall

1748
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:55,000
experience of of owning the product that

1749
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,960
hey you know what today I'm going to

1750
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,119
clean some of my dynavap devices okay

1751
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,600
and and that uh leads into another

1752
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:06,800
really fun thing that maybe some people

1753
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:11,039
still don't know about right and that

1754
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:14,719
is we already know that using dap

1755
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:17,399
products can stretch your stash

1756
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,000
significantly just from the consuming

1757
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:21,319
and inhaling those compounds for the

1758
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,920
effect that you're looking

1759
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:26,079
for well secondary to that is what

1760
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,639
whatever is left in your chamber when

1761
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:33,158
you're done can be saved and is all now

1762
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:35,319
decarbed and can be consumed at will and

1763
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:36,679
will give you whatever you didn't inhale

1764
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:38,799
you'll be able to consume it that way

1765
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:41,399
and you'll get that effect so we get an

1766
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,159
additional multiplier well there's a

1767
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:46,439
third multiplier that is actually I

1768
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,960
think one of my favorites and that is

1769
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:52,759
what uh is usually referred to as stem

1770
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,439
milk but I think a better way for to

1771
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,800
describe it is it's more like tiping

1772
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:59,599
condenser

1773
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,760
uh you know tea or coffee right and you

1774
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,120
just make yourself a good hot cup of

1775
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:07,119
coffee or tea definitely on the hot side

1776
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,158
you know close to Boiling is good you

1777
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:12,198
don't even necessarily have to put the

1778
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:16,479
tea in at first okay but you do put your

1779
01:17:12,198 --> 01:17:19,198
tip in your condenser right in that hot

1780
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:21,119
water okay pour in a little bit of good

1781
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:22,960
quality creamer the creamer is key it's

1782
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,439
really important because now you've got

1783
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:28,239
this homogenized fat that all of the

1784
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:30,719
good things that have condensed in your

1785
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:34,718
condensor or left over in your tip

1786
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:39,119
they're going to dissolve or uh diffuse

1787
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:41,800
into that hot water and creamer

1788
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:45,279
mixture and now you have a liquid edible

1789
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,840
that tastes like coffee or tea that well

1790
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,399
at the same time now just clean your

1791
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:51,440
device when it's all done you just rinse

1792
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:54,399
off your condensor and tip with some hot

1793
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:55,879
water and you clean your device you got

1794
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:59,719
to drinkable

1795
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:02,440
edible wow we just made things another

1796
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:05,039
level more

1797
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:07,119
efficient I wanted to ask you exactly

1798
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:10,119
about this which was what is your

1799
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:12,719
recommendation for the ABV because a lot

1800
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:15,238
of people differ and you know do you do

1801
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,239
I I read about the the water cure which

1802
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:19,039
apparently can make it a bit better

1803
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:21,079
what's your sort of recommendations on

1804
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:22,920
what people can do with that cuz I I

1805
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:25,880
certainly myself have accumulated a bit

1806
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:28,039
of it

1807
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:30,639
oh boy you know it's it I find that to

1808
01:18:28,039 --> 01:18:35,000
be such a personal preference thing

1809
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:38,039
because uh some people accumulate a fair

1810
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,719
bit some people don't accumulate much at

1811
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:42,840
all and it's one of those things well do

1812
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:44,760
you accumulate a little bit or do you

1813
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:48,000
accumulate a lot well that creates two

1814
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:50,520
different paths now second of that is do

1815
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,760
you like Edibles or do you not because

1816
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,840
some people really don't like that

1817
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,600
effect because it's very different when

1818
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,920
it goes you know Down the Hatch versus

1819
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,159
you know through the

1820
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,920
lungs and if you're not a big fan of

1821
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,920
that effect well then maybe you fall in

1822
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,239
that category where well when I'm done

1823
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,319
if I'm going to save it I'm going to

1824
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:11,279
save it for someone else uh or if you

1825
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:13,519
don't really accumulate very much well

1826
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,559
then when you're done it just goes back

1827
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,000
into the

1828
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:23,400
environment and that's okay

1829
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,279
too so personal preference thing and one

1830
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:27,638
you know fun little plug I wanted to

1831
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:30,158
make here when you're using a product

1832
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:34,039
that lasts for decades or

1833
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:37,198
longer and your input is nothing but raw

1834
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:39,198
flow well your net impact on the

1835
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:40,759
environment is no different than if the

1836
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,839
plant that you're just consuming had

1837
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:47,360
grown in nature finished its life cycle

1838
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:49,760
tipped over and hit the ground and got

1839
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:51,719
reabsorbed back into nature you know

1840
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,320
there's no paper there's no filters

1841
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,719
there's no tips there's no plastic

1842
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:56,840
there's no metal there's no batteries

1843
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:00,800
there's none of this other stuff it's

1844
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:03,560
just raw extracted

1845
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,840
flour yeah that's actually an

1846
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,719
interesting sort of um thought I I

1847
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,000
hadn't cross my mind I I like

1848
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,760
that and you know it's not even it's not

1849
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,359
even burned you know as if it was coming

1850
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,159
through a bowl or a joint you know an

1851
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:19,479
ash it's

1852
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:22,759
just like as if the plant had grown and

1853
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:24,919
got old and dried out and died

1854
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:27,360
sure I you know I like that I'm going to

1855
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,199
think about that for a bit I uh I wanted

1856
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,679
to follow up on one of the things we

1857
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:33,238
were talking about in our last episode

1858
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,039
which was you were talking about the

1859
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:39,599
dino coil which is super cool for anyone

1860
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:41,760
who likes concentrates um and we had a

1861
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,440
few guests who they were stoked about

1862
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,000
how you were talking about like making

1863
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,559
the little balls and putting it around

1864
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,479
the tip of it as like a cool way to sort

1865
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,600
of smoke some hash in the DAP are you

1866
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:55,519
able to put like BHO and sauce and stuff

1867
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:59,120
on the dino coil

1868
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:03,239
okay I'm really glad you brought that up

1869
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:06,679
um so the DI Cole has now been around I

1870
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:08,799
think since 2019 so it's five years

1871
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:11,840
right uh we're

1872
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,199
actually uh investigating you know some

1873
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,480
uh updates for it because uh I think

1874
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:19,039
it's it's about due it was one of those

1875
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:21,119
things that uh I thought we would have

1876
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,960
maybe updated it sooner but the reality

1877
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:25,238
is it just generally

1878
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:29,920
works except for those that it doesn't

1879
01:21:25,238 --> 01:21:29,919
work and I'd like to address

1880
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:37,079
that because well understood because

1881
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:42,440
kind of like dinov VAP okay it's not

1882
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:45,840
intuitive out the gate because not like

1883
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:47,238
lighting a one hitter in the regard that

1884
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,199
people intuitively know how to use a one

1885
01:21:47,238 --> 01:21:52,559
hitter quickly okay because the steps

1886
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:55,719
are very simple and there's not many

1887
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,880
okay when it comes to using a Dino oil

1888
01:21:55,719 --> 01:22:01,359
how do you consume it well maybe a

1889
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:03,239
banger right take a dab maybe try and

1890
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:06,519
wipe a little bit on a rolling paper

1891
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:07,439
right they're they're not the easiest to

1892
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,840
really

1893
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,960
use well but the way people use them

1894
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,760
they see the dle well that use it like

1895
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,480
you take a dab you take you stick your

1896
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,199
dab tool in here you grab a glob of it

1897
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:20,799
you wipe it on there you put the cap on

1898
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:24,319
you heat it up right

1899
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,119
well that's how I thought it was going

1900
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:26,719
to be

1901
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:30,198
be

1902
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:33,560
and then I come to find after doing a

1903
01:22:30,198 --> 01:22:37,879
little bit more experimentation that

1904
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:40,719
actually uh when the be came out in

1905
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,800
2022 it it went up on the website and I

1906
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,359
was reading through the product

1907
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,600
description I was like wait a minute why

1908
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,399
does it say in the product description

1909
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:51,520
it's not compatible to dino

1910
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:53,238
coil and it's like well I was told well

1911
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,360
the chamber is not as deep as a regular

1912
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:58,919
tip so it doesn't fit

1913
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:01,079
like okay that that's intuitive put the

1914
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:04,279
cap on and the cap still

1915
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:08,238
fit but now it's sticking out it's like

1916
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:12,000
well hm and it got me thinking I like

1917
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:14,879
you know there's something here and I

1918
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,119
can remember then taking that b with the

1919
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,000
dino coil in it sticking out the anend

1920
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:21,800
it's like you

1921
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,760
know one of the worst things about using

1922
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:27,320
concentrates is everything gets sticky

1923
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,719
it's just annoying right and you got to

1924
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:31,599
have a dab tool and it's hard to use

1925
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:33,760
good quality concentrates on the go

1926
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,679
because you got to have a place to set

1927
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,960
things down and and go through your

1928
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:41,079
ritual to to do it

1929
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:45,000
right and I was like wait a minute if I

1930
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:46,679
take a b okay or now my current favorite

1931
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,079
is an

1932
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:51,279
M7 okay because I'll push the screen

1933
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:52,920
into the half position for an M7 and put

1934
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:55,319
a d coil in it again so it's sticking

1935
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,000
out like it would be in the tip of a b

1936
01:23:55,319 --> 01:24:00,840
the dynat

1937
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,639
B then you take your lighter or your

1938
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,000
induction heater and you heat up your

1939
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:08,800
tip for enough time to get it hot enough

1940
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,158
that it'll melt the concentrate okay so

1941
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,440
usually uh if you're using a torch it's

1942
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:16,319
going to be 5 to 10 seconds get it hot

1943
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:19,559
not not super hot but hot and this

1944
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:23,759
allows you to now take your

1945
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:25,360
device and dip that D coil into your

1946
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,639
concentrate

1947
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:32,920
vertically okay so now your device

1948
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:36,039
becomes the dab tool okay the Dil is now

1949
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:38,920
hot and so what it does is it melts the

1950
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:42,679
concentrate and this allows that

1951
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,840
concentrate to then Wick into the dino

1952
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:46,719
coil using capillary

1953
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:50,400
action

1954
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:52,679
and a magical thing happens okay just

1955
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:55,118
like you can't soak up five gallons of

1956
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:57,960
water with one paper towel it hits a

1957
01:24:55,118 --> 01:25:00,039
point of saturation where no matter how

1958
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,560
much water is around it it won't soak up

1959
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:05,639
anymore okay well the dino coil will

1960
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,639
only soak up as much concentrate as it

1961
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:10,600
can

1962
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:12,560
hold period when it's hot okay versus

1963
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,000
when you use a dab tool and you smear a

1964
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,320
glob on there you can put as much on

1965
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,158
there as it'll fit okay and then when

1966
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,679
you heat it up whatever it can't hold

1967
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:21,679
melts and runs through and makes a

1968
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:24,960
sticky mess

1969
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:27,239
so here it is Sever several years after

1970
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:31,198
introducing the dino coil I come to the

1971
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:32,839
realization that H I've been telling

1972
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:35,039
people to use this thing in a way that

1973
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:38,199
just doesn't work as good as if

1974
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:41,158
you stick it in your tip with the screen

1975
01:25:38,198 --> 01:25:43,399
up or use a b tip that's smaller so the

1976
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:44,279
coil is actually sticking out preheat

1977
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:46,559
your

1978
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:48,840
tip so that your coil is hot enough to

1979
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,600
melt your concentrates dip it in your

1980
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:54,760
concentrate it will load the same amount

1981
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,560
of concentrate every single time

1982
01:25:54,760 --> 01:26:00,000
I mean it becomes this super accurate

1983
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,119
dosing mechanism and it doesn't overload

1984
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,560
and then on top of that when you put

1985
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:05,238
your cap back on and then you then heat

1986
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,440
up to the click well you've already

1987
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:08,919
preheated your tip so you're not going

1988
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:11,638
from a cold

1989
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:13,600
start and it makes for a really really

1990
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:16,400
nice

1991
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,360
experience I love that and I can just

1992
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:20,359
imagine doing it you know it almost

1993
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:22,839
makes me imagine that you're turning

1994
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:24,519
your unit into like a paintbrush you

1995
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,560
know like you're loading it up the way

1996
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:30,320
that little bit of residual pain sits in

1997
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:32,880
there yes that's a good way to describe

1998
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:35,359
it there you go well look I'm going to

1999
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,039
have to give that a go I I wanted to ask

2000
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:39,359
you you know since we last spoke there's

2001
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:42,079
actually been a few new models released

2002
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,439
and I took a look at the the website

2003
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:45,760
last night just to make sure I was up to

2004
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,799
date and I know that like the xv4 is

2005
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,719
certainly a newer one along with the

2006
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:53,480
M5 um you mentioned also the hyperd a

2007
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:54,960
bit earlier maybe you know can you give

2008
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:56,799
us a bit of a run down on some of these

2009
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,158
new guys and why you might lean towards

2010
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:03,719
one of them the the

2011
01:26:59,158 --> 01:27:07,439
x is it's kind of a fun one because it's

2012
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:10,800
actually an M that we made back in

2013
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:13,839
2021 okay it's not something that we

2014
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,400
made recently we just have some stock

2015
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,319
left over from some of those early

2016
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:22,279
production runs

2017
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:24,960
and we've been really kind of growing in

2018
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:29,198
terms of our uh our AB ility to change

2019
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:31,480
the way our products look uh because

2020
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:34,638
we've developed some equipment and some

2021
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:37,479
process that allows us to create new

2022
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:40,840
colors new Surface finishes new textures

2023
01:27:37,479 --> 01:27:43,039
on the products and so we've been

2024
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,400
experimenting with some of those things

2025
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:47,560
and we found that some of the some of

2026
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:50,719
the product that didn't get sold back in

2027
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:53,080
2021 2022

2028
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:54,439
2023 the only reason it wasn't sold was

2029
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:56,760
not because it wasn't functional was

2030
01:27:54,439 --> 01:28:00,079
because it had Sometimes some cosmetic

2031
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,840
issues okay we like to sell good quality

2032
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,399
product we want that customer to have a

2033
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,360
good experience with it we want them to

2034
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:07,118
be happy that they purchased it and we

2035
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:10,198
want it to look the part that they think

2036
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:13,158
it should well with some of this new

2037
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:15,279
equipment that we've built we can take

2038
01:28:13,158 --> 01:28:17,679
some of these older products and we can

2039
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:19,920
give them new life we can give them

2040
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,279
colors that just simply weren't

2041
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,800
available when those products were

2042
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:25,079
originally sold which is really kind of

2043
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,320
fun and we you can even make them feel

2044
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:30,639
different which is also super fun so

2045
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:34,399
that's kind of what the uh the X Series

2046
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:37,239
is now hyperd takes that to a whole new

2047
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:40,158
level because the hyperd is our is our

2048
01:28:37,238 --> 01:28:42,839
first large capacity product where we

2049
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:47,319
took the volume of the extraction

2050
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:48,960
chamber and more than doubled it because

2051
01:28:47,319 --> 01:28:50,519
if there was one bit of feedback that we

2052
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,239
would consistently get from people in

2053
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:57,280
our community is when are you going to

2054
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:59,519
make a bigger product and for years I

2055
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:02,439
resisted but it got to a point a few

2056
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:05,000
years back where it's like okay why am I

2057
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:06,158
resisting this if people really want it

2058
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,079
no it's not just because they don't know

2059
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:10,359
how to use the product they are just

2060
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:13,158
looking for more and for people that

2061
01:29:10,359 --> 01:29:15,439
actually smoke a fair bit the tiny

2062
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:16,719
little chamber on a dynavap just isn't

2063
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,479
going to get them what they're looking

2064
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,960
for

2065
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:23,000
or to qualify it isn't going to get them

2066
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,760
what they're looking for until they've

2067
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,880
developed a little bit

2068
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:29,639
different level of skill and familiarity

2069
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,880
with the product because it just that's

2070
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:33,960
how that product works right when you

2071
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,279
really know the product it's amazing

2072
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,279
what you can get out of that tiny little

2073
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:40,679
chamber right when when you know how to

2074
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:45,519
operate and you understand the Nuance

2075
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:47,279
okay so we made a bigger product and it

2076
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,119
took a little while to develop because

2077
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:51,719
we didn't want to cut Corners with it

2078
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:54,399
and one of those hard things to figure

2079
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:57,480
out for us was

2080
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:59,479
the cap right you know the cap on all of

2081
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:01,599
our devices prior to this was you know

2082
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:04,079
made out of stainless steel very thin

2083
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,679
metal kind of springy so it was easy to

2084
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:11,238
get that cap to literally push on but

2085
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:13,158
yet stay on and be adjustable and also

2086
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:14,479
fit across a broad range of different

2087
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:17,439
tips that are slightly different shapes

2088
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:19,399
and sizes now how we going to do that if

2089
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:21,439
we need to make a bigger

2090
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:23,000
cap if we want to make that cap out of

2091
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:25,960
titanium how are we going to do that how

2092
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,960
we gonna make it go

2093
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:32,880
and it it took a few tries it took some

2094
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:36,279
real head scratching to finally figure

2095
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:39,079
out that you know what even though the

2096
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:41,960
cap on hyperd is literally machined out

2097
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:41,960
of one piece of

2098
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:49,719
titanium we can make it click onto the

2099
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:51,679
hyper tip just like a standard captive

2100
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:52,760
cap will click on almost any of our

2101
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,880
other

2102
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:58,679
devices and and we did that by

2103
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,440
engineering what they call a compliant

2104
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:04,679
mechanism into that titanium cap and

2105
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:09,279
even though it doesn't move or bend or

2106
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:11,279
Flex much it's just enough that it'll

2107
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:13,319
just click right on and it stays on the

2108
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:16,319
tip without the need for any threads or

2109
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:20,000
any other kind of retention so just kind

2110
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:22,599
of fun stuff and of course the hyperd is

2111
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,479
is also our our first kind of full scale

2112
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:27,400
product that

2113
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:31,879
features what we call our durine

2114
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:33,039
finishing right really really hard very

2115
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,639
scratch

2116
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:38,118
resistant interesting color options that

2117
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:41,118
we can create with this finish process

2118
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:44,039
that takes a material like titanium

2119
01:31:41,118 --> 01:31:46,960
which uh in contrast to what most people

2120
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:49,560
think although titanium is a relatively

2121
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:52,880
strong material compared to say

2122
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,560
aluminum it's actually a relatively soft

2123
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,760
material especially compared to Steel

2124
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,600
okay so if you buy a material or a a a

2125
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:03,560
product that's made from Titanium or has

2126
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,560
titanium parts that are visible or

2127
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:09,360
touchable what you're going to find is

2128
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:11,360
that they scratch really easily if you

2129
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,599
polish it yeah you can polish it nice

2130
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:15,118
but it's going to

2131
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,800
scratch

2132
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:23,559
well we can put our durine finish on

2133
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:25,480
there and now you've got a all titanium

2134
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:28,719
product that I'm not going to say it's

2135
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:30,919
scratch proof but it's

2136
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:32,520
close that's that's brilliant The Best

2137
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:35,199
of Both Worlds you know it's got that

2138
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,440
cool look and the improved durability so

2139
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:40,039
that's that's really exciting to hear

2140
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:41,599
yeah it's it's fun we get some colors

2141
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:45,319
too

2142
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:48,840
right uh you the the first color we

2143
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:52,880
released with hyperd is kind of a really

2144
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:54,319
nice kind of dark grayish black color

2145
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,880
really resonates with people got a nice

2146
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:59,559
glossy Sheen to

2147
01:32:55,880 --> 01:33:01,960
it but there's more colors coming for

2148
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:05,920
sure I think that you're right like

2149
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:08,319
there's so many cool colors that affect

2150
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,000
the Cosmetics of it that can play into

2151
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:12,479
why people are interested and I'm so

2152
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,439
glad you guys are exploring it I love

2153
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:18,559
the color the original the original one

2154
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:22,799
I got was the um the the rosium I love

2155
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:25,199
that sort of beautiful magent blue

2156
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,320
purples oh run up my alley one one of my

2157
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:30,079
favorite

2158
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:32,759
colors uh and now the rosium is not a

2159
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:34,840
color that we currently do in house

2160
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:38,119
because it

2161
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:40,800
is colored through a coating process

2162
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:43,559
called PVD which is a really fascinating

2163
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,000
process super durable when it's done

2164
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,080
properly uh reasonably temperature

2165
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,238
resistant in fact you know we put it

2166
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:51,639
even on the caps and especially when

2167
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:54,238
people use induction heaters for the

2168
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:57,199
Caps it holds up really really really

2169
01:33:54,238 --> 01:34:00,519
well I mean I've seen examples of some

2170
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:03,678
of the first rosium devices that we

2171
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:05,239
released uh which geez is that all the

2172
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,199
way back

2173
01:34:05,238 --> 01:34:09,039
to

2174
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:12,039
2019 or

2175
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:12,039
20

2176
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:17,519
um they still in good shape it holds up

2177
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:21,440
good

2178
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,560
um the we brought back rosium this year

2179
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,399
on the

2180
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:30,360
M7 and

2181
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:33,799
and the rosium M7 is by far and away my

2182
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:34,759
absolute favorite of all the rosium M's

2183
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:37,560
we've ever

2184
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:43,719
made you know because now what do we

2185
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:48,159
have we have the M7 as a stainless steel

2186
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:50,800
device has one of our kind of signature

2187
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:53,799
textures on the stem okay and it's a

2188
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:56,440
really interesting texture that plays in

2189
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:59,719
the light in a really neat way just as a

2190
01:34:56,439 --> 01:35:02,198
raw stainless steel product when we put

2191
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:04,279
that rosium PVD coating on

2192
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:05,638
there now it takes it up a whole another

2193
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:10,719
level because now you don't really have

2194
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:12,800
color but you have a color shift

2195
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:15,118
depending on your viewing angle and it's

2196
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,079
just so fun to look at and to watch

2197
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:18,639
where just by tipping It One Direction

2198
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:22,359
versus the other the color of the

2199
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:26,159
product will shift from gold to to

2200
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:29,198
magenta to bluish purple or

2201
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,079
green and it's the same product and the

2202
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:32,919
same

2203
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:35,559
color no I love it it's uh it's super

2204
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:37,359
super cool the the other product I

2205
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,679
wanted to quickly ask you about before

2206
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:41,559
we uh look to wrap things up was the The

2207
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:44,158
Bong adapter you know this one seems

2208
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:46,199
like a no-brainer to me especially cuz

2209
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,960
like I I have so many people who message

2210
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:51,799
me because I'm so vocal you know like I

2211
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:53,198
got off combustion I got off bongs and I

2212
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,039
I feel like it's a bit of a no-brainer

2213
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:56,439
but I want is is that what you would

2214
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:59,519
recommend for people looking to make the

2215
01:35:56,439 --> 01:36:02,000
transition or what would you recommend

2216
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:05,159
oh it's it's such a good product for

2217
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,319
that because it doesn't cost very much

2218
01:36:05,158 --> 01:36:09,920
you know it's it's it's one of our least

2219
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:12,399
expensive pieces or devices especially

2220
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:15,800
if you buy it as a as a functional unit

2221
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:17,719
it's also very short and compact so it

2222
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:20,639
it mates really well with your with your

2223
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:22,279
water tools without being long and and

2224
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,679
sticking out and just being a little bit

2225
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:27,679
unruly okay

2226
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:30,800
but it can also be used as if it was

2227
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:34,079
kind of a a little short fat blunt too

2228
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:36,840
so it's it's kind of a really versatile

2229
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:38,399
product and I think it's also worth

2230
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,279
mentioning here

2231
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,039
that uh to to kind of tip back to say

2232
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:44,399
the

2233
01:36:42,039 --> 01:36:47,960
hyperd okay that we're just talking

2234
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:51,079
about when we were collecting input from

2235
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:53,800
the community right and some you know

2236
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:59,238
customers and people within the company

2237
01:36:53,800 --> 01:37:01,239
terms of okay we want to make a uh uh a

2238
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:05,079
larger capacity product

2239
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:06,718
right well not only how big should it be

2240
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:08,158
but what are the key other elements that

2241
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,439
that product should have and one of

2242
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:12,039
those key elements that just came up

2243
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:14,039
again and again in these conversations

2244
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:17,800
and these surveys

2245
01:37:14,039 --> 01:37:21,679
is make it backwards compatible with

2246
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,279
your other products it's like okay not

2247
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,480
quite sure how we're going to do that

2248
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,118
but

2249
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:29,399
that's a really important

2250
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:31,279
thing and it's understandable it's

2251
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:33,759
important especially for people that

2252
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:35,479
have more than one dap device which you

2253
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,360
don't need more than one because it

2254
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:40,000
should last a really really long time

2255
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:42,079
but we're finding that even though we

2256
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,920
make products that generally don't

2257
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:48,599
break people tend to buy more than

2258
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:50,399
one because collecting is kind of fun

2259
01:37:48,599 --> 01:37:52,159
and you get to have different

2260
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:53,920
experiences with them they look

2261
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:55,279
different they feel different they form

2262
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,079
different your stainless tips your

2263
01:37:55,279 --> 01:38:01,319
titanium tips your XL length long

2264
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:02,920
devices or your little short length ones

2265
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:04,719
uh I don't know if you've even seen uh

2266
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:07,480
we we had when we released back this

2267
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:12,359
fall called the mini wind that the whole

2268
01:38:07,479 --> 01:38:14,238
device is the same length uh or if you

2269
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:17,000
take the tip off and set it next to the

2270
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:19,479
device they're the same length Okay it's

2271
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,599
tiny tiny little thing right it

2272
01:38:19,479 --> 01:38:25,718
disappears in your hand um but that's

2273
01:38:23,599 --> 01:38:26,679
part of that versatility of what we like

2274
01:38:25,719 --> 01:38:31,118
to call the

2275
01:38:26,679 --> 01:38:33,199
dinoverse right so just just fun stuff

2276
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:36,880
and so to Circle back to the bonger

2277
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:39,039
right you can buy just a hyper tip which

2278
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:41,639
is what we call the larger diameter

2279
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:43,920
larger chamber tip for the

2280
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:47,480
hyperd and

2281
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:50,319
because the components of the hyperd are

2282
01:38:47,479 --> 01:38:53,238
backwards compatible with almost every

2283
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:56,279
device that we've made since we began as

2284
01:38:53,238 --> 01:38:58,678
a company you can mix and match those

2285
01:38:56,279 --> 01:39:01,679
parts just like you can so many of the

2286
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:04,158
other parts and you can put a hyper tip

2287
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:07,880
on a bonger and you can get a really

2288
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:10,319
powerful experience which really helps

2289
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:13,279
get through that somewhat challenging

2290
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:15,238
transition as we're moving from

2291
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:18,079
combustion to Thermal

2292
01:39:15,238 --> 01:39:19,678
extraction totally I I love it and I I

2293
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:20,880
agree with the sentiment there which is

2294
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,520
that like it's really just that

2295
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,679
transitionary period that can be a

2296
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,880
little bit sticky to some people and

2297
01:39:24,679 --> 01:39:29,359
once you get through that you'll be like

2298
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,400
man this is this hits just just like

2299
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:34,238
what I wanted from the combustion and

2300
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:36,079
I'm never going back so I I love that a

2301
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:38,598
lot the final question I wanted to ask

2302
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:40,599
you for this one is you got anything fun

2303
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:42,599
in the pipeline you might be willing to

2304
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:44,800
share with this even if it's just a

2305
01:39:42,599 --> 01:39:48,960
dream oh my

2306
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:50,320
gosh no no no I absolutely do in fact I

2307
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,480
even have some of sitting right here

2308
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:56,759
next to me la la

2309
01:39:53,479 --> 01:40:00,359
got actually got two things right so the

2310
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,679
first one we actually just released uh

2311
01:40:00,359 --> 01:40:05,399
very recently I don't know if you've

2312
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:08,520
seen it yet or not um have you seen this

2313
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:13,960
thing uh I think I saw it on the

2314
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:18,159
side okay so we now have

2315
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:22,279
available a gravity powered water

2316
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:24,719
tool that comes in its own little kit

2317
01:40:22,279 --> 01:40:29,000
right

2318
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:32,359
okay and what's really fun about this is

2319
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:36,960
it works with just about any available

2320
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:40,198
bottle that you happen to have okay so

2321
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:44,118
put on a couple little extensions here

2322
01:40:40,198 --> 01:40:46,879
and I can take a beer

2323
01:40:44,118 --> 01:40:49,039
bottle plug it in I can take another

2324
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:54,560
beer bottle put it on

2325
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:57,439
top okay I can take this uh hypert

2326
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:01,000
off of uh one of my

2327
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:03,879
devices and I can plug that right in

2328
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,439
right and if I want I can

2329
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:11,118
grab my little whip right out of my kit

2330
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:13,598
I can plug that in the other side I can

2331
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:15,519
heat up my tip built clicks and then I

2332
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:19,960
can just flip this thing

2333
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:23,320
over and it'll fill right up and it'll

2334
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:25,399
do all the work for you and when when I

2335
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:26,639
flip it back it'll just simply blow it

2336
01:41:25,399 --> 01:41:28,000
right in your face or it's really nice

2337
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,118
to share at parties because no one has

2338
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,359
to put anything in their mouth yeah wow

2339
01:41:30,118 --> 01:41:33,799
so it just creates a gravity bong out I

2340
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:35,799
know or in Australia we call it the

2341
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:38,000
bucket bong but it just you just whip it

2342
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:40,440
out with two bottles you whip it out

2343
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:45,039
comes in this cute little case

2344
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:47,519
right and I think it's just super fun oh

2345
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:51,519
yeah anyone who remembers the hits from

2346
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:57,159
those bad boys it is super fun indeed so

2347
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:58,920
there's that uh um also coming next

2348
01:41:57,158 --> 01:42:01,559
year

2349
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:04,920
is the

2350
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:08,000
dinen okay I mean we've all heard people

2351
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,399
talk about the vape pen right but most

2352
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,800
people don't sign their checks with

2353
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:11,799
their vape

2354
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:24,039
pen but with this one you can right I

2355
01:42:19,118 --> 01:42:26,960
mean it's an adapter that will fit into

2356
01:42:24,039 --> 01:42:29,000
just about any dap stem that you have

2357
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,719
and it converts

2358
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,520
it into a

2359
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:38,920
pen because we can

2360
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,239
and it's just one more way that we're

2361
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:43,440
expanding the

2362
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:46,039
derse I love that so

2363
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:49,198
much and I think it's super fun for

2364
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:52,279
people that have a collection of dinat

2365
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:54,678
products well now you can pull the

2366
01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:56,359
mouthpiece off of end or the tip off of

2367
01:42:54,679 --> 01:42:58,079
the other end because you only need

2368
01:42:56,359 --> 01:43:00,598
really need one you can put this pen

2369
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:03,599
incer on there and you can take it with

2370
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:07,560
you to work and you can be literally

2371
01:43:03,599 --> 01:43:10,639
working with your dinov app using it as

2372
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:13,560
a pen or mechanical pencil or what have

2373
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:14,920
you and someone might walk by like well

2374
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,360
that's a really cool looking pen it's

2375
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:21,319
like yeah and you only know the half of

2376
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:24,439
it but the reality is it it's

2377
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:28,079
legitimately a pen because it can be so

2378
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:29,919
why not that is absolutely incredible

2379
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:31,760
I'm glad you saved that for the end

2380
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,319
hopefully you post it up and people can

2381
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,440
jump on board if they

2382
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:37,359
can yeah that's that's what that's what

2383
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,678
the game plan is so we're we're putting

2384
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,359
some of the preliminary things in place

2385
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:45,279
now

2386
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:48,920
and well I don't know about you but uh I

2387
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:51,519
like to be kind of an optimistic person

2388
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:53,239
anyway I'm really excited for what's to

2389
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,280
come I think there's some really good

2390
01:43:53,238 --> 01:43:56,959
positive

2391
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:58,960
things starting to come

2392
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,439
together I I think it's going to be a

2393
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:06,118
good year yeah I'm with you let's make

2394
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:08,399
it happen let's do that so I think with

2395
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:10,639
that it just about brings us to the end

2396
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:13,519
of it were there any comments or

2397
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:15,359
shoutouts you wanted to make uh well

2398
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,880

2404
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:34,400
makes me smile you know uh I got a few

2405
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:37,960
kitty cats at home and my wife uh does

2406

oh they're they're fun but uh no uh you

2414
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:01,840
know in terms of shout outs the probably

2415
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,519
the most important thing for me to do is

2416
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:07,319
to just show a little bit of gratitude

2417
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:08,960
for you know first off the people that I

2418
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:12,719
work with uh

2419
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:14,639
for for really sticking around putting

2420
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:17,158
up with me because I know I can be a a

2421
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,440
challenging person at at times even

2422
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:20,000
though believe it or not I'm actually

2423
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:22,479
not trying to be challenging I'm

2424
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,920
actually just trying to to to do the

2425
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:27,479
best that I can to help everyone get

2426
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,118
what they're looking for out of life uh

2427
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:31,678
you know I've got some really good

2428
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:35,118
business partners and you know of course

2429
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:37,440
my family who I really wasn't sure at

2430
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:39,759
first you know when I started down this

2431
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:41,799
path you know whether or not they would

2432
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,840
uh you know think less of me for doing

2433
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,400
it because you know the the world is

2434
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:49,840
kind of divided on on some of these

2435
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,679
