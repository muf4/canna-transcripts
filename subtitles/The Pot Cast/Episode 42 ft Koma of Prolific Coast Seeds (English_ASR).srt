cheers brother how's it going good my

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,540
friend good first question we'd love to

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,439
ask people what are you smoking on at

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,460
the moment

43
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,898
uh currently I'm smoking on some

44
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,118
solventless

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,019
strawberry mamba

46
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,060
from Ridgeline Reserve grown by happy or

47
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,060
grown by Ridgeline and then processed by

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,020
happy cabbage got uh my little

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,640
five grams I'm allowed to buy in Oregon

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,620
they they'll let me buy a shopping cart

51
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,559
of liquor but I'm only allowed to buy

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,459
five grams a day of rosin so there's

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,439
that but uh yeah just a few grams a

54
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,140
couple grams a day going down the hatch

55
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,500
as per usual

56
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,059
love it and so in general what are some

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,340
of the dispensaries you rate in Oregon

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,560
because I remember when I was there very

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,680
briefly it was a little hit and miss

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,039
yeah I mean um the dispenser that I work

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,099
with uh has are strains that are grown

62
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,679
under my guidance regularly fresh drops

63
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,579
in Bend and in Hillsboro The Fifth

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Element

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,680
you can check out archives seed bank for

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,419
really good clone drops and and he

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,500
oftentimes has really good hash there

68
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,018
too

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,439
yeah

70
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,539
[ __ ] man Oasis out on the coast has some

71
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,719
good some good herb and really cool

72
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,098
scenery I mean like you said it ends up

73
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,019
being hit or miss because the

74
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:16,619
dispensaries oftentimes are just

75
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,080
fluctuating on what they're in taking so

76
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,560
it ends up being kind of just like um

77
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,700
you just chase the the products more or

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,979
less than

79
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,899
than the actual dispensary because some

80
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,378
of these guys like a great example here

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,500
is is the uh Happy cabbage team they

82
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:36,000
make drops let's say they make

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,259
um this really good flavor but they

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,180
don't make it all the time well when

85
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,979
they do make it some dispensaries might

86
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,799
get it some might not so you're kind of

87
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,539
chasing the drop versus chasing the

88
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,760
actual you know this is a good

89
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,560
dispensary or something it sucks when

90
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,840
you're on the outside looking in but

91
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,280
it's much easier to follow the drops and

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,158
follow the certain flavors you like

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
whenever you're plugged into it so the

94
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,098
next time you come out here dude just

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,599
let me know and I'll make sure for sure

96
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,060
you're plugged with some [ __ ] fire

97
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,679
we'll enjoy a dinner or something get a

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,438
drink or something both

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,120
oh you're too kind my friend I think

100
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,620
what's really interesting is kind of

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,900
what you just touched on there where

102
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,759
there's often a common sentiment

103
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,040
especially by like kind of the more Cali

104
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,899
Growers who kind of say like oh you know

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,660
the quality of growers in Oregon isn't

106
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,279
that good but as you alluded to it's hit

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,020
and miss and that's it's pretty much the

108
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,179
case everywhere even in Cali it's pretty

109
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,519
hit and miss so I guess the question is

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,680
do you feel like there's much of a

111
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,839
difference in the level of growers in

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,600
general in Oregon versus Cali or it's

113
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,299
kind of just like a rivalry thing

114
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm not sure who started that whole

115
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,360
thing but obviously a bunch of really

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,879
good Growers

117
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,860
migrated North and maybe some of them

118
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,259
migrated South you know like this whole

119
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,960
West Coast is

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,240
it's a mecca for cannabis it has been

121
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,638
for decades we've

122
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,418
been kind of on the Forefront of a lot

123
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,400
of stuff but some of the best stuff that

124
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,978
we have and we've gotten comes from the

125
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,679
East Coast oh geez and sours and this

126
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,560
isn't stuff from West this isn't from

127
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,079
Oregon or Cali so

128
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,899
in my in my honest opinion I just think

129
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,359
it's one of those dumb rivalry things

130
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:23,279
that people do you know it's like a any

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,860
sports rivalry or anything else it's

132
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,779
just a you're over there and we're over

133
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,840
here so let's kind of gripe but I've

134
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:33,779
literally seen absolute chronic in both

135
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,758
places and I've seen complete dog [ __ ]

136
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:39,000
weed in both places and the same goes

137
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,038
for people and for Growers and for

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,538
prices of food and for everything you

139
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,159
know it's like hit and miss everywhere

140
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:46,079
you go you can find something good and

141
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,180
you can find something bad it's not

142
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,459
really like you can't draw a line on a

143
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,620
map and be like this is where all the

144
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,198
good Growers are and everybody outside

145
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,538
of this isn't as good it's like it's

146
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,340
kind of silly there is definitely a lot

147
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:01,279
of really really good growers in

148
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,500
California they have a giant population

149
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,599
they were ahead of the curve or for a

150
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,759
lot of places so

151
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
like I said the West Coast has been a

152
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,780
Mecca but Oregon

153
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,180
like we have some really really good

154
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,239
Growers here some great breeders some

155
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,840
amazing projects and we definitely hold

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,620
our own as far as anything rosin hash

157
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,719
uh anything or all extracts you know

158
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,360
Edibles like we have really good good

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,300
people here so I love the state and it

160
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,419
really has been uh nothing more than a

161
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,100
light in my life so I have nothing

162
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,659
negative to say about Oregon there's

163
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,879
obviously [ __ ] Growers here but they're

164
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,039
[ __ ] Growers everywhere so it doesn't

165
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,500
really mean anything

166
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,939
yeah that's a sentiment I can definitely

167
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,120
agree on

168
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:53,779
so take us back what was your first

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,379
experience with cannabis

170
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:58,799
oh

171
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:02,038
um so seventh grade I used to walk home

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,978
from Junior High the same way every day

173
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,500
and there was a kid that used to walk in

174
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,120
front of me or behind me every day for a

175
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,918
couple months and we would always walk

176
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,079
maybe a block apart

177
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,698
and uh one day after school we just

178
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,439
walked together

179
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,319
and he asked me when we were getting to

180
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,319
my house he said you ever smoked pot

181
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,639
and I didn't want to sound stupid so I

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,340
was like yeah

183
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,680
and I'd never been stoned before I tried

184
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,698
to smoke pot one time but I don't know I

185
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,139
don't know if it was like we were

186
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,419
smoking [ __ ] I don't know what

187
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,639
happened it just I didn't get stoned so

188
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,899
I told him yeah and he's like drop your

189
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,639
backpack off

190
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,219
and come to my house we'll smoke some

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
pot and I was like all right

192
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,740
so I dropped my backpack off we walked

193
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,560
to his house another [ __ ] half mile

194
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,139
we get to his house his mom's gone uh at

195
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,939
work for another three four hours and uh

196
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,800
we walk in his back room and he pulls

197
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,759
out from under a love seat in his

198
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,400
bedroom

negative Cloud hanging on me

230

232
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,859
thing it just felt right it felt so good

233
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:31,559
and uh funny I was chewing sunflower

234
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,000
seeds the whole way to his house and

235
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,099

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,419
it out

240
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,399
and I've never smoked weed so this is

241
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,338
the first time I've ever smoked weed and

242
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,220
I take this giant hit of pot and cough

243
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:53,640
out the smoke and if you've ever coughed

244
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,160
smoke out you'll know it is [ __ ] so

245
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,259
harsh on your lungs and on your body and

246
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,139
I just started dying and then I threw up

247
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,838
on his floor all those sunflower seeds

248
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,338
that I ate all the way to his house and

249
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,860
uh he just looked at me he watched me

250
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,079
throw up and I think he got a kick out

251
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,579
of making someone so high they threw up

252
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,979
and he's like you have to clean all that

253
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:16,439
up and I was like yeah no no worries

254
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,379
like I'll clean it up I was so [ __ ] up

255
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,300

256
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,399
good friends

257
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,379

258
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,419

two and a half almost three years in

274
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,519
prison

275
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:09,120
as a parole violation because he had an

276
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,440
ounce of pot and five grams of BHO and I

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,259
really want everybody to wrap their

278
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,860
heads around that right now [ __ ] five

279
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:19,379
grams and one ounce of pot and they they

280
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,959
put my friend in prison for years of his

281
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,259
life while his sons are in very

282
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:27,479
important times at 10 and 12. got little

283
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,578
boys that are [ __ ]

284
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,680
turning into young men and you're going

285
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,359
to take their father away because he had

286
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,059
a little bit of a thing that makes him

287
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,639
feel good do you know how crazy this is

288
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:41,219
man we're living in some type of weird

289
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,778
I don't know what this is but this is

290
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,759
just some or really a nightmare where

291
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,439
you'll just destroy a family and tear

292
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,778
them all down and apart because a man

293
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
wants to make himself feel good you got

294
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,439
to be out of your [ __ ] mind that's

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,078
the [ __ ] that we deal with I know

296
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,420
Australia doesn't have it any better but

297
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,399
it's just like it's just crazy to think

298
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,259
that this is the land of the free and

299
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,078
[ __ ] like that will still happen to you

300
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,899
here that is so free huh

301
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,778
yeah it's a real issue you've kind of

302
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,578
highlighted so just to extend on that a

303
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,860
little bit what do you think is going to

304
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:16,319
be the future of the federal laws of

305
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,419
cannabis in the states although full

306
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,760
it'll be fully decriminalized soon

307
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,559
they'll don't take their bad Hammer off

308
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,778
of it and release the banking they're

309
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,759
already doing it right now in the next

310
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,919
few years there will be interstate

311
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,019
commerce they've already opened up

312
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,419
interstate commerce once for certain

313
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,519
deals because [ __ ] I can't remember

314
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,099
if it was Nevada or Arizona one of those

315
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,839
States ran out of pot so they allowed

316
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,480
one of the other states to move some pot

317
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,040
over there and and eventually it'll be

318
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,379
full interstate commerce you'll just

319
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,599
have to pay your licensing fees and then

320
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,159
your track your transaction fees when

321
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,560
something goes from one state to another

322
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,120
you'll have to pay a fee on it and

323
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,119
they'll get their money they built an

324
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,720
entire system around this plant being

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,720
illegal so it was basically tax dollars

326
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,700
like we put everyone in jail and then we

327
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,500
make them go through rehabs and [ __ ] and

328
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,720
it's all tax dollars that's how we

329
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,039
generate money from marijuana they

330
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,759
realized quickly that they could

331
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,860
generate [ __ ] 10 15 20 times more

332
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,620
Revenue by just letting us have the plan

333
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,899
and just doing it like anything else

334
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,000
free market you know letting it free

335
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,879
market run its course

336
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
we're never not going to smoke pot like

337
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,919
humans love pot we've loved pot forever

338
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,078
and we're just gonna enjoy it whether

339
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,879
they made it legal or not so I think

340
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,019
they finally gave up on that and now

341
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,700
they they're just going to make their

342
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,440
money this way so it's just a matter of

343
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,778
time it's not that long maybe a few

344
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,699
years Max and it'll be

345
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:46,379
federally decriminalized and I think a

346
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,879
lot of that has to do with them wanting

347
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,980
to get their own

348
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,600
hands in on it you know I mean they want

349
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,459
to be able to paint their own weed money

350
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,620
a lot of these [ __ ] investors and a

351
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,838
lot of these people are cops and

352
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,179
ex-governors and people that were

353
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,860
totally opposed to cannabis until they

354
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,259
saw a way to make a ton of money off of

355
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,940
it and so they definitely still have

356
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,620
their little cop buddies and their

357
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,839
contacts and they're they're still

358
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,000
[ __ ] buddy buddy with their Senator

359
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,560
buddies you know so like that's how

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,458
circles work that's how they've always

361
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:19,559
worked I'm not oblivious to that so I

362
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,719
mean I figure a few years Max it's just

363
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,219
a money thing you can't put that much

364
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,500
money on the table and not expect

365
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,079
everybody to want to get some of it so

366
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,100
we're talking about billions not

367
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:34,439
millions billions of dollars so

368
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:38,159
definitely it won't be too long

369
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,019
yeah well I mean kind of funny but also

370
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,899
reality like you talk about like

371
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,659
investors being ex-cops and stuff like

372
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,879
what about Stan the Man like what's the

373
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,860
situate that don't get me started on him

374
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,559
I honestly I mean I'll tell you honest

375
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,720
to God I cannot fathom how that guy is

376
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,119
welcomed in the Cannabis community at

377
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,600
all as soon as he posted a picture of

378
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,980
himself in a police uniform and said I

379
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,220
was a cop

380
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,019
then you're not welcome here and I don't

381
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,199
want to be rude to police officers

382
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:11,820
because I know that not all cops are the

383
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,179
enemy or something it's not like that

384
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,040
it's just that we're on one side and

385
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,078
there on the other that's it it's always

386
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,360
been that way I got raised in the

387
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,399
streets we don't [ __ ] with cops that's

388
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,620
it and I don't know how the [ __ ] you

389
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,379
guys think that that dude talks to

390
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,259
anybody else I mean let's just be real

391
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:33,360
you're a cop for 10 years 15 years who

392
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,399
do you think your buddies are when you

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,919
shut off your cell phone and you're not

394
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,019
staying the man on Instagram who is your

395
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,240
friends who comes to your parties whose

396
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,698
house do you go to for birthdays who do

397
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,799
you do [ __ ] you do it with other cops

398
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:49,620
and cops families you're a cop you were

399
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,000
always a cop cops are cops so now all of

400
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,220
a sudden there's this dude who has

401
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,379
access to all these weed people

402
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,540
who's [ __ ] a set I mean and you think

403
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,278
he's the only one I mean you would be a

404
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,740
[ __ ] fool if you didn't realize the

405
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:05,578
entire cannabis community

406
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,759
on every level has some form of someone

407
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,399
Undercover the federal government is not

408
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,199
stupid they're definitely they're

409
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,539
watching everything they're not

410
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,620
oblivious to what's going on so you

411
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,559
don't think they've put their own

412
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,839
players in play I mean come on you'd be

413
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,399
[ __ ] silly I mean dude I just don't

414
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,500
know how people don't realize some of

415
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,419
this stuff but I definitely don't think

416
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,958
we should be welcoming them with open

417
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,399
arms when they for decades tore apart

418
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,039
our families

419
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,799
put men and women in prison took

420
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,838
children and put them in CPS programs

421
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,698
basically stealing [ __ ] children now

422
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,339
that we're finding out about what CPS is

423
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:46,620
and basically a child pedophile [ __ ]

424
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,600
hijacking service

425
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,820
um it's just a joke they've they've

426
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,980
completely abused their power when it

427
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,980
comes to this plant and we should not be

428
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,860
just welcoming them to our side now

429
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,620
you've made a bed now [ __ ] weighing

430
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,220
it [ __ ] laying it don't just get to

431
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,140
come and play now I get it it's legal

432
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,480
now so sit your [ __ ] ass over there

433
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,400
and watch me make money watch me enjoy

434
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,279
my time with the plant that I've loved

435
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,199
that you used to [ __ ] cause drama huh

436
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,418
I mean how many times Stan put somebody

437
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,220
in jail for having weed I mean how many

438
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,980
times a cop gotta [ __ ] cause

439
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,860
somebody's life some drama over a plan

440
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,279
trust me I've had enough interactions

441
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,678
with them as a kid growing up even as an

442
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,259
adult as far as cannabis goes that I

443
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,000
know that we're on one side and they're

444
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:38,038
on another side so

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,419
and it's not just him like I said it's

446
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:45,538
my strong strong feeling that we need to

447
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:48,299
defend our area like we need to just be

448
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:51,179
very aware of who's joining and who were

449
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,759
welcoming and who we communicate with

450
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,160
and who we allow in our DMS and we're

451
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,200
talkative with and buddy buddy it's very

452
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,759
important for some people to not feel

453
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,500
like they're members like you're not us

454
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,599
dude you're you dude you can make an

455
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,339
account you can post weeds [ __ ] you can

456
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,359
comment in the weed [ __ ] all day long

457
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:13,980
but we should not be accepting everybody

458
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,379
you could try you can sit there you

459
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,019
could be in the peanut gallery but for

460
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,179
for certain people to get held up dudes

461
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:23,099
you gotta maybe prove who you are maybe

462
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,780
throw in a couple decades of some

463
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:29,879
[ __ ] I'm not a cop [ __ ] or something

464
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,678
just threw me it throws me off bro it

465
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,740
throws me off because a bunch of people

466
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,559
a bunch of people are just totally

467
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,380
oblivious with potential for disaster

468
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,960
when you're allowing complete Outsiders

469
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,980
into such a

470
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,380
such a fragile it's like dude this plant

471
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,419
and that our lives like a lot of us

472
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,280
operate

473
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,740
aren't they lying you know what I mean

474
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,839
so it's like I don't want to say too

475
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,440
much and cause any drama for people but

476
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,599
it is what it is we have our lines and

477
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,419
we have our rules for a reason I never

478
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,538
needed to tell the rule

479
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,100
don't [ __ ] with cops that's not a rule

480
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:13,859
that you need to tell people that's the

481
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,839
automatic that's on a mattress when we

482
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,579
were little kids nobody in the

483
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,459
neighborhood ever said hey don't talk to

484
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:22,678
Cops we just [ __ ] do better we do

485
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,120
better we knew not to talk to Cops I'll

486
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,400
tell you a quick Story one time I was

487
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,779
sitting in a trailer with this dude

488
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
we're just sitting there smoking

489
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:32,460
cigarettes and this [ __ ] ex-con comes

490
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,140
in all covered in tattoos and he's

491
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,179
sitting there all [ __ ] up dude he was

492
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,799
all spun out and [ __ ]

493
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,600
and he's like give me a cigarette man

494
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,700
and I gave him a cigarette and then we

495
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,500
left me and my friend Larry

496
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,298
we were out on the street on our

497
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,220
bicycles for maybe [ __ ] two minutes

498
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,298
and this cop pulls up to us and he goes

499
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,700
hey come here

500
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,200
and we're like what and he goes you see

501
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,298
this guy and he holds up a piece of

502
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,160
paper that had that dude's picture that

503
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,859
we just saw in that trailer and it said

504
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,419
five thousand dollar reward and I just

505
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,158
[ __ ] looked at the carpet and I was

506
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,159
like [ __ ] no we ain't seen him mind you

507
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm a poor very very poor kid and I've

508
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,900
never seen five thousand dollars nor

509
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,538
will I in my mind ever be seeing five

510
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,240
thousand dollars but the [ __ ] you

511
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:17,038
[ __ ] cops like dude and that's before

512
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm in the weed game I'm not even in the

513
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,359
Wii game that's just like Street [ __ ]

514
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,380
like I don't know how we've come this

515
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:28,500
far like I saw a picture the other day

516
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,480
of a guy at a event he was at like one

517
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,640
of these weed events and the cops you

518
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,380
know they're there doing their like just

519
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,240
patrols how they walk around and [ __ ]

520
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,400
and this dude took a picture with the

521
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
cops and he's like they used to bust us

522
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,320
now they protect us and I just laughed

523
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,419
and I was like why the [ __ ] would you

524
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,000
take a picture with two Riverside County

525
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,038
Sheriffs and be like they used to bust

526
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,140

527
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,000

528
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,520

529
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,099

530
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,839
it's got to be like dude holy [ __ ] this

531
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,219
isn't a real thing I'm dealing with but

532
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,038
that's with everything I mean we could

533
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,480
just go on and on about The Madness of

534
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,038
the world it's not just the weed

535
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,099
Community it's like everyone's losing

536
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:14,099
their [ __ ] minds so it shouldn't be

537
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,658
it shouldn't be so shocking to see silly

538
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,519
[ __ ] happening in the weekend really

539
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:22,380
just because we smoke a plant doesn't

540
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:25,859
make us you know safe from silliness

541
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,140
yeah no I agree and uh some wise words

542
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,779
in there for sure so before we get too

543
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,580
into all the various topics of meme

544
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:33,599
discussion I wanted to dive into let's

545
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:35,519
go back

546
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,918
you've just gotten high with your friend

547
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,139
you'd established that connection do you

548
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,520
remember what that first strain was that

549
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,919
you were smoking or at least do you

550
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,500
remember what it was like it was just

551
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:51,538
greeds it was just green Bud that his

552
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:55,500
dad grew his dad is a was a grower in

553
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:58,440
Texas in the early 90s so he was really

554
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,440
risking the biscuit and uh he had

555
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,200
probably about a half an acre of outdoor

556
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,860
that he a little plot that I had seen

557
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,380
maybe twice and uh sorry I'm completely

558
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:12,839
congested but at least sinuses agave

559
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,940
but uh he had a little outdoor plot that

560
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,379
we had access to the pot I don't know

561
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,900
what straight his dad was growing but

562
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,900
definitely good pot like it wasn't bad

563
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,059
it wasn't seeded pot it was it was his

564
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,880
dad's little private stash

565
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:28,558
um just some really good green Bud

566
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,320
definitely for a young beginner smoker

567
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,658
got the job done we were always torched

568
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:37,798
his dad would leave like half smoked

569
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:39,960
joints on the lid of the doorways and

570
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,480
windows you know like the little seal

571
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,220
like the above the doorway so when we

572
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,380
would walk around the house we would

573
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,880
just run our hand across the top of

574
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,740
those doors because his dad would set

575
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,240
joints everywhere and that's where he

576
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,940
would hide them so we would just get

577
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,058
like half smoke joints and get [ __ ] up

578
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,340
I mean [ __ ] up dude I remember feeling

579
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:03,418
like I was like mildly hallucinating

580
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:07,079
like holy [ __ ] yeah good good [ __ ]

581
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,840
Vibes man it was the best start I

582
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,000
absolutely have the coolest memories of

583
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,519
starting my relationship with this plant

584
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,159
that I'll have those memories forever

585
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,379
just really funny times with those guys

586
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,240
with Josh and Ian that that are just

587
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,919
forever man it's [ __ ] great to look

588
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,659
back at the beginning of smoking and

589
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,880
falling in love with something that has

590
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:29,640
such a huge impact on your actual life

591
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,280
and everybody's life around you you know

592
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,659
like it's just a big deal so it's pretty

593
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,960
[ __ ] cool

594
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,940
yeah that sounds awesome so as you were

595
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,640
growing up it sounds like you had access

596
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,798
to you know more kind type of Bud were

597
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,538
you aware that there was also like you

598
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,058
know the the reggies or was that just

599
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:50,339
totally out of your world nah we just

600
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,678
got whatever bud that was around it was

601
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:56,220
it was just whatever it was never

602
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:59,038
anything special until I was probably 16

603
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,679
or 17. I found a pretty good chronic

604
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,778
connect and we used to just force feed

605
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,580
that guy buddy because he was the only

606
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:08,759
one who had chronic that I'd ever seen

607
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:11,759
like real [ __ ] chronic chronic and uh

608
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,940
yeah like it was just random weed up

609
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,640
until then dude whatever we could get

610
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,440
and so what was the first strain that

611
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,038
truly kind of inspired you like maybe

612
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,740
the first name strain oh gee man I

613
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,798
remember like it was yesterday I was uh

614
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,140
in fact it's funny because my buddy

615
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,940
that's up here I got a buddy from SoCal

616
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,778
that came up here to kind of help me do

617
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,278
some growing and stuff snot rocket

618
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:40,619
uh he was at my house when it happened

619
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:45,119
this kid came over to sell me some pot

620
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:47,339
and he had pure kush real Kush and I

621
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,259
smoked some of it and I [ __ ] fell in

622
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:52,980
love I had never smoked weed like that

623
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:55,619
it felt so good in my chest my palate

624
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,360
was just [ __ ] it was like I couldn't

625
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:00,418
believe that I had been smoking weed

626
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,119
this whole time that wasn't bad if

627
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,679
that's my if I could make a point like

628
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,778
it was one of those moments where I was

629
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,140
just like dumbfounded that I had been

630
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:12,538
smoking pot that wasn't that flavor and

631
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,500
uh definitely OG it still is to this day

632
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:18,480
real good gas OG crosses are just like

633
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't know they got a place in my

634
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,099
heart forever

635
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,679
and so we've heard a lot about the

636
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,199
origins of OG over the past year or so

637
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,240
with the TK origin guys popping up and

638
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,740
whatnot what do you think is behind it

639
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,980
genetic wise

640
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,599
oh dude it's I don't even don't even go

641
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,659
down those roads and I'll tell you why

642
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:43,859
because if you go online and you look

643
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:46,500
for lineage histories it's just a

644
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:47,939
goddamn mess everybody's got stories of

645
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,298
where

646
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,940
Kim came from or Sour OG and what it's

647
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:56,339
named for it's just all a mess I just

648
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,980
could give two shits about it I quickly

649
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:02,220
realized that I don't have a lot of time

650
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,819
on Earth so I don't Fester into

651
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,460
emptiness like I won't go into a rat's

652
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:11,399
maze at all if I look at it from the top

653
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,558
and I see what it is I won't do it I

654
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,720
just won't waste my time doing it so

655
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:16,980
something like that is exactly what that

656
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,860
is

657
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,259
um there's a couple other things like a

658
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:25,199
great example for me and my type of

659
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:27,480
personality is learning about computers

660
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,819
and doing what you do so I have a

661
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,980
podcast that I'm about to start and I'm

662
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:34,319
waiting to find the right person to work

663
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,700
with to do all my engineering and all my

664
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,879
my uh

665
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,259
post-production stuff I can't do it and

666
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,419
I don't want to do it I've tried to

667
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:45,179
start learning it but it's like a It's A

668
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,940
Rat's Nest right to me because I don't

669
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,620
do computers so it's just like all of

670
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,480
this [ __ ] that I have to learn how to do

671
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,699
and it's something that it's like like I

672
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,980
said I look down on it and I see it's

673
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,319
just going to be a total [ __ ] chaos

674
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,000
thing I just don't want to do it and

675
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,918
that when you go looking for any string

676
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,960
I swear to God you can go find five

677
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,759
stories for every single strain on the

678
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,740
internet and then if you go to somebody

679
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,819
that actually knows about cannabis

680
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,859
lineage like archive or or Riot riots

681
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:15,359
actually knows a lot of [ __ ] and archive

682
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,639
does a lot of [ __ ] you'll quickly

683
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,918
realize that most of the [ __ ] on the

684
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,840
internet is not true so then it's just

685
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,120
like why would I fill my brain with

686
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,759
false information or half information

687
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,699
it's just stupid like if something's

688
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,500
fire it's fire I don't give a [ __ ] if

689
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,899
it's fired twice I like the way it

690
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,159
tastes if it breathes true just because

691
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:37,739
something tastes good doesn't mean it's

692
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,960
going to make good seed or breed true so

693
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,579
you gotta just go you just gotta get in

694
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,259
there and go and if something's breeding

695
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,480
good and it's putting out good Ops for

696
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:47,519
free you can keep the projects moving

697
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,860
and I mean that's really where I'm at

698
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,379
with it I don't I don't go too deep on

699
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:53,939
that on that whole internet [ __ ]

700
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,580
trade

701
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,620
yeah no that that makes sense and I

702
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:00,058
think that's a good quality to have but

703
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:02,879
something I wanted to chase out what you

704
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,319
just mentioned some parents May taste

705
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,080
good but don't necessarily make good

706
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,019
seeds are there any popular clones out

707
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:13,379
there which you think fit that rule

708
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:16,200
absolutely uh Mach One Mac one makes

709
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,260
amazing flower and looks [ __ ] amazing

710
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,659
every person who grows back the Mac one

711
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,879
has Frosty buds it always looks good it

712
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,820
always has this really cool earthy

713
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,100
profile that like it's just different

714
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:31,439
it's great it's kind of got a little bit

715
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:33,418
of a mute slow veg and it's got a little

716
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,778
bit of a shitty growth pattern it's not

717
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,880
the most vigorous of Growers but the

718
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:41,278
bugs are really good everybody loves it

719
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,380
it does not make seed I don't give a

720
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,940
[ __ ] what anybody says I've heard from

721
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,340
everybody it doesn't make seed I've

722
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,640
dusted it with three different studs it

723
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:54,000
will not make seed now maybe it's that's

724
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,520
why we're gonna move into the f2s and

725
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,319
maybe make a BX menu with some of the

726
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,379
stuff like we're gonna have to work

727
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,319
projects with it to try to find Vigor in

728
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,260
that g marker so there's just something

729
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,000
about that plant right out of the top of

730
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,278
my head it's the only one that pops into

731
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,319
my mind that just won't make seeds I'm

732
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,599
[ __ ] worked with hundreds of plants

733
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,480
and I can't think of anyone that's been

734
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,699
that bad so but it's amazing flower

735
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,860
that's why people will still continue to

736
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,980
want the crosses of it and I'm pretty

737
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:27,658
sure with some f2s or or some BX work we

738
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,360
could find the gene marker that'll

739
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:33,240
promote seed production and we can just

740
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:35,459
work from there you know using that as a

741
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,899
base marker that's all that's all it

742
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,538
really is dude where you're breeding is

743
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:41,579
you're just looking for markers you're

744
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:45,000
just looking for the right markers

745
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:47,158
so every breeders got different uh

746
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,839
pallets and they have different ideas of

747
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,240
what they want it

748
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,980
that's that you know it's really it's

749
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,200
kind of cool we're all like little chefs

750
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,640
you know we're in our kitchens and you

751
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,220
just have to find the one that you like

752
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,020
the way the food tastes and if you like

753
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,298
the way the food tastes then eat there

754
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,700
and support that kitchen and if you

755
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:07,079
don't [ __ ] go eat somewhere else real

756
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,200
simple

757
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:14,639
so just to quickly follow up on that one

758
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,100
have you ever seen any of the Mac f2s

759
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,419
that are maybe keeper females are just

760
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:19,740
really struggling to find some myself

761
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,140
online

762
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,419
no I haven't seen I've seen some mac

763
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,820
crosses

764
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,640
um I haven't seen anything I haven't

765
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:31,918
seen anything I also can admit that I

766
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,200
oftentimes don't

767
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,860
um stay up to date with what's going on

768
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,480
I'm so locked into my own existence and

769
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:43,019
the reason why I do this I have five

770
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,140
kids I have multiple grows that I have

771
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:49,139
to look over I trade Jiu Jitsu five days

772
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,620
a week and I'm just like I'm just locked

773
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,840
in dude I stream I do like the stuff

774
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:57,959
that I do so that I don't have a lot of

775
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,759
time for other people's stuff so it's it

776
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,980
is what it is it's like a curse because

777
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,720
I know that I'm missing out on

778
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,440
interacting with people and definitely

779
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,720
about watching projects happen and what

780
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,200
people are up to and [ __ ] but

781
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,880
I just did we got one life man I'm just

782
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,100
living mine you know what I mean just do

783
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,500
with me so not trying to bother anybody

784
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:21,240
or cause drama [ __ ] just hyper

785
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,460
focused on living my

786
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,519
my existence I just started skydiving

787
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,940
too which is [ __ ] amazing so I just

788
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:32,460
added one more thing to do I'm just like

789
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,700
I don't know man I don't see people's

790
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,298
projects so there probably is fire f2s

791
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,538
or or uh you know I'm assuming I don't

792
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,798
know did did he not make f2s has he made

793
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:46,259
f2s

794
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:48,298
yeah he's made more originals as well

795
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:49,200
but I just haven't really seen much come

796
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:51,599
from it

797
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,700
yeah I mean dude and you got to also

798
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,939
understand too that just because

799
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,460
someone's f1s were good doesn't mean

800
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,278
that the F2 seed stock will be good Matt

801
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,620
Matt kind of blew that out to me explain

802
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,839
to me that it would be better for me to

803
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,579
lock [ __ ] down through a BX menu than

804
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,178
actually using F2 so you see more

805
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:15,119
variants through f2s and f3s so it's

806
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,399
pretty crazy you know maybe that Mac F2

807
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,619
isn't as good as F was I don't [ __ ]

808
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,918
know but just honest opinion I don't

809
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:25,439
know so and I know I know um

810
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,360
I just know that I don't pay a lot of

811
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,100
attention to other people's projects so

812
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,278
it's not really fair to ask me that

813
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,538
question yeah no good I did want to ask

814
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,038
you something you just mentioned you

815
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,898
mentioned you were streaming I want to

816
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,179
Sidetrack for a moment what's it like

817
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:41,939
streaming on Twitch these days I heard

818
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:45,240
it's a little bit going downhill Maybe

819
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,340
uh I just got there so the grind you

820
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,460
kind of have to just grind for a year or

821
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:53,579
two to really like get in the grind but

822
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,700
we have a regular 20 30 people watching

823
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:59,819
I mean it's not a lot but it's fun I get

824
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,220
I drink a little Margarita and smoke

825
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,319
some dabs and play some video games and

826
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,179
laugh sometimes I use it as just like uh

827
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,700
how I do my Ig live where I'm just

828
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,759
sitting there talking on the grid and

829
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,919
sometimes I'm playing games I'm about to

830
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,619
set it up where I'll be sometimes uh

831
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,019
watching YouTube videos while you can

832
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:21,778
see my face and the YouTube video so we

833
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:24,120
could do like commentary on stupid

834
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:26,759
videos and [ __ ] I'm about to have it set

835
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:30,119
up a little different but it's fun man I

836
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,700
enjoy it I think it's cool it's a it's a

837
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:35,278
I don't know dude I'm just looking for

838
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,740
Instagram [ __ ] us all over I spent

839
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,319
years on Instagram building an audience

840
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,899
for them to just take it away which is

841
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,058
really shitty like I got Shadow band

842
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:47,518
because I like certain posts and I share

843
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,619
certain posts and I say certain keywords

844
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,778
and no matter what anybody knows or

845
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,879
thinks they're listening to what you do

846
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:55,980
and they watch everything you do and

847
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,419
it's all through the program it's not it

848
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,120
has nothing to do with some person

849
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:02,580
sitting in some office going we need to

850
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,219
shadow man come to the grower it's dude

851
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:07,558
if you like certain posts and let's say

852
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,260
let's say

853
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,179
a great example is they'll just I'm

854
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,760
assuming I don't know for sure I just

855
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,440
know what happened to my posts I started

856
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,800
talking about things that were Against

857
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,358
the Grain but are 100 factual and as

858
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,519
soon as that happened I started seeing

859
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,679
it and it got worse and worse and worse

860
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,539
to the point to where my interaction is

861
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,418
like less than one percent like they

862
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:32,759
just took away my whole audience so I

863
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,858
don't I just feel like I wasted years it

864
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,419
sucks now don't get me wrong people know

865
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:39,179
who cover the grower is and they know

866
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:42,658
who prolifico seed is so it's not a

867
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:46,918
waste but imagine if I had access to my

868
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,720
130 000 followers and only 20 000 of

869
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,658
them were real people that followed me

870
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,500
and I made a t-shirt for sale every

871
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,619
month

872
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,980
I could sell what 5 000 t-shirts out of

873
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,059
my 30 000 real followers 5 000 t-shirts

874
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,400
sold a month

875
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,858
with a ten dollar profit

876
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,180
think about it dude but they don't they

877
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:08,460
don't want you to make money on

878
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:11,699
Instagram not without paying them every

879
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:13,980
time I make a post it says promote they

880
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:16,078
want me to give them money for my post

881
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,300
to be seen and they purposefully don't

882
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,980
let them be seen because they know that

883
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,380
it triggers a thing in my head that

884
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,119
pisses me off and I want it to be seen

885
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,338
and if you have the money you're going

886
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,900
to pay for it that's how a lot of these

887
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,820
businesses have stayed successful on

888
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,800
Instagram they just pay the advertising

889
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,599
money and I and I've thought about it

890
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,400
should I just pay for the advertisement

891
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,300
because I have a business this is my

892
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,980
business

893
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,000
something about it won't let me do it I

894
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,400
don't know if it's because I'm a

895
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,619
stubborn Irish [ __ ] or if I just

896
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,240
don't like if I don't like Instagram I

897
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,460
don't know what it is but I'm not giving

898
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,819
them a [ __ ] penny I'm not gonna do it

899
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,338
so it is what it is babe

900
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,960
you touch on a really important issue in

901
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:57,179
terms of how the algorithms are

902
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,338
affecting our community do you think

903
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:01,078
ultimately people will get so sick that

904
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:01,980
we'll just get off Instagram or do you

905
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,960
think there'll be some sort of

906
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,820
compromise

907
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,519
um I don't think they'll ever compromise

908
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,338
like I just had a poster move today for

909
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:13,320
against their against their terms and it

910
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,239
was just a weed post

911
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,920
um I don't think they'll ever compromise

912
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:22,219
and I don't think that it'll be very

913
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,838
much longer before something comes along

914
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:26,639
that will take people's attention you

915
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,119
know the same with Myspace something

916
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:32,879
came along and took that and

917
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,099
uh when Facebook was out nobody thought

918
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,320
Instagram was gonna be as big as it was

919
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,359
so I'm assuming something eventually

920
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,240
will come along right now Instagram is

921
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,400
just very easy for a lot of people so

922
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,299
they're using it out of out of ease I

923
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,639
think

924
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,680
there's a few other things like cannabis

925
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,838
and stuff but they just I don't know

926
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,539
what it is I don't know they don't

927
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,358
function as easy as Instagram and our

928
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:59,759
customer bases are on Instagram that's

929
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:03,119
where everybody is so if I'm trying to

930
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,820
make money or or generate Revenue in any

931
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,920
way or build any type of momentum

932
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,079
towards generating Revenue I need to be

933
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,519
in front of my customer base and that's

934
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,079
where all these people are it's on

935
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,000
Instagram so right now they kind of have

936
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,640
us by the balls there's really nothing

937
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,280
we could do like you just kind of got to

938
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:21,838
just go with it it just it sucks like I

939
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,140
said but there's really nothing you can

940
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:27,719
do so I don't see it I don't see them

941
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:29,759
ever changing and I do see people

942
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,559
getting tired of it eventually but

943
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,440
there's nothing that I see that's going

944
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,940
to take anybody yet so we'll see

945
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,159
yeah

946
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,039
so let's jump back to the story for a

947
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:44,338
moment how do we go from smoking The

948
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:47,759
Chronic to then having your first grow

949
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:48,960
oh I tried to grow for a second in

950
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,820
Southern California I didn't know

951
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,980
anything about growing this guy brought

952
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,180
over a high pressure sodium bulb and

953
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:59,880
ballast and hood and I bought it for 250

954
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:02,759
bucks and I set it up in a little

955
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,400
trailer or like a little uh trailer but

956
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,880
a shed in the backyard and it had no AC

957
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,139
and it was summer in California and I

958
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,400
didn't realize like I didn't know

959
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:13,799
anything about growing I was like oh

960
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,300
[ __ ] it's like 140 degrees in here I

961
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,039
didn't have any plants in there I just

962
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,060
set it up just to like see how the room

963
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,739
would work

964
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,019
so

965
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:24,059
um I never grew right there I just

966
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:25,980
started growing outside like I grew weed

967
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,460
outside probably

968
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:32,460
maybe like three four years

969
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,019
I grew once outside of Texas with a

970
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,559
failed Harvest

971
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:41,940
I grew twice when I so once in Texas

972
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:44,960
when I was 15 failed Harvest we uh did

973
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,960
not get our buds

974
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,680
all rotted it I've got all like [ __ ]

975
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,519
disgusting and [ __ ]

976
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,779
um

977
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:56,159
17 18 and 19 we grew pot outside in

978
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,640
California

979
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:02,578
uh decent harvests like nothing to write

980
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,379
home about but definitely learning about

981
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,660
growing pot and learning about getting

982
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,280
better with the plant for sure I did

983
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:10,920
grow wheat for a long time after that

984
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,880
until I got here

985
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,000
at 26 and started growing indoors here

986
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,320
in Oregon 26 to now for the last 10

987
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,260
years growing weed inside here

988
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,400
pretty much consistently every every

989
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,980
year

990
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,380
killer killer and so what was the first

991
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,760
big name clone you got

992
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:40,019
oh first big name clothes I got were OG

993
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,619
cuts from Rascals crew I traded payaso

994
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:46,079
grow and stinky Farms clothes and they

995
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,039
brought some stuff up from Southern Cali

996
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,560
probably a Wi-Fi three and a fire cut

997
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:55,679
those are the first real clothes I got I

998
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:59,039
had I grown some good pot before but

999
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:01,139
I had never like done it you know to be

1000
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,579
like knocked out packs on packs of

1001
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,920
chronic and really like changed my

1002
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,079
position on the board and those clothes

1003
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,019
really helped me change my spot for sure

1004
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,180
I started just it was [ __ ] day and

1005
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:16,079
night I went from second gear to [ __ ]

1006
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:17,940
just straight paid figure like it was it

1007
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,880
was [ __ ] crazy how fast everything

1008
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,338
changed like quick little story we were

1009
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,760
struggle struggle struggle I got those

1010
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:30,960
clothes vegged out a big ass I had uh 12

1011
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:34,160
hoods in this garage all OG

1012
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,159
and uh

1013
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,780
I'll see if my kids are crying all right

1014
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,358
I filled it up with all that OG the

1015
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,800
Wi-Fi three of the fire and I got like

1016
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:49,500
maybe 19 pounds 20 pounds of like real

1017
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,260
good solid top nugget it sold all that

1018
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,260
[ __ ] at 28 it was the first time I'd

1019
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,599
ever [ __ ] just lump come up like that

1020
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,339
it happened so fast everything was

1021
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,079
always a struggle before you know you

1022
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:03,599
would like Harvest weed and have to try

1023
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,339
to like sell a pound to this guy so a

1024
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,099
half pound of this guy you know you're

1025
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:11,099
just like hustling to sell it but I had

1026
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:13,680
real gas for the first time it was like

1027
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:16,380
gas gas and that [ __ ] was just [ __ ]

1028
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,239
gone it's crazy those were crazy times

1029
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,358
man crazy times

1030
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:24,959
so the Fire OG was the first real good

1031
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:28,920
cut Fire OG not Fire OG just fire cut

1032
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,579
it's uh not the same oh okay

1033
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,920
So Fire OG Fire OG is uh

1034
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,140
probably just renamed something green

1035
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,960
and there was basically Saturn OG

1036
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:44,219
Jupiter OG all these [ __ ] they're

1037
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,920
probably the same three OG's renamed I

1038
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:49,259
mean dude a handful of OG cuts and don't

1039
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,180
get me wrong with the first ogs came

1040
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,099
over they did what OG's like to do which

1041
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:55,199
is throw S one here or there so people

1042
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:57,059
found a seat here or there the little S1

1043
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,699
made a little pollen here there so there

1044
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:03,239
was OG hybrids made real quick on

1045
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:06,239
accident and then ogs ones that were

1046
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,739
planted right away I mean someone finds

1047
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,659
a seed in something that's really really

1048
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,459
date the first thing if they're a grower

1049
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:13,078
the first thing to do is throwing it out

1050
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,500
so

1051
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:21,300
um the fire cut is definitely not Fire

1052
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,858
OG and Rascal made sure he I didn't know

1053
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,599
that he's the one who schooled me on

1054
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,299
that so Props to him for making sure

1055
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,599
that the true stories get told instead

1056
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,619
of you know buddied up history

1057
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,780
uh

1058
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:36,838
I don't know how happy he was and I got

1059
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,060
those cuts to be honest but I definitely

1060
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:42,299
got the Wi-Fi through the fire cup from

1061
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:45,420
payaso and stinky farms and uh it dude

1062
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,880
it [ __ ] saved my life so Props to

1063
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,099
everybody involved and I really don't

1064
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,380
know what to say but that was the first

1065
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,940
real real date that I got in the first

1066
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,460
time that things

1067
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,200
changed on my board

1068
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,539
yeah okay Kayla thanks for the

1069
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,118
clarification I didn't know that so I

1070
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:05,639

1071
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:09,180

1074
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:17,879

love it okay yeah so what was it then

1083
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:43,439
that stimulated you to begin prolific Co

1084
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,980
seeds

1085
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,519
um pretty much just by failed running of

1086
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,539
other people's seed like I grew weed for

1087
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:53,519
years

1088
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:55,139
and for a long time I was growing other

1089
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,000
people's seed and Seed I was buying off

1090
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,759
the internet and

1091
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,380
just regularly coming up short even to

1092
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,119
the point I've said this before to the

1093
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,800
points where I was questioning myself I

1094
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,480
didn't know if I was even a good grower

1095
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,839
dude I I didn't know what the [ __ ] was

1096
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,079
going on like I was just having a really

1097
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:16,380
hard time in the beginning and then

1098
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:19,140
I got those cuts right

1099
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,380
and it made me realize real quick I was

1100
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:24,838
worth 3 000 a pound right like in a

1101
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,720
busted Market nobody had no [ __ ] weed

1102
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:30,480
money in Oregon dude like this place was

1103
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,118
dog [ __ ] so even in the market that's

1104
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,639
falling apart I was eating and I quickly

1105
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,579
realized it wasn't me it was all this

1106
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,779
whack-ass [ __ ] weed I was growing and

1107
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:42,060
there's a bunch of people here that

1108
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,220
still do it to themselves in Oregon like

1109
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:46,440
you said the booth Growers of Oregon how

1110
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,879
they have this like bad name a lot of it

1111
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,619
is just the straights they're growing

1112
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,900
they're not bad Growers they're just

1113
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:57,119
growing [ __ ] weird straights that are

1114
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:59,160
not like heat heat so that being said I

1115
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,599
mean

1116
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,460
I don't know

1117
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't know

1118
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,400
to me to me it just seems like

1119
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,739
to me it seems like we

1120
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,740
we made a choice

1121
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:16,858
we made a choice that we were gonna lead

1122
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:19,318
our own destiny and I do right away that

1123
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:21,539
I could do the job I do exactly what it

1124
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:22,858
was to make seed I wasn't oblivious to

1125
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:24,838
it don't get me wrong there was a bunch

1126
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:26,460
of my brain I didn't know and there's

1127
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,559
still a bunch of stuff about breeding I

1128
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,780
don't know and I love to learn

1129
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,739
of getting better regularly so that's

1130
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,960
fine

1131
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:36,299
uh

1132
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,900
I just knew that I could do a good job

1133
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,579
at it and it was an important position

1134
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,380
in the Cannabis industry that needed to

1135
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:46,140
be taking a little more serious than a

1136
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:48,660
lot of people were taking it and

1137
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,759
that's that it was just that so we made

1138
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:53,460
the first group of crosses and we gave

1139
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,980
them to our friends to test nothing was

1140
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,139
for sale I was actually only making C

1141
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,480
for me and my crew me and my immediate

1142
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:03,659
Hobbies just so we could all have fire

1143
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,000
and sell packs of fire do crosses that

1144
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:08,219
nobody else would have the seed was so

1145
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,739
[ __ ] good my friends were like you

1146
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:12,239
have to sell this dude everybody told me

1147
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:15,779
the same thing they're like bro I just

1148
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,639
tested 30k Ball 30k Sports 30 now 30

1149
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,920
Honey Tree this shit's all fire

1150
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,259
everybody was saying the same thing I

1151
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,480
got multiple Keepers this is [ __ ] I

1152
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,700
heard that from everybody I got multiple

1153
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,920
Keepers when you hear that multiple

1154
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:31,259
Keepers that's like a green light

1155
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,700
because I popped hundreds and hundreds

1156
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,920
and hundreds of seeds and found nothing

1157
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:37,199
that I could keep nothing that I could

1158
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,980
make money off of it all had the names

1159
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:43,618
and all said Cherry this or Kush that or

1160
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,599
[ __ ] oh gee this but none of it was

1161
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,059
gas none of it was Cherry none of it was

1162
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,519
OG fish so that I'm sitting over here

1163
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,019
pulling my dick telling my wife you know

1164
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,759
it's gonna be different this time babe

1165
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,219
we're gonna Harvest we're gonna have

1166
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,500
straight [ __ ] kill and it was a kill

1167
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:59,939
and then it was a kill again and then it

1168
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,139
was a kill again how the [ __ ] am I

1169
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,420
supposed to look at her in the face and

1170
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:04,920
tell her how could I look at her in the

1171
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,358
face and tell her it's gonna be killed

1172
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,318
it ain't gonna be killed we don't have

1173
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:09,480
kill

1174
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,400
Ed so I had to fix that [ __ ] that's what

1175
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,619
I got kids I got a wife I got people

1176
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,539
that are relying on me

1177
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,900
big reason why I was able to learn how

1178
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:20,759
to grow and do this job well was [ __ ]

1179
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,700
dude if I didn't do it well we were

1180
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,200
gonna die pretty simple pretty easy to

1181
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:28,318
be good at something when you don't have

1182
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,598
a way you know like that's it like we're

1183
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,858
here we went all in with with the plant

1184
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,380
so

1185
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:36,480
which you're all in you're always

1186
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,539
you can't pull the chips back bro that's

1187
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,699
not how the casino works

1188
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,920
yeah wow that's some real honest

1189
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:46,558
motivation right there

1190
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,280
so you've worked with a lot of different

1191
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:52,140
ogs what do you feel they pair best with

1192
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,940
what do you think is a good breeding

1193
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:56,699
partner for an OG

1194
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,380
oh dude everything so I don't really

1195
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:02,219
like Fruity pot

1196
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:04,440
or like exotic like profiles really it's

1197
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:06,659
hot I like a bit dabs but I don't really

1198
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:11,700
like them in the flower but when you put

1199
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:14,519
OG studs with like a lot of this stuff

1200
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:16,318
the profiles are like perfect because

1201
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,800
they still taste a lot of The Offspring

1202
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:21,440
still taste gassy but there's these just

1203
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,000
undertones on the back end of whatever

1204
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,039
like I don't know if it's just my studs

1205
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,460
because my studs really do breed heavy

1206
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:32,400
so when I dust something that's has no

1207
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:35,760
OG in it a lot of The Offspring comes

1208
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:40,318
out with OG profiles a lot of Threes And

1209
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,059
fives a lot of that leggy uh OG profile

1210
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,838
even though my studs are shorter stud

1211
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:48,720
you'll still see OG uh OG profiles just

1212
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:51,058
the way they look and uh

1213
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,639
definitely the way they smell but like I

1214
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:56,240
said you'll you'll find some oftentimes

1215
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:59,039
that a lot of The Offspring has these

1216
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:02,279
undertones these side angles of whatever

1217
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,900
was dusted so I I just really feel like

1218
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,000
it goes good with everything it ends up

1219
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,579
being just about individual partners of

1220
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,559
those Partners mesh well because some

1221
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:13,440
females won't accept pollen and they

1222
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,780
won't make seed and that could be that

1223
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,119
specific mail to that specific female

1224
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,640
where that female would accept seed from

1225
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,818
maybe her brother or from a different

1226
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,818
stud but she won't accept pollen from

1227
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:29,579
that stud most of the time that's not

1228
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:31,619
the case it's just that she won't accept

1229
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:33,599
pollen like the Mac one is a great

1230
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,818
example there where you could touch it

1231
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,619
with thousand different pollens like it

1232
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:39,058
doesn't like to make seed that's why

1233
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,220
those seeds are so [ __ ] expensive

1234
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,059
when they go to market because there's

1235
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:44,058
not a lot of them

1236
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,800
in in theory like

1237
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:52,219
I don't know I don't know man I don't

1238
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,680
know whatever next question

1239
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:57,959
no I love it man I love it I should have

1240
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,940
asked you before but I forgot when you

1241
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,980
were kind of before you got into your

1242
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,200
breeding days were there any breeders

1243
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,358
you particularly like the work of or

1244
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,919
maybe even looked up to and thought yeah

1245
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:08,880
like this guy really knows what they're

1246
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,599
doing

1247
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,838
oh yeah oh yeah like oh as far as

1248
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:19,680
knowledge as far as knowledge goes I

1249
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,380
really feel like Matt and and uh archive

1250
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,480
they [ __ ] are like human

1251
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,500
encyclopedias those dudes know pretty

1252
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,780
much

1253
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,338
what needs to be known you know like if

1254
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,200
if the Earth was going to end tomorrow

1255
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:32,699
you want to take these two [ __ ] and

1256
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,799
stuff them in a hole somewhere so that

1257
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:37,078
way they don't so we don't lose all the

1258
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,300
weed lineage because they know they know

1259
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,460
all the [ __ ] they're really both really

1260
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,039
[ __ ] sharp and uh

1261
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:47,880
I looked up to Karma a lot the karma

1262
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:50,940
crew are some uh just absolute Legends

1263
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,220
and I truly feel like this like time

1264
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,679
tells the story with breeders and with

1265
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:57,959
people in general and karma's been here

1266
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,879
for [ __ ] a long time dude and they

1267
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,159
haven't done shady [ __ ] to people over

1268
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,500
all these years and they haven't [ __ ]

1269
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,019
lied to people or made some waxy drop

1270
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,239
you know what I mean like they've proven

1271
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:12,019
time and time again what their character

1272
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:15,358
is and that's what it is to me is like

1273
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:18,420
all the [ __ ] aside dude [ __ ] time

1274
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:21,420
never lies time always tells the story

1275
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:25,858
time's [ __ ] never been defeated like

1276
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:28,019
we all get the story in the end so I

1277
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:32,639
just uh I looked up a lot to them I

1278
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:34,318
looked up to uh hso I looked up to um I

1279
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,578
mean I still do I know it's not that I

1280
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,440
looked up to that but I know it should

1281
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,260
be like where I'm a younger breeder kind

1282
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,480
of like I I definitely uh had a few

1283
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,300
people that were always I was always

1284
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,179
looking forward to to hearing talk and

1285
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:51,480
always looking to uh to learn from and

1286
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:52,519
see what they were doing so definitely

1287
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,500
100

1288
00:51:52,519 --> 00:52:00,318
so what is kind of your General Vision

1289
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,318
or trajectory you'd like to take PCS in

1290
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:07,740
the ideas I want to just

1291
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,139
you know it's like PCS to the world

1292
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:13,919
pretty much I just want people to have a

1293
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:16,739
shot at growing real gas if you live in

1294
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,780
some [ __ ] third world country and you

1295
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:21,899
buy seeds which people do you know I

1296
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:24,540
mean I I could honestly tell you most

1297
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,460
people don't have gas most people in a

1298
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:29,759
the states don't have gas especially

1299
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:33,838
places like Vermont or [ __ ] Oklahoma

1300
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,059
or Kansas or South Dakota or these like

1301
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,519
Off the Wall States that never had weed

1302
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,619
programs and like nobody really set up

1303
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,179
there and [ __ ] big they don't have

1304
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,300
access to clones and they don't have

1305
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:47,940
access to good OG or sour or whatever so

1306
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,980
me making the crosses and making the

1307
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,280
seed

1308
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:55,800
and making what I made and what I do

1309
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,140
make is for a purpose like I want people

1310
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:01,019
to have access to that potential to

1311
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:02,818
safely that happened to me where when I

1312
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:05,039
just finally got gas my whole life

1313
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:07,920
changed dude we were struggling every

1314
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,358
[ __ ] day every day was a struggle and

1315
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,920
we didn't know how the bills were going

1316
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,739
to get paid next month we just would

1317
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,318
hope that it was going to be okay gig up

1318
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:18,239
to my man boost free because that little

1319
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,980
[ __ ] saved my life so many times

1320
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,779
I don't even I'm telling you but I've

1321
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,059
had a couple homies out here that I just

1322
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,760
cannot imagine what I would have done

1323
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:29,220
without these people in my life and I'm

1324
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,460
here now because of the support that I

1325
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:35,519
was shown by a few really close friends

1326
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:37,079
and I mean in reality dude like that's

1327
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:38,639
what it ends up being you just kind of

1328
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,900
gotta

1329
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:45,179
you gotta just understand that

1330
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,519
you're gonna set your own pace you're

1331
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,019
gonna set your own mission and and we've

1332
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,880
set our own pace that's why I don't rush

1333
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:52,500
venues like a lot of people's like

1334
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,760
where's the next menu where's the next

1335
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,219
menu I'm not going to sell you guys

1336
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,700
something that's not ready I'm not gonna

1337
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:01,558
sell you anything that's not proper so

1338
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:03,838
we just finished what we're doing we're

1339
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:07,319
waiting to do these giant hunts that way

1340
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:10,858
I could truly look through the gear and

1341
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:13,019
I don't know this is what is dude I I

1342
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:15,598
got a ton of people online that are

1343
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:18,659
supporting PCS whether we instantly

1344
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,280
launch or or launch at next menu or not

1345
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:22,618
so like I feel really comfortable with

1346
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,300
my position and we're just gonna do what

1347
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:26,640
we've done consistently the whole time

1348
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,920
which is not [ __ ] with anybody we know

1349
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,980
we don't lie to anybody we don't rip

1350
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,599
anybody off and that's it and I truly

1351
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,579
feel like it's the best advice I could

1352
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,920
give to any young entrepreneur coming

1353
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:40,079
into the Cannabis industry or any

1354
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,720
industry in general

1355
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,280
just don't be a piece of [ __ ] and you're

1356
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,798
already ahead of the game you're already

1357
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,720
80 ahead of the game there's [ __ ]

1358
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:50,880
only you're already in the top 20

1359
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,919
percentile just don't rip anybody off

1360
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,099
don't lie to anybody don't do anything

1361
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,079
shady or sell some [ __ ] cut cart pens

1362
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:59,760
or [ __ ] you know what I'm talking

1363
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,920
about like everybody's always trying to

1364
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,079
get over on everybody just don't be that

1365
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,960
guy and you're already in the top tier

1366
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:09,720
so you're ahead

1367
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,659
love it love it we're gonna get back to

1368
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:13,919
that topic in a little bit and you'll

1369
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:15,539
know what I'm talking about when we get

1370
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,119
there but for the moment let's jump back

1371
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:20,880
a minute what was the process like for

1372
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,619
creating the pcs1 mail like guide us

1373
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,940
through its Genesis

1374
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:30,599
okay so I basically had a pretty big uh

1375
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:32,400
hoop house outside that I was just not

1376
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,338
sure what I wanted to do

1377
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,338
so I floured out a bunch of Casper OG

1378
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:38,338
seeds

1379
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:42,298
um

1380
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,338
in reality I didn't find any females

1381
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:47,659
that I liked I was not even going to use

1382
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:50,519
the Casper o Gmail I was gonna use a

1383
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:53,338
scotso Gmail I was gonna go a different

1384
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,460
way but I have a at the time I have a

1385
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:58,139
really really good Scotto G female

1386
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,298
probably one of the better cuts that

1387
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:02,879
I've ever come across and found in my

1388
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:05,159
life that I found from seed so I know

1389
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,900
I'm one of the only few that has this

1390
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,818
specific cut

1391
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,160
I had given it out to a couple people

1392
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:15,659
but it's pretty pretty close

1393
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:20,279
and uh I dusted that Scots with the

1394
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:21,779
really gassy OG dog Casper OG Bale that

1395
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,960
I found

1396
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:28,980
when I collected that seed I probably

1397
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:32,159
had maybe 3 000 seeds five thousand

1398
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,699
seeds I quickly gave a shitload of them

1399
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:36,539
to my friends and I only planted maybe

1400
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:40,078
150 of them

1401
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:41,639
I did not find what I was looking for in

1402
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,400
the first group

1403
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:48,179
and I'll quickly explain

1404
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:51,720
I was searching for short I just really

1405
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:55,500
had this concept that if I could find an

1406
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:57,959
incredibly short OG dog plant then I

1407
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,019
could defeat the one thing that causes

1408
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:04,318
issues in everybody's OG project which

1409
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:06,358
is this lanky [ __ ] right OG has this

1410
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,480
[ __ ] tendency to just run on

1411
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:12,539
everybody so I was specifically looking

1412
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:15,119
for a jean marker like I told you

1413
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,759
earlier that was going to promote this

1414
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,640
short plant growth

1415
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,400
and uh because the next step was to

1416
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,039
touch my Wi-Fi three and I know the

1417
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,559
Wi-Fi 3 just happens to be a short OG

1418
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:31,318
structured plant it tastes like gas

1419
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,240
takes fire but it does not grow like a

1420
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:36,838
lot of OG's like the San Fernando Valley

1421
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:40,019
or or or the [ __ ] TK how they'll run

1422
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:41,279
on you they get leggy Wi-Fi 3 does not

1423
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:43,199
get lucky

1424
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,500
so I know if I could get this second

1425
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,779
this this [ __ ] first layer done on a

1426
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,818
short scale and I'm gonna dust this

1427
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,519
wi-fi 3 then I'm gonna have this double

1428
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:55,199
G marker of short planes and that's

1429
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,759
exactly what happened the second time I

1430
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,358
went through that seed stock I planted

1431
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:03,780
200 plus seeds I found an incredibly

1432
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:09,900
gassy OG dog plant that was [ __ ]

1433
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:13,079
shortest [ __ ] I dusted my Wi-Fi 3 with

1434
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:15,059
that palette I mind you the whole time

1435
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:16,559
I'm dusting a bunch of other [ __ ] so I

1436
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,960
have a bunch of these projects like all

1437
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,880
types of side projects but that's where

1438
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,639
the mail came from was beef dusting this

1439
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,480
wi-fi three with that shorter stud from

1440
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,019
the

1441
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,119
Casper on the Scots which are both leggy

1442
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:31,798
mind you the Scots is leggy and the

1443
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,200
Casper's leggy so

1444
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:36,960
it was just a total random fight that I

1445
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:39,960
found a short short uh

1446
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,260
child from that cross

1447
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:46,079
the Wi-Fi 3 cross was

1448
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:49,980
175 seeds once we've dusted the Wi-Fi 3

1449
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:53,099
and I found the pcs one stud

1450
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,838
I instantly knew which one I liked out

1451
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:57,180
of the crop out of the group and I

1452
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:59,279
isolated them took a bunch of cuts and

1453
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:03,058
started making the projects like started

1454
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,000
using him that first one from seed uh

1455
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:07,920
I've since just been taking cuts of cuts

1456
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,500
and just keeping him alive and keeping

1457
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,139
him in my rooms in vegetative state any

1458
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:16,920
time ready to go anytime he's ready to

1459
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:21,259
to bust the nut always hanging out

1460
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:24,119
I love it so uh what are some of the

1461
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,619
attributes or characteristics of males

1462
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,298
that you like to look out for when

1463
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:30,420
you're selecting something or is it more

1464
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:32,039
of a by feel thing oh no you have to you

1465
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,780
have to do

1466
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,219
well archive said something that was

1467
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,519
kind of smart he says you know that's

1468
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:41,639
what's cool about reversals is you can

1469
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:43,139
taste the mail before you have the male

1470
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:44,940
pollen because you're reversing a female

1471
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:47,879
so you kind of know where you're at it

1472
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:51,059
makes a ton of sense it's uh

1473
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,559
something that I didn't do I'm gonna

1474
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:54,599
have other projects in the future and

1475
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,599
it's something I probably will do so

1476
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:59,818
it's cool but as far as my selecting I

1477
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,579
was just selecting on Vigor I was

1478
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:05,880
selecting on on actual

1479
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:08,579
growth pattern and that's about all I

1480
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:12,180
could select on you know smell Vigor and

1481
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:15,420
how it actually is growing so we

1482
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:17,578
when I took clothes you got to realize I

1483
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:21,420
guess I didn't explain when I chose the

1484
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:25,140
pcs1 mail there was a whole lot of males

1485
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:27,720
in there and when I took the clothes you

1486
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:30,118
know there's probably four or five bales

1487
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:32,039
that are pretty short and then there's

1488
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,380
another four or five that are not that

1489
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:37,079
short but still gassy and one of these

1490
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,880
males is going to be pcs one when I took

1491
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,680
the clothes I

1492
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,298
the first thing I'm looking at is which

1493
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:44,899
ones are rooting fast because that's

1494
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:48,780
instant Vigor that's telling me a real

1495
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:50,760
important story and the pcs1 mail that I

1496
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,619
did select was absolutely the first one

1497
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,720
to start rooting and it was fully rooted

1498
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:57,480
at like eight days completely rooted

1499
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,039
ready to be transplanted so completely

1500
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,139
full of vigor

1501
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,480
OG dog

1502
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:05,699
short structure just everything that you

1503
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,260
could if you were gonna draw one up it

1504
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,939
would be what you would want you know

1505
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,640
what I mean it has what you need from

1506
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,559
the OG it has what you don't want I I

1507
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:15,960
did exactly what I tried to do with it

1508
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:19,579
it breeds true everything it touches

1509
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,440
turns to gas so it's just an incredible

1510
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:24,359
incredible first first stud to come out

1511
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,298
the gate with and make some really good

1512
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:30,960
projects for people to enjoy

1513
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:33,539
hell yeah so you just briefly spoke

1514
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,220
about how many seeds you like to pop and

1515
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:37,619
how many you had popped in the past

1516
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:39,058
pretty nice numbers you had there I

1517
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:41,640
guess as a general rule of thumb

1518
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:43,559
obviously people can do amazing work

1519
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:45,659
with small number of seeds but in your

1520
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:47,579
mind what are the numbers you'd like to

1521
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:50,519
work with to feel confident that you

1522
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:55,019
were doing the project Justice

1523
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:56,579
um in reality a couple hundred per if

1524
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:59,038
I'm really selecting at least a couple

1525
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,539
hundred but that's just me I am a little

1526
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:04,140
bit of a

1527
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:06,599
over like I I just dude I'm so worried

1528
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:09,058
like when we found keeper case Morris I

1529
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:11,039
was kind of like [ __ ] because I had

1530
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:13,140
already seen kids online with what I

1531
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,539
thought maybe might be better gay sports

1532
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:18,420
and I and I'm like that kid only popped

1533
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:20,460
20 seeds and I popped [ __ ] 200 so

1534
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,900
it's like I'm always a perfectionist it

1535
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,119
made me want to go back through case

1536
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,920
Wars and Poppy before of them and he

1537
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:29,338
very well may have had the better ones

1538
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,318
so in my in my eyes it's a couple

1539
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:34,500
hundred but that's just me you could

1540
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:36,960
find heat in a 10-pack toy bag dude and

1541
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,219
just find absolute kill but breeding a

1542
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,260
little bit different it's definitely

1543
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:42,358
nice to be able to look through through

1544
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,880
seed stock at least 100 or a couple

1545
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:47,519
hundred would be probably probably a

1546
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,338
little bit better for for us as breeders

1547
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,679
as we're looking for as many as many uh

1548
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:55,440
variables as we can find here

1549
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:57,239
yeah okay and how would you feel if

1550
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,798
someone bought say one or two packs of

1551
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,659
your gear found a male and started

1552
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,159
breeding with that dude a bunch of

1553
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:03,719
people hit me up and ask me if they

1554
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:06,239
could use my stuff for their projects

1555
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:07,858
and I don't have any problem with that

1556
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,078
at all dude that's kind of what this

1557
01:03:07,858 --> 01:03:11,578
whole thing is you know it's like if

1558
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,440
your projects are good people will like

1559
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,900
them but maybe there'll be better pot

1560
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,960
out there I don't have any qual with

1561
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:21,000
people making money people making good

1562
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,818
chronic people smoking and chronic like

1563
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,099
all of that sounds good to me so as long

1564
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:28,259
as you don't go through naming [ __ ] and

1565
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,900
changing names and taking my lineage

1566
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,880
away from me then I'm fine with whatever

1567
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,440
people do with my seed to be honest man

1568
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,539
straight up

1569
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,380
yeah that's an awesome attitude to have

1570
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:40,260
I think

1571
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,119
so what are some of the plants you want

1572
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:45,119
to work with going forward maybe some of

1573
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:47,880
the females you plan to breed with

1574
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,519
um so I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna be

1575
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:53,940
doing a bunch of TK stuff speaking of

1576
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:56,759
I'm going to be doing some chem work and

1577
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:00,420
some Sour work making some some chem and

1578
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:02,700
sour hybrids uh essentially dude I'm

1579
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,380
just gonna be sticking with what I enjoy

1580
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:07,139
and the same thing that I've done the

1581
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:10,019
whole time which is just a lot of gassy

1582
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:13,798
hybrids tried to bring bring girth from

1583
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:15,659
the camp side of my chem 4 line into a

1584
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:16,798
lot of these these other projects that I

1585
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:20,759
have

1586
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:22,259
basically Kev Sour OG man chem Sour OG

1587
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,480
for me

1588
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,180
it's a tried and tested combo right

1589
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,500
absolutely absolutely well I think

1590
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:30,000
that's where a lot of breeders have gone

1591
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,619
weird where they're all trying to be

1592
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,260
like the next they're trying to make the

1593
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:36,059
wheel over with there's still a bunch of

1594
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,280
hybrids that are really good that could

1595
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:41,579
be made with chem sour and OG different

1596
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,798
OG profiles cab 91 is not the same as

1597
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:45,660
Camp four there's a couple different

1598
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:47,639
Sour Diesel profiles that are really

1599
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:50,219
good like let's [ __ ] see where this

1600
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:52,500
[ __ ] could take us and then introduce

1601
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:56,879
some of this land race stuff that's

1602
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:00,599
gonna throw an entire new plethora of of

1603
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,579
hybrid F1 [ __ ] Offspring out I mean

1604
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:04,260
dude that's where it really we gotta we

1605
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:07,380
gotta work on our end before we're just

1606
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:09,299
like you know let's just [ __ ] it mix and

1607
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,700
match with this garbage from the hills

1608
01:05:09,298 --> 01:05:15,900
of Peru that's been growing at [ __ ]

1609
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:18,960
10 THC for the last 50 years like I get

1610
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,519
it there's there's genetic diversity in

1611
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,019
there that we don't have that could

1612
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:24,298
change ours but let's build ours up

1613
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:26,519
that's make sure our shit's super fire

1614
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:28,259
like I don't know I just feel like it's

1615
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:30,838
all fresh and brand new we haven't even

1616
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:34,380
come close to touching the tip of the

1617
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:37,440
iceberg the actual the actual Beast that

1618
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:39,420
is within our potential with our our

1619
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,760
diversity we have now with our libraries

1620
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:45,059
we have now it's just like unlimited

1621
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,099
potential so I'm just ready to to see

1622
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:49,859
what we could do as far as with our

1623
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:51,900
chems and sours and are our different

1624
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:53,880
hybrid projects because I really feel

1625
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,460
like there's a lot left to untouch

1626
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:59,880
that's untouched

1627
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,980
yeah I would agree so you touched on a

1628
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,420
staple of the show the chem dog which

1629
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,900
one is your favorite

1630
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:10,798
uh Camp four Camp four for sure it's got

1631
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:12,119
this amazing juicy big bud structure

1632
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,699
it's a little slow it's what I don't

1633
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:17,700
like about it it takes about 11.

1634
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:19,558
11 maybe even a uh 12 weeks to finish

1635
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,899
properly and I don't like that at all

1636
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:25,140
it's a little fickle to grow too so

1637
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:27,539
we're already working on on making some

1638
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,058
hybrids that carry that same profile

1639
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:33,660
over but finish a little bit early eight

1640
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:35,880
nine weeks and still have the same that

1641
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:38,519
that taste is [ __ ] so good it's

1642
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:42,298
almost unmatched I absolutely love cam

1643
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:46,440
it's just [ __ ] such a beauty and uh

1644
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:48,119
to have Kim and OG hybrid flavor in sour

1645
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,119
like those

1646
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:53,760
the potential there is everything to me

1647
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:57,358
so that's what I'm after is just working

1648
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,180
these kebs of these OG lines together

1649
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:02,279
so given your experience with the OG is

1650
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:04,379
when you look at your cam plans do you

1651
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,819
see any relationship there or do you

1652
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:08,579
think they're just different

1653
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:12,179
oh there might be there might be but

1654
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:14,760
chems tend to be much laggier and I mean

1655
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:16,679
they they have dude I'm sure it's all

1656
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,720
somewhere tied together somewhere

1657
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:20,519
there's a cousin or a bob or something

1658
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,939
you know but I just

1659
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:25,559
they're just definitely different so I

1660
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,599
mean I could say yeah I I could say

1661
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,579
maybe I could see it because they both

1662
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,980
have a definitely have a gassy profile

1663
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:34,980
like real OG and real Kev have kind of

1664
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,699
this this funk to it but

1665
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,440
um

1666
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:38,759
I don't know it's one of those things

1667
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,519
where I'm just

1668
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,559
does it matter if they're related it

1669
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:44,940
doesn't really I mean if they are they

1670
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,039
are if they're not they're not they're

1671
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,659
both fire as [ __ ] they're not going

1672
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,160
anywhere so

1673
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:52,019
it's one of those things like I don't

1674
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,118
really pay much attention to because it

1675
01:07:52,019 --> 01:07:56,400
doesn't matter either way

1676
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:59,640
yeah no understandable

1677
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,798
so when you consider the OG high and you

1678
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:04,078
think about that kind of commonly

1679
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:06,480
associated terpene profile the fuel

1680
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,519
lemony cushy type of thing

1681
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,679
would you a consider that your favorite

1682
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:12,420
and B do you think that that's part of

1683
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:14,219
the high or do you think that that just

1684
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,020
happens to be the turbine profile

1685
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:17,880
associated with OG Kush and it's more

1686
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,719
like the cannabinoid profile that does

1687
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,020
it

1688
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,939
well our highs how we get high is all

1689
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,100
individual we all have our own

1690
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:29,879
individual cannabinoid systems that they

1691
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,859
react with THC and terpenes and your

1692
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,560
body it's actually terpenes that are

1693
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:37,679
kind of the driving force on how people

1694
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,279
feel when they smoke pot so

1695
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,460
um

1696
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:43,739
I I dude I just loved the way that it

1697
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:46,259
always has tasted gas like that profile

1698
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:48,298
and how there's no ceiling with OG so

1699
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:50,158
like other strains I could smoke and

1700
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:54,778
after a couple weeks I won't get high

1701
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:57,059
anymore like uh Keb Sour OG and cookie

1702
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:59,640
real good cookie crosses they are not

1703
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:02,940
like that I will always get high if I

1704
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,159
smoke them forever I could smoke OG for

1705
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:07,019
30 years straight and I'll get stoned

1706
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:10,139
every [ __ ] time

1707
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:12,719
every time but if I smoke like green

1708
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:15,298
dragon or some [ __ ] random strain

1709
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,920
from somebody like after a couple days I

1710
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:18,778
just won't get high my body will quickly

1711
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,600
quickly adapt to it but there is no

1712
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:23,060
ceiling on OG or cam or sour period I

1713
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,199
don't give a [ __ ] who you are everybody

1714
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,298
agrees with me on that I've talked to

1715
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,858
[ __ ] hundreds of people it always

1716
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:30,899
gets you stoned and that's why it'll

1717
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:32,699
always have its place because

1718
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:35,479
the [ __ ] King

1719
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:35,479
the king

1720
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,500
so what is it do you think that is

1721
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,179
required in Australia for it to have

1722
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,619
that ability because we often hear this

1723
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:45,179
topic brought up

1724
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:46,920
um among guests where they say you know

1725
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,319
like it's just got no ceiling you just

1726
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:52,560
keep getting higher is it just quality

1727
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:53,279
or is it like a certain profile

1728
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,560
um

1729
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,480
I do think it's lineage because it is

1730
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,699
seems to be the same group of plants

1731
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:03,359
it's coming from which is OG's chems and

1732
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:07,259
sours and cookie and hybrids so I mean

1733
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:10,198
it's most people are reacting the same

1734
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:12,719
way to most trades but there are some

1735
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:14,158
people that are off like they're not the

1736
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,079
same and that's where I'm saying we all

1737
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:18,119
have different and no cannabinoid

1738
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:20,340
systems but

1739
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:22,800
a lot of us have similar cannabinoid

1740
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,360
systems that's why we get agree some you

1741
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,400
know oh this gets me really stoked

1742
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:28,439
there's a lot of people that smoke stuff

1743
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,119
that agree on it and there's a handful

1744
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:31,799
of people that don't agree on it and

1745
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:33,779
it's not like they're wrong their bodies

1746
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,579
just don't react the same to it so it's

1747
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:37,559
not you'll hear people talking about oh

1748
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:39,479
this makes me really nervous and freak

1749
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,760
out you know it's like

1750
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:43,559
yeah that's the way you react to it it's

1751
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,739
not it's not the pot that's the way your

1752
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,719
body's reacting do it do I mean you

1753
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:50,639
probably drink [ __ ] wine coolers and

1754
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,198
freak out too or whatever you know what

1755
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,659
I mean like who knows who knows what's

1756
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:58,439
happened happening when you get high but

1757
01:10:54,658 --> 01:11:00,179
uh yeah yeah okay cool well just on a

1758
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:03,178
little personal note before we wrap up

1759
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:04,859
on the OG stuff one of the ogs that I

1760
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:07,140
really really loved admittedly I haven't

1761
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:11,339
tried them all what do you think about

1762
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:14,760
triple X OG from Oregon kid

1763
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:17,279
um I've never smoked it damn oh that

1764
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:21,300
backfired on me no I never smoked it

1765
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:23,460
Oregon kid is a is a OG though yeah he's

1766
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,279
definitely not gonna be girl with

1767
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,380
stickle Fritz so if he's if he's got

1768
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:31,380
some that he's got his name on I'm sure

1769
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:33,359
it's fire he's definitely a a an OG he

1770
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,199
knows what gas is if he knows what dank

1771
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,179
is

1772
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:38,099
I would definitely trust him if somebody

1773
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:39,899
said I got something from Oregon kid I

1774
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,520
would assume it's going to be gas in my

1775
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:44,039
head that's the first thing I think so

1776
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,719
I'm sure it's probably good that

1777
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:48,658
yeah okay

1778
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:51,060
so we've kind of touched on cookies here

1779
01:11:48,658 --> 01:11:53,879
and there and obviously you've done some

1780
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:55,620
cookies cross ogs do you think that's

1781
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,039
one of the better pairings you can do

1782
01:11:55,619 --> 01:12:00,840
with cookies like cross to an ogmail

1783
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:04,859
absolutely absolutely

1784
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,239
I mean dude the the problem with the

1785
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:09,420
cookie cross is

1786
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,879
is they all carry the same marker from

1787
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:15,539
the first cookie which is an unstable

1788
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:18,179
marker like it was made with CPK

1789
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:23,279
that was an unfinished project the CPK

1790
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:25,739
went S1 it either pollinated the Derm or

1791
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:27,179
[ __ ] salted in their Garden I don't

1792
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:29,759
know what it followed it but there was

1793
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:32,579
never a male to female that made Girl

1794
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:35,100
Scout cookies it wasn't like that it was

1795
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:37,619
an accidental pollination so they

1796
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:39,480
started selling packs of that plant that

1797
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:42,899
they grew out from that accidental

1798
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:46,319
pollination and that plant had the same

1799
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:48,359
marker that its mama daddy had where it

1800
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:50,880
would throw us once so every pack that

1801
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:52,920
comes out has a few seeds in it

1802
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,199
everybody in the bay was buying cookies

1803
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,579
so there was a seat here see there

1804
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:59,279
people started planting that's where you

1805
01:12:56,579 --> 01:13:02,698
got ogkb and forum and these other

1806
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,559
cookie hybrids that are they're just

1807
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:06,000
they're just are where people started

1808
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,620
making all the cookie hybrids that's

1809
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,140
where it was coming from was from the S

1810
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:12,658
Wood lineage that was coming straight

1811
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,699
out of their their Garden they kept S1

1812
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:16,979
he got every everybody who touches that

1813
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:19,919
cut it'll still and it carries through

1814
01:13:16,979 --> 01:13:21,718
into all the Hybrids so nothing that has

1815
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,100
cookies in it is going to be like super

1816
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:25,079
stable I've heard people online

1817
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:27,239
complaining they're like

1818
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:30,000
you know a lot of these European

1819
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:32,479
breeders have way more stable gear and

1820
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,460
I'm like yeah the [ __ ] is [ __ ] 12

1821
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:38,639
like if you want to grow [ __ ] dog

1822
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:41,340
[ __ ] weed you grow it dude we're growing

1823
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:46,619
[ __ ] Elite hybrids and

1824
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:48,960
cookies OG sour chem that [ __ ] has a g

1825
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,640
marker that says I want to

1826
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,140
self-reproduce if you're not gonna give

1827
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,060
me pollen that's what a plant's doing

1828
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,579
the whole time it's growing as a bud

1829
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:58,140
swelling the whole type of 12 12. it's

1830
01:13:56,579 --> 01:14:00,539
just waiting for pollen

1831
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,880
the second you touch it with pollen it

1832
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:04,439
doesn't grow like it used to but plants

1833
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,600
that make big ass buds they don't make

1834
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:09,178
big buds after they're pollinated they

1835
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,620
focus all their energy on making seed so

1836
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:12,658
that's what that is as that thing is

1837
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:14,819
swelling it's just putting pistols

1838
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:17,639
further and further away as from its

1839
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:19,799
mass essentially making a larger surface

1840
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,900
area to potentially collect a piece of

1841
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,300
pollen so

1842
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:25,920
you know I don't know at some point at

1843
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,600
some point people got to realize there

1844
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,920
was never a bale of people that made

1845
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,659
cookies that's why they never sold

1846
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,640
cookie seeds and then when they finally

1847
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:34,738
did sell seeds

1848
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,600
they ripped everybody [ __ ] ripped

1849
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:39,718
everybody off and sold the London pound

1850
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:42,120
cake did candy paid and all these seeds

1851
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:44,158
that were just Herbie trash it's it's

1852
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:46,019
the biggest stickle Fritz that's ever

1853
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:50,039
happened in the wheat Industries history

1854
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:52,620
it's [ __ ] crazy crazy but

1855
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:54,658
the so I'm not denying the fact that

1856
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:57,059
they had access to one of the best

1857
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:59,399
tasting Cuts I've ever [ __ ] with

1858
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:01,500
whatever that was that did the

1859
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:03,658
self-pollination in their Garden they

1860
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,600
they grew it out it they Girl Scout

1861
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:08,759
cookies and that [ __ ] tastes amazing but

1862
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,940
it does inherently have a problem where

1863
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:13,860
it wants to S1 and it did S1 constantly

1864
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:15,059
and that's where a lot of that [ __ ] came

1865
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:18,238
from and that's where a lot of the

1866
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:20,280
cookie Offspring uh the cookie hybrid

1867
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:23,279
Offspring comes from is from that that's

1868
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:25,439
where almost 99 of it came from was

1869
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:29,840
their S1 ink packs that they were

1870
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:32,759
selling to people so it's whatever

1871
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:35,159
so do you think that they'll ever have

1872
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:38,100
to kind of face the music for the candy

1873
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:39,379
lines they just did I feel like they did

1874
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,239
just now

1875
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:43,859
[ __ ] could sell [ __ ] couldn't sell a

1876
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:46,198
pack of seeds right now if he wanted to

1877
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:48,779
so I think people pretty much got the

1878
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:51,059
hit right now what just happened I mean

1879
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:51,920
that was like I said that was stickle

1880
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,420
Fritz

1881
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,279
it is what it is I'm not gonna sit here

1882
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,039
and talk numbers or anything but they

1883
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,619
sold 500 packs of seeds a couple

1884
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:05,100
thousand packs of seeds at 500 a piece

1885
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:07,800
you do the [ __ ] math and hardly

1886
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:09,179
anybody got good Offspring most of the

1887
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,940
people couldn't even get the seeds to

1888
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:14,158
pop they would even pop if they did pop

1889
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:17,339
they were growing all mutant in trash

1890
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:18,960
and it's like it's just such a stickle

1891
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,340
fridge I just can't even believe that it

1892
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,819
even happened and that they would even

1893
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:26,400
have any body supporting them at all

1894
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:27,139
yeah I figured that'd be a full hundred

1895
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:29,579
percent

1896
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:33,480
blacklisting there's still people that

1897
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:35,579
support them so it's whatever but like I

1898
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:37,678
said time with everything so you can't

1899
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:40,380
beat time that's why [ __ ] this appeared

1900
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,179
[ __ ] and burger claimed Burger clay

1901
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:44,520
jigga's account just got deleted from

1902
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:46,079
Instagram so [ __ ] make a new one and

1903
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,940
get a shout out from your boy burner

1904
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:49,979
you'll have 50 000 followers in [ __ ]

1905
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:51,960
two weeks but you don't you don't want

1906
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:53,339
to come face the music you don't want to

1907
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,840
see what people are going to say to you

1908
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,000
you don't want to [ __ ] face the

1909
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,039
reality that you just stole a couple

1910
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,039
billion dollars from your customer base

1911
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,899
that's exactly what happened so just

1912
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:05,939
like I said it's never happened in the

1913
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,619
history of the marijuana industry

1914
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:10,619
something like this

1915
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:12,658
someone with such a huge name that was

1916
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:14,698
held in such a high regard by a lot of

1917
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:16,859
people not everybody

1918
01:17:14,698 --> 01:17:20,339
but a lot of people did think that they

1919
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:22,079
had good potential to drop good seed and

1920
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,659
then it was just the absolute worst seat

1921
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:27,179
drop of all time never has there been a

1922
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:29,939
worse he drop from anyone small company

1923
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:33,719
or big company period

1924
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:36,059
interesting so do you think that we'll

1925
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:37,560
see them again we're hearing whispers in

1926
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,440
the wings of the community that Jay

1927
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:43,020
Beezy is locked into doing more projects

1928
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:46,079
for them oh jbz works with them for sure

1929
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:49,980
and they might release stuff under jbz

1930
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:51,960
but you'll never see [ __ ] posting his

1931
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:54,059
little homemade colorful packs again

1932
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,739
remember how he made I mean if you go I

1933
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:57,780
mean you go back and look at how this

1934
01:17:55,738 --> 01:18:00,539
all happened this was all just a huge

1935
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:04,079
stickle for its grab so but you'll never

1936
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:06,960
see [ __ ] talking about his female hunts

1937
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,880
and all these [ __ ] F1 race car and

1938
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,060
all this [ __ ] dude the videos are just a

1939
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,219
joke man like the defenio they're just

1940
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,380
so fake dude they're all so fake burners

1941
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:19,260
never bred anything Burger doesn't know

1942
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:20,940
anything about breeding cannabis [ __ ]

1943
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:23,940
doesn't know anything about breeding

1944
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:25,799
cannabis like I'm a young breeder I have

1945
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:28,139
a ton of [ __ ] to learn about breeding

1946
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,300
cannabis and I literally have forgotten

1947
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:32,159
more about breeding cannabis than those

1948
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,800
two dudes together have ever learned

1949
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:38,399
they [ __ ] literally know nothing

1950
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,140
about breeding and it's so crazy like a

1951
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:43,319
great example

1952
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:44,699
is the whole F1 video on YouTube and I

1953
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:46,259
hate to go in on these guys right now

1954
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:47,719
but I just feel like this is this is a

1955
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,340
perfect time since you asked about it

1956
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:52,619
there's a video where they're talking

1957
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:55,199
about what makes cookies

1958
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:56,760
and anybody who watches it can see right

1959
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:58,198
through this if you have any common

1960
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,380
sense at all

1961
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:03,419
you could tell right away what happened

1962
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:06,900
they were around people that said the

1963
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:09,539
the word F1 and they didn't know what

1964
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:14,039
that was they didn't understand what an

1965
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:16,819
F1 was so they said that F1 was F1 race

1966
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:19,140
car that made uh

1967
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:20,880
as he's stumbling all over his words

1968
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:23,039
because he has no [ __ ] clue what he's

1969
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,260
talking about he can't just tell you

1970
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,658
what made cookies like you asked me

1971
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:31,079
right now what made

1972
01:19:27,658 --> 01:19:34,379
what made me out I took raw and I dusted

1973
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:38,158
it with the pcs1 stud what is raw raw is

1974
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:41,219
Fire OG dusted by Scott's OG male

1975
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:44,279
and what's pcs one Wi-Fi 3 dusted by

1976
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:46,380
Scotts OG dusted by casparoji

1977
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:48,960
I can tell you right now any project

1978
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,060
that I've done and it takes me two

1979
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,340
seconds to tell you what I did

1980
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:54,900
if anybody that if you ask them if you

1981
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,779
ask them an artist question how did you

1982
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:59,939
make this and they go

1983
01:19:56,779 --> 01:20:02,099
[Music]

1984
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:04,859
you're [ __ ] full of [ __ ] you're a

1985
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:06,600
[ __ ] liar you're a liar and it's sad

1986
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:08,639
that we've even come this far with such

1987
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,039
an important plan and we still had

1988
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:13,619
people around us like that that were

1989
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,238
just willing to just lie just willing to

1990
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:18,059
steal and that's so much that's why I'm

1991
01:20:15,238 --> 01:20:19,738
saying if you enjoy this industry and

1992
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:22,139
you just don't lie and steal from people

1993
01:20:19,738 --> 01:20:23,519
you'll be in the top 20 right out the

1994
01:20:22,139 --> 01:20:25,560
gate because that's what everybody's out

1995
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,120
here doing they're all just bullshitting

1996
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,239
each other and lying to each other it's

1997
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,500
[ __ ] so great it's like this one big

1998
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:34,319
grab to try to get in each other's

1999
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,340
Pockets but that that team and that

2000
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:37,619
story

2001
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:40,020
it will go down in history as the

2002
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:42,840
biggest money money snatch in all of

2003
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:47,100
cannabis history hands down the worst

2004
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:48,539
seed offspring of all time and uh they

2005
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,340
just had such a huge name and everybody

2006
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:52,560
expected so much more

2007
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:54,539
it's [ __ ] is what it is it's crazy

2008
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,060
that no I don't think they'll ever be

2009
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:59,939
back I know jbz will cover them but jbz

2010
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:02,400
has his own fan base so people will

2011
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:03,178
people will still they'll still make

2012
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:05,819
money

2013
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:08,699
but they sell they sell [ __ ] toasters

2014
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:11,158
with cookies on it and backpacks made in

2015
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:12,599
Taiwan and [ __ ] like they've they sell

2016
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:15,779
everything dude they're always going to

2017
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:18,060
make money so it wasn't about money it

2018
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:20,460
was about Tegrity and they don't got no

2019
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:23,480
tequery

2020
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:26,579
I love you for referencing that so

2021
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:27,959
interestingly enough I noticed that you

2022
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:29,939
haven't done as far as I know you

2023
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:32,399
haven't done any crosses with sherbet or

2024
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:34,198
gelato do you ever plan to and as a

2025
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,658
follow-up do you think

2026
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:38,219
um shabinski made the right call by kind

2027
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,719
of distancing himself from the cookie

2028
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:40,980
fam a while ago

2029
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:43,139
oh

2030
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:44,879
oh you know

2031
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:47,039
story he definitely seems like an

2032
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,980
outsider to me just a like a rich dude

2033
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,779
that just has connections and stuff he

2034
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:53,459
very well may have made those strains

2035
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:55,380
and if he did congratulations they've

2036
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:58,380
had a huge impact for sure a bunch of

2037
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,460
people enjoy them he's not by flavor of

2038
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,619
person

2039
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:04,439
he's kind of what I call I really feel

2040
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:07,260
like there's two really

2041
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:08,519
there's two really strong personality

2042
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,520
types that are in this marijuana

2043
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:13,860
industry right now one of them is what I

2044
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,199
would call the regulars and then one of

2045
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:19,559
them is called the Hollywoods and the

2046
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:21,419
regulars are just people selling [ __ ]

2047
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,639
dope and selling Edibles and whatever

2048
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,380
you know we're just out here working and

2049
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:27,359
then there's the Hollywoods that are all

2050
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:29,039
about the magazines and all about the

2051
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,799
interviews and all about the pictures

2052
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:34,500
and all about the let me get my product

2053
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,420
in this what has he got his [ __ ] weed

2054
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,520
does he sell his weed in like some

2055
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:40,260
[ __ ] super rich white people store

2056
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,639
what is it I can't remember what it was

2057
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:44,639
it was like

2058
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:46,560
solid Widow Louis Vuitton store so I

2059
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:48,480
can't remember

2060
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,179
a ton but I don't know what it is he's

2061
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,819
got his weed in some [ __ ] he's like

2062
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:56,158
all fancy pantsy type guy and I that's

2063
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:57,899
just not my style like all those people

2064
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:59,519
that he works with or people that were

2065
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:02,039
not cool with weed

2066
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:05,159
you know 10 years ago five years ago

2067
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:07,380
even so it's just a money thing

2068
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:10,679
um a lot of people are gonna be like

2069
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:12,239
that and I don't think that he'll ever

2070
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:14,639
go anywhere because he's a hustling

2071
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,899
[ __ ] and real Hustlers they

2072
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,480
don't they don't give a [ __ ] about

2073
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:21,000
anything else they just grind so I have

2074
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:23,039
a ton of respect for him in that aspect

2075
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,760
he's gonna grind it till the wheels fall

2076
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:29,460
off and uh I don't have anything to say

2077
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:31,800
outside of that I mean he is he is who

2078
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:35,100

uh crosses with his stuff not that I

2080
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:39,480
have plans two at least I mean if

2081
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,239
something tastes really fire and it

2082
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:43,979
breeds true I'll use it in my project I

2083
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:46,198
don't have some like

2084
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:48,299
fake made up [ __ ] in my head where I'm

2085
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:50,339
not gonna abuse your [ __ ] because you

2086
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,139
know whatever like I don't like exactly

2087
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,719
who you are as a person that's [ __ ]

2088
01:23:52,139 --> 01:23:56,579
dope I just I didn't have any plans on

2089
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,960
using any of his stuff that's for sure

2090
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:01,198
but uh

2091
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,520
yeah dude he just is two years man

2092
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:04,619
there's just a bunch of people with

2093
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,600
different personalities and I have a

2094
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:07,859
real strong personality type too so

2095
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:11,100
there's a lot of people that don't like

2096
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:12,420
me just the same so I'm not I'm not too

2097
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,620
stressing on it it's the way the game

2098
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,539
goes

2099
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:18,658
and would you ever consider breeding

2100
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:21,179
with gelato or sherbet oh yeah I mean if

2101
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:23,339
it was if I got something if I had a cut

2102
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:25,679
and I grew it out and the weed was fire

2103
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:28,440
and then that cut bred true I wouldn't

2104
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,020
be afraid to use it in projects so to

2105
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:33,238
answer your question it's not it's not a

2106
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:34,860
yes or a no like it's just whatever if

2107
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:36,718
it was something that I came across that

2108
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:39,179
tasted fire yeah

2109
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,679
that's what anybody's [ __ ] you know

2110
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:42,179

2111
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:44,579

would have dude like everything dude

2129
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:22,319
that we never thought we could ever ever

2130
01:25:19,738 --> 01:25:23,698
touch we get because of this [ __ ]

2131
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:26,158
plan so

2132
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:28,379

am to it see how thankful I am for the

2134
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:34,619
people who support PCS like all of it is

2135

2136
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:41,158
just riding it right that wave brother

2137
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:42,119
love it love it so I wanted to ask you

2138
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:43,859
because I think you'll be able to answer

2139
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:45,658
better than any of my previous guests

2140
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:47,219
really could and it's a bit more of a

2141
01:25:45,658 --> 01:25:50,158
lightweight topic anyway which I think

2142
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:52,260
will slide in nicely here have you tried

2143
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,698
slash what's your opinions on that

2144
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:58,739
famous Oregon cut Jaeger

2145
01:25:55,698 --> 01:26:00,299
ah Jaeger it's funny I just got in

2146
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:01,919
trouble online the other day because I

2147
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,920
said on someone's post I thought it was

2148
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,779
[ __ ] trash it's just one of those

2149
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:08,340
cuts that you either like it or you

2150
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:11,279
don't I don't like it at all I don't

2151
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:13,560
like licorice Terps I don't like it does

2152
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,539
well outside and Oregon has a really

2153
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:18,600
rough weather climate for growing pot

2154
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:20,340
outside so it tends to be any cut that

2155
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,380
shows up that does well outside here

2156
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,940
everybody goes bananas for it because

2157
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,859
they're like Yay something that's not

2158
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:29,579
going to turn into [ __ ] complete [ __ ]

2159
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:32,339
by September so it's like

2160
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:33,960
I get it I'm not oblivious to it if

2161
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:36,060
you're an outdoor farmer in Oregon try

2162
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,619
to eat [ __ ] grow all the Jager you

2163
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:40,980
can it's not something that I would ever

2164
01:26:37,619 --> 01:26:42,300
use in my projects or grow inside I

2165
01:26:40,979 --> 01:26:43,859
would never that's how I could tell a

2166
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:47,100
straight is good or not would you grow

2167
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:49,500
it inside would you grow it inside for

2168
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:53,280
your head stash like no you're not

2169
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:55,619
growing [ __ ] Jager inside so it's

2170
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,738
just it's one of those things and some

2171
01:26:55,619 --> 01:27:00,899
people like it though so yeah yeah okay

2172
01:26:58,738 --> 01:27:03,238
so but there's some people that there's

2173
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:05,219
some people that like to get [ __ ]

2174
01:27:03,238 --> 01:27:06,658
chicks to take shits on him and kick

2175
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:09,179
them in the balls or they can't have an

2176
01:27:06,658 --> 01:27:11,460
orgasm so people are [ __ ] weird dude

2177
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:13,139
like not everybody's the same if a chick

2178
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,359
took a [ __ ] on me I'd punch her in the

2179
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:17,340
[ __ ] throat right in her T3 vertebrae

2180
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,259
and I'd snap that bitch's [ __ ] your

2181
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:21,239
neck would be [ __ ] lady your neck is

2182
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,860
[ __ ] the next place you walk is gonna

2183
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:24,658
need a [ __ ] wheelchair ramp because

2184
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:27,738
you're gonna be paralyzed that's what

2185
01:27:24,658 --> 01:27:30,839

2186
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:32,819

2187
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,179
other notable Oregon ones have you had

2188
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:38,639
any experience with the J1

2189
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:41,460
ah no no no all right it's a good one I

2190
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:44,039
like it anyway what about blue Magoo

2191
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:46,020
uh yeah I've smoked it I've seen some

2192
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:47,698
decent examples of it not not anything

2193
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:51,360
to super right home about but definitely

2194
01:27:47,698 --> 01:27:52,879
not it not as uh not as repulsive as

2195
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,198
Jager

2196
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,000
all right and then my final little one

2197
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,559
on my Oregon List have you ever seen

2198
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,079
Pink Champagne

2199
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:04,020
oh absolutely oh I've seen the peak

2200
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:07,019
definitely and it's got a really cool

2201
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:10,739
profile that is champagne when you open

2202
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:15,780
up a bag of a PC that's exactly what you

2203
01:28:10,738 --> 01:28:19,619
smell is a a soft pink rose champagne

2204
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:22,139
smell it's [ __ ] so smooth super cool

2205
01:28:19,619 --> 01:28:24,840
to smell something that's like

2206
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:27,779
what I that's the uh I word I use words

2207
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,940
like exotic for that profile it's kind

2208
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:33,119
of fruity but it's not like a fruit that

2209
01:28:29,939 --> 01:28:34,678
you're used to smelling and uh yeah I

2210
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,319
absolutely like that straight I don't

2211
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:39,899
smoke a lot of other people's flowers so

2212
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:41,880
you know unless I see it in extracts I

2213
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:43,920
don't I don't smoke it but I have ran

2214
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,020
across it in my time here and it is very

2215
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,119
[ __ ] good for sure if it's grown

2216
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:50,100
right obviously like anything else

2217
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:51,300
yeah I love it it's definitely one of my

2218
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,980
favorite ones

2219
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:54,900
um so you're in Oregon where there's

2220
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:57,119
actually quite a good number of notable

2221
01:28:54,899 --> 01:29:00,198
breeders around the area who are some of

2222
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:05,698
the ones whose works you Vibe with

2223
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:07,559
uh I've used archives uh Casper OG to

2224
01:29:05,698 --> 01:29:10,859
build out my stud

2225
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:13,080
and uh to help build out my stud he was

2226
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:15,658
one of the three pieces

2227
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:18,600
um he makes a lot of good crosses that a

2228
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:21,059
lot of people enjoy I don't grow like I

2229
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:25,620
said I stopped years ago stopped growing

2230
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:28,260
other people's seeds so I never uh

2231
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:31,139
grow like any of his new projects but

2232
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:35,280
he's from here uh

2233
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:38,400
there's a lot of there's a lot of

2234
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:41,698
I don't know man it's I don't really

2235
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:44,698
grow people's seeds after

2236
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:47,219
I decided to make the switch when I

2237
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:51,000
first got to really good clothes I

2238
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:53,698
focused heavily on production of my

2239
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,219
Elite clones and training and collecting

2240
01:29:53,698 --> 01:30:00,299
and building my stable

2241
01:29:56,219 --> 01:30:03,719
and uh I just didn't grow a lot of seed

2242
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:05,880
outside of my own seed projects so it's

2243
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:08,039
hard for me to just sign up for someone

2244
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,539
and be like yo this guy is the guy who's

2245
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:11,760
doing good up here it's like I don't

2246
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:13,380
know and I don't like I told you earlier

2247
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,420
I don't pay a lot of attention to other

2248
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,920
people's projects how they turn out if

2249
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:19,920
they're good or bad I kind of just stay

2250
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:22,260
in my own lane I'm hyper focused on my

2251
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,899
own projects and my own stuff and my own

2252
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:27,539
journey and that's pretty much the only

2253
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:29,279
way I could get it all done you know

2254
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:31,738
it's just to not give a [ __ ] about what

2255
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:33,539
other people are up to so it's nothing

2256
01:30:31,738 --> 01:30:36,000
personal at all if someone brings

2257
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:39,899
something to my attention I I definitely

2258
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,238
will check it out I just it it's just

2259
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:43,979
one of those things that I decided to do

2260
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:46,500
a while ago and it's been definitely

2261
01:30:43,979 --> 01:30:49,198
good for being for my energy and my time

2262
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:51,899
to not get all involved in everybody's

2263
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:54,000
anything you know I just don't and just

2264
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:55,439
stay [ __ ] focused on PCS or what

2265
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,238
we're doing so

2266
01:30:55,439 --> 01:31:00,238
and I'll tell you why it's because I

2267
01:30:57,238 --> 01:31:02,519
spent many years not many years spinny

2268
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,678
wheels and not focused and not hustling

2269
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,560
and being all caught up in everybody's

2270
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:09,779
job on here and caught up in my own

2271
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:11,520
drama and like what the [ __ ] dude [ __ ]

2272
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:13,738
these people like nobody here gives a

2273
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,060
[ __ ] about you if your page is shut down

2274
01:31:13,738 --> 01:31:17,399
tomorrow do you think people are gonna

2275
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:19,320
lose sleep nobody's gonna give a [ __ ]

2276
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:21,719
like you're just gonna be gone like a

2277
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:25,139
fart in the wind so you need to focus

2278
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:27,719
and make sure that you you take

2279
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:29,520
advantage of your opportunities and and

2280
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:32,340
everybody's life you're gonna have left

2281
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,920
and right turns and you can look back at

2282
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:38,100
your life right now all of you listening

2283
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,840
and you could go man I went left right

2284
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:41,100
there and I should have went right right

2285
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,500
there

2286
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,760
and everybody could see a spot where

2287
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,880
they went left or they should have went

2288
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,800
right and I just want to minimize those

2289
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:53,719
as much as possible you know what I'm

2290
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:53,719
saying for myself so

2291
01:31:54,658 --> 01:32:00,779
yeah understandable frustration I get it

2292
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,520
so I've noticed this trend right where

2293
01:32:00,779 --> 01:32:04,500
it's like it's not enough for like the

2294
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,820
meme pages to try to be funny or

2295
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,859
whatever like they've got to have their

2296
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:09,599
own little Canada brand on the side and

2297
01:32:07,859 --> 01:32:12,000
I have a feeling this is kind of what

2298
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,860
leads to their inevitable downfall

2299
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,939
what do you think about the meme pages

2300
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:16,380
in the community do you think they

2301
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:18,299
should just steer clear of trying to

2302
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:21,840
start their own business like our friend

2303
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:23,100
Kelly Terps Factory

2304
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,060
ah

2305
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,860
I still are going to do whatever we

2306
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:29,580
gonna do I really don't care what people

2307
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:31,679
do with their business lives I like I'm

2308
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:34,559
not too stressing on it I like I said

2309
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:37,980
earlier time separates all of us So

2310
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:40,560
eventually time sorts all digs out I've

2311
01:32:37,979 --> 01:32:42,599
seen a hundred Brands come and go you

2312
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,000
know over the past five six years brands

2313
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,699
that were so fast out of the gate that

2314
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,579
were big talkers and we're this and that

2315
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:52,079
and now they're just non-existent so I'm

2316
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:53,519
not stressing on it dude like if

2317
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:56,158
somebody wants to make [ __ ] brand

2318
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,860
make a brand like all power to you I

2319
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:01,979
wish everybody well uh

2320
01:32:58,859 --> 01:33:03,000
I don't think that most people are doing

2321
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:05,519
it right

2322
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,619
so that's why I feel like I'm just so

2323
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,500
comfortable with time because I just

2324
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:11,760
know that time works fast so if you're

2325
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,380
not doing it right you're not gonna

2326
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,079
you're not gonna stick around very long

2327
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:18,119
and you really can't count

2328
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,279
hundreds of companies that have just

2329
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:22,139
cuddly gone in the last five years so

2330
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:24,479
the reason why is because they weren't

2331
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:25,560
met for it you go on Craigslist right

2332
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,158
now

2333
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:31,139
and find in any city in the country you

2334
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:34,500
can find garden equipment for sale like

2335
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:36,060
weed growing equipment because this [ __ ]

2336
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,738
ain't for everybody

2337
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:39,840
a bunch of people think they want to

2338
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:43,859
come and do it and then all of a sudden

2339
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:47,100
it's not you know it's not the [ __ ]

2340
01:33:43,859 --> 01:33:49,259
Grand Vision that they thought

2341
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,480
oh [ __ ] I actually have to mop floors

2342
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:53,579
most of the time being a grower is

2343
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:54,839
actually being a [ __ ] janitor I

2344
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:57,899
pretty much feel like a [ __ ]

2345
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:59,520
custodian like that's what it is I mean

2346
01:33:57,899 --> 01:34:02,399
just just a heads up for all you young

2347
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,739
Growers get a [ __ ] mop get to know

2348
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:06,359
the broom give the broom a name because

2349
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:09,000
you should be dancing with that [ __ ]

2350
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:12,179
every day it's [ __ ] crazy how how

2351
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,560
it's uh total title shift in your brain

2352
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:15,920
from what you thought you were going to

2353
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:19,380
be doing to what you're actually doing

2354
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,600
[ __ ] funny yeah I can relate to that

2355
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,300
one a lot

2356
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:25,760
so just to kind of wrap up this last

2357
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:28,380
little section we've been talking about

2358
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,179
Matt Wright has put forward this joke

2359
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:33,060
but I I reckon it would be great right

2360
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:34,560
where we have like a WWF ring at like

2361
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:36,360
the Cannabis cups and people can like

2362
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,659
settle settle their beef in that would

2363
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:44,279
you sign up for it absolutely

2364
01:34:39,658 --> 01:34:46,379
absolutely you find you no WWF though we

2365
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:48,779
gotta we gotta put some gloves on or let

2366
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:50,460
me actually smack some of these kids put

2367
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:53,579
geese on them and we could actually do

2368
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:55,980
some some Jujitsu or something but no

2369
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:59,658
WWF as long as as long as I really get

2370
01:34:55,979 --> 01:35:02,339
to [ __ ] show them my intention

2371
01:34:59,658 --> 01:35:04,319
I love it and you just segued perfectly

2372
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:06,719
into the next question whereby I was

2373
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,880
gonna say how do you think Jiu Jitsu

2374
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:10,380
plays into the Cannabis lifestyle

2375
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,480
because we see that they're so heavily

2376
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,100
intertwined in their usage among the

2377
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:15,899
practitioners of both what do you think

2378
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:17,100
it's about the both that draw people to

2379
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:19,319
both of them

2380
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,840
uh they well the first thing is probably

2381
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:24,179
the healing aspects of cannabis uh

2382
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:26,460
spiritually and mentally there really

2383
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:29,039
are cleansers

2384
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:30,960
um you could let a lot of [ __ ] go just

2385
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:32,960
by having a good session you know a

2386
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,579
really good herb session or dab session

2387
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,960
you feel different when it's done if

2388
01:35:35,579 --> 01:35:40,380
it's done the right way a lot of people

2389
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,939
just abuse marijuana and abuse extracts

2390
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:44,100
they don't really

2391
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:47,698
truly use it as the medicine that has

2392
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,780
been gifted to us as jiu jitu players I

2393
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:52,259
find

2394
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:54,238
tend to be Cruisers like a lot of Jiu

2395
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:56,520
Jitsu guys are just these like Cruiser

2396
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:59,939
types right the surfer mentality the

2397
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,619
[ __ ] the the [ __ ] the cruise

2398
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:04,138
through lifetime man and that's where

2399
01:36:01,618 --> 01:36:06,599
pot is like it always finds the Cruisers

2400
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:08,940
man it's a cruiser drug it feels good it

2401
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,880
makes food better makes movies better

2402
01:36:08,939 --> 01:36:14,759
makes sex better it makes Jiu Jitsu

2403
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,560
better it makes things better it's just

2404
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,300
the way that it is and this way it'll

2405
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,699
always be that's why I thought it was

2406
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:22,980
funny that pot was so [ __ ] outlawed

2407
01:36:20,698 --> 01:36:25,079
for so long that like they finally

2408
01:36:22,979 --> 01:36:27,238
realized we're never not gonna smoke

2409
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:29,519
this drug like you can keep it illegal

2410
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:31,259
forever we don't give a [ __ ] so they're

2411
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,880
like we better legalize this and make

2412
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:34,760
money off of it the other way it's like

2413
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:38,039
yeah you should probably do that because

2414
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,360
we love pot like people love pot if

2415
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:41,698
they're always Gonna Love pot because

2416
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:43,679
it's [ __ ] amazing so it's definitely

2417
01:36:41,698 --> 01:36:48,000
not just Jiu Jitsu if you go to the NBA

2418
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:51,000
like almost [ __ ] like easily half the

2419
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,100
NBA smokes spot NFL players a bunch of

2420
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,500
them would love to smoke pot for healing

2421
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,940
their bodies and instead of taking pills

2422
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,399
and [ __ ] like

2423
01:36:56,939 --> 01:37:01,559
it's not just Jiu Jitsu it's just

2424
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:03,299
[ __ ] it's the way it is and if we

2425
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,739
really dove into it we would quickly

2426
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,860
find out that a bunch of our school

2427
01:37:04,738 --> 01:37:09,718
teachers and a bunch of our bankers and

2428
01:37:07,859 --> 01:37:13,139
a bunch of like pot is just really

2429
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:15,300
pretty [ __ ] prevalent in our in our

2430
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:17,940
society it's just one of those things I

2431
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:21,000
was kind of not talked about as much and

2432
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:22,979
alcohol was really promoted and people

2433
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,198
were kind of just quiet about it about

2434
01:37:22,979 --> 01:37:27,779
the clock part but they were definitely

2435
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:31,259
doing it that's for sure

2436
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:32,819
yeah definitely definitely so you kind

2437
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:34,980
of touched on how there are some sports

2438
01:37:32,819 --> 01:37:36,238
where the players would benefit from

2439
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:38,638
being able to use it but currently

2440
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:40,678
aren't allowed what do you think will be

2441
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:42,480
some of the first sports to open it up

2442
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:47,219
and do you think UFC might be one of

2443
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:49,319
them uh yeah the UFC uh the NFL and the

2444
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:51,359
NBA I can all see in the next few years

2445
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:53,698
just releasing as the federal

2446
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:54,899
government's bleeding back in different

2447
01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:57,299
states are leaning back into

2448
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:59,039
legalization like it's only a matter of

2449
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,659
time dude we never thought that we would

2450
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:02,519
see this when we were kids if you told

2451
01:38:00,658 --> 01:38:04,738
me hey man one day you'll be able to

2452
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,360
just walk in stores and buy pot and walk

2453
01:38:04,738 --> 01:38:07,678
two blocks up the street and walk in a

2454
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:10,319
different store and buy a pot I'd be

2455
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:11,699
like you're [ __ ] crazy but that's

2456
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:14,340
where we're at so it's definitely

2457
01:38:11,698 --> 01:38:17,279
changing it uh

2458
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:19,500
it's man it's changing pretty crazy how

2459
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:21,238
fast it's changing but we'll see I I

2460
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:23,880
don't think uh I don't think we're gonna

2461
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:27,299
see anything but progression so that's

2462
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:30,359
part of progression is is releasing

2463
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:32,400
people from its clutches of of uh

2464
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:33,839
illegality you know it's pretty [ __ ]

2465
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:35,879
if you have a job and you still have to

2466
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,319
piss in a cup and all you want to do is

2467
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,340
smoke a little bit of pot and you can't

2468
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:40,979
because you don't want to lose your

2469
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:43,560
[ __ ] job that pays you 75 000 a year

2470
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:45,479
because God forbid if you had to go make

2471
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,280
sixty thousand a year it's like you're

2472
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:49,138
already struggling you know it's like

2473
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:50,759
they've got everybody by the balls dude

2474
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:53,100
it's really weird this whole [ __ ]

2475
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:55,020
this whole story how it's getting played

2476
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:58,079
out is [ __ ] weird

2477
01:38:55,020 --> 01:39:00,239
yeah I agree it's uh it's kind of

2478
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:01,859
ludicrous in a sense and you touched on

2479
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:04,019
how you know things are always changing

2480
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:05,519
so let's segue back into some Australian

2481
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,500
stuff things are always changing

2482
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,480
especially kind of the hottest strain of

2483
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,639
the month what do you think is going to

2484
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:13,678
be the next big flavor profile to take

2485
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:16,920
over the scene

2486
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:19,739
uh I hate to do my own horde but my pcs2

2487
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:24,060
crosses are really gonna to light up

2488
01:39:19,738 --> 01:39:27,178
2020 with the Kev and the OG profiles

2489
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:31,500
coming through and then uh hybrid

2490
01:39:27,179 --> 01:39:35,399
Offspring like everyone's gonna find

2491
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:37,439
basically OG Kent Kevo G like you're

2492
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:39,479
gonna find profiles that are the best of

2493
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:43,859
both worlds like

2494
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:46,319
you know karma's sour projects I'm sure

2495
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:48,599
he's gonna do some more sour stuff but

2496
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,698
everybody's been loving his sour

2497
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:53,280
projects I've seen so many people post

2498
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:55,859
about his sour projects so I'm sure

2499
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:58,259
carba Karma and the boys will come out

2500
01:39:55,859 --> 01:40:02,158
with something dope for 2020 with that

2501
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:04,079
sour some some Cross or maybe a

2502
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:05,460
maybe just do some more line work on

2503
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:07,198
what they already have I don't know but

2504
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:09,600
I know a bunch of people have fallen in

2505
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:11,939
love with that shirt so

2506
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,860
yeah you you beat me to my next question

2507
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:15,118
which was going to say that we I can say

2508
01:40:13,859 --> 01:40:17,819
that you've started to make some new

2509
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:19,679
crosses with the pcs2 now

2510
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:21,059
tell us a little bit about how that

2511
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:25,340
one's a bit different from the number

2512
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:25,340
one and what was its Genesis story

2513
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:31,979
so basically I just took my pcs1 mail

2514
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:34,439
and I dusted uh probably 30 different

2515
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:38,698
cuts 25 different cuts

2516
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:40,799
oh I was just looking for you know good

2517
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:42,899
seed stock I still have a bunch of those

2518
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:45,900
crosses but one of the first ones I went

2519
01:40:42,899 --> 01:40:48,839
through was the kev4 that was dusted by

2520
01:40:45,899 --> 01:40:51,658
the pcs one and we found

2521
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:54,179
so basically what made me decide to use

2522
01:40:51,658 --> 01:40:55,439
that was the female offspring that we

2523
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:58,260
found

2524
01:40:55,439 --> 01:41:00,539
so we planted a bunch of those seeds and

2525
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:04,980
flowered out

2526
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:07,738
[ __ ] 80 80 or 90 females and a bunch of

2527
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:13,379
them were just [ __ ] cabin Ho Chi

2528
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:16,319
hybrid funky power so I I decided to use

2529
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:17,279
that same seed stock to select a mail

2530
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:20,340
from

2531
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:23,219
knowing that that profile is getting

2532
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,840
pushed through in that seed stock

2533
01:41:23,219 --> 01:41:26,880
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's

2534
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:29,279
going to come through on said mail

2535
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,440
but as we started checking The pcs2

2536
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:34,079
Offspring right away that's exactly what

2537
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:36,779
we saw was anything that was gas that

2538
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:39,179
got touched was [ __ ] just it was like

2539
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:41,219
poured it was like poured gas on a

2540
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:44,279
campfire pretty much like that's all we

2541
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:46,800
did we added girth to a bunch of stuff

2542
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:49,099
with the kev4 and you could smell and

2543
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:53,039
taste the Kim forward a bunch of it

2544
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:55,020
especially the uh the OG crosses the

2545
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,880
cookie crosses tended to take it a

2546
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,980
little less but you could still smell it

2547
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:01,679
come through like it's still there it's

2548
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:03,178
definitely prevalent I think people are

2549
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:05,699
really gonna [ __ ] enjoy the only

2550
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:07,679
reason I haven't released them to Market

2551
01:42:05,698 --> 01:42:10,259
I've let people get at them in my

2552
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,359
auction but I've only released them and

2553
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:14,699
auctioned it not to Market because I

2554
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:17,099
personally want to do my big fetal hunts

2555
01:42:14,698 --> 01:42:18,899
before they go to market market

2556
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:20,760
and I've just been waiting for this

2557
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:24,000
facility to get finished so I have room

2558
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:27,179
to do my big hoods

2559
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:31,139
lovely so if we look at all of the

2560
01:42:27,179 --> 01:42:33,600
different PCS to crosses you have

2561
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:35,219
planned which one are you most excited

2562
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,380
for and out of the first release with

2563
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:39,300
the number one male what out of those

2564
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:41,460
was the ones that you kind of just

2565
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:44,940
decided you'd like the most

2566
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:46,859
so out of pcs1 the best thing that we

2567
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:50,698
found that I think that I think I like

2568
01:42:46,859 --> 01:42:51,839
the most is definitely the the meow

2569
01:42:50,698 --> 01:42:54,419
um

2570
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,579
the the Scottsdale g-cut that I have

2571
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:58,260
that I built all that stuff with is so

2572
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:59,460
[ __ ] dank and it comes through with a

2573
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:02,039
lot of stuff and it definitely comes

2574
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:04,260
through in that cross but it has a it

2575
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:06,899
just has a different different vibe to

2576
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:10,860
it super chunky and meow is

2577
01:43:06,899 --> 01:43:14,698
just big so consistent like every 15

2578
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:16,679
pack you know every 15 seeds perk you

2579
01:43:14,698 --> 01:43:18,479
know one pack of seeds there's a [ __ ]

2580
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:21,060
Bob keeper this is like everybody finds

2581
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:23,158
a keeper in that that cross so I

2582
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:25,139
absolutely love the meow it's done a lot

2583
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:28,319
of people saw it and it's done be really

2584
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:31,079
solid we have some [ __ ] power keepers

2585
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:34,559
of the pcs2

2586
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:37,380
I'm pretty stoked about Congo which is

2587
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:42,539
the zookies

2588
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:45,779
um dusted by PCS 2 and I'm

2589
01:43:42,539 --> 01:43:48,840
90 sure one of the biggest strains of

2590
01:43:45,779 --> 01:43:51,719
the year is going to be the champawat

2591
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:56,279
which is is uh

2592
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:58,739
the raw dusted by pcs2 so we're just

2593
01:43:56,279 --> 01:44:00,960
like I said we've popped the seed we

2594
01:43:58,738 --> 01:44:03,899
found offspring that we like but I don't

2595
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:06,600
want to say this is it until I do the

2596
01:44:03,899 --> 01:44:08,519
200 300 seats per and I'm about to have

2597
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:11,159
room to do it so I just figured I would

2598
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:13,320
wait to sell the seed I have a bunch of

2599
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:14,939
the seed ready to put to Market I would

2600
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:16,439
just wait to sell the seed until I did

2601
01:44:14,939 --> 01:44:18,658
my hugs so

2602
01:44:16,439 --> 01:44:21,539
it's just chilling

2603
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:23,339
yeah Okay cool so just as a quick

2604
01:44:21,539 --> 01:44:25,260
follow-up so you just said it was the

2605
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:29,159
raw what's that one

2606
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:32,699
so raw is fire the fire cut that I got

2607
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:35,759
for Rascals crew dusted by a Scotto G

2608
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:38,158
Bale and when I did the big Scottsdale

2609
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:42,480
gfito hunt when I found that scotsoji

2610
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:45,599
female I found like six males I ended up

2611
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:48,718
flowering three of them at killing two

2612
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:51,060
of those three before they ever dropped

2613
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:52,800
pollen I just kind of wanted to see how

2614
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:55,440
they were building their flower sets out

2615
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,659
and I ended up flowering one of those

2616
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:59,879
Scottsdale gmails and I dusted

2617
01:44:57,658 --> 01:45:03,839
everything that I had so at the time I

2618
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:06,079
had maybe like seven Cuts 70 lead cuts

2619
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,060
and I made a bunch of side project stuff

2620
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:11,219
and uh that was just one of them that I

2621
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:13,320
decided to plant and look through the

2622
01:45:11,219 --> 01:45:15,840
fire cut dusted by that Scotts or Gmail

2623
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:18,238
and I found hands down one of the

2624
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:20,279
nastiest OG hybrid

2625
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:23,218
cuts that I've ever [ __ ] smoked or

2626
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:25,920
seen in my life the the raw and it's

2627
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:28,260
just it is what it is that's why I named

2628
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,179
it raw because it's just Raw it's so

2629
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,520
gassy and everybody who [ __ ] with it

2630
01:45:30,179 --> 01:45:34,260
loves it it's just super dang super

2631
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:39,360
enjoyable

2632
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:40,980
love it the rust of the raw so uh do you

2633
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:42,299
think it's important that breeders

2634
01:45:40,979 --> 01:45:43,919
should be trying to hunt their own

2635
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,779
females I've noticed it's a trend that

2636
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,819
there are some breeders who the the

2637
01:45:45,779 --> 01:45:49,738
females they're Crossing stuff for two

2638
01:45:47,819 --> 01:45:51,899
it's just the Clone owners you never see

2639
01:45:49,738 --> 01:45:53,939
any of like their own strains getting

2640
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:55,079
crossed to a male do you think that's an

2641
01:45:53,939 --> 01:45:57,178
important thing

2642
01:45:55,079 --> 01:45:59,519
absolutely it's important that's what

2643
01:45:57,179 --> 01:46:01,260
you would be looking at for real line

2644
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,780
work for people to start doing their own

2645
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:06,719
lines and stuff like myself I have it

2646
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:08,759
dusted anything that's not I mean maybe

2647
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:11,460
that raw cut but most everything I've

2648
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,739
dusted has been me Dusty cloned all the

2649
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:16,139
elites and the reason why is because I

2650
01:46:13,738 --> 01:46:18,000
just at brand new at breeding so as soon

2651
01:46:16,139 --> 01:46:19,800
as you know we get a little further down

2652
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,760
in the journey there's definitely going

2653
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:23,460
to be

2654
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:24,840
different lines made and Line work

2655
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:27,000
there's really nothing I could do at

2656
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,679
this point without the space that I need

2657
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,139
so I'm kind of just hanging out as soon

2658
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:32,880
as I get the space I'll be able to

2659
01:46:30,139 --> 01:46:33,719
expand into those projects but without a

2660
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,859
doubt

2661
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:39,600
it's imperative as to be a breeder to

2662
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:42,118
truly be doing your own mind work and

2663
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:46,079
selecting and building stuff from inside

2664
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:48,299
your own uh your own projects

2665
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:50,880
what do you think about the idea of like

2666
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:52,860
a standardized seed pricing system where

2667
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,920
like if it's like an F1 and the two

2668
01:46:52,859 --> 01:46:57,899
parents nope nope you don't even need to

2669
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,480
finish I love it love it tell me more

2670
01:46:57,899 --> 01:47:03,299
tell me standardized pricing I'm like

2671
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:05,399
nope we're all different dude and some

2672
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:08,520
people's projects are just complete dog

2673
01:47:05,399 --> 01:47:12,420
[ __ ] they have no depths and they don't

2674
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:15,000
have any potential like I want right now

2675
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:17,100
everybody who's listening think of your

2676
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,560
favorite breeder

2677
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:21,300
and once you have them in your head I

2678
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:24,480
want you to think of all the strains

2679
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:27,239
they've released in the last five years

2680
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:29,698
and now I want you to think about all

2681
01:47:27,238 --> 01:47:32,099
the people that you know that still grow

2682
01:47:29,698 --> 01:47:34,079
any of the stuff that they released over

2683
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:37,020
the last five years and I want you to

2684
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:39,300
understand that a bunch of that seed

2685
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:41,940
that was sold had no offspring that was

2686
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:44,820
keepable it was just seed that was sold

2687
01:47:41,939 --> 01:47:47,039
to you as a customer because it had a

2688
01:47:44,819 --> 01:47:48,658
name and you thought it might be good it

2689
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:50,819
might render something good but did it

2690
01:47:48,658 --> 01:47:54,899
how many strains have we heard of in the

2691
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:56,759
last five years from all of us right I

2692
01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:58,559
mean I'm a brand new breeder but I'm

2693
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:01,679
serious but everybody's name into the

2694
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:03,840
Hat how many of them are where are the

2695
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:06,239
keeper Keepers right like

2696
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,340
dude I've seen so many menus come with

2697
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:09,479
nothing to be heard of from the menu

2698
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,179
so

2699
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:13,979
it's just one of those things

2700
01:48:12,179 --> 01:48:15,719
I don't think that all of our projects

2701
01:48:13,979 --> 01:48:20,039
are the same I don't think standardizing

2702
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:22,739
prices on on how uh where things are on

2703
01:48:20,039 --> 01:48:24,000
a tree is is would make any sense at all

2704
01:48:22,738 --> 01:48:26,158
so

2705
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,600
out of all the breed is currently out

2706
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:29,399
there how many of them do you think are

2707
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,600
actually doing like a good job in terms

2708
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:32,879
of what they should be doing and

2709
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:36,119
delivering to Market Etc it's like a

2710
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,819
percentage it's a it's a 20 it's a 20

2711
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:40,618
again two out of ten

2712
01:48:38,819 --> 01:48:41,759
two out of ten there's right now

2713
01:48:40,618 --> 01:48:44,460
currently

2714
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:46,860
people making seed for the marijuana

2715
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:50,639
industry there's

2716
01:48:46,859 --> 01:48:50,639
Maybe 300.

2717
01:48:50,698 --> 01:48:55,979
250 to 300 people making seed for the

2718
01:48:54,479 --> 01:49:00,118
marijuana industry

2719
01:48:55,979 --> 01:49:02,218
and and maybe one out of ten two out of

2720
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:05,880
ten ten percent probably is a better

2721
01:49:02,219 --> 01:49:08,158
estimate 10 literally there's about 20

2722
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:10,500
or 30 guys that you could [ __ ] trust

2723
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,960
that you know are gonna deliver

2724
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:15,198
yeah it's a short list but it really is

2725
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:18,000
but like I said if you put

2726
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:20,158
billions of dollars on the table every

2727
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,560
wolf it's the same as if you put a dead

2728
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:25,079
body on the Sahara right every wild dog

2729
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,119
every coyote every [ __ ] thing is

2730
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:30,059
Gonna Come the vultures the the

2731
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:31,738
everything the Lions they all show up

2732
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:33,539
because there's food so that's what

2733
01:49:31,738 --> 01:49:36,118
we're dealing with here is

2734
01:49:33,539 --> 01:49:39,118
just a budding industry and a bunch of

2735
01:49:36,118 --> 01:49:42,299
people showing up to to get get their do

2736
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:44,698
what they think is their due at least

2737
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:46,800
yeah so I think we're kind of in the

2738
01:49:44,698 --> 01:49:49,319
midst of the the corporate cannabis

2739
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:53,179
Takeover in a sense where do you see

2740
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:53,179
things going on the big AG level

2741
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:58,679
um

2742
01:49:54,060 --> 01:50:01,980
I mean as far as growing smokeable good

2743
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:03,960
product ever they'll never compete uh

2744
01:50:01,979 --> 01:50:05,459
it'll always end up just an extract form

2745
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,340
whatever they're doing whether they're

2746
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:10,139
freezing it or just drying it making

2747
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:12,060
[ __ ] crude or whatever the [ __ ] they

2748
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:15,480
do you know I don't really

2749
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:17,820
I don't stress on them at all like I've

2750
01:50:15,479 --> 01:50:20,879
never I've never been worried about

2751
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:23,399
anybody else that's not what bothers me

2752
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:27,359
about big AG what bothers me about them

2753
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:31,399
is their potential to control law

2754
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:35,098
well their potential to control

2755
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:37,559
by human existence because they are

2756
01:50:35,099 --> 01:50:40,500
afraid of the little guys they always

2757
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:43,199
consistently show they are Big Industry

2758
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:45,960
knocks around little industry to make

2759
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:47,939
you know all the profits available to

2760
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,579
them that's what Walmart does that's

2761
01:50:47,939 --> 01:50:53,158
what everybody does like

2762
01:50:50,579 --> 01:50:55,380
I don't know I just worry about all the

2763
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:57,839
smaller Farmers that Mom and Pops are

2764
01:50:55,380 --> 01:51:00,300
gonna be turned into a straight

2765
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:02,520
legitimate Outlaws again

2766
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:03,960
because they want to gross apart for

2767
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:05,639
themselves and maybe sell a couple

2768
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:07,139
ounces to their people or whatever and

2769
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:08,460
that's not going to be an option anymore

2770
01:51:07,139 --> 01:51:10,380
it's just

2771
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:13,439
it's the whiskey tax all over again

2772
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:15,239
we're just living some [ __ ] alternate

2773
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:17,759
reality where the government shows up it

2774
01:51:15,238 --> 01:51:19,799
just says you can't do that and it's

2775
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,800
like [ __ ]

2776
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,239
why I'm not doing any I'm not hurting

2777
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:26,699
anybody what are you talking about you

2778
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:29,279
guys are [ __ ] liars and thieves and

2779
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:31,859
killers and you guys [ __ ] kill kids

2780
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:33,840
with drones and [ __ ] and I can't grow a

2781
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:37,799
plant like dude we're living [ __ ]

2782
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:41,340
some weird [ __ ] it really is weird [ __ ]

2783
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:42,840
yeah yeah it's uh wild times kind of

2784
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:46,260
Twilight Zone stuff

2785
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:47,159
so were you around when the forums were

2786
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:50,520
really big

2787
01:51:47,158 --> 01:51:52,198
no I was but I didn't I don't use I

2788
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:54,540
never used a computer or got on the

2789
01:51:52,198 --> 01:51:56,698
forums at all I was never a form today

2790
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:58,079
yeah okay well I mean I think you can

2791
01:51:56,698 --> 01:52:00,059
still have a pretty good input on this

2792
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:01,920
one why do you think people reminisce so

2793
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:04,440
much about the forums even though the

2794
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,880
general uh knowledge of the Cannabis

2795
01:52:04,439 --> 01:52:07,399
Community is much greater now than what

2796
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,139
it used to be back then

2797
01:52:07,399 --> 01:52:11,638
I think because they had it it was a

2798
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:14,039
little tight it was a little more tight

2799
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:16,020
knit and uh pretty much everybody kind

2800
01:52:14,039 --> 01:52:18,420
of knew everybody on whatever four of

2801
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:20,040
you were on like everybody it was just

2802
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:22,560
much more tight-knit there's a lot of

2803
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:26,158
Outsiders now and it's just saturated

2804
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,780
with just [ __ ] idiots so there was

2805
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:29,819
one for him I can't remember if his icy

2806
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:31,559
mag which you couldn't even comb it at

2807
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:33,000
first like you had to join and be a

2808
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,679
member for a while before you could say

2809
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,539
anything and then you had to like

2810
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:38,940
message people

2811
01:52:36,539 --> 01:52:40,920
and that they had to message you back or

2812
01:52:38,939 --> 01:52:42,658
something like six times before you can

2813
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:44,099
comment or some weird [ __ ] like that I

2814
01:52:42,658 --> 01:52:45,960
don't know if it was icy mag but one of

2815
01:52:44,099 --> 01:52:48,000
them was pretty serious about just

2816
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,279
letting anybody come on you had to work

2817
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,599
for him a little bit so that was kind of

2818
01:52:50,279 --> 01:52:54,300
good probably kept some of the people

2819
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,920
out but definitely I think it's just a

2820
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:58,199
it's just one of those things it was a

2821
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:01,560
little bit of a more tight-knit group so

2822
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:03,598
no biggie yeah

2823
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:05,280
so what do you think about the rise of

2824
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:07,679
the Vape cartridges and everything

2825
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:10,559
that's followed with that

2826
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:12,060
ah it's just dog [ __ ] man I don't I

2827
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,860
don't have any

2828
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:15,480
they're just trash just quick way to

2829
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:18,019
make a buck dude people turning all

2830
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:21,299
kinds of garbage harvested to

2831
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:23,099
processable Buddy it's what it is you'll

2832
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:26,039
never ever see anybody put really good

2833
01:53:23,099 --> 01:53:27,900
flour into anything like that so it's

2834
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:29,399
always just dog [ __ ] that they're trying

2835
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:31,618
to make money off of

2836
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:33,779
I've never seen it be anything else

2837
01:53:31,618 --> 01:53:36,179
other than that so it's just it's one of

2838
01:53:33,779 --> 01:53:38,759
those things but it sucks but

2839
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:41,099
whatever it's just the way it goes

2840
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:43,739
yeah of course

2841
01:53:41,099 --> 01:53:45,060
so what would be some tips you would

2842
01:53:43,738 --> 01:53:46,559
offer for someone who's thinking about

2843
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:48,599
getting into breeding but just doesn't

2844
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,159
really know how and just what would be

2845
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:51,719
your kind of advice about how they could

2846
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:54,059
get things started

2847
01:53:51,719 --> 01:53:55,260
uh first he's first shut off what

2848
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:57,060
everybody's gonna say to you because

2849
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:58,860
people are going to tell you that you

2850
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:00,900
know you don't need to do it or it's not

2851
01:53:58,859 --> 01:54:04,019
for you or whatever don't [ __ ] listen

2852
01:54:00,899 --> 01:54:05,819
to anybody if you want to breed

2853
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:07,800
um make sure you have a nice decent

2854
01:54:05,819 --> 01:54:09,719
selection to start with like a stable

2855
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:12,539
build out a little bit of a stable and

2856
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:14,579
just start make sure you're reading and

2857
01:54:12,539 --> 01:54:16,019
understanding the basic concepts of what

2858
01:54:14,579 --> 01:54:19,439
you're doing so you're not all over the

2859
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:21,960
[ __ ] place and don't overthink it man

2860
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:24,598
just make some cool new crosses to enjoy

2861
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:27,000
and if you get good at it maybe people

2862
01:54:24,599 --> 01:54:28,920
will enjoy your stuff enough to to want

2863
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,479
to buy it and you can [ __ ] sell seed

2864
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:33,300
and if not you'll always have your own

2865
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:34,859
seed stock of stuff you like or back up

2866
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:37,860
seed stock in case the [ __ ] world

2867
01:54:34,859 --> 01:54:39,658
goes [ __ ] D-Day [ __ ] and you actually

2868
01:54:37,859 --> 01:54:41,039
have some seed for yourself you know

2869
01:54:39,658 --> 01:54:43,259
like

2870
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:45,060
I don't know don't stress on it don't

2871
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:46,800
let anybody [ __ ] with you don't let

2872
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:48,420
anybody dictate your [ __ ] make sure you

2873
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:51,179
have a nice little stable to start with

2874
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:53,099
and [ __ ] do it

2875
01:54:51,179 --> 01:54:55,920
some good advice

2876
01:54:53,099 --> 01:54:58,079
so how important do you think it is for

2877
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:00,658
people to have a social media these days

2878
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:02,519
if they're looking to be like a breeder

2879
01:55:00,658 --> 01:55:04,379
for example or an influencer in the

2880
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:06,540
market is it critical you're not going

2881
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:08,940
to be able to sell anything if you don't

2882
01:55:06,539 --> 01:55:11,519
have social media like

2883
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:14,460
nobody sells [ __ ] unless they have

2884
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,080
actual store for the space like they

2885
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:18,480
have to have social media that's where

2886
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:20,880
our community is is on Instagram and

2887
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,339
social media

2888
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,840
yeah and so I've noticed you've got

2889
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:27,060
quite an impressive following yourself

2890
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,800
what would be some tips for people who

2891
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:30,119
are kind of struggling to get their

2892
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,079
follow account to where they want it to

2893
01:55:30,118 --> 01:55:33,960
be

2894
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:36,960
well Instagram's algorithms pretty much

2895
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:39,779
junk now it's busted up so I don't know

2896
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:41,880
anymore about Instagram but what I did

2897
01:55:39,779 --> 01:55:44,939
back in the day before it was bought by

2898
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:47,699
Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg pulled his

2899
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:50,238
Shenanigans was just post good pictures

2900
01:55:47,698 --> 01:55:52,738
regularly make sure you stay interactive

2901
01:55:50,238 --> 01:55:54,000
post a picture of the boarding get a

2902
01:55:52,738 --> 01:55:56,039
picture at night so you get two

2903
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:59,579
different audiences you know

2904
01:55:56,039 --> 01:56:01,139
um if not sometimes the same group of

2905
01:55:59,579 --> 01:56:03,000
people on both pictures you know what

2906
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:04,440
I'm saying so a lot of people are on

2907
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,819
their phones in the morning some people

2908
01:56:04,439 --> 01:56:07,979
are holding on their phones at night if

2909
01:56:05,819 --> 01:56:10,079
you post once in the AM and what's the P

2910
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:13,618
if you have a good chance of people

2911
01:56:10,079 --> 01:56:15,359
seeing one of the posts uh make sure

2912
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:18,000
you're interacting with people don't be

2913
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:20,819
a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude you'll be good

2914
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,679
I literally built my whole thing by just

2915
01:56:20,819 --> 01:56:25,198
being me man just interacting with

2916
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:27,239
people helping [ __ ] countless Growers

2917
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:29,460
with simple questions that a lot of

2918
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:33,299
other Growers didn't want to answer

2919
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:35,520
giving myself to the community for years

2920
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:36,840
like just being available and helping

2921
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,239
people and

2922
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:41,340
it's not something that's for everybody

2923
01:56:39,238 --> 01:56:43,979
but it's definitely for a lot of people

2924
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:45,480
so don't be afraid if you want to get

2925
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:47,638
get your

2926
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:49,500
get your foot at the door just like I

2927
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:51,060
said don't be a piece of [ __ ] just start

2928
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:52,800
interacting start doing what you're

2929
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:54,599
doing and your account will go up I'm

2930
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,639
assuming if you if you're not being a

2931
01:56:54,599 --> 01:57:00,239
[ __ ]

2932
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:02,579
love it love it so in your opinion what

2933
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:06,000
do you think will go down as the notable

2934
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:07,439
cut from the 2015 to the 2020 period And

2935
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,939
by the reason why it's a very specific

2936
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:11,460
question like that is because I think

2937
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:13,500
it's pretty undeniable 2010s 2015 that

2938
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:16,760
was really the cookies era what do you

2939
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,760
think is the last five years

2940
01:57:16,859 --> 01:57:18,859
um

2941
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:23,279
wow I mean everybody's different man

2942
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:24,960
everybody's got their old

2943
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,399
everybody's got their own thing I really

2944
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,198
feel like there's been good projects

2945
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:30,420
from a bunch of different people for me

2946
01:57:28,198 --> 01:57:32,158
that's just I can't get away from the

2947
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:35,279
same stuff that I [ __ ] with it's just

2948
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:37,198
OG's and cubes uh they never they never

2949
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,238
go old to be there's definitely going to

2950
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:41,698
be always new projects and stuff people

2951
01:57:39,238 --> 01:57:43,500
that are are going to be making

2952
01:57:41,698 --> 01:57:45,539
all types of stuff that I just don't

2953
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:49,380
have any interest in at all but a bunch

2954
01:57:45,539 --> 01:57:51,658
of people like so you know I mean csi's

2955
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:54,239
made some really cool stuff uh some

2956
01:57:51,658 --> 01:57:56,519
really cool uh hybrids and I I

2957
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:57,839
personally did like I said earlier you

2958
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:59,940
know it's just one of those things where

2959
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:02,460
I don't smoke a lot of other people's

2960
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:04,859
pot I don't pay much attention to what

2961
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:06,599
other people are doing and I stay super

2962
01:58:04,859 --> 01:58:08,339
focused in my own little thing and I

2963
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:11,099
think a lot of people take that the

2964
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:13,380
wrong way they think that I'm like ego

2965
01:58:11,099 --> 01:58:15,599
or that I like don't

2966
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:17,819
give them good energy or something

2967
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:20,279
because I'm like hyper focused on my own

2968
01:58:17,819 --> 01:58:21,960
[ __ ] but it's the only way to get out of

2969
01:58:20,279 --> 01:58:24,859
such a hole that I was in like people

2970
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:28,920
don't realize I came to Oregon with 800

2971
01:58:24,859 --> 01:58:31,799
like we spent 650 on our first month's

2972
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,880
rent and by the three weeks in we had no

2973
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:36,480
money

2974
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:39,179
like we we barely made it so everything

2975
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:42,718
I have I got from from nothing from

2976
01:58:39,179 --> 01:58:44,639
zilch dude from starting from zero and I

2977
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,679
realized quickly I could get more for my

2978
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:48,480
family and do better for my tribe if I

2979
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,099
just don't pay attention to everybody

2980
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:52,079
else's [ __ ]

2981
01:58:50,099 --> 01:58:53,520
it's like dude I can't look my kids in

2982
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:55,979
the face

2983
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:58,739
knowing I just wasted [ __ ] hours of

2984
01:58:55,979 --> 01:59:00,238
my life arguing with some random kid on

2985
01:58:58,738 --> 01:59:02,039
the Internet or some [ __ ] you know what

2986
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:03,598
I mean like that's why I said I just

2987
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:05,219
won't we won't do that anymore we're

2988
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:06,659
just gonna pull up and scrap if you

2989
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:08,340
really have a [ __ ] problem we're

2990
01:59:06,658 --> 01:59:09,839
gonna scrap if not then I'm not gonna

2991
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,619
give a [ __ ] about what you're saying

2992
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:12,840
because

2993
01:59:10,618 --> 01:59:15,420
what it is

2994
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:16,920
that's it straight to the money

2995
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:19,260
yes sir

2996
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,940
all right so I think that brings us to

2997
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:23,699
our last couple of quick fire questions

2998
01:59:20,939 --> 01:59:27,779
a little bit more yes snowy type of

2999
01:59:23,698 --> 01:59:30,079
things so first one what is the best bud

3000
01:59:27,779 --> 01:59:35,158
you've ever smoked in your life

3001
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:38,819
uh either the crippler here in Oregon

3002
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:40,559
that was gifted to me years ago and I

3003
01:59:38,819 --> 01:59:42,479
lost the cut because I'm [ __ ] stupid

3004
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:45,599
and I don't know the guy who gave it to

3005
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:46,559
me it's just a total random event

3006
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:51,000
um

3007
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:54,119
or the pure Real Deal OG Kush that I

3008
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,420
smoked the very first time that I smoked

3009
01:59:54,118 --> 02:00:00,000
OG Kush it's still to this day is one of

3010
01:59:57,420 --> 02:00:03,899
the purest Cuts I've ever come across

3011
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,179
and it was so [ __ ] smooth and amazing

3012
02:00:03,899 --> 02:00:09,598
so on the flip side what's the worst

3013
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:13,859
weed you've ever smoking oh boy that's

3014
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:16,739
definitely uh that that Maxi the Maxi

3015
02:00:13,859 --> 02:00:19,319
brick we've gotten weed from from Mexico

3016
02:00:16,738 --> 02:00:22,079
that is still smelled like gasoline that

3017
02:00:19,319 --> 02:00:23,579
was smuggled in in the gas tank and the

3018
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:26,880
[ __ ] packs were leaking and they

3019
02:00:23,579 --> 02:00:28,380
actually got gasoline into them and weed

3020
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,319
is like a sponge it just sucks

3021
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:34,139
everything up so I've definitely gotten

3022
02:00:31,319 --> 02:00:36,118
gasoline dirt weed growing up as a kid

3023
02:00:34,139 --> 02:00:37,679
that's the worst [ __ ] weed I've ever

3024
02:00:36,118 --> 02:00:40,559
smoked for sure

3025
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:44,039
wow that that's a new Benchmark you've

3026
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:46,400
set there but okay [ __ ] you I'm not the

3027
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:46,399
only one

3028
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:53,699
[ __ ] [ __ ] I completely forgot that we

3029
02:00:51,479 --> 02:00:55,259
smoked dirt weed that actually smelled

3030
02:00:53,698 --> 02:00:57,019
like gas

3031
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:59,300
big gas

3032
02:00:57,020 --> 02:01:02,880
that's where the passion comes from

3033
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:06,300
right yes sir no don't worry I've I've

3034
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:08,400
certainly smoked my fair share of uh you

3035
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:10,340
guys have smoked [ __ ] Aboriginal dog

3036
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:15,299
[ __ ] weed don't give me that

3037
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:17,099
uh riddled with pgrs trust me yeah

3038
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:19,440
um okay so let me put a spin on that one

3039
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:22,139
for you what's the worst strain you've

3040
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,879
smoked which commercially kind of took

3041
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:25,380
off a bit and people some people thought

3042
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:29,819
it was good but you were like no this is

3043
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:32,819
trash Jaeger Jager

3044
02:01:29,819 --> 02:01:35,539
um Blue Dream Jager

3045
02:01:32,819 --> 02:01:35,539
uh

3046
02:01:35,698 --> 02:01:39,238
uh yeah those are the Jaegers the first

3047
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:40,679
one that really pops off coming from

3048
02:01:39,238 --> 02:01:42,359
Oregon there's just a lot of people that

3049
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:43,319
were really liked it and were hyped on

3050
02:01:42,359 --> 02:01:45,000
it but I really think it was just

3051
02:01:43,319 --> 02:01:47,279
because it finished early and it wasn't

3052
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,539
it was something that would get out on

3053
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:52,380
the outdoor you know without getting

3054
02:01:48,539 --> 02:01:54,000
rotten so yeah okay so you're on a

3055
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:56,940
desert island you can only take three

3056
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,460
Cuts with you what are they

3057
02:01:56,939 --> 02:02:03,118
oh that's that's gonna be pretty easy

3058
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:07,380
for me I'm taking a Kev I'm taking a

3059
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:11,098
[ __ ] pure TK like a real deal TK

3060
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:14,400
Kevin Ford at a real deal sour

3061
02:02:11,099 --> 02:02:15,380
that's it tree piece baby with some

3062
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:20,039
sauce

3063
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:22,199
easy money love it okay so what is a cut

3064
02:02:20,039 --> 02:02:24,960
that you've either lost over the years

3065
02:02:22,198 --> 02:02:26,039
or never quite got access to that you'd

3066
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,359
love to get back and I know you

3067
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:29,639
mentioned the crippler before so it's

3068
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:34,019
got to be something other than that

3069
02:02:29,639 --> 02:02:36,900
okay uh Bay 11 I grew out some seeds one

3070
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:41,639
time and I found a cut I found a plant

3071
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:44,519
uh Bay 11 that was absolutely phenomenal

3072
02:02:41,639 --> 02:02:46,618
I for some reason didn't like those

3073
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:48,960
structure of the plant and I just didn't

3074
02:02:46,618 --> 02:02:51,179
clothe it I was very specifically

3075
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,920
looking for certain structures and it

3076
02:02:51,179 --> 02:02:55,020
was easily one of the top five best

3077
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:56,460
tasting pots I've ever smoked in my life

3078
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:58,560
and I just

3079
02:02:56,460 --> 02:03:01,679
tried to revege it I couldn't get it to

3080
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:03,300
Revenge it was devastating so

3081
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:06,000
that's Obama I think we've all had

3082
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:07,679
similar experiences like that right yeah

3083
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,359
it was it was uh it's still to this day

3084
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:12,380
still bothers me a little bit honestly

3085
02:03:09,359 --> 02:03:15,899
there's a little piece of my heart

3086
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:17,819
alrighty so on to our final question if

3087
02:03:15,899 --> 02:03:21,059
you could go back in time any place

3088
02:03:17,819 --> 02:03:24,079
anywhere where would you go when and

3089
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:27,239
what seeds are you collecting

3090
02:03:24,079 --> 02:03:30,599
uh if I could go back to any place in

3091
02:03:27,238 --> 02:03:33,419
time uh anywhere

3092
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:35,579
surprisingly I wouldn't go that far back

3093
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:38,179
and I really wouldn't be there to

3094
02:03:35,579 --> 02:03:40,979
collect weed seeds

3095
02:03:38,179 --> 02:03:43,560
if I had the trigger and I could just go

3096
02:03:40,979 --> 02:03:45,419
any place in time I would go sit down

3097
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:48,239
and have dinner with my grandmother I

3098
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:51,539
would make her I would make her a nice

3099
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:54,118
tri-tip and salad and I would just enjoy

3100
02:03:51,539 --> 02:03:55,618
her company and her conversation for the

3101
02:03:54,118 --> 02:03:57,899
night you know

3102
02:03:55,618 --> 02:04:00,479
she was my absolute best friend and when

3103
02:03:57,899 --> 02:04:02,098
she had me I didn't quite have my head

3104
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:04,500
on straight so I was all over the place

3105
02:04:02,099 --> 02:04:07,440
and I didn't get to fully enjoy

3106
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:10,738
her energy how cool of a lady she was

3107
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:12,118
and I readily always that's the first

3108
02:04:10,738 --> 02:04:13,799
thing that pops in my head when someone

3109
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:16,618
asked me that if you could go to any

3110
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:19,679
place at any time it's always I just

3111
02:04:16,618 --> 02:04:22,799
crave to hear her voice to uh

3112
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:25,440
enjoy her company one more time yeah

3113
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:28,560
that would be the best for me

3114
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:30,178
yeah what a beautiful sentiment so do

3115
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:31,679

3116
