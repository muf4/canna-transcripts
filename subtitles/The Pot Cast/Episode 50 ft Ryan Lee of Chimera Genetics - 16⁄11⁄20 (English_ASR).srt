chimerogenetics thank you so much for

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,040
taking the time to chat with us today

37
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,180
my pleasure Heavenly thank you for

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,520
having me here

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,740
not a problem so the first question we

40
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,560
like to ask guests these days is what

41
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,899
are you currently been smoking on

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,820
you know I'm actually I'm not really

43
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,519
smoking a lot of flour these days the

44
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,919
last couple of years I've really been

45
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,359
focused on vaping concentrates I'm not

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,120
even really dabbing them on a hot nail

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,580
either just with a torch or

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,840
uh you know a lower temp kind of Vape

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,000
device

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
I find it's a lot easier on my lungs and

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,959
you know as we start getting up on in

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,900
age it uh

53
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,340
you know I I I kind of when I when I

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,020
hang out with friends at conferences and

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,239
stuff we're used to do that back in the

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,879
day the emerald cup or whatever we do

57
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560
there's a lot of really really heavy

58
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,079
smoking that goes on and I just find

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,300
that it doesn't it doesn't really go

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,319
well too well with my lungs

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,939
um I'd rather do a smaller inhalation of

62
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,339
something much much stronger and more

63
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,659
flavorful so I've kind of been staying

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,979
away from the flower to be perfectly

65
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,079
Frank

66
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,979
um so just really smoking on Fresh live

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,000
rosin and really nice fresh dabs that

68
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:59,818
kind of are popping around in the

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,860
community these these days here

70
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,958
yeah I can certainly relate to that

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,360
sentiment having recently put down the

72
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,219
bong and picked up the Vape myself I

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,260
guess my question is do you feel like

74
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,598
there are any specific cultivars which

75
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,519
really lend themselves to being

76
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,378
um smoked through a vape in concentrate

77
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,239
form

78
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,780
I think they all do

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,019
um you know a really good a really good

80
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,340
live rosin or a live resin kind of

81
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,500
extract

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,739
is really just the essence of the plant

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,719
and the THC so you're you're removing

84
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,300
all that you know that leaf material

85
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,800
that really is not adding anything of

86
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,719
Health to your lungs and it's certainly

87
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,299
not anything adding anything to the

88
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,039
experience of the of the smoke or of the

89
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,659
consumption so

90
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,699
I really think that that kind of

91
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,979
Direction whether it's a high quality

92
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,679
CO2 or whatever the extraction method is

93
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,139
as long as you remove all the

94
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,760
um the solvents and even better if

95
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,738
you're using solventless techniques

96
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,239
you're really just getting the the part

97
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,120
of the plant that

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,039
you know is really is is what we want

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
right

100
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,199
um and it's just an evolution from from

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,938
you know started office and then we all

102
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,479
kind of got into the bubble hash and the

103
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,159
and the dry CIS but the these extracts

104
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,259
they use as you know probably they use

105
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,019
heat and pressure to to pull the

106
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,519
essential compounds out of that kind of

107
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,918
more natural Matrix of the of the resin

108
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,258
and uh your you know if it's processed

109
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,719
and cared for carefully you end up with

110
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,060
a product that in my opinion is a lot

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,759
healthier to smoke than you know sucking

112
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,819
on half gram joints all day

113
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,520
yeah certainly I think the the amount of

114
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,439
tar consumed is astronomically different

115
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,779
right so for that reason alone I'm on

116
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,639
board in past episodes we've had

117
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,279
breeders talk about this idea of

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,319
breeding for the end goal of making

119
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,719
concentrates and sometimes they would

120
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,639
reference you know big land heads things

121
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,960
like that would you ever consider

122
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,759
something like that or do you just think

123
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,379
like a good strain will translate to

124
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,900
good concentrates and you don't need to

125
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,360
specifically set out to do that yeah

126
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,219
good cultivar should definitely I mean

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,379
if it's grown well that's what you're

128
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,380
trying to do is bring out that Peak

129
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,360
essential oil expression and I think

130
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,040
that any kind of variety is really good

131
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,080
for that there's definitely something

132
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,439
going on with the size of the resin

133
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,359
gland and either the ratio of the

134
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,219
thickness of the gland to the internal

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,100
diam or the you know the internal

136
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,440
diameter essentially so think of it like

137
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,840
a we call it a waxy pillow so like the

138
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,939
the pillowcase is made of something that

139
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,619
is somewhat fibrous or waxy material

140
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,779
it's got you know there's there's

141
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,600
actually no drug content in the in the

142
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:48,478
structure of the trichome itself but the

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,160
inside of that pillow is where all the

144
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,180
um the essential oils are produced in

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,100
the plant and certainly where the

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,660
cannabinoids are produced as well

147
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,780
and um

148
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,759
yeah so really being able to like take

149
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,319
those compounds out or the oil that is

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,660
in those compounds which is really what

151
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,399
I call what I consider the essence of

152
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,060
the plant

153
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,339
um

154
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,740
yeah I'm not so sure that we've really

155
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,359
do understand whether it's there's a

156
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,180
specific gland size or maybe when the

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,060
glands get to a certain size that the

158
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,519
the you know the membrane that surrounds

159
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,478
that waxy pillow gets thicker so it can

160
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,099
can hold in the the uh the contents and

161
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,579
like I said that's not those those

162
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,680
that's made for material that is not

163
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,359
um really what we're after is consumers

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,360
it's just kind of in the way

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,520
and so I think a really a good extract

166
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,379
is about removing the things that we

167
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,538
want from the things that we don't want

168
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,339
without changing the chemical profile of

169
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,560
the plant

170
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,538
um and that way any extract really will

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,000
let there any good quality extract will

172
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,740
let the plant shine in its in its best

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,620
form right

174
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,199
and we like them all I mean it's it's

175
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,418
expensive to deal with the with a tire

176
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,100
um you know a haze or something like the

177
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,959
Lyman Pine that I was using for a while

178
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,580
they make incredible extracts but you

179
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,138
know the ratio the return is not very

180
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,818
good

181
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,038
um so as a breeding goal really it's

182
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,160
just about you know producing biomass

183
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,680
with enough what we call oil content

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
um you know so that you they can shine

185
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,538
in extracts

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,520
sure and I mean a great point you just

187
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,038
touched on there about you know Hayes

188
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,500
and some of these smaller yielding

189
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,360
sativa varieties you know making it a

190
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,519
hard sort of argument for the return on

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,860
investment I remember in an episode with

192
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,779
DJ Short he discussed how some of these

193
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,419
varieties have like a higher proportion

194
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,638
of the systolithic trichomes that don't

195
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:44,339
have that kind of pillowcase that we've

196
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,259
been referencing would you think that

197
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,000
there is still a lot of room to make

198
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,740
concentrates because I think DJ said

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,199
that you know they tend to secrete the

200
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,699
oils onto the surface of the plant do

201
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,978
you think that you could still get a

202
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,300
good return from that given that the

203
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,859
oil's there somewhere it's just maybe

204
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,120
not in the trichome head or do you think

205
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,939
the trichome head is really

206
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,259
fundamentally necessary to get that good

207
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,860
concentrate

208
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,080
yeah so but you know I don't like

209
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,580
creating drama with people but that's

210
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,318
he's actually not correct to say that

211
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,060
listen systolithic errors are

212
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,039
non-glandular

213
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,660
um so they actually don't really uh

214
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,478
produce an oil

215
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,879
um that's extractable or that is

216
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,918
secreted by the the structure it's

217
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,840
really like a thought long thin kind of

218
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,560
pointy thing

219
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,019
um

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,940
if you look at a resin gland under you

221
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,379
know some kind of microscopic picture

222
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,539
and there's all sorts of them on the net

223
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,219
you know bubble man is they've got a lot

224
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,958
of great great ones if you follow him on

225
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,399
Instagram

226
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,658
um but you can kind of see that the

227
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,539
actual structure it's really about

228
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:47,639
what's inside that glandular head and

229
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,899
there's shorter you know gland there's

230
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,580
also there's a few different types of

231
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,399
glands on the plant there's these non

232
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,519
you know non-capital glands and there's

233
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,839
the bulbous glands that sit on uh on the

234
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,759
leaf like you were saying they're kind

235
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,220
of more down towards they don't really

236
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,039
have a kind of think of it like a golf

237
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,959
ball on a tee that sticks into the into

238
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,539
the leaf surface so they don't really

239
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,338
have the tea part it's just like kind of

240
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,019
a little gland on the

241
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,480
on the ground but I'm not sure that

242
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,480
those are really

243
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,339
um too important in the overall

244
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,959
processing you know in the overall space

245
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,820
there is some definite differences in

246
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,278
chemistry but I think with our current

247
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,600
extraction methods

248
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,458
um unless you're actually physically

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,139
separating those gland heads by size

250
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,018
we're really just going in with either

251
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,458
heat or pressure or a solvent to pull

252
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,200
those things out

253
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:40,679
right so you're gonna for the most part

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,399
you're gonna get it all anyway

255
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,139
yeah sure so a question I'm very

256
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,700
interested in but is one that's kind of

257
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,139
hard to talk to people without a

258
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,700
scientific background so I've been

259
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,278
waiting for you to come on so you could

260
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,560
give me your opinion I remember in that

261
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,100
same chat with DJ we were talking about

262
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,319
like the biochemical nature of like what

263
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,659
makes you feel a strain as a sativa

264
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,640
versus an indica and it's obviously

265
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,259
still a bit of a cloudy area where we

266
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,879
don't really have it down pat but

267
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,519
something which always comes to my mind

268
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,159
is that even if you take a really racy

269
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,620
sativa and make a concentrate it doesn't

270
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,120
tend to have that same racy effect like

271
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,580
you might still perceive it as a bit

272
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,740
sativary but it's certainly mellowed out

273
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,480
what's your thoughts on this and do you

274
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,980
think that it maybe indicates that

275
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,839
there's something in the plant matter

276
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,000
which isn't being extracted which

277
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,980
contributes to the perceptual feel of a

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,799
certain strain

279
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,839
yeah so there's a few things that we

280
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,639
should probably touch on that let's come

281
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,260
back to the Indica sativa thing and just

282
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,639
talk about the chemistry thing for a

283
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,259
moment

284
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,578
um and actually we can use Dan as a

285
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,299
great example

286
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:47,879
um

287
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,319
you know DJ he had these great you know

288
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,360
all these great varieties but his whole

289
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,000
thing has always been he you know he he

290
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,399
came from a lot a time period where we

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,559
weren't breeding using a lab right we

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,860
were always selecting plants based on

293
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:05,879
how they make you feel not how much THC

294
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,320
there is in the plant okay and so when I

295
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,480
I was doing some work down in the states

296
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,879
and you know I collected a whole bunch

297
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,440
of Dan's stuff uh both in Clone and and

298
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,820
from seed and we grew up a fair amount

299
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,240
of it

300
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,620
and the the one thing that I noticed in

301
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,860
general was that the plants were

302
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,360
actually relatively low THC they were in

303
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,919
most of them not all of them but the

304
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,459
vast majority of them fell kind of in

305
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,199
the 8 to 12 to 13 range which is pretty

306
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,599
low for the market

307
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
um Market average these days at least in

308
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,079
in North America and California

309
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,219
specifically

310
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,739
um

311
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,300
and I've also noticed this with you know

312
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,940
other if you listen to experiences of

313
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,699
people that take the Sesame which is a

314
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,760
you know a synthetic THC it's actually

315
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,600
not see it it's a yeah it's a synthetic

316
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,578
THC in a peanut oil

317
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,360
Matrix kind of a jelly you know a jelly

318
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:01,379
type pill capsule and if you take those

319
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
things

320
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,500
or you ask the patients that are using

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
them what they feel and they always say

322
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,458
they get really tired

323
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,139
and I've kind of noticed after having

324
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,518
access to the lab and playing with a lot

325
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,679
of these different varieties and smoking

326
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,480
them and also having the ability to run

327
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,578
them through to understand their

328
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,560
cannabinoid profile is that when you

329
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:22,319
start turning the THC way up you really

330
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,819
do get that lethargic property and I

331
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,800
think that what a lot of people

332
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,260
sometimes confuse for the effects of

333
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:31,740
miracine is actually a result of a high

334
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:34,639
THC concentration whereas Dan was always

335
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,220
selecting for plants based on

336
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:42,000
they're again how they made him feel not

337
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,399
on the basis of a lab report and so I

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,740
think that there's something to that

339
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,320
ceiling lists high that really Clarity

340
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,879
that you get from smoking you know what

341
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,760
you're

342
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,980
referring to as the the sativas I call

343
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,659
them equatorials those more equatorial

344
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,459
plants

345
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,319
um that they were not really bred for

346
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,119
high cannabinoid content they're really

347
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,220
in that lighter

348
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,539
what I would call the lighter class of

349
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,980
of cannabis

350
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:12,719
and you know for for you know I I'm I'm

351
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,899
mid 40s so I'm going to say younger

352
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,700
generation but you know obviously we're

353
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,860
now not the younger generation anymore

354
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,360
but I think in regards to the folks that

355
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,120
were smoking a lot during the 60s and

356
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
70s and and early 80s and and working

357
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,600
back then

358
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,458
you know those types of headspace you

359
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,839
hear it all the time where these these

360
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,958
older hippie Elders are from our

361
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,880
community say you know today's cannabis

362
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,739
is too strong and we don't have those

363
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,799
unique head spaces that you used to be

364
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,620
able to get from the Acapulco Golds and

365
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,479
the Hawaiians and the ties

366
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,519
and I have a theory and I you know I

367
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,920
haven't confirmed this 100 obviously but

368
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,440
but my theory is that a lot of those

369
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,778
head spaces that you that you could get

370
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,820
back then were because the Cannabis

371
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,639
actually wasn't stronger than you know

372
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,680
even 15 cannabis right

373
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,360
in Canada I mean I'm in Canada and now

374
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,479
we have this legal you know this

375
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,980
National legalization system and the

376
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,778
provincial Distributors that buy the

377
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,519
Cannabis from The Growers they really

378
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:14,240
don't want to even look at anything less

379
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,240
than 20 percent

380
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,700
um which is crazy because I mean if you

381
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,500
make that if you if you transfer that

382
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,778
analogy over to the alcohol industry

383
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,299
that would wipe out most of the wines

384
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,740
and all of the beers and the you know

385
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:27,120
the ciders and all that kind of stuff

386
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,799
and really push

387
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,320
into

388
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,120
the the spirit world right the the

389
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,560
whiskeys and the Gins and the vodkas all

390
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,860
that kind of stuff

391
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,479
and I think that having a regulatory

392
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,940
system where

393
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,459
that that encourages us to just start

394
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,160
chasing high THC numbers is actually not

395
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,778
a great way to be producing cannabis

396
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,240
because again we're not

397
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:53,039
we're not

398
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,680
considering the way that these plants

399
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,078
make people feel the younger generation

400
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,819
that's all they've grown up with you

401
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,939
know they a lot of these kids start with

402
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:06,600
dabs and stuff so you get a lot more THC

403
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,360
they they get a lot larger dose of THC

404
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,440
and it's again like I said that's my

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
personal

406
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,160
my personal belief that that's actually

407
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,919
one of the things that's leading to this

408
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,679
what I call THC lethargy

409
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,719
right we try to

410
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,879
in in the community we try to say oh

411
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,259
terpenolene or limonene or pinene they

412
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,179
make you up they give you an up

413
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,578
perspective

414
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,559
um but and then mircin brings you down

415
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:33,599
but the truth is is that we actually

416
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,819
haven't done those type of studies yet

417
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,220
to be able to say that conclusively and

418
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,199
and legally in most countries you can't

419
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,759
do that kind of study

420
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,620
um for example in Canada the the

421
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,838
licensed producers here

422
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,278
they need a special license to consume

423
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
the Cannabis that they're producing on

424
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,240
site right if they want to if a grower

425
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,160
wants to smoke his own weed and they

426
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,539
don't have that license they have to

427
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,278
sell it to the liquor distribution board

428
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,198
and it goes out to the distributor to

429
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,698
the the retailer and then they have to

430
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,799
go and buy their cannabis retail before

431
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,078
they can even try it that's kind of

432
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,198
bizarre right like imagine you're you're

433
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,000
a winter or a master Brewer and you

434
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,919
couldn't taste your wine or your beard

435
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,078
during the production process it's kind

436
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,299
of it's kind of insane but that's what

437
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,099
we've ended up with in the regulatory

438
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,120
system so

439
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,579
um

440
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,259
being in this legal system has really

441
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,179
forced people to start saying okay we

442
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,439
can't smoke the plants so what we're

443
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:27,359
going to do is send them all to a

444
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,880
laboratory and then pick the one with

445
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,320
the highest THC well imagine you did

446
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,600
that for whiskey or wine right you don't

447
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,160
go into the wine store and say okay I

448
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,079
need a I need a nice raw with the

449
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,698
highest alcohol content it's just not

450
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,120
the way that we consume those products

451
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:44,039
and so it's kind of weird that that has

452
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,860
been the way that we're now marketing

453
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,740
and advertising cannabis

454
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,259
yeah wow what a phenomenal explanation

455
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,600
right there you raise such a brilliant

456
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,360
analogy in regards to you know like the

457
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,159
high alcohol content and something which

458
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,620
has been brought up in Prior episodes is

459
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,600
this idea of should cannabis be treated

460
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,359
just like tomatoes should it be treated

461
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,818
like alcohol I guess it is a bit of a

462
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,678
sort of complex question where do you

463
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:12,539
sit on that one what do you think should

464
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,400
be the general regulatory framework

465
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,379
around cannabis or does it need its own

466
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,419
new one

467
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,179
I think we have to take pieces of all

468
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,160
the different regulatory systems I'm of

469
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,559
the opinion that cannabis is a drug

470
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,819
right it's a psychoactive substance and

471
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,678
that doesn't mean that it's dangerous

472
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,960
but it does mean that we don't want to

473
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,519
be you know I I was I was in high school

474
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,319
and I was smoking cannabis but I think

475
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,779
if I was designing a regulatory system

476
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,000
as an adult that I would probably say

477
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,639
yeah like kids under

478
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,839
well I don't really want to set the age

479
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,120
because it would probably be younger

480
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,339
than most but um I think that there's

481
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,859
probably enough scientific

482
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:53,339
data to say hey yeah we actually we

483
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:57,240
shouldn't provide high THC cannabis to

484
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:58,980
um to kids under 18. and you know

485
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,038
not that I necessarily agree with that

486
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,660
as a personal ethic but I because I

487
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,298
don't believe that it's that as

488
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,120
dangerous as it's made to seem

489
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:12,720
um but part of using psychoactive

490
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:15,000
substances in any culture is a a taught

491
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,579
experience right that's

492
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,099
cultural information that's passed down

493
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:23,339
from the elders to the younger

494
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,619
generation and I think that you know

495
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,879
people need to be of a certain age to

496
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,798
really appreciate

497
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,840
how to truly start using these

498
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,000
substances properly

499
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,619
um you know when I was like 13 and 14

500
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,779
and sitting around the table at

501
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,279
Christmas dinner you know the kids in my

502
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,519
family my brother and I we were allowed

503
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,558
to have a very small glass of wine

504
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,639
um you know all the parents were having

505
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,139
it and this is kind of one of those

506
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,700
things as kids it's like why don't we

507
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,900
why don't we get to have a little taste

508
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,240
too and I don't think there's anything

509
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,640
dangerous of letting

510
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,099
um children have or not let's not say

511
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,919
children but young teens have a small

512
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,839
taste of wine in the context of a family

513
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,120
celebration

514
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,579
um at the dinner table do I want that

515
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,259
child then going and taking a bottle of

516
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:09,659
wine and hanging out with his friends

517
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:12,058
probably not right even though you know

518
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,220
obviously Most teens do that they try to

519
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:16,440
get beer or alcohol for the weekend

520
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,298
I think again as an adult if I were

521
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,740
designing a system for that I probably

522
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,720
wouldn't

523
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,400
create a situation where it was easy for

524
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,100
them to get access

525
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,080
right yeah look I wholeheartedly agree

526
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,178
with you and nothing new here being said

527
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,918
but the the study is pretty conclusively

528
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,640
show that a lot of European countries

529
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,380
that follow the sort of style of

530
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,600
introducing small amounts of alcohol in

531
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,679
family settings like it's shown to be

532
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,619
beneficial because you're kind of

533
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,500
normalizing it right

534
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:49,079
yeah well you can't I mean if you want

535
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,240
young adults to make responsible choices

536
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,038
you have to respect them and treat them

537
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,440
as intelligent enough to make their own

538
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,839
choice right and part of that is giving

539
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,640
them the tools so that when they do

540
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,019
encounter these substances on their own

541
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,759
later in life that they know how to

542
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,200
interact with them and you know

543
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,200
reasonably and that's kind of what I

544
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,919
think where my mom's

545
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,319
um

546
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,940
you know her idea was was behind letting

547
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,460
us have small things about it is again

548
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,080
it's cultural knowledge it's part of

549
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,120
teaching people how to interact with

550
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,519
these substances substances in a

551
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,279
responsible way

552
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,500
um and I think this is don't you know

553
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,418
this just say no all drugs are bad

554
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,220
approach I mean it obviously doesn't

555
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,620
work

556
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,240
um and I think it sets up children for

557
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:35,099
to believe you know because again you

558
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,558
hear drugs are bad drugs are bad don't

559
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,058
touch cannabis it's bad too and then

560
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,038
when people try cannabis they realize

561
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:43,740
that it's not what

562
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,179
the elders told them it was right and

563
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,038
then now you've created a situation

564
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,538
where the younger generation doesn't

565
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,298
trust the people that are trying to

566
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,740
teach them life lessons on how to

567
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,139
you know how to go about interacting

568
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,640
with these substances through life so my

569
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,820
personal opinion is to just be

570
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,559
responsible and educated and arm the the

571
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,240
kids with as much information so that

572
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,339
they can then go on and make responsible

573
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,798
choices right

574
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,418
Yeah a hundred percent I am one of the

575
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,038
biggest Advocates you'll find of like

576
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,538
harm reduction and I think that it's

577
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,740
totally in line with that sort of

578
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,019
philosophy

579
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,700
a question which kind of stems off that

580
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:19,679
a little bit which I have been pondering

581
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,440
myself especially since picking up the

582
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,320
Vape as my preferred ingestion method is

583
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,580
that I do wonder if as you reference you

584
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,619
know a lot of the younger generation

585
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:31,500
they they might have started out on dabs

586
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:34,379
and I feel like the question needs to be

587
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,380
asked if that sort of excessive

588
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,600
saturation of the THC receptors could

589
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,100
have some deleterious effect just in

590
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,158
terms of maybe even just your own

591
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:46,139
ability to enjoy the plan I know that at

592
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,700
periods of time when I've been smoking

593
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,500
particularly heavy you can kind of

594
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,480
notice like you're not getting as high

595
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,679
what's your thoughts on that do you

596
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,319
think that like some amount of

597
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,120
self-restraint actually could lead to a

598
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,158
more long-term enjoyment of the plant

599
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,379
and the concentrates in general

600
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,120
yeah absolutely and we you know we know

601
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,159
this with opioid receptors and it's it's

602
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,439
showing true as well with cannabinoid

603
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,059
receptors is that when you drive one of

604
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,820
these neurochemical systems with an

605
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:13,918
excess of the ligand or the molecule

606
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,359
that is binding to these receptors that

607
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,620
The receptors do something called they

608
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,959
go undergo a process called down

609
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:21,538
regulation where they actually become

610
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,659
fewer receptors and that's kind of like

611
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:26,879
a way to balance for you know your they

612
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,460
the cells want to maintain that level of

613
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,320
signal that is being passed from the the

614
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,960
post-synaptic presynaptic nerve to the

615
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:36,899
postsynaptic nerve where the receptor is

616
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,480
located right so essentially we have a

617
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,700
natural or endogenous signal

618
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,038
you know you can assign it any kind of

619
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,200
value you want call it a hundred that

620
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,839
goes from the presynaptic nerve to the

621
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,538
postsynaptic nerve terminal and when we

622
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,879
when that you know your body has a

623
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:56,220
natural level of endogenous opioids that

624
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,780
exists and work in that system and so

625
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,519
when we smoke cannabis what we're doing

626
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,678
is we're driving that system harder

627
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:06,119
we're we're putting in a molecule that

628
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,880
mimics the endogenous ligand and that

629
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:12,058
essentially overdrives the system so

630
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,159
we're now we're giving the The receptors

631
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,379
a much greater signal than they're used

632
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,419
to and so for them to compensate what

633
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,039
they do is they they down regulate the

634
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,320
number of receptors and it kind of

635
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,940
brings the the nut the amount of signal

636
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,819
going from the previous nerve to the

637
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,659
post nerve down into the similar type of

638
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,960
line

639
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,840
and when we when we then pull away

640
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,600
that exogenous signal we stop smoking

641
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,759
cannabis your body is now compensated so

642
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,399
you're actually now getting too little

643
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,720
signal and that's a case of

644
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,179
um you know that's what we call

645
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,240
withdrawal really right

646
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,240
um

647
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,980
so yeah I think that it's probably it's

648
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,480
probably it's you know in terms of using

649
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,779
cannabis and being a cannabis user

650
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,700
tolerance breaks are really good for you

651
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,918
um people obviously need these compounds

652
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,259
for using for medicine but I don't think

653
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,740
any of these you know I'm going to call

654
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,579
them quote sacred plants

655
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,159
um

656
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,558
or medicinal plants I don't think it's a

657
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,600
great idea to be using them all the time

658
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:18,178
right there's there's something to be

659
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,918
said for taking breaks and having

660
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,419
moments of clarity and you know if you

661
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,059
do that you take a couple of weeks off

662
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,280
of consuming cannabis you will find just

663
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,839
like you said that when you go back to

664
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,079
it the same amount that you were using

665
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,939
two weeks ago has a much greater effect

666
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,740
um so that's one thing on that topic

667
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,600
another thing that's kind of interesting

668
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,859
on the topic

669
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:42,779
that I don't think any

670
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,298
um any markets have really truly

671
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:47,940
embraced yet is the type 2 cannabis so

672
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:50,579
cannabis that has a balance of CBD and

673
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,700
THC of you know most people know the the

674
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:55,379
variety catatonic from from resin seeds

675
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,740
in Spain

676
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,020
um and that's that's a type 2 plant and

677
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,240
the thing that makes type 2 plants

678
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,639
you know different from the high THC

679
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,500
plants is that they produce about 50 of

680
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,659
their

681
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,019
um total cannabinoid fraction as CBD

682
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:17,100
rather than THC and there's just the

683
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,240
beginnings of uh scientific research

684
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,619
that are being done in kind of the

685
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,679
Neuroscience community in the Health

686
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,599
Community that show that having that

687
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,740
little bit of a CBD buffer in your

688
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,579
experience

689
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,620
actually might provide some

690
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:33,839
um some safety against the things that

691
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,939
you were talking about you know

692
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,918
over over driving your system with

693
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,840
massive amounts of dabs all the time

694
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,600
right

695
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,178
um so there might even be a safety

696
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,319
aspect too to having CBD in in the

697
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,659
context again of what we were talking

698
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,859
about before with children or kids under

699
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,740
20

700
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,899
you know maybe the solution is to have

701
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,519
them only have access to type 2 cannabis

702
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,860
right they don't get access to have

703
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,379
access of the really truly potent stuff

704
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:03,058
until they turn 18 or 20.

705
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,340
um I don't know how you would go about

706
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:07,259
enforcing that but it's you know it's

707
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:10,319
something to consider I think that that

708
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:13,259
whole area of the CBD buffer is

709
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,480
something that um

710
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,038
really hasn't been explored very much by

711
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,558
the community and I think it has a

712
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,919
potential for use

713
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:25,019
yeah of course of course and I think a

714
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,360
topic in general which we're kind of

715
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,220
skirting around slash touching on a

716
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,139
little bit is something which a lot of

717
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,179
people really don't want to acknowledge

718
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,720
is that there can be like sort of

719
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,159
downsides or excessive use of cannabis

720
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,159
and I think a lot of people are really

721
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,340
just so invested in this idea of

722
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,440
cannabis is 100 safe it's non-harm for

723
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,658
you and I always have a bit of a problem

724
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,000
with that because it's like there's many

725
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,340
cases of like people smoking cannabis

726
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,558
and then unfortunately running in front

727
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:57,359
of a car like not on purpose but like I

728
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,339
just find it hard to stomach when people

729
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,500
just raise it like there's no possible

730
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,178
downsides to her kids I I started

731
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,919
smoking 12 years old it should be fine

732
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,600
and as you've said like it is worth

733
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,520
considering if that's actually a

734
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,558
realistically true statement because

735
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,900
you're a kind of experience as a child

736
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,720
doesn't represent everyone's and it's it

737
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,059
is worth considering what's best for a

738
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,460
12 year old a 15 year old or an 18 year

739
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:22,619
old so yeah I really like that sentiment

740
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,940
you'd Express right there yeah well and

741
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,558
just like there's different types of

742
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,100
cannabis I think people need to be aware

743
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,740
that you know human are are individual

744
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,839
neurochemical makeup is different from

745
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,419
person to person

746
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,538
um and so it's not only necessarily

747
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:41,759
about the chemistry of the plant there's

748
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:44,759
variability in the chemical in the

749
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,700
neurochemistry of the population and we

750
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,019
really don't know

751
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,278
um you know I have a lot of friends and

752
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,900
they're just like cannabis isn't for me

753
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:53,400
or I had friends that were in you know I

754
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,480
was in high school with and I used to

755
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,860
smoke with them and then they got a

756
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,599
little bit older and they they tell me

757
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,699
you know I just I just realized it

758
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,158
wasn't good for me it wasn't making me

759
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,140
feel healthy mentally stable I I knew

760
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,820
another lovely little not a lovely

761
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,220
little girl but a lovely girl and she

762
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,200
was in her early 30s and when I met her

763
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,960
she was smoking Fair bit of cannabis and

764
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,298
she got right into it and I watched her

765
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,298
go through a mental spiral like I've

766
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:19,500
never seen on anyone and you know to the

767
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,440
point that she thought that there was

768
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,659
people in the in in the light switches

769
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,360
in the you know the electrical outlets

770
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,400
and then you know she was putting like

771
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,079
tin foil on top of light fixtures and

772
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,000
stuff it was really bizarre behavior but

773
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,960
she definitely wasn't using any other

774
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,019
drug

775
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,640
and the canvas wasn't helping her

776
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,679
so

777
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,720
um to have this and I actually

778
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,340
substituted her cannabis I took all our

779
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
cannabis away from her gave her a bunch

780
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:50,278
of CBD cannabis that had no THC in it

781
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,558
and um

782
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,179
it seemed to help a little bit but at

783
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,178
that point in time I think again she had

784
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,580
she had overdriven her endocannabinoid

785
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,320
system so hard that just with her

786
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,759
particular neurochemistry it didn't work

787
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,200
for her

788
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,658
um so anybody that says you know all

789
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,220
cannabis is medicine and you know it's

790
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:11,460
no matter how you use it it's medical

791
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,380
that to me is just not true

792
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,659
um because I've seen it right I've seen

793
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,980
it happen and it's well documented in

794
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,899
the scientific literature in the medical

795
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,700
literature

796
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:23,038
um that there is a small subset of

797
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,240
people and we don't know whether it's

798
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,000
their genetics or their Euro

799
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,798
neurochemistry but whatever it is

800
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,778
cannabis doesn't interact well with them

801
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,418
and

802
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:36,119
um when you're looking at creating a

803
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,500
regulated market or a system as a

804
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,058
government official you have to be

805
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,339
thinking about

806
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,558
the lowest common denominator right you

807
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,319
have to make your safety barriers safe

808
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:48,720
for everybody not just the top 90

809
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:53,220
percent right it's not okay just if 10

810
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,360
people suffer from using the product so

811
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,538
um

812
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,418
yeah being aware of the different types

813
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:03,538
of cannabis I think is important

814
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:06,659
but also this idea that all cannabis use

815
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:08,879
is harmless is probably not I don't

816
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,740
think that's a really responsible way to

817
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,500
think about it you know

818
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,538
so just to jump back to the concentrates

819
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,819
topic we were discussing a moment ago

820
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:20,099
something which has always been an

821
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:21,359
interest to me is that someone I can't

822
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,639
remember who it was unfortunately but

823
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,398
they pointed out to me that a lot of the

824
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,919
technology and especially the techniques

825
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,079
used in extraction processing these days

826
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,759
are actually very old school technology

827
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,579
like there's patterns going back to the

828
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,919
1920s and 30s which outline a lot of the

829
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:40,918
methods currently being used and sort of

830
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,659
presented as like The Cutting Edge I

831
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,659
figured you'd be better to ask than

832
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:47,580
anyone have you seen any genuine new

833
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,140
advances in extraction or do you feel

834
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,960
like it's true to what I said where it

835
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,299
is all kind of rehashed old technology

836
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,038
yeah I mean all the old you know we've

837
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,099
had a lot of really great Chemists in

838
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:00,839
the world phytochemists in the world for

839
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:03,178
150 years at least

840
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,918
um and it's kind of one of those those

841
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,019
stories where there's nothing new Under

842
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,580
the Sun right

843
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,918
um maybe people are modifying old

844
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:13,079
techniques but yeah this is all like you

845
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,520
know even distillation for THC or you

846
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,819
know fractional distillation or for

847
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,179
example the the butane extracts

848
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:24,359
um those type of of alkane carbohydrate

849
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,360
or uh

850
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,579
those those alkane extractions they all

851
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,919
really have their roots in other

852
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,898
Industries and maybe people are changing

853
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,919
things a little bit temperature all that

854
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:36,959
kind of stuff

855
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,919
to optimize it but I think for the most

856
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,659
part it's not most of it's not that new

857
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,179
um it's just new to cannabis because

858
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,620
cannabis is because of prohibition it's

859
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,059
been left out of so many different

860
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,500
systems a lot of people just couldn't

861
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:51,898
touch the plant

862
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,058
right you know 30 years ago you had to

863
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:57,239
be pretty rebellious to actually be

864
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:57,960
braving the penalties

865
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,359
um

866
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,298
and it just it kept a lot of people that

867
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:05,459
can teach the Cannabis community

868
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:06,538
different techniques or sets of

869
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,460
knowledge

870
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:10,440
it just kept them away

871
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,659
um so at least in Canada

872
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,038
now we're starting to integrate all that

873
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,278
you know we're able to collaborate with

874
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:19,859
people and in existing Industries

875
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,679
and tap into all that that knowledge

876
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:25,678
base that they have right because again

877
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,298
cannabis is just another plant

878
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,980
um it's a different plant but you know

879
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:30,480
we can use all the same kind of science

880
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,919
that we use on all the other plants in

881
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,980
the world

882
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,899
Yeah a hundred percent and I mean in

883
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,120
line with that idea I think I was

884
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:41,398
reading an article written by a CBD

885
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,500
extractor who was trying to figure out

886
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,199
why they were getting such high Returns

887
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,419
on their CBD extractions and what they

888
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,240
hypothesized was that some of the

889
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,000
terpenes you find in CBD cultivars the

890
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,859
type 2 cultivars may actually be acting

891
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,679
as kind of like almost an industrial

892
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,898
solvent in the process and helping to

893
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,640
extract more things through that solvent

894
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:04,558
being present have you heard anything

895
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,600
about this and if that were to be true

896
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,339
do you think that might indicate that

897
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,740
breeding for certain terpene

898
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:14,720
predominance could be like a good idea

899
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,720
if your main goal is extraction

900
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:19,679
um

901
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,840
I don't know if they would Aid in

902
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,179
extraction you can definitely optimize

903
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,918
cultivars through breeding for

904
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,000
extraction

905
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,799
um that was one of the things that we

906
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,359
did when I was down in California is we

907
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,579
were we were not only looking at the

908
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,439
terpene profiles of plants but actually

909
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,819
measuring their overall terpene output

910
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,019
we were kind of one of the first groups

911
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,700
to do that

912
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,319
and

913
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,419
um you know we were finding plants you

914
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,339
typically we had a we called the you

915
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,620
know our friends at SC Labs called it

916
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:49,019
the swag flag but we typically

917
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:51,898
would eliminate any plant that was under

918
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,700
one percent total terpene content if it

919
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:54,898
didn't have

920
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,019
um you know

921
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:59,639
10 milligrams of terpenes per gram that

922
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:02,159
was out it just didn't make the list

923
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,620
unless it had some other characteristic

924
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,840
that was so unique about the plant you

925
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,000
know for example we came across a thcv

926
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,259
plant that we kept

927
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,059
um because that's a really rare

928
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,679
cannabinoid but the terpene profile on

929
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:15,960
the plant sucked it was horrible it's

930
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,300
not like hemp and it just wasn't it

931
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,280
wasn't oily it was just not really tasty

932
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,099
to consume and

933
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,619
um so that became one of our lower

934
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,659
limits and we through time we would

935
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,039
raise that number

936
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,200
um you know one and a half two percent

937
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,878
for of tripping content and anything

938
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,219
below that we wouldn't keep because the

939
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,898
idea was to be making these plants

940
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,358
produce as much not only the right

941
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:42,960
complement of terpene the right set of

942
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:45,000
terpenes but also we wanted to have them

943
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,820
produce more terpenes

944
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,858
right and there's definitely a whole lot

945
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,240
of world there where we can be take you

946
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,279
know because it might be for example

947
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,138
we're talking about making dabs and you

948
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,339
want to have a full I'm going to call I

949
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,838
hate the word but I'm going to use it

950
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:04,440
anyway these full terpene extract

951
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:07,139
plants you know you might want to have

952
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,900
end up with a dab or with a you know

953
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:12,059
your concentrate that is

954
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,019
really high in terpenes but say it only

955
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:17,880
has 40 total cannabinoids right as

956
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:20,639
opposed to a lot of terpenes and 80

957
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,200
total cannabinoids and I I'm sure most

958
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,480
of the community is probably listening

959
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,819
to me say those things right now and

960
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,559
thinking well that's not what I want

961
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,420
um

962
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:31,739
but again getting back to this

963
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,619
discussion where we were talking about

964
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:36,419
how things make you feel

965
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,099
um there definitely is going to be a

966
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,539
whole subset of the population that for

967
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,680
them you know they're not they don't

968
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,500
want to drink whiskey they want to drink

969
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,858
wine right they want to they want to

970
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,838
Vape on a pen all night not have one

971
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:51,539
puff and become a toast

972
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:53,279
and this is something that I hear from a

973
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:54,420
lot of you know the older hippies that

974
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,700
I'm in touch with in the community

975
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,559
because you know it's kind of it's it's

976
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:00,419
kind of funny when you say it that way

977
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,219
but it's like you know it's like oh you

978
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,720
kids today your music is too loud it's

979
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,239
like are you kids today your weed is

980
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:08,399
just too strong but it's true for them

981
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,759
right you know I bring over an OG Kush

982
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,980
to a party at like uh you know a family

983
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,440
or so older family member's house and

984
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,960
pass it around the campfire and they're

985
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,820
out right they're staring at the wall

986
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,858
for the next three hours

987
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,780
and they don't just they don't want that

988
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:28,259
right why would you want that that's not

989
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,060
fun right I mean for you know for every

990
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,800
occasional kind of thing but that's just

991
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,539
to them that's not what cannabis was

992
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,000
right cannabis was something that they

993
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:38,460
could sit around the campfire and smoke

994
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,119
all night and enjoy the flavor of their

995
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,159
of their Dube right

996
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,680
um so there's something to be said about

997
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,480
about breeding plants that have lots of

998
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,460
flavor and they don't punch you in the

999
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
face when you smoke them

1000
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,539
right

1001
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,700
um it may not be for you it may not be

1002
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:58,440
for everybody but I think that we have

1003
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,118
to start thinking about making cannabis

1004
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,800
more accessible to other people and how

1005
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,900
can we do that right what are the things

1006
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,400
we need to do that is it using these

1007
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,680
type 2 varieties with a little bit of

1008
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,780
CBD in them you know maybe even even in

1009
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,779
in Switzerland you know I don't know if

1010
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,820
you've heard about uh the CBD markets

1011
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,160
they're now selling CBD cigarettes and

1012
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,400
grocery stores in Switzerland

1013
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:23,159
and um their type 3 plants which have

1014
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,160
you know lots of CBD and almost no THC

1015
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:29,098
in them they're they're effectively hemp

1016
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,858
but if you can make hemp taste like an

1017
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,599
OG kush or you can make it taste like a

1018
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,219
really flavorful Haze or something

1019
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,539
really nice that's it's nice for people

1020
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,699
to consume

1021
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:41,039
again it might not be what most of the

1022
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:43,439
people listening to this podcast want

1023
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,820
but if we can create a whole nother

1024
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,400
segment

1025
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,000
of the population that are embracing

1026
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,599
cannabis and benefiting from cannabis

1027
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,639
um

1028
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,220
I think that that's great and they don't

1029
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,480
need to be high you know it's it's I

1030
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:58,919
think it's just great that we can have

1031
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,199
more people having a relationship with

1032
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,480
this fantastic plant

1033
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,639
yeah I wholeheartedly agree and I think

1034
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,099
it is one of those things where when you

1035
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,679
are an everyday smoker just puffing away

1036
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:12,720
on your OG cush it does seem like a very

1037
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,299
foreign idea and I am a little bit

1038
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,039
guilty of falling into that trap you

1039
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,740
mentioned of you know old people wanting

1040
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,719
the the less strong weed and just kind

1041
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:23,338
of being a bit perplexed at the idea but

1042
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,139
nowadays I find myself in that same

1043
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:27,420
position and I've got this newfound

1044
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,279
appreciation for the orange strains

1045
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,320
which maybe classically aren't

1046
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,760
considered as strong but boy is the

1047
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,760
flavor nice

1048
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,599
yeah yeah and the truth is we can bring

1049
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,180
breed those things to to be high THC we

1050
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,400
can breed them to be a mixed ratio of

1051
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,379
CBT to THC and we can also breed those

1052
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,960
same flavors to be in the CBD plants

1053
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:54,180
right that's just a matter of of making

1054
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,940
the right crosses and selections and um

1055
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:59,338
I I one of the things I love about

1056
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,780
cannabis is the diversity that it brings

1057
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:04,619
as a plant

1058
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,240
and you know who am I to say now only

1059
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:08,820
these ones are the ones we're going to

1060
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,379
use I I kind of see my job as a breeder

1061
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,838
is to make all the different types

1062
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,760
available and then the doctors and the

1063
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,139
Stoners and the and you know everybody's

1064
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,760
going to figure out what works for them

1065
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:19,799
the patients

1066
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,079
but at least they have the opportunity

1067
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,079
to do that when we can provide this

1068
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,160
broad selection of chemotypes

1069
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,200
um

1070
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,879
you know not everybody needs the THC

1071
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,858
stuff that's great if you like the THC

1072
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,838
stuff I like the THC stuff I mean that's

1073
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:36,420
kind of where that's kind of my go-to

1074
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,880
I'm not saying don't use high THC

1075
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,460
cannabis but I'm just saying if if we

1076
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,380
can have more people have a relationship

1077
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:48,240
with cannabis because we make them tasty

1078
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:52,440
tasty cultivars of high CBD low THC you

1079
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:56,939
know flower that's to me that's a win

1080
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,800
yeah no I I wholeheartedly agree so uh

1081
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,139
just to jump back to kind of some

1082
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,000
terpene talk for just a moment I'd love

1083
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:05,338
to hear your thoughts on whether you

1084
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,159
feel that it's becoming a more common

1085
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:10,139
Trend that people are adding terpenes

1086
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,659
either to concentrates maybe even trying

1087
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,759
to infuse flour that is maybe a bit less

1088
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:17,819
than ideal in its terpene content with

1089
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,000
external turpins do you feel like this

1090
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,260
is deleterious advantageous and do you

1091
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,239
feel like there's any benefit because

1092
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,640
there's a lot of discussion around oh

1093
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,439
it's non-cannabis derived terpenes and

1094
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,480
that's inferior to cannabis derived

1095
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,000
terpenes but the the inner chemist in me

1096
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,440
thinks mess ends missing man like you

1097
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,900
know what's your thoughts

1098
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,240
yeah same I will just bring it back to

1099
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,980
water I mean you can make you know you

1100
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:44,338
can make water in a lab by combining

1101
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,619
hydrogen and oxygen or you can take

1102
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,838
um sewer water and distill out pure

1103
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:50,220
water right which one would you rather

1104
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:52,739
drink

1105
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:55,379
the truth is if you purify them both

1106
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,239
they're both just water right it's the

1107
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,300
same thing no matter what the source is

1108
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:02,699
so to me water is water is water it's

1109
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,260
what's what's it contaminated with and

1110
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:06,899
that's the question there's two

1111
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,280
questions a is it contaminated okay so

1112
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,800
we're getting miracine from a different

1113
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,079
plant that's fine are we co-extracting

1114
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,000
anything else with the mirror scene

1115
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,300
you know so what are the contaminants in

1116
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,338
that that bottle of miracine that you're

1117
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,920
buying to dump on your flour or add to

1118
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:24,420
your concentrates that's the question

1119
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,059
um so what's the contaminant what's the

1120
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,380
levels of those contaminants and what's

1121
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,659
the health consequences of those

1122
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,300
contaminants

1123
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:35,399
um because plants make compounds that

1124
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,839
are poisonous to humans it's right

1125
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,700
that's what they do they try to defend

1126
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,440
themselves from us

1127
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:43,199
um and from you know any any plant

1128
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,579
that's a herbivorous

1129
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,239
um someone that's a test you know plant

1130
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,680
or an animal that's attacking a plant so

1131
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,838
these defense compounds can actually be

1132
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,879
bad for you so maybe we're going into

1133
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,619
some you know call it some weird

1134
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,180
lemongrass or something like that to try

1135
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,338
and find some terpenes to put into our

1136
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,799
cannabis

1137
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:03,119
it get the the potential is there that

1138
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,980
if their work

1139
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,720
um a secondary metabolite produced by

1140
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,119
the plant that was poisonous to humans

1141
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,219
that we co-extracted and now that's in

1142
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,019
with the mirror scene right and then

1143
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:14,578
that mirror scene enters the or that met

1144
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,440
that contaminated mirror scene enters

1145
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,820
the supply chain well that could be a

1146
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,119
problem

1147
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,920
the other thing that could be a problem

1148
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:25,619
is when we when we consume cannabis

1149
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,240
there's natural physiological levels of

1150
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,380
these chemicals that the plant can

1151
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:30,000
produce

1152
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,059
and

1153
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
the last 30 40 Years of science seems to

1154
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:38,159
show that there's no deleterious effect

1155
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,260
on human health by using those but it

1156
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,399
could be if we start making you know it

1157
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,280
might you know

1158
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,960
a lot of these these limonene

1159
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,220
terpenolene pinene a lot of these

1160
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,220
terpenes as you were saying earlier

1161
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,719
they're solvents right they they can

1162
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,578
dissolve cannabinoids but they can

1163
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:55,919
actually also dissolve like certain

1164
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,240
types of plastic or rubber you know

1165
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,619
Sam's Skunk Man was telling me a story

1166
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:59,939
but they had this Haze plant that they

1167
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,780
used to harvest in California I believe

1168
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,900
it was

1169
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,640
and if they had these rubber rings that

1170
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,139
sat on the top of the jars when they

1171
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,199
would close off and the rubber would

1172
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:12,059
seal in the jar but if you lit you left

1173
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,460
the them in there for three or four

1174
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:17,578
months the Terps would actually dissolve

1175
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:21,119
away the the rubber

1176
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,579
um so there's a potential issue with all

1177
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,559
these Plastics that we're using to you

1178
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,000
know to hold cannabis especially the

1179
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,279
cheaper stuff and again in a

1180
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,239
non-regulated market nobody's paying

1181
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,240
attention to these things

1182
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,359
um and they could have potential Health

1183
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,700
consequences for example if you if

1184
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:40,139
you're making high terp dabs and you're

1185
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,299
putting them in these plastic containers

1186
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:43,858
you can actually see sometimes when you

1187
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,220
when you clean out the container that

1188
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:50,098
the plastic has started to melt and did

1189
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:52,739
that did that plastic then melt into the

1190
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:56,039
dabs right are you now consuming these

1191
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,379
things so there's a lot of health issues

1192
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,539
um that I think we have to really keep

1193
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,300
at the Forefront of our planning as we

1194
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,858
go about creating regulated markets all

1195
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,119
over the world

1196
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:07,799
um and it doesn't mean that we shouldn't

1197
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,380
do it but it just means that we should

1198
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,960
have some kind of thought and really

1199
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,140
careful due diligence before just doing

1200
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,519
whatever we want as if you know as if

1201
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:19,799
the way that we have done things in the

1202
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,659
black market have have been the right

1203
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,339
way to do things right we've done them

1204
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,799
out of necessity

1205
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:28,139
typically for the past 50 years but it

1206
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,640
we might learn and we are learning with

1207
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:33,239
some of the chemicals that we spray on

1208
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:35,519
the plant that these things stick around

1209
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,959
right the the story used to be all you

1210
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,159
have your veg if you're in veg don't

1211
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,480
worry buddy you can spray on the plant

1212
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,879
that's not going to end up in the flower

1213
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,380
but [ __ ] we started doing the testing

1214
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,059
and it's like you know what it all ends

1215
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,099
up in the flower

1216
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:49,980
right so a lot of the practices that

1217
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,359
we've had in Black markets

1218
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,400
um they're not going to be the practices

1219
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,199
that we use in regulated markets and

1220
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,619
that's okay right it's all about

1221
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:01,199
advancing our understanding and creating

1222
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,240
a safe industry where people can use

1223
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,639
cannabis in as you know like you said

1224
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:09,239
from a harm reduction point of view it's

1225
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:12,598
as safe as it's safe as it can be

1226
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,799
yeah yep words of wisdom right there and

1227
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:15,480
I think you know you touch on a

1228
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,119
brilliant point that we've come a long

1229
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,119
way since the days of mycobutanal and uh

1230
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,619
butane soup but I guess a topic which

1231
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,180
stems from that and what you just

1232
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,460
discussed is there's a lot of current

1233
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:29,338
discussion and maybe even a bit of

1234
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,500
necessary discussion around vape pens

1235
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:34,559
particularly the ones that come from say

1236
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,420
China or other areas of the world where

1237
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,219
the the manufacturing standards are

1238
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,500
maybe a little less than what they are

1239
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:43,199
in other Western countries do you think

1240
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,599
that because of this issue and the

1241
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:49,379
necessity for there to be high quality

1242
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,539
assurance of quality that basically we

1243
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,700
will see the falling off of that or do

1244
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:55,679
you think that you know China and maybe

1245
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:57,539
even African produced products will

1246
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,759
eventually creep into the market over

1247
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:01,019
time and become the new dominant Force

1248
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,540
at Play

1249
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:06,000
with I think China is the dominant Force

1250
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:07,559
at play in all the Vape technology that

1251
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,179
we have at least in North America most

1252
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,519
of that stuff's not produced and I think

1253
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:13,980
I actually don't know any of it that's

1254
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,440
actually produced in North America

1255
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,480
um it all comes from China and you know

1256
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,740
I've I've got friends and relationships

1257
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,599
with people in some of these large

1258
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:24,179
Canadian multi-billion dollar companies

1259
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,160
and I know you know through speaking

1260
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:28,379
with them about

1261
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,179
um the issues that they've had in doing

1262
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,160
the due diligence I mean if you're gonna

1263
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:33,899
if you're a big massive company and

1264
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,118
you're going to put vape pens onto the

1265
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,680
market you know we've got call it 35

1266
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,780
million people here in Canada it's a

1267
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:43,739
little more but call out a market of you

1268
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:46,740
know call it five to ten million users

1269
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:48,419
that's a lot of that's a lot of Hardware

1270
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,239
that you need to ensure that you're not

1271
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,240
going to run out that you have a supply

1272
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:56,219
and being able to do the due diligence

1273
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,959
on the safety of those products coming

1274
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:00,899
from China I mean you know if you're

1275
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,300
ordering 500 000 vape pens or a million

1276
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,980
vape pens you're buying from one company

1277
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,119
and then they're like they're like we

1278
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,219
can't actually produce those all

1279
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,720
ourselves and they go and they Outsource

1280
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:11,818
them to another company

1281
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:13,919
right so you have to be doing all this

1282
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:15,838
batch testing because again if you're

1283
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,880
putting a product onto the market it's

1284
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,039
your ass right it's your responsibility

1285
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,480
to make sure that it's safe if it comes

1286
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:22,800
back and it's not safe it's your

1287
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,260
shareholders that are going to suffer

1288
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,200
not China

1289
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,960
um so they have to do these really deep

1290
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:32,519
dives into the you know Upstream to the

1291
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,079
manufacturers they go over there they

1292
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,818
check their metals they check the

1293
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,440
solders that they're putting

1294
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:40,079
that they're using to fuse the parts

1295
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,800
together to wire the you know the pens

1296
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,960
and everything so you really

1297
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,460
again all these things cannabis has been

1298
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,019
left out of all these systems for so

1299
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,818
long because it's a black market and

1300
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:52,980
people could just do whatever they want

1301
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:54,659
and you know I remember being

1302
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,159
you know in my younger years and it's

1303
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:57,838
like if you couldn't score and finally

1304
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,338
you you got something you were stoked

1305
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,199
right just because you got something you

1306
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:03,299
were able to you're able to

1307
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,338
to find your wheat I wasn't a Beer

1308
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,960
Drinker or anything so when I was in

1309
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:09,000
high school and University I didn't

1310
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,980
really consume alcohol

1311
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,838
um

1312
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:14,280
cannabis was my thing and so if I ever

1313
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:15,659
didn't have cannabis and you had to go

1314
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,280
and buy you know you're on the street

1315
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,659
looking for something and it was just

1316
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,400
supply and demand it was what was

1317
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:21,838
available

1318
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,880
um and if you could find something then

1319
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,460
you were satisfied but that's probably

1320
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,858
not a very good you know way to go about

1321
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:31,079
doing things right like if you're if

1322
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,519
you're looking for steak you're not just

1323
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:35,220
going to pick up any old meat that's

1324
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,079
lying on the on the supermarket floor or

1325
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:38,939
on the road right you want to be buying

1326
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,500
high quality products where you know

1327
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,039
where they come from and you know that

1328
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,420
they've been made with respect

1329
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,039
and treated with respect and the plants

1330
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,358
have not been sprayed with pesticides

1331
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,300
right you don't want to consume all that

1332
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:54,299
kind of stuff it's just not good for you

1333
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:56,400
and inevitably in a black market

1334
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,460
you do see a ton of that I mean in

1335
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,440
California we did some studies and vast

1336
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,000
vast amounts of the the Cannabis that's

1337
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,059
on the market is like you said it's got

1338
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,420
microbutanil in it or it's got mold on

1339
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:10,858
it or it's got a bacteria growing on it

1340
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,680
um

1341
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:15,659
and that's not all right you know in in

1342
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,179
the legal food production systems when

1343
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,679
there's you know we had one couple weeks

1344
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:21,539
ago the onions were coming up from the

1345
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,338
states red onions and they had uh

1346
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:25,980
salmonella on them

1347
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:27,659
so a legal Market we have recall systems

1348
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,920
to recall all that product and make sure

1349
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:30,779
that it doesn't get into the hands of

1350
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,700
people and when it does get into the

1351
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,260
hands of people it's on the news so

1352
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,919
everybody knows hey don't eat your

1353
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,000
onions right take them off the menu

1354
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,818
um because people are going to get sick

1355
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,358
and black market cannabis systems don't

1356
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:47,219
have those safeguards

1357
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,679
um

1358
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:51,719
and we need them right

1359
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,279
a lot of Growers are you know they get

1360
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,679
week five

1361
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,960
week four even all of a sudden they get

1362
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,818
a big spider mite

1363
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,960
um infestation that's going to kill the

1364
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:02,759
crop

1365
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,318
and they got two choices you kill the

1366
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,300
crop and start again

1367
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,559
or you spray it with someone God the

1368
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,720
chemical

1369
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,960
and cross your fingers and that way you

1370
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:15,659
can pay your mortgage unfortunately

1371
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,079
you know paying the mortgage is it's one

1372
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:21,659
of the major excuses for for many many

1373
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,220
evils in the world today

1374
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,199
people are just doing it because they're

1375
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:27,000
trying to get by and so you can

1376
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,500
understand why it happens there's not a

1377
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,539
lot of Honor in putting those products

1378
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,519
in the market but again when people are

1379
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:34,380
desperate for money or just paying the

1380
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:36,659
bill or they're just trying to get by or

1381
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,980
feed their families they often make

1382
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,420
choices that aren't in the best

1383
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,760
interests of the people that are going

1384
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:43,740
to be consuming their plants and really

1385
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,540
and again in Black Market systems they

1386
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:47,219
don't know the people that are consuming

1387
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:49,980
their weed they sell it to a guy and it

1388
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:52,139
gets shipped or it gets you know sold to

1389
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,519
a bunch of people they don't know and so

1390
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:55,618
there are a certain amount of people

1391
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,059
that will they'll just spray it and and

1392
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,500
not care about the consequences

1393
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:02,160
Downstream

1394
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,838
so regulated systems there they there

1395
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,299
are a lot of good things about them it's

1396
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,199
a pain in the ass to work in them but

1397
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:12,720
it's kind of the right thing to do

1398
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,639
yeah of course and I think that a lot of

1399
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,459
the frustration that comes from the

1400
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,980
Growers and in engaging in these systems

1401
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,599
is an idea you touched on earlier in

1402
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,940
that because historically they've never

1403
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,700
had to really pay attention to Quality

1404
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,740
Control quality assurance it now seems

1405
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:30,960
like this big Boogeyman when in reality

1406
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:32,399
it's a part of every established

1407
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,500
industry in the world and I think that

1408
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,260
if we do want to end up being like a

1409
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,539
wine industry or some sort of terroir

1410
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,220
based industry then there has to be a

1411
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:43,318
certain acceptance that these are just

1412
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:45,358
the necessary scaffolds that need to be

1413
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:47,219
put in place

1414
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,480
yeah and it's about pride in your

1415
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,039
product

1416
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,059
right

1417
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:52,019
um I know there's people that just make

1418
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:54,119
products because they just want to sell

1419
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:55,259
them make some money and but those

1420
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,599
aren't the products that I want to

1421
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,700
consume right I like products that are

1422
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,579
made by Artisans or that are you know

1423
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:04,439
grown by a farmer with pride for as for

1424
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,099
what he's making

1425
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,260
um

1426
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:09,539
same with wine you know

1427
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,980
but same with vegetables too I mean and

1428
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:13,739
and meats it's the same thing when

1429
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,980
people they understand the art and the

1430
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:19,199
science of their you know their chosen

1431
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,639
field they take pride in the work that

1432
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,219
they're doing

1433
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,960
and I don't know how you could be proud

1434
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:27,058
of putting

1435
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,800
cannabis on the market that you knew had

1436
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:34,319
a pesticide or a fungicide sprayed on it

1437
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,900
yeah of course so on to a little bit of

1438
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,239
a somewhat controversial topic but it's

1439
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,119
one I do feel really personally invested

1440
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,679
in tobacco and cannabis given we've

1441
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,318
discussed how we should be doing

1442
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:48,960
everything we can to kind of minimize

1443
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:52,199
the potential harmful compounds that are

1444
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,480
within cannabis pesticides heavy metals

1445
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:56,578
from Vape carts do you feel like there

1446
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,980
should be somewhat of an active effort

1447
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:00,780
to discourage the use of tobacco in

1448
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,940
conjunction with cannabis like what we

1449
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,079
see around General tobacco use or do you

1450
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,539
think it's just an each to their own

1451
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,400
sort of thing no I I think that we

1452
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:10,139
should actively tell people not to put

1453
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,420
back when they're cannabis it's insane I

1454
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:15,239
mean tobacco is a bronchial constrictor

1455
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:17,039
right if you smoke tobacco your lungs

1456
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,779
close on you automatically when you

1457
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,960
smoke cannabis your lungs open up it's a

1458
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:24,420
bronchodilator and so when you mix the

1459
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,400
two the healthcare the health minister

1460
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,960
in Canada I think it was like about 20

1461
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,180
years ago it might even been 25 years

1462
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,099
ago I remember her coming out and saying

1463
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:33,598
we're really not too too concerned about

1464
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:35,460
people consuming cannabis what we're

1465
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,440
concerned about is the mixing the two

1466
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,539
together because again the Cannabis

1467
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,240
opens up your lungs and it allows all

1468
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:45,358
those really bad things that are put on

1469
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:48,019
into tobacco and that just that those

1470
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,400
chemicals that a result of of

1471
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:52,079
tobacco combustion

1472
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,280
we don't need to be breathing that in it

1473
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,280
doesn't add to the experience

1474
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,920
um

1475
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:01,259
and it's again it's a cultural thing

1476
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,680
it's you know I think it's it ties back

1477
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:08,700
to the use of tobacco and hookahs

1478
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:10,500
um it became the norm in in Spain before

1479
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:12,058
the Cannabis culture really got going in

1480
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,000
Spain kind of in the late 90s early

1481
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:17,700
2000s it was a hash consuming country

1482
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,199
and so that they would get hash in

1483
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:20,818
Morocco and they'd mix it with tobacco

1484
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,460
and they'd smoke it that way and that

1485
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:27,119
became the norm same with Italy

1486
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:29,400
both countries are really quite

1487
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,280
accepting of tobacco it's just a

1488
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,019
cultural norm

1489
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,160
and even in Holland right like I don't

1490
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:36,300
know if you've ever been to Amsterdam

1491
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:38,219
but if you go to a coffee shop in

1492
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,359
Amsterdam you'll see a Dutch guy come in

1493
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:42,719
from the end of his work day and he'll

1494
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:45,539
sit down and ask for

1495
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:48,539
um a half gram or a gram of hash from

1496
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:51,358
the dealer and they'll take out a full

1497
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:53,099
cigarette and a one of these long jumbo

1498
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,679
sized papers and they break the entire

1499
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,280
cigarette out and they might take you

1500
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,159
know

1501
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,319
a tenth of a gram or two tenths of a

1502
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,759
gram and break up the hash into that and

1503
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:04,199
then they roll that in their entire

1504
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,280
cigarette and smoke the whole thing to

1505
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:07,858
themself

1506
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,500
well that's to me I mean I

1507
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:13,199
the taste of that alone would be enough

1508
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,300
for me to say just don't do it but from

1509
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,960
a health perspective

1510
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,640
I think that it it really makes the

1511
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,980
worst things about the tobacco more

1512
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,480
harmful right so from a harm reduction

1513
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,818
perspective

1514
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,099
don't smoke tobacco with your cannabis

1515
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:32,338
from a taste perspective

1516
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:35,338
Jesus please don't smoke

1517
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:37,380
cannabis right and I listen I grew up in

1518
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:39,719
Ottawa um which is very close to

1519
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:42,780
Montreal which is a port city kind of on

1520
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,459
the Eastern side of of Canada and so we

1521
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,440
would have a lot of hashish that would

1522
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,760
come in through the Montreal Port you

1523
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,280
know being like two or two and a half

1524
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,440
hours away that was the predominant form

1525
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,900
of cannabis that was available when I

1526
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,338
was younger and it wasn't until I was a

1527
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,039
little bit older that we started seeing

1528
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:01,799
some cannabis flowers

1529
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,480
um back then whether it was the police

1530
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,059
or the genetics that were available to

1531
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,858
be grown outside or the availability you

1532
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,940
know the lack of supply all these things

1533
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:10,619
together

1534
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,659
created a situation where we just didn't

1535
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:15,480
have cannabis flowers it was we were

1536
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:17,578
hashmokers and

1537
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,619
I lived right on the border of Quebec

1538
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:23,280
which is the French speak uh speaking

1539
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,380
part of of Canada and they have a lot of

1540
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,780
ties back to France of course culturally

1541
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,220
and again in France you know it's in

1542
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,619
between Spain and

1543
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,358
and Italy

1544
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:35,940
that's you know they're they're also

1545
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,858
hashmuckers and and great tobacco

1546
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,720
smokers it's just it's part of the

1547
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:40,980
culture

1548
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:45,659
um

1549
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,619
so I believe as our you know I came to a

1550
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:48,899
point where I was like I'm gonna try

1551
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:50,400
stop not smoking with tobacco I was

1552
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,338
buying cigarettes just to have tobacco

1553
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,079
to be to mix in with my joints

1554
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:56,940
um

1555
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,619
and you know I got to the point where I

1556
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,000
was like forget this I'm just going to

1557
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:02,039
start smoking with cannabis and I

1558
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,480
remember I was in a music man at the

1559
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:05,460
time and some of my friends that were in

1560
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,380
the band they were like oh we can't you

1561
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,838
know it's too harsh it's when you smoke

1562
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,700
it without it's too harsh and it feels

1563
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,759
that way for about the first two weeks

1564
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:16,379
but after you get accustomed to smoking

1565
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,599
without cannabis you actually change the

1566
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:20,880
way that you smoke you draw the air

1567
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,980
differently in

1568
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,900
um I think you rather than taking these

1569
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,539
long draws on the joint you take smaller

1570
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,980
draws with larger breaths of air at the

1571
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:30,300
same time so you're kind of titrating

1572
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,358
down the smoke

1573
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:36,240
and uh you get to the point where where

1574
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,338
you just it tastes so much better you

1575
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,379
wouldn't go back if you had to

1576
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:41,818
and when someone passes you a joint like

1577
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,480
if I'm you know if I'm out at a party

1578
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:46,619
Sam on the east side of Canada again

1579
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,119
smoking with tobacco is a lot more

1580
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:50,039
prominent than it is on the west coast

1581
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:51,599
and so if you're at a party someone

1582
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:53,219
passes you a joint you have a taste of

1583
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,359
it you get you know you get it halfway

1584
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:57,058
down your throat and your lungs

1585
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:58,380
immediately slam shut

1586
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:00,540
um because they just don't want that

1587
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,519
tobacco smoke in there

1588
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:05,279
um so I I'm really against it I'm really

1589
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,318
against tobacco as a whole I don't I

1590
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,540
think it's I've seen the damage it does

1591
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:11,400
to people

1592
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:13,079
um and I just don't think it's a good

1593
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,358
thing to be consuming if you don't have

1594
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:17,880
to and you certainly don't need to be

1595
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:20,818
consuming with cannabis and it's kind of

1596
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,619
like putting orange juice in a fine wine

1597
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:25,139
you know

1598
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:27,539
yeah well so many things you just said

1599
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:28,618
which are just so heavily relate to you

1600
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:30,539
know I think I just agree with

1601
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:32,400
everything you said and as someone who's

1602
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,199
never smoked a cigarette in my life but

1603
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,019
at one point was addicted to Tobacco

1604
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:38,338
purely through smoking it with weed I

1605
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,539
think that I can agree with you that

1606
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:41,818
that after you get through that first

1607
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:44,159
two weeks you're like wow this is such a

1608
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,779
better world to be in but I'd love to

1609
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,179
just quickly jump back to something you

1610
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:50,280
touched on because we did have uh one of

1611
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:52,139
the friends of the show direwolf submit

1612
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,420
a question which relates perfectly to

1613
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:56,279
the hash sort of comment you made and he

1614
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,318
was wondering what's your thoughts on

1615
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,298
the old school Moroccan imported hash

1616
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,858
did you love it did you hate it where do

1617
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:04,798
you stand

1618
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:06,420
what it's kind of like everything in the

1619
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:08,159
Cannabis world I mean I love it for what

1620
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,358
it is I've been to Morocco a couple of

1621
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,500
times now

1622
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,818
um I've traveled there a little bit on

1623
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,500
my own and I actually went with Rob

1624
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:15,119
Clark and we had a little trip and went

1625
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,838
and saw some Growers that we need down

1626
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,420
there

1627
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,558
and really got to see all about the

1628
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,760
culture

1629
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:24,298
it

1630
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:27,180
it's a great thing to see

1631
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:29,159
I think from um

1632
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:30,838
you know when I went the last time I had

1633
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:33,118
already been working in these regulated

1634
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:35,578
models so when I started going back and

1635
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,559
seeing the way that things were done on

1636
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:39,660
such a massive scale

1637
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:41,519
there's a lot of gross things that are

1638
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:44,879
you know there's no real high just no

1639
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:47,699
real sense of hygiene in the process

1640
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,099
or in the cultivation it's just not

1641
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:51,358
really thought of and and we've seen

1642
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:52,798
through some of the studies that have

1643
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,298
been done even in like Dutch coffee

1644
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,980
shops that

1645
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:58,079
you know for example like if you're

1646
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,000
trimming your weed and someone goes off

1647
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,460
the washroom doesn't wash their hands

1648
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,400
after they use the washroom you can get

1649
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:08,159
like E coli on the flowers right

1650
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,818
and that's pretty gross

1651
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,858
um

1652
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:14,699
and it's not it's it's completely

1653
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:17,578
avoidable right this is the other thing

1654
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:18,659
um and so these systems they don't they

1655
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,220
don't they don't have any of these

1656
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:21,899
safety protocols they don't have

1657
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:23,000
standard operating procedures they don't

1658
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,639
have

1659
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,559
protocols for maintaining the quality of

1660
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,298
the flower from a consumer safety

1661
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,359
perspective

1662
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:32,358
um

1663
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,920
the other thing about it is it's the

1664
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:39,539
market has changed so even even when the

1665
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,280
first time I went which is I think it

1666
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:43,679
was 2011. it might even have been a

1667
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,780
little before then but around that time

1668
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,818
it was they were going through a

1669
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:51,420
transition where

1670
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:53,759
the Moroccans had started adopting

1671
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,920
um Advanced agricultural techniques so

1672
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,359
for example they were growing feminized

1673
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,760
seeds from Holland

1674
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,259
but rather than just scatter C I mean

1675
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,520
the way they used to do it they'd

1676
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,720
Harvest all the seeds at the end of the

1677
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:05,400
year when you when you're harvesting

1678
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:07,098
Acres of cannabis it's seeded like

1679
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:11,700
Moroccan is

1680
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:13,559
you separate the the the resins from the

1681
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:15,480
plant right through screening or this

1682
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,160
this batter beading technique which I

1683
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,480
don't know if you've seen online but you

1684
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:20,399
know people can Google it and you can

1685
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,139
look on YouTube they essentially put in

1686
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,180
the bag and then they beat this the bag

1687
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,679
with sticks and the sticks knock the

1688
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:28,139
resin glands off the flower and then

1689
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,500
they collect the resin glands so there's

1690
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:32,639
no real there's no real safety

1691
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:36,599
consideration in doing that it's just

1692
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:39,539
kind of done right because for them

1693
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:41,640
they all know that it's Black Market but

1694
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:44,400
the truth is if you're up in Morocco up

1695
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:46,739
in the in the rift mountains

1696
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,420
and you have land like you're paying for

1697
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,318
your house and your way of life and

1698
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,358
everything

1699
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:52,558
by with cannabis I mean if you go up

1700
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,239
there and you drive around you'll see

1701
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,920
driving through the riff

1702
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:57,779
the biggest houses they're all

1703
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,180
surrounded by cannabis fields

1704
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,680
right and so this is what the point was

1705
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:03,899
is that they're they're bringing in

1706
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,598
these feminized seeds and now they lay

1707
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:08,519
drip emitters down

1708
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,318
and they plant the feminized seeds on

1709
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:12,059
drip lines whereas what they used to do

1710
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,558
is Harvest all the seeds after they'd

1711
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:16,140
beat the resin glands off the hash

1712
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,700
they'd collect the seeds and then the

1713
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:19,679
next year they would actually just walk

1714
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:21,419
around the property with bags of seeds

1715
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,440
and Scatter seed them by just tossing

1716
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,440
out handfuls of seed

1717
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:29,159
um so you get a lot of it's kind of

1718
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,838
grown a little bit more like hemp than

1719
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:32,759
they do drug cannabis you get a lot more

1720
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:35,460
plants per square foot

1721
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,500
um they grow very tall and thin

1722
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,420
um with top colas and not a lot of side

1723
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,639
branching and that was kind of the

1724
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,559
traditional method of of production for

1725
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,480
farmers in Morocco

1726
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,059
now if you go down

1727
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,219
and you go up into the Riff you'll see

1728
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:52,380
they've got these like you know they've

1729
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:54,480
dug into the side of these mountains

1730
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,660
like pretty much Olympic swimming pool

1731
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,039
sized pools to hold the water

1732
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:00,358
um so when it rains in the winter they

1733
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,940
collect all that water and they line

1734
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:04,798
them with with big Plastics a big

1735
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,559
plastic or rubber mats

1736
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:09,179
and that holds all the water in so they

1737
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:11,519
have these huge reservoirs from which to

1738
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:13,259
feed their plants and they take that

1739
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,199
water and they pump it out and they

1740
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,299
inject chemical nutrients from

1741
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:20,219
a lot of it comes from Holland but you

1742
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:21,780
know it's that it's that same kind of

1743
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:25,078
chemical fertilizers that everybody else

1744
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,700
in the blue crystals kind of thing

1745
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:28,798
um

1746
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:31,318
because the the places that they're

1747
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:34,500
growing in Morocco it's not even really

1748
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:36,900
soil it's more rock and dust than any

1749
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:39,119
kind of organic material in the soil

1750
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,059
and so they really just turn it into a

1751
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,980
massive hydropanic hydroponic bed right

1752
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:46,260
with the drippers providing all the

1753
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:49,559
nutrients that the plant needs

1754
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:53,940
um and again growing feminized seeds by

1755
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:55,380
the 10 20 30 acre plot

1756
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,659
um

1757
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,059
so not a lot of love given to the plants

1758
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:00,779
it's all about bulk

1759
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:03,000
um

1760
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,160
they don't understand the concept of you

1761
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,420
know you know Howard Parks funnily

1762
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:08,159
enough went through the same thing in

1763
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,260
Morocco when when he was there he was

1764
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:12,420
asking for you know I don't want as much

1765
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,559
hash I just want better quality and they

1766
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,720
just didn't understand that it was like

1767
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,480
we'll just we'll just make more right

1768
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:20,279
and it's like no we don't want more we

1769
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,260
actually want less of the stuff that we

1770
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,040
don't want in there

1771
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,000
um

1772
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:30,058
so do I think that those things will be

1773
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,980
available as they are in the New Market

1774
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:34,319
no they won't

1775
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,400
right because it's probably not it's

1776
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:39,659
probably not the best way of doing

1777
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:43,019
anything doing things can you take those

1778
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:45,358
production practices and make them

1779
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:47,099
um applicable or safe to do in a

1780
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,880
regulated market absolutely you can make

1781
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:52,200
products like the Moroccan hashes

1782
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,160
um and some people will love those

1783
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:55,858
things

1784
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:57,298
but again just transferring over the way

1785
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:59,578
that it's always been done into the

1786
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:00,599
regulated market I just don't see it

1787
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:02,579
happening

1788
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,338
along with what you just mentioned is

1789
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:07,440
what's your opinion on people going to

1790
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:09,719
these sort of land race or indigenous

1791
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,940
areas and trading modern feminized

1792
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:14,159
genetics for the cultivars like notably

1793
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,960
Strain Hunters and RN have done that a

1794
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,298
lot and they cop a lot of flack for it

1795
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,619
do you think that's deserved or do you

1796
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:22,318
think it's not as harmful as people

1797
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:23,940
might make out well I think there's two

1798
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,058
things to realize like for example

1799
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:29,818
Morocco cannabis wasn't grown in Morocco

1800
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:31,319
until like 1300 years ago so they were

1801
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:32,759
brought those populations were brought

1802
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:33,960
there really what they were growing even

1803
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,299
until a couple of hundred years ago I

1804
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,559
remember 150 years ago maybe it wasn't

1805
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:41,159
even that long it could have been less

1806
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:42,900
they were it was actually really a hemp

1807
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:45,000
variety right it wasn't they weren't

1808
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,920
really potent cannabis and that's why

1809
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,659
they made it into hashish because it

1810
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,500
concentrated it enough that you'd get

1811
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:51,480
high

1812
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,920
but the Moroccans that's not how that

1813
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,539
they would consume their cannabis and to

1814
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,798
this day they still don't consume the

1815
01:05:54,539 --> 01:06:00,179
resin glands they mix flower tops with

1816
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,940
little bits of tobacco and that's how

1817
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:05,460
they smoke it it's not it's not used the

1818
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,740
way we smoke it to consume the same

1819
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,440
concentration of the drug they they kind

1820
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:12,659
of again like maybe like DJ's ways that

1821
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,760
they were they were

1822
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:16,558
they were using a less amount of the

1823
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,920
drug than just to get a slight effect

1824
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,460
and that was the that was the really the

1825
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,079
purpose for them

1826
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:26,940
truthfully the DEA has gone around the

1827
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:28,380
world I mean they've spent the last you

1828
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,700
know maybe not the last 20 years but

1829
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,019
that's certainly the 20 years before

1830
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:33,118
that

1831
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:34,679
going around the world and paying the

1832
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,680
Thai government and paying the Indian

1833
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:39,598
government and paying the

1834
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:42,538
afghanistani government to go out and

1835
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,380
conduct anti-cannabis

1836
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:46,140
um

1837
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,460
raids right go out go out and have these

1838
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:49,739
programs to go out and cut the fields

1839
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,780
down in fact at one point in time it was

1840
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:54,058
the UN

1841
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:55,559
the the U.N office of drug control it

1842
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:57,240
was their policy to actually make

1843
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:59,579
cannabis extinct like that was one of

1844
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:01,139
the un's world goals was to make

1845
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:03,359
cannabis extinct

1846
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:04,500
right that's insane like imagine the

1847
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,779
un's

1848
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,539
having one of their mandates to make a

1849
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:11,760
species go and say it's extinct it's

1850
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:12,599
just bizarre

1851
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,460
um

1852
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:16,440
but it was all ideologically driven

1853
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:19,079
right so

1854
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,519
I think the truth is is that most of the

1855
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,079
Cannabis that's been grown and those

1856
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,420
land what people call land race

1857
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,640
populations and the cultures that grew

1858
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,159
those land races for example the Thai

1859
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,739
culture that grew the the really Fine

1860
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:33,598
Thai sticks that's gone like those

1861
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:35,939
things just don't really exist anymore

1862
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:39,780
they might have like little dots of them

1863
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:42,240
around the country in very small spots

1864
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:44,880
but it's not a cultural phenomenon like

1865
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,219
it used to be it's not a way of life

1866
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,019
and so the lessons that they had to

1867
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:51,719
teach the cultural practices they had to

1868
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:53,639
teach those ways are probably gone the

1869
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:56,038
genetics at least the diversity is

1870
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:58,679
mostly gone

1871
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,920
um and from a farming point of view I

1872
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:04,019
mean if you're a farmer in Thailand or

1873
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,358
India or the Congo you know you're

1874
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:09,420
talking about The Strain Hunters

1875
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:11,639
if you're a farmer in those places

1876
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,260
you want the best

1877
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:15,598
product that you're going to grow like

1878
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:17,520
if somebody has a a variety of corn that

1879
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,079
yields 10 times as much

1880
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,819
and that means that you can have 10

1881
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:23,278
times as much

1882
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:25,140
you know profit or return from your crop

1883
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,000
or 10 times this much food to feed your

1884
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:29,579
family you're gonna do it

1885
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,679
right because these folks probably don't

1886
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:32,479
understand the

1887
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,159
the

1888
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,198
intricacies of

1889
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:39,238
protecting the global diversity of

1890
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,278
cannabis

1891
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:43,439
um and that's kind of the way we are in

1892
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,500
most of these species with most species

1893
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:50,698
now is that these centers of origin as

1894
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:53,640
we call them or centers of diversity

1895
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:55,318
of most crop species are gone or they're

1896
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,140
threatened all around all around the

1897
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,060
world just because of human activity and

1898
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,900
so at this point in time we really rely

1899
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,359
on

1900
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:05,879
what we call ex-sit you or or you know

1901
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,199
collections that are taken and capped

1902
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,659
out of the place where they were

1903
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:11,639
produced because

1904
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:13,500
the environment's changing and these

1905
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,719
these ecosystems are threatened and

1906
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,219
that's what we do we have at the point

1907
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:18,298
unfortunately the point that we have to

1908
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,859
do that now

1909
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:21,899
is that we just have to collect these

1910
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:24,420
things as they are and try to preserve

1911
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,759
the diversity and I think that if we're

1912
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:28,798
trying to you know blame Ariane or blame

1913
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:31,259
anybody for going and polluting

1914
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:33,659
polluting these germplasm these genetic

1915
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:36,960
pools the truth is those genetic pools

1916
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:40,979
are mostly depleted anyway

1917
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,420
um and those Farmers have ju have you

1918
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:44,639
know I think it's kind of hard to argue

1919
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,399
that those Farmers don't have

1920
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,199
every right that all the local Canada

1921
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:52,559
you know all our domestic cannabis

1922
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:55,559
Growers to to to to produce the newest

1923
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,120
most commercially viable plants that's

1924
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,480
what that's what Farmers want to do they

1925
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:03,599
want to stay competitive right

1926
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,339
yeah and I I think that you know when if

1927
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,260
you if you look at it on a human level

1928
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:08,640
you can totally relate to the point you

1929
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,260
made about you know people are trying to

1930
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,960
feed their families you know it's not

1931
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:15,960
it's not all this like Grand oversight

1932
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,119
driven sort of actions taking place an

1933
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,980
idea that one of our past guests errors

1934
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:22,140
and brought up and he's a lovely guy

1935
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:24,599
from India who's done some land race

1936
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:27,239
Expeditions and preservation efforts of

1937
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,039
his own he raised this interesting idea

1938
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:31,559
which I think makes a lot of sense to me

1939
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,779
in that he said as you pointed out these

1940
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,760
These cultivars are disappearing on

1941
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:37,619
their own for various reasons it's not

1942
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,020
like Strain Hunters is the sole reason

1943
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:42,779
for that but he raised this idea of like

1944
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,000
if you do have these seeds it's kind of

1945
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:46,738
your due diligence to try to get them

1946
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,079
out there and not just sit on the stock

1947
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:51,299
forever and like sort of hoard it in a

1948
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:53,039
way do you feel like that's an idea you

1949
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,140
can get down with

1950
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,519
well yeah I mean and that's kind of you

1951
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,400
know it's it's it's interesting because

1952
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,739
again we have systems in the world for

1953
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:04,019
regulating the use of plants or you know

1954
01:11:01,738 --> 01:11:05,879
for example yupov kind of oversees the

1955
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,800
the naming and

1956
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,800
describing of what is a different plant

1957
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,960
type and they award you know rights to

1958
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,060
the the plant breeders for you know you

1959
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,619
breed a new Apple for example you you

1960
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,699
get the commercial rights to produce

1961
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:19,559
that apple

1962
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:21,899
but one of the things that comes up with

1963
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:24,060
that is that yeah you get the 20 years

1964
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:27,359
of commercial rights to grow that apple

1965
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,980
and profit from it exclusively but the

1966
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,380
trade-off is that you have to make that

1967
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:33,059
apple tree available to other plant

1968
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,719
breeders

1969
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:41,159
and the idea behind that is that plant

1970
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:42,359
genetic resources are really a global

1971
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:44,219
um you know I'm going to call them a

1972
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:46,559
it's going to say it's a human right to

1973
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,719
use them but I think that humans kind of

1974
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,760
we we put ourselves first on the planet

1975
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:53,520
a little too much

1976
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:56,760
um but the truth is is that everybody on

1977
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,159
the planet has the right to access

1978
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,840
different types of germplasm if you

1979
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:02,639
protect if you invent a new plant and

1980
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,159
you want to you want to get intellectual

1981
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:08,159
property rights on it that's one thing

1982
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:10,079
but really

1983
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:12,960
that's fine to get the commercial rights

1984
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:16,738
to benefit from that exclusively but

1985
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:19,198
we we also do have a duty to maintain

1986
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:22,259
these plants and plant species and plant

1987
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:24,059
populations in a way where they're more

1988
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:27,420
accessible

1989
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:29,340
um to everybody and again call it an

1990
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,560
echo of prohibition I call you know

1991
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:33,420
Echoes of prohibition being the things

1992
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,800
that we've that we're still doing wrong

1993
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:36,658
because we learned to do them through

1994
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,179
prohibition one of the Echoes of

1995
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:41,099
prohibition is oh if you want

1996
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:43,859
that you know if you want the seed that

1997
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,760
I have then you have to pay me for it

1998
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,619
um

1999
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,060
and it's kind of just the way it is you

2000
01:12:46,619 --> 01:12:51,179
know I and so I have all these

2001
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,920
populations and I you know the idea is

2002
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,980
to eventually get them all out and share

2003
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,880
them all in some regard

2004
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:58,979
um

2005
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,500
but it took a lot of work to create to

2006
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:03,959
collect these things and I don't want to

2007
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,060
pass them on to someone that doesn't

2008
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,158
know how to to preserve them properly

2009
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,679
right because the idea again is that

2010
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:13,439
we're we're really custodians of the

2011
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:16,380
Cannabis gene pool it's not ours it

2012
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,539
doesn't no plant breeder owns all the

2013
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:21,960
Cannabis that they have it's just that

2014
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:23,399
you're a custodian for it for the future

2015
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,380
generations of people that are going to

2016
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,639
use it

2017
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,140
um and I think that that's a really

2018
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,140
important

2019
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:34,140
attitude to have when when going about

2020
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:37,800
cannabis preservation work is that no

2021
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:40,020
it's not your alcopolitical gold or your

2022
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,640
Mexican variety or your Indian variety

2023
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:44,100
is like these

2024
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,679
you know these seeds have cultural

2025
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,840
heritage attached to them and there's

2026
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:50,819
there's history in people that preserve

2027
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,659
them

2028
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:56,698
for us right in fact there's you know

2029
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:59,698
there's something called the CBD which

2030
01:13:56,698 --> 01:14:00,899
is funnily enough CBD it's the

2031
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:03,779
um

2032
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:07,079
what is it again

2033
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:08,340
I'm having a mind mind moment here where

2034
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:10,439
I'm not recognizing what it is but

2035
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,119
essentially it's like a a program of

2036
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:13,619
biological diversity

2037
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:15,779
um an agreement of biological diversity

2038
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:18,658
between all these plants or all these

2039
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:20,340
countries to protect the diversity

2040
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:24,259
because what's typically happened is

2041
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:27,659
Western countries have gone to these

2042
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:32,039
poor third world countries

2043
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:34,019
looking for plants to

2044
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:35,698
collect and take back and turn them into

2045
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,280
a pharmaceutical product

2046
01:14:35,698 --> 01:14:41,039
right where the culture that maintained

2047
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:42,719
that plant or discovered that plant

2048
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:44,279
they don't have any benefit from them

2049
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,198
right they don't they don't earn any

2050
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:48,000
benefit from them so there's something

2051
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:51,059
called the Nagoya protocol and people

2052
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,279
can again Google that but the Nagoya

2053
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,260
protocol essentially says for all the

2054
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,698
signatory countries

2055
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,260
but if you know if you're a Spanish

2056
01:14:56,698 --> 01:15:00,599
company or you're a Dutch company

2057
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,300
they're both signatories you can't just

2058
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,000
go down to Africa and start

2059
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:07,619
pilfering seeds right and then taking

2060
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,359
them back and profiting them and in that

2061
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:11,158
sense you know it could well be that

2062
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,738
Ariane is actually violating that

2063
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:15,238
product that protocol

2064
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:16,919
um that agreement that his government

2065
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:19,859
has signed to where

2066
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:22,199
if you're going to go down and exploit

2067
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:24,420
that genetic diversity or that cultural

2068
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:26,399
diversity that genetic diversity that's

2069
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:29,899
produced by the culture that they're

2070
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:29,899
entitled to some of the profits

2071
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,659
um

2072
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:35,639
and it just stops the more advanced

2073
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:37,019
countries of the world or the more

2074
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,300
developed countries of the world from

2075
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:42,860
going around and exploiting the the

2076
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,860
folks that aren't quite as developed yet

2077
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:47,940
yeah definitely and I think history has

2078
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:50,039
shown that a lot of the less developed

2079
01:15:47,939 --> 01:15:51,960
countries have sadly copped the the

2080
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:54,479
short end of the stick without these

2081
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,579
sort of regulations in place so

2082
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:59,339
hopefully our buddy are in hasn't

2083
01:15:56,579 --> 01:16:02,158
violated any laws in that regard

2084
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:04,440
um a question I'd just love to run by

2085
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:07,500
before we jump back to the beginning so

2086
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:09,238
to speak is on the topic of indigenous

2087
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,560
land races one of the really good

2088
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:12,899
questions we got from one of our

2089
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,860
listeners was they were interested in

2090
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:16,500
knowing

2091
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:17,939
you know in line with errors in a former

2092
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,800
guest of ours having done some of the

2093
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:21,479
Andreas Expeditions and he did hint that

2094
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,039
there are still some indigenous stuff

2095
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:25,439
out there it's obviously just near and

2096
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:27,539
far when you come across it are there

2097
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:30,299
any indigenous cultivars or land race

2098
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:32,158
strains that in your mind you would

2099
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,400
really love to work with if you had the

2100
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:34,399
chance

2101
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,238
I mean it would be really nice to be

2102
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:41,599
able to go back to those varieties of

2103
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:44,218
yesterday with the Technologies of today

2104
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,620
and start doing some real exploring

2105
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:49,140
using science

2106
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:50,719
um I've you know I've got little

2107
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:53,159
collections of

2108
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,260
relatively exotic things in the

2109
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:56,839
collection I've got some ties and you

2110
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,100
know some Mexicans the Highland Mexican

2111
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,300
and some other these you know all

2112
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,340
different Colombians all these different

2113
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,920
things the truth is when you start

2114
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:06,060
exploring land race population there's a

2115
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,158
lot of dogs

2116
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:10,080
right there's a lot of plants that are

2117
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,059
way way substandard in there for

2118
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,399
whatever reason

2119
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:17,880
um and so honestly it's kind of a hassle

2120
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:20,099
to be working with land race populations

2121
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:23,940
um even if you're breeding modern day

2122
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:26,219
corn you don't go back to the varieties

2123
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:28,319
that were collected out of the Wilds you

2124
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:30,060
know the teosantes of the world because

2125
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,920
you're losing all that genetic progress

2126
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,020
that you've created right the breeders

2127
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,520
of the world that have ushered it

2128
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,659
um ushered cannabis to us in the state

2129
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,400
that it's in today

2130
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:40,920
yeah they've made a lot of mistakes

2131
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,899
because again they're typically not

2132
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,239
professionally trained scientific plant

2133
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:47,219
breeders like the rest of the world's

2134
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:48,059
crops right

2135
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:50,039
um

2136
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:51,780
the Cannabis world is kind of funny it's

2137
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:53,340
like plant breeders are celebrities and

2138
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:55,559
I don't I don't you know I don't know

2139
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,840
any celebrity wheat breeders or or

2140
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,179
cornbreeders right it's just not that

2141
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,900
kind of thing they're kind of bred by

2142
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:07,079
like big time nerds you know

2143
01:18:03,899 --> 01:18:10,500
um which is great but um

2144
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:13,380
it's just kind of the way it is so

2145
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,840
um we try to work with you know we go

2146
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:17,520
back to those

2147
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:20,400
what you call land race populations or

2148
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,900
those more wild populations typically in

2149
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:24,599
a plant breeding project when you're

2150
01:18:21,899 --> 01:18:27,000
looking for a trait that has been lost

2151
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,900
over time

2152
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,539
um

2153
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:31,859
so for example it corn in the United

2154
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,340
States

2155
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:36,479
went through this vast bottlenecking

2156
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,520
process because they were trying to make

2157
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,319
these high yielding sweet corn varieties

2158
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,880
and they did they created these

2159
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,979
incredibly bulletproof sweet corn

2160
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,440
varieties that were high yielding and

2161
01:18:43,979 --> 01:18:48,899
you know you'd produce

2162
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:50,099
50 times the amount of corn per acre is

2163
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:53,339
that you would but if you're using a

2164
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,480
variety say from 20 30 years ago

2165
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,640
um

2166
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:59,519
but one of the things that they learned

2167
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:02,460
they realized is that the plant the

2168
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,739
plants became susceptible to pests in

2169
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:06,658
the root in the soil so the roots would

2170
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:09,599
be attacked and The Roots essentially

2171
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:11,099
they had lost these compounds that would

2172
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,079
protect them so one of those compounds

2173
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,520
was beta-cariophyllene which is one of

2174
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:16,979
the major sesquitur beans that's

2175
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:20,219
produced by cannabis it's in all the

2176
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:23,759
Kush varieties OG Bubba all that kind of

2177
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:26,939
stuff is high in high in beta-carotylene

2178
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,520
and beta-carotylene makes the roots

2179
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:31,079
unpalatable to certain aphids right well

2180
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,239
they accidentally bred it out because

2181
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:36,119
they were so focused on the big sweet

2182
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:37,738
corn that the other traits that they

2183
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:39,719
weren't really paying attention to a lot

2184
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:41,819
of them got lost along the way

2185
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:44,520
and so they had to actually when they

2186
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:46,380
realized hey all the modern corn doesn't

2187
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,780
produce beta-cariotylene in The Roots

2188
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,300
they now had to go bait way back in time

2189
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:53,300
in their breeding programs to find

2190
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,619
plants that had those to try and

2191
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,960
re-introgress that trait back into the

2192
01:19:55,619 --> 01:20:00,439
population and so I think for me that

2193
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:03,000
that's really where

2194
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:05,339
the the major benefits are going to come

2195
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,658
from those land race lines

2196
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,400
yeah you're probably getting some

2197
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:10,738
interesting head spaces again because

2198
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:13,979
the plants are in the like eight to ten

2199
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:15,899
percent THC range not the 20 plus THC

2200
01:20:13,979 --> 01:20:18,479
range

2201
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:20,879
um and maybe some of them have unique or

2202
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:23,579
interesting terpene profiles

2203
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,380
but funnily enough most of that stuff

2204
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:27,800
has actually been preserved pretty well

2205
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:27,800
because

2206
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,060
Growers and smokers have always liked

2207
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,439
the interesting smelling plants right

2208
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:36,659
and there's always been one grower

2209
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:39,419
that's you know he's like I really like

2210
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:41,339
this type of smell and in that Pursuit

2211
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,739
he's managed to breed

2212
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:46,079
for the predominance of one terpene over

2213
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:47,339
another right and so right now we

2214
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,880
actually have an incredible amount of

2215
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:55,560
genetic diversity and flavor

2216
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,719
whereas where the plant is probably

2217
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,840
most going to be able to be to be

2218
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:02,760
improved in terms of things like disease

2219
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:05,279
resistance and pest resistance right

2220
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,420
resistance to powdery mildew botrytus

2221
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:11,219
yada yada all that kind of stuff

2222
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:13,800
yeah definitely definitely and there's

2223
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:15,359
many subjects we'll touch on in the near

2224
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,340
future of this chat especially

2225
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:18,779
preserving old school skunk that's

2226
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,380
something I want to talk about with you

2227
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:25,019
for sure but before we do that let's go

2228
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:27,179
back to the start what was your first

2229
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:29,219
experience with cannabis

2230
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:30,539
well I was hash someone had brought some

2231
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:33,420
hash to a party

2232
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:37,140
and it was you know it was rolled in a

2233
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:40,560
in a a joint with some tobacco

2234
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,760
and uh I think I felt a little high I

2235
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,260
remember we smoked it and we went

2236
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,940
outside for a walk and I remember

2237
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,800
feeling weird on this walk as we went

2238
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:50,819
from one party to another

2239
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:54,600
but it wasn't really that uh

2240
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:56,099
of a profound experience I kind of came

2241
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,159
away from the whole thing thinking well

2242
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,659
that wasn't really a big deal

2243
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:01,859
um and then it became something that we

2244
01:22:00,658 --> 01:22:03,539
did you know I'd go over my friend

2245
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:06,359
Costa's house

2246
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:08,460
uh on weekends and his older brother

2247
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:09,899
you know would would get us the hash and

2248
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:14,460
we would sit around and listen to Led

2249
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:15,539
Zeppelin and and smoke hash joints

2250
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:19,140
um

2251
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:21,060
so it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't really

2252
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,800
about the diversity and the flavors for

2253
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,320
me then I remember then

2254
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,239
you know I I met another girl in school

2255
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:29,639
just a friend of mine and her older

2256
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:31,259
brother was a dealer and she said you

2257
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,760
know you smoke cannabis you should I

2258
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,900
should teach you to my introducing my

2259
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,659
brother because he's got really good

2260
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:38,939
stuff and so this this kid became my

2261
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:40,738
connection and he had all this like

2262
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:42,599
exotic stuff that I'd never seen before

2263
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:44,579
like he had he had the purple weed that

2264
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:48,719
I'd never seen for the first time

2265
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:51,359
and you know Manali finger sticks and

2266
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:55,619
these like kind of surfboard looking

2267
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:57,359
flat plate hashes that were imported

2268
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:58,979
um for whatever reason through his

2269
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,658
connections he just happened to have all

2270
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:02,759
this kind of diversity

2271
01:23:00,658 --> 01:23:04,439
first time I saw a really nice indoor

2272
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,539
weed the first time I saw like a cherry

2273
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:09,479
oil you know all these kind of things

2274
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:11,279
and so when I met this guy he really

2275
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:12,178
opened my eyes

2276
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,698
um and he was actually quite

2277
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:16,800
instrumental in in my future cannabis

2278
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:19,678
use because

2279
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,179
a couple of years in knowing him he had

2280
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:22,440
a couple guys break into his house in

2281
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:24,719
the middle of the middle of night with a

2282
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:26,039
shotgun and they took his all of his

2283
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,600
weed and all of his money and they

2284
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:30,479
kidnapped his roommate

2285
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:33,480
and left his roommate you know

2286
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,039
100 kilometers outside of town on the

2287
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,639
side of a road at cross streets in his

2288
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:41,039
underwear and uh that was enough for my

2289
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,900
my my friend's older brother to be like

2290
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,880
I want nothing to do with this business

2291
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:47,639
anymore I'm out

2292
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,679
which really sucked because I had

2293
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,840
learned to have this appreciation for

2294
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,300
all the diversity that he had and and

2295
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,619
showed me and then I was forced to go

2296
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,600
back on the street

2297
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:59,519
um to try and find things of significant

2298
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,320
quality like he had he always had the

2299
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,659
quality

2300
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:06,420
and I learned within about eight months

2301
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:09,299
or 12 months that most other dealers

2302
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:13,260
didn't care about buying them you know

2303
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:15,539
you got to imagine like for any product

2304
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:17,039
there's a wholesale market right and the

2305
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:18,600
wholesale Market has a variation in

2306
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,119
price yeah you can pay for the the

2307
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,380
really expensive stuff but a lot of the

2308
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:23,760
dealers are at least the ones that I

2309
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,319
knew they all wanted to buy the lower

2310
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,079
price stuff because they could make a

2311
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:30,779
higher margin on it

2312
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:33,179
um and that was really contrary to my

2313
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:35,219
goals right which was to have the really

2314
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:37,020
nice the really nice flowers

2315
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:39,480
and that was kind of right before I

2316
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,280
entered the university and and was

2317
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:43,379
getting out on my own and at that point

2318
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,300
in time it was like wow you know what I

2319
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:47,400
know that these things exist

2320
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,600
they have to be that you can clearly

2321
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:50,939
produce them

2322
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,920
the channels that I have are clearly not

2323
01:24:50,939 --> 01:24:54,719
interested in bringing those things to

2324
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,399
me so I'm just going to start growing

2325
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,899
and so I went out and I bought every

2326
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:00,000
girl book that I could find in some

2327
01:24:57,899 --> 01:25:02,219
seeds and I read them all cover to cover

2328
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,920
like you know way too many times

2329
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:06,960
and that was the beginning of this

2330
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,039
what's become an obsessive insane

2331
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:12,539
Pursuit I think you know for

2332
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:15,119
over the past 30 years I think the first

2333
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:17,760
15 or 20 of them most of the people that

2334
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:19,319
I knew thought that I was insane right

2335
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,000
was like why are you spending all of

2336
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:23,340
your time

2337
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,539
focusing on all this weed it's really

2338
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,860
you know

2339
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:28,079
I could have done a lot of different

2340
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:30,420
things I think in my life and so for a

2341
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,579
lot of people to think to see me

2342
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,960
focusing all that attention on cannabis

2343
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:35,100
I think they thought was a waste of my

2344
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,600
potential

2345
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,460
and then

2346
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,920
funnily enough the world turned around

2347
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:44,640
and they all realized that I wasn't

2348
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,840
insane I was just ahead of my time

2349
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,020
um

2350
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:51,360
and now you know that we have a legal

2351
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:54,239
industry

2352
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:56,880
I'm able to you know positively

2353
01:25:54,238 --> 01:26:00,779
influence the industry through this

2354
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,440
massive Gene collection that I've got

2355
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:02,880
um

2356
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:04,319
which has always been what I've been

2357
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,960
interested in doing you know I mean I

2358
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:09,000
got when this system developed in Canada

2359
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,100
all the pub covers went I was offered

2360
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,460
millions of dollars for my seed

2361
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:16,699
collection and

2362
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:18,960
you know when someone offers you

2363
01:26:16,698 --> 01:26:22,138
multiple millions of dollars you have to

2364
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,000
seriously think about you know why

2365
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:25,679
you're doing what you're doing you know

2366
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,079
do you take the big payout and then just

2367
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,179
go and live a comfortable life

2368
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:32,639
but the truth was is that that's never

2369
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:35,699
why I collected I didn't do all the work

2370
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:37,260
collecting all these seeds because I had

2371
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:38,279
hoped that one day that there would be a

2372
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,619
payout

2373
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:43,019
right I did it because I loved it

2374
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:44,460
and I enjoyed what I was doing

2375
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:46,139
and

2376
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:49,260
so I turned all these offers down

2377
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:51,119
because it became about no I don't I'm

2378
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:53,100
not looking for a buyout I'm looking for

2379
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,599
a home right for a place where I can

2380
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:57,600
actually

2381
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,280
get a farm and some nice greenhouses and

2382
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,600
actually take all this hard work that

2383
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:01,500
I've put into collecting all these

2384
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,539
things

2385
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,639
and start bringing them back to the

2386
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:06,899
world like you said right how do you get

2387
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:08,279
these things out and share them with the

2388
01:27:06,899 --> 01:27:10,019
world

2389
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:11,759
and so the new world is really about

2390
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:13,980
dealing with the regulatory challenges

2391
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,600
to make that happen how do you how do

2392
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:17,039
you sell seeds internationally legally

2393
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,420
how do you do all the stuff right

2394
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:19,979
because we have to when you start

2395
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,658
working in a regulating system you can't

2396
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:23,519
live in both worlds

2397
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:25,379
right you can't be one foot in the black

2398
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,320
market and one foot in the the legal

2399
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:31,880
World it just doesn't work

2400
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:31,880
um so yeah it's really about

2401
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:36,658
about the work and not the money right

2402
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:38,279
it was a good it was a good lesson to

2403
01:27:36,658 --> 01:27:40,500
learn right it was a good thing to kind

2404
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:41,939
of be faced with and and come to the

2405
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,800
realization that no you know what I

2406
01:27:41,939 --> 01:27:46,339
don't do this for the money I do it

2407
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:50,460
because I love it

2408
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:53,460
yeah I I so so much Vibe with that

2409
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:56,340
message because so often a lot of the

2410
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:58,500
the decisions that get made that lead to

2411
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:00,600
deleterious outcomes in cannabis are

2412
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:03,719
done because people are looking to make

2413
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,760
money and as kind of as much as it might

2414
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:07,619
irritate some people I always kind of

2415
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,380
say like it's worth considering having a

2416
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:12,300
day job so that you don't have to grow a

2417
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,920
certain cultivar because you need to pay

2418
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,539
the rent with the yield you know what I

2419
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,060
mean like it gives you that freedom to

2420
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:20,340
be able to pursue your passions and not

2421
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:22,219
like the bottom dollar

2422
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:26,400
yeah it becomes about

2423
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:28,739
again the Artistry or the that artisanal

2424
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:32,219
aspect of whatever your art is whether

2425
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:35,339
it's planning making guitars or you know

2426
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:37,619
raising and curing pork or vegetables or

2427
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:38,639
cheese or whatever it's all you know

2428
01:28:37,619 --> 01:28:40,260
there's some people that are doing it

2429
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,520
for money and and the commercial aspect

2430
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:45,539
for it and then there's some people

2431
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:47,219
doing it just to make the finest product

2432
01:28:45,539 --> 01:28:49,380
right because that's what they enjoy

2433
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:51,539
doing they like having the finest cheese

2434
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,219
in the world or the finest wine in the

2435
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:54,119
world

2436
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:57,679
um

2437
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:57,679
and I think that there's a you know

2438
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,380
a lot of people say oh it's like oh

2439
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,238
you're a scientist you breed weed from a

2440
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:06,300
scientific perspective it's like yeah

2441
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:08,579
well true enough but I'm also an artist

2442
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,380
right it's like you can if you're an

2443
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:13,019
artist you can use science as a tool in

2444
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,940
your toolbox right it's like just like a

2445
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:16,500
specific type of type of paint or a

2446
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:18,479
specific paintbrush

2447
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:20,760
right just because you're using science

2448
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:23,339
it doesn't mean that you can't do the

2449
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,860
art aspect of it as well right so to me

2450
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:28,260
it's a it's a fusion of those two yeah

2451
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:30,479
the science is just a set of tools that

2452
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:34,739
help you execute your art

2453
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:37,738
yeah I wholeheartedly agree so if we

2454
01:29:34,738 --> 01:29:39,419
kind of touch on that same theme what

2455
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:41,158
was your first grow like I find the

2456
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:42,480
viewers are always extremely interested

2457
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,819
in hearing you know like do you remember

2458
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,279
this the first strain you ever grew and

2459
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:49,259
the sort of Technology was it like sort

2460
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:50,939
of all MacGyver together give us a

2461
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:53,100
little rundown if you can remember yeah

2462
01:29:50,939 --> 01:29:56,279
so it wasn't it wasn't a known or a

2463
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:58,320
named seed light it was you're probably

2464
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:01,079
noticing I don't use the word strain and

2465
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:03,059
we can touch on that after but um

2466
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:04,859
yeah it wasn't a known variety it wasn't

2467
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:06,900
a labeled variety it was seeds that I

2468
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:09,119
got out of some bud

2469
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:11,158
um I was young I was like too young to

2470
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:12,719
be growing weed that way

2471
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:14,819
um I'd heard stories of family members

2472
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,319
that had grown weed in the past and I

2473
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:18,658
just kind of grabbed some seeds and I

2474
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,399
was like I started them and I told my

2475
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:21,839
parents and they're you know one of my

2476
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:22,799
parents were separated at that point in

2477
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,900
time they didn't live together anymore

2478
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,520
longer so you know I said to my mom I

2479
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:28,019
said yeah I'm gonna grow some plants and

2480
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,780
I think that really what happened is she

2481
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:33,540
was like yeah okay sure thinking that I

2482
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:35,340
would completely fail of course

2483
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,619
you know I was I was still in high

2484
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:40,079
school like I was you know I think I was

2485
01:30:37,619 --> 01:30:42,599
14 or 15 at the time

2486
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:45,800
uh my mom's gonna be rolling her rolling

2487
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:48,300
her upset if she hears me telling this

2488
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,980
publicly but anyway that's another

2489
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,420
conversation so

2490
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:54,000
um so I started growing these plants I

2491
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,980
went to the Hydra star and they set me

2492
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,779
up with a you know I told them you know

2493
01:30:55,979 --> 01:31:00,178
we're growing some Tomatoes at our house

2494
01:30:57,779 --> 01:31:03,599
and I want to do this and they they were

2495
01:31:00,179 --> 01:31:05,699
like okay well they sold me a one foot

2496
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,520
by four foot

2497
01:31:05,698 --> 01:31:11,460
um kind of like a window box tray and

2498
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:13,860
and a

2499
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:16,739
um slab of rock wool that fit perfectly

2500
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:20,039
into that one foot by four foot

2501
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:22,439
um tray I got a bucket and a pump and a

2502
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:25,079
and a short piece of hose that became

2503
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:27,539
the drip dripper line and it just you

2504
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:30,238
know we designed it into the what I

2505
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:32,100
later came to learn was a recirculating

2506
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:33,419
drip system

2507
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,340
took it home put it in the window

2508
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:37,980
planted a couple of seeds right into the

2509
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:41,219
medium and for the next year and a half

2510
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:43,319
I had these stupid unhealthy plants in

2511
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:44,819
my basement beside my guitars and all my

2512
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:46,679
friends coming over to smoke dope on the

2513
01:31:44,819 --> 01:31:49,319
weekend

2514
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:50,940
um and I would turn the lights off when

2515
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:53,039
I would go to bed and I'd turn them on

2516
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:54,719
when I'd get up in the morning

2517
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:56,100
right and so these plants of course

2518
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,420
never flowered they do they weren't

2519
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,100
getting any kind of consistent light

2520
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,880
cycle

2521
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:01,560
um

2522
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,420
and finally I think it must have been

2523
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,159
like it must have been like you know 13

2524
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,779
14 months or something and finally my

2525
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:08,819
mom was had enough and she's like that

2526
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:10,380
those have to go

2527
01:32:08,819 --> 01:32:11,698
and so I moved him down to my dad's

2528
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:13,199
house and put him in a window that

2529
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:15,539
happened to be west facing and I didn't

2530
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:18,658
know anything about it but just

2531
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:20,639
coincidentally it happened to be fall so

2532
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:23,279
the plants flowered

2533
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:26,760
right and we cut him down and it was

2534
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:28,500
terrible smoke because the genetics were

2535
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,360
crap and

2536
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,158
but I but it was a learning experience

2537
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:33,839
right it was like huh you can actually

2538
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:35,819
get these things through to the the

2539
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,739
cycle

2540
01:32:35,819 --> 01:32:39,840
um

2541
01:32:37,738 --> 01:32:41,099
and I put it away for a couple years I

2542
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,659
didn't even really think about it again

2543
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,159
because it didn't again it didn't turn

2544
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:45,960
out well and I was living at my parents

2545
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:47,399
foot my folks house

2546
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,539
but when I moved out on my own I was

2547
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:50,479
like okay I'm gonna figure this thing

2548
01:32:48,539 --> 01:32:53,698
out and learn how to do it right

2549
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:55,379
so the second time I started growing I

2550
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:57,479
went and bought a little 400 watt light

2551
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:59,460
from the grow store and uh you know I

2552
01:32:57,479 --> 01:33:02,218
think I was growing in 20 liter buckets

2553
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:04,139
reading the old Mel Frank books and some

2554
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:08,279
of Ed rosenfolds all books and you know

2555
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:09,060
obviously marijuana botany was my Bible

2556
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:11,279
um

2557
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:12,600
and it just went from there I started

2558
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:14,698
screening and I remember going down to

2559
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,800
the the Hydra store and I was kind of

2560
01:33:14,698 --> 01:33:18,359
friends with the guy and I subtly said

2561
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,980
to him I was like hey man you know do

2562
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:21,119
you think I can get some clones is there

2563
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:23,879
any way

2564
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:26,158
and he gave me the the stock answer was

2565
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,679
you know he's like no we don't do that

2566
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:31,259
and part of

2567
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:33,119
growing cannabis is cutting your teeth

2568
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,739
on seeds and finding some good plants

2569
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:36,779
and working with those

2570
01:33:34,738 --> 01:33:39,899
and I was like well

2571
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:42,119
[ __ ] you you know what I did that I went

2572
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:43,079
and went insane with buying seeds and

2573
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:46,198
started growing all these different

2574
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:47,698
varieties and about a year later he was

2575
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:49,379
asking me for cuttings because I had

2576
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:51,779
better you know I'd found better plants

2577
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,819
than what they were growing

2578
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:56,519
um and I realized that I really like

2579
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:58,259
that that part of the the grow and I was

2580
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,199
you know I was in university and started

2581
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:02,880
I I think I had a genetics course and

2582
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:04,500
from that point on I just got right into

2583
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,699
it

2584
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,760
um

2585
01:34:05,698 --> 01:34:09,960
and was almost immediately bringing you

2586
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,000
know I brought

2587
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,039
I brought the the flowers that I had

2588
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,319
produced back to the storefront that was

2589
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:18,119
selling the seeds and he was like wow

2590
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:20,279
your flowers are really good like can I

2591
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:22,139
get some seeds from these and so I made

2592
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:24,840
a couple of crosses and I donated them

2593
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:26,940
to one of the early medical uh cannabis

2594
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:29,039
challenges that were going on in Canada

2595
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:30,779
and they sold them through this head

2596
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:33,539
shop

2597
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:35,759
and the feedback was really good right

2598
01:34:33,539 --> 01:34:37,340
because I had found excellent plants for

2599
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,199
for the parents

2600
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:41,699
and just having a little bit of

2601
01:34:40,198 --> 01:34:44,219
Knowledge from you know my plant

2602
01:34:41,698 --> 01:34:47,359
breeding courses or my genetics course I

2603
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:49,380
was able to make better choices for what

2604
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:50,819
constitutes a good parent and I guess

2605
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:52,139
the seeds turned out well

2606
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:54,000
and

2607
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:55,500
you know when I went in one day and the

2608
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,300
guy was like man your seeds are getting

2609
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,639
great reviews from all these people we

2610
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,100
want you to start making more seeds

2611
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:03,900
and that kind of just fit in really good

2612
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:06,239
with what I was doing so I from kind of

2613
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:08,879
from the start like I didn't

2614
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,799
really grow cannabis to have largest

2615
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,359
amount to sell it I always just became

2616
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,239
the guy that was growing lots of plants

2617
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:17,460
from seed and keeping clowns and finding

2618
01:35:15,238 --> 01:35:20,519
interesting plants and and working for

2619
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:22,260
them that way and it it I found it

2620
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:24,600
really enjoyable right that's kind of

2621
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:27,139
what I love about cannabis is there's

2622
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,400
such a diversity in the

2623
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:30,960
morphological and chemical profiles the

2624
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:33,000
scent as you know the cannabinoids

2625
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,980
everything like it's it really is a

2626
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,500
remarkable plant in that way

2627
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:39,000
unlike many types of plants which are

2628
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:42,300
much more uniform

2629
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,658
and less diverse and so cannabis has got

2630
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:48,300
so much that we can do with it that it's

2631
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:50,519
really kind of a fun plant to play with

2632
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:51,659
wholeheartedly agree wholeheartedly

2633
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,280
agree

2634
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:55,460
the thing which jumps to mind for me

2635
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:57,658
when I hear that amazing story is

2636
01:35:55,460 --> 01:36:00,658
obviously a lot of people talk about

2637
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:02,939
having looked at Rob Clark's books and

2638
01:36:00,658 --> 01:36:05,399
people of that early generation who

2639
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:08,339
really laid a lot of the the paving for

2640
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:10,679
future breeders and for future Growers

2641
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:13,800
but the thing about Rob was he wasn't

2642
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:16,199
like as notable of a breeder as he was

2643
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:19,139
sort of like a guru and an instructor

2644
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:20,879
were there specifically any breeders who

2645
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:23,400
you looked at when you started your

2646
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,779
projects and thought this person has a

2647
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:27,179
good feel for what they're doing and

2648
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:28,979
they were kind of like a um like you

2649
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:30,960
know a figure you looked up to in a

2650
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:33,359
sense well I might say I'm pretty early

2651
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,300
on right

2652
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:38,219
um and he kind of we we kind of

2653
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,659
connected over the Internet because he I

2654
01:36:38,219 --> 01:36:40,819
think he recognized he's like wow this

2655
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:42,960
person knows what they're talking about

2656
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:45,299
and so I went over to Canada the

2657
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,939
Cannabis Cup I can't remember what year

2658
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:51,300
was it was pretty early on and

2659
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:54,658
I met I met Sam

2660
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:56,279
and when he found out who I was I think

2661
01:36:54,658 --> 01:36:57,899
he was kind of taken back that I was

2662
01:36:56,279 --> 01:36:59,099
much younger than he had thought that I

2663
01:36:57,899 --> 01:37:01,399
would have been

2664
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:03,719
and and he kind of like brushed me off

2665
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:05,939
and you know he was a little bit like

2666
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:07,619
dismissive of me and I was like whatever

2667
01:37:05,939 --> 01:37:09,839
I just I don't know this guy that's fine

2668
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:11,519
and I got I remember leaving you know

2669
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,480
completing my trip and coming back home

2670
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,239
and

2671
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:19,619
I went home found an email waiting from

2672
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:21,419
David from from Dave Sam David and he um

2673
01:37:19,619 --> 01:37:22,920
and he essentially apologized me he's

2674
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:24,600
like I'm sorry I was kind of rude to you

2675
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,819
and he was like next time you come back

2676
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,739
to Amsterdam you come over my house for

2677
01:37:26,819 --> 01:37:31,319
dinner and I got a bunch of stuff to

2678
01:37:28,738 --> 01:37:32,759
show you and you know I don't know most

2679
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:35,039
a lot of people might not realize but he

2680
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,079
was also the president or founder of the

2681
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:38,698
international hemp Association so he was

2682
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:40,260
a pretty central figure in the Cannabis

2683
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:40,919
world

2684
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:45,560
um

2685
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,560
and his connections are just so deep

2686
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:49,560
um and

2687
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:50,759
I honestly don't know I've ever met

2688
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,739
anybody

2689
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,420
more than than David that is more

2690
01:37:52,738 --> 01:37:56,819
passionate about cannabis than David he

2691
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:58,500
really is like you know a lot of people

2692
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:01,259
slag him on the internet and there's all

2693
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:03,359
these stupid just totally wrong rumors

2694
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:06,179
about him working for the DEA and the

2695
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:08,819
CIA that get passed around about him

2696
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:10,920
online and you know I got to tell you

2697
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:12,960
it's just not true like all that stuff

2698
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,940
is just it's all got like tiny little

2699
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,739
bases in reality

2700
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:18,719
but you know for example like he did

2701
01:38:16,738 --> 01:38:20,819
when he started he was licensed to work

2702
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,920
in Holland and so the University of

2703
01:38:20,819 --> 01:38:25,198
Mississippi which was the only licensed

2704
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:28,199
DEA grow at the time they wanted to get

2705
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:30,359
genetics to improve their their work

2706
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:31,859
they reached out to David and said hey

2707
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:33,839
we're doing science over here in

2708
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:36,719
Mississippi and University of

2709
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,159
Mississippi can you send us some seeds

2710
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,960
you're you're legally allowed to grow

2711
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:42,839
them in Holland can you export some to

2712
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:46,020
the states and so they went and got a

2713
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,579
you know they're a DEA licensed producer

2714
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,860
in the States they're one of the only

2715
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:51,719
ones or I think they're the only one now

2716
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:53,880
but there used to be two

2717
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:55,800
and

2718
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:58,020
and the DEA granted them an import

2719
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,800
permit to produce seeds and and so David

2720
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:03,179
was able to export seeds from hortifarm

2721
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,000
his company into the United States

2722
01:39:03,179 --> 01:39:08,819
completely legally

2723
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,859
but somehow the community

2724
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:12,960
thought oh well David's working with the

2725
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:14,039
DEA he's got these abilities to do these

2726
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,899
things

2727
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:17,698
and the truth was is that he of course

2728
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:19,559
he wasn't working with a DEA there's

2729
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:23,039
nobody that would work with the DEA less

2730
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,600
than David right like he's completely on

2731
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:26,639
board for the cause like he's not

2732
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,520
helping out the CIA or the DEA that's

2733
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,179
just Stoner nonsense

2734
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,699
um

2735
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:34,739
but there was a lot of animosity towards

2736
01:39:32,698 --> 01:39:37,319
David because he had figured out how to

2737
01:39:34,738 --> 01:39:39,779
do legally what everybody else couldn't

2738
01:39:37,319 --> 01:39:42,119
do right they everybody else was playing

2739
01:39:39,779 --> 01:39:44,519
in the in the black market world and he

2740
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:46,679
had learned how aide figured out how to

2741
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,179
get a grow licensed how to do research

2742
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:50,940
on plants

2743
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:52,920
how to start looking into the different

2744
01:39:50,939 --> 01:39:54,599
chemical profiles in the plant the truth

2745
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,980
is he was like one of the very very

2746
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:59,719
first people

2747
01:39:55,979 --> 01:40:02,039
in the western world that was

2748
01:39:59,719 --> 01:40:05,460
promoting medical cannabis or the

2749
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:07,260
medical use of cannabis and he firmly

2750
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,819
believed that you could you could take

2751
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,380
all these plants and create all these

2752
01:40:08,819 --> 01:40:13,198
different chemical profiles from them

2753
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:16,619
when nobody else even was even close to

2754
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:18,479
considering doing that so you know I I

2755
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:20,099
have a lot of respect for David he's

2756
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:21,959
really like he's kind of like a father

2757
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:24,780
figure to me

2758
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,698
um and he's just he's just a great guy

2759
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:29,460
he's a weirdo for sure and he'll tell

2760
01:40:26,698 --> 01:40:31,559
you that straight out of his own mouth

2761
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:33,658
um he's really quite eccentric but he is

2762
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:37,260
super smart

2763
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:39,119
he is super focused on cannabis and

2764
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:40,800
collecting as many different types as he

2765
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:42,539
can from all over the world and learning

2766
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,279
about the plant

2767
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:45,719
um you know he's in his 70s and he sucks

2768
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:47,819
up information all the new information

2769
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:50,100
like a vacuum cleaner it's really

2770
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:51,238
unbelievable

2771
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:54,719
um

2772
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:57,539
so you know as a role model from people

2773
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:58,980
to look to look at from as I was kind of

2774
01:40:57,539 --> 01:41:01,019
starting my career

2775
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:03,238
he and Rob I mean there was no better

2776
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:05,219
there was no better people to know right

2777
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:07,738
because I got to learn through him too

2778
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:10,739
the truth behind

2779
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:12,718
the the Dutch Seed Company at the time

2780
01:41:10,738 --> 01:41:15,419
and honestly

2781
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,698
these stories of these massive breeding

2782
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:20,460
houses in Hall and doing work on seeds

2783
01:41:17,698 --> 01:41:22,138
is that's nonsense it's a it's a fable

2784
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:24,600
it's just not it's not what happens

2785
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:26,219
right A lot of these guys produce seeds

2786
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,420
in closets and it's no different than

2787
01:41:26,219 --> 01:41:29,158
the work that anybody else is doing

2788
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:31,800
anywhere else in the world it's just

2789
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:33,779
that they can legally sell the seeds and

2790
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:35,279
create a marketing

2791
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:36,658
um perspective that makes it look like

2792
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:38,519
they're doing the work well the truth is

2793
01:41:36,658 --> 01:41:40,439
they're not doing the work

2794
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:42,179
right so David was really one of the

2795
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:44,399
only people that were you know he built

2796
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:46,679
a laboratory he started looking for THC

2797
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:48,179
and CBD and all these other cannabinoids

2798
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:50,880
and they even started looking at

2799
01:41:48,179 --> 01:41:53,039
terpenes like way before their time way

2800
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,920
before anybody else was

2801
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,760
um so yeah I think if you're asking who

2802
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,319
my

2803
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,900
the people I looked up to it would be

2804
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,158
those guys you know other people in the

2805
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:03,899
Canadian space I would just collect

2806
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:05,158
everybody's seeds I would buy seeds and

2807
01:42:03,899 --> 01:42:06,960
sell seeds and

2808
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:09,599
it was all about just getting everything

2809
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:12,000
right there wasn't any ego attached to

2810
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,100
it the first person I was kind of really

2811
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,319
excited to work with was DJ

2812
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:18,000
um and the blueberry

2813
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:20,099
um that was kind of fun because he was

2814
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,840
just you know his stuff was just so

2815
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,880
different than everybody else's

2816
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,860
and from a genetic diversity point of

2817
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:28,199
view I thought that it was

2818
01:42:25,859 --> 01:42:29,519
you know it was a good addition to your

2819
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:32,238
your pool of what you're working with

2820
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:36,300
it's like a whole new little subset of

2821
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:37,919
genetics to create hybrids with

2822
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:39,900
um

2823
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,819
but by that point in time I was starting

2824
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:43,618
to be really disenfranchised with the

2825
01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:45,779
rest of the seed business so I think for

2826
01:42:43,618 --> 01:42:47,219
most people I don't you know there's a

2827
01:42:45,779 --> 01:42:50,579
few people that are doing it right like

2828
01:42:47,219 --> 01:42:52,319
Simon serious seed Simon he's

2829
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:53,819
um he's not a trained plant breeder but

2830
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:57,118
he really understands what he's doing

2831
01:42:53,819 --> 01:43:00,779
and he he understands trying to create a

2832
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:03,420
uniform product and and uh you know I

2833
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:05,158
think his work is really good

2834
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,840
um

2835
01:43:05,158 --> 01:43:08,158
some of the younger guys there's a lot

2836
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,020
of younger guys that know what they're

2837
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:11,939
doing you know Caleb

2838
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:14,219
from uh

2839
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:16,500
CSI seeds

2840
01:43:14,219 --> 01:43:17,880
he does some good stuff

2841
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,079
there's a whole bunch of people that are

2842
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,579
doing it right now and they're starting

2843
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:21,960
to do I think we're kind of in a bit of

2844
01:43:20,579 --> 01:43:23,460
a Renaissance

2845
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,319
for cannabis there's a lot of people

2846
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:27,899
that are just hacking plants together

2847
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:30,000
and creating an image and you know being

2848
01:43:27,899 --> 01:43:31,920
really popular on Instagram and

2849
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,060
that's all fine and dandy but I think

2850
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,739
for most of those people it's about

2851
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:36,539
making money not really about improving

2852
01:43:34,738 --> 01:43:38,879
the plant

2853
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:39,719
um but I'd like to see more of these

2854
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,819
people

2855
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:43,739
invest in a couple of plant breeding

2856
01:43:41,819 --> 01:43:45,539
textbooks and put some effort into

2857
01:43:43,738 --> 01:43:48,658
trying to learn about

2858
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:51,179
you know the biological

2859
01:43:48,658 --> 01:43:52,859
basis for for plant breeding because

2860
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:54,840
when you understand all that stuff you

2861
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:56,279
can just you're really more effective in

2862
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:58,679
your work

2863
01:43:56,279 --> 01:43:59,880
right and I think that the people that

2864
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:02,279
really care about the plant and

2865
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:04,319
improving the plant they do that

2866
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:05,639
and a lot of the people that are more

2867
01:44:04,319 --> 01:44:08,460
concerned about the money and the

2868
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:09,719
celebrity don't really do that and

2869
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:12,859
that's a shame

2870
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:15,658
yeah certainly and just a plethora of

2871
01:44:12,859 --> 01:44:18,238
avenues we could go down in terms of the

2872
01:44:15,658 --> 01:44:19,500
discussion before we jump on to some of

2873
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:21,658
the other breeders you mentioned I'd

2874
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:24,600
love to just chat about David a little

2875
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:26,698
more if possible and specifically I

2876
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:29,940
think the question which I most commonly

2877
01:44:26,698 --> 01:44:31,678
hear around that sort of DEA mystery

2878
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:33,599
sort of thing is that I think a lot of

2879
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:36,179
people have a hard time understanding

2880
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:39,000
how that story about how the warehouse

2881
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:40,560
got raided and then like he was Henry's

2882
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,779
colleagues were able to like get the

2883
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,480
plants out of the dumpster and then bail

2884
01:44:42,779 --> 01:44:47,039
do you have any Reflections or insight

2885
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:48,839
into that story like do you think he

2886
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:51,000
just got lucky or what do you think the

2887
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:53,579
situation was with that the story is not

2888
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,800
even true that's the funny thing is that

2889
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:57,840
David was involved with I think he he he

2890
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,539
technically wasn't even involved in the

2891
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,920
bust he had moved to Amsterdam or he you

2892
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:03,658
know he went over to start work in

2893
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:06,118
Amsterdam

2894
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:07,618
um was kind of exploring because you

2895
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:09,839
know if you were in the drug scene and

2896
01:45:07,618 --> 01:45:11,460
you heard that Canada that Holland was

2897
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,199
popping off and you could go there grow

2898
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:14,520
weed I mean that was a pretty exciting

2899
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:16,138
thing for people

2900
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,080
so he went over there and started doing

2901
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:20,460
some work and you know realized oh this

2902
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:21,600
is the place for me I got to go back to

2903
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:23,340
California

2904
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,520
and close up my life there and I'm

2905
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:28,199
moving over to Amsterdam so he did and

2906
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,000
he went back and you know got all their

2907
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:31,259
stuff dealt with and then he moved to

2908
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,179
Holland

2909
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:36,119
and

2910
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:39,060
his wife at the time got busted and it

2911
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:42,719
wasn't the wife it was their roommate

2912
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:45,719
had a male plant in the window

2913
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:47,219
and that was the oh and so Dave but

2914
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:49,859
David wasn't even there that's the only

2915
01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:52,920
California like cannabis bus that even

2916
01:45:49,859 --> 01:45:54,118
has any remotely closeness to David

2917
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,840
right

2918
01:45:54,118 --> 01:45:56,880
um

2919
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,520
so all these stories about like the

2920
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:01,739
sacred seed Collective and all the this

2921
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,980
is just these are nonsense stories that

2922
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:06,118
people just make up on the internet

2923
01:46:04,979 --> 01:46:08,519
um

2924
01:46:06,118 --> 01:46:10,259
and I've done you know I've I I'm a

2925
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,480
pretty interesting person when it comes

2926
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:14,100
to things like this of history and I've

2927
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,079
done a little bit of looking into it and

2928
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:18,179
I tell you man he's not like that didn't

2929
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:19,319
happen so I don't know about the story

2930
01:46:18,179 --> 01:46:20,639
in the warehouse and the plants and

2931
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:22,618
saving the plants and all this kind of

2932
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:25,380
stuff it's to me it sounds like internet

2933
01:46:22,618 --> 01:46:27,359
fantasy but there's no basis in reality

2934
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:28,618
to it as far as I'm aware

2935
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:30,059
and I've asked him all these questions

2936
01:46:28,618 --> 01:46:31,859
you know I've asked David all the hard

2937
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:33,539
questions

2938
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:36,019
um because I wanted to get to the basis

2939
01:46:33,539 --> 01:46:39,238
of it and the answers are always

2940
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:41,159
very like it's you know you know the

2941
01:46:39,238 --> 01:46:42,718
concept of Occam's razor or persimony

2942
01:46:41,158 --> 01:46:45,059
right it's like

2943
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,319
the simplest explanation is usually the

2944
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:49,020
true one

2945
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:50,340
right and I think that with but listen

2946
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:51,719
I've had people do it with me we'll

2947
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,119
probably get to that later in the

2948
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:55,859
episode but there's a lot of Fantastical

2949
01:46:54,118 --> 01:46:57,719
stuff that's written about me on the

2950
01:46:55,859 --> 01:47:00,000
internet that's just has no basis in

2951
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:01,739
reality so I've seen it you know I've

2952
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,539
seen it happen

2953
01:47:01,738 --> 01:47:05,539
um and I you know

2954
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,380
getting to know David as I have over the

2955
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:12,480
last 20 years

2956
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:14,340
I just I just don't believe any of this

2957
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:16,019
that stuff right and you talk to other

2958
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:18,300
you know I've been able to go back and

2959
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:20,040
meet like other people that he worked

2960
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:22,079
with in California and you know he knew

2961
01:47:20,039 --> 01:47:24,118
Rob back in the day and I've talked to

2962
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:25,800
Rob about all this kind of stuff and

2963
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:28,079
it's just I think that

2964
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,820
a lot of it spurred from the fact that

2965
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,880
he was able to get these licenses that

2966
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:36,000
nobody else was able to to do

2967
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:39,000
um when GW Pharmaceuticals

2968
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,020
got the go-ahead from

2969
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,060
um

2970
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:44,179
the home office in the United States to

2971
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:46,080
set up a grow and start working there

2972
01:47:44,179 --> 01:47:48,000
obviously you know because they

2973
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:49,439
understood that there was pharmaceutical

2974
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,479
potential in cannabis and so they

2975
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:53,279
started doing everything you would do to

2976
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:55,198
do that you you set up and grow you

2977
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:57,059
start doing some science you make some

2978
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:58,500
extractions you figure out what

2979
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:00,659
molecules are in the plant and you start

2980
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,039
testing them

2981
01:48:00,658 --> 01:48:04,319
and

2982
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:05,939
they needed a genetic Supply they needed

2983
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,799
to turn to somebody in the world and say

2984
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:09,359
hey do you have these rare varieties

2985
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,920
with all these different chemistries and

2986
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:13,319
sure enough they found hortifarm because

2987
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:16,380
horror Farm was the only company in the

2988
01:48:13,319 --> 01:48:18,420
world that was doing that work

2989
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:21,900
and

2990
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:23,940
you know David had David kept quarter

2991
01:48:21,899 --> 01:48:25,679
farmer alive with his own

2992
01:48:23,939 --> 01:48:27,539
he didn't he didn't have a bunch of

2993
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,118
people giving him money right there was

2994
01:48:27,539 --> 01:48:31,439
no public markets for raising funds to

2995
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:33,779
support that kind of business he was

2996
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:36,000
doing it with his own work and paying

2997
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:37,859
for that kind of work with his his legal

2998
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,679
seed sales right seed sales were always

2999
01:48:37,859 --> 01:48:43,079
legal in in Holland and so he was able

3000
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:45,960
to sell some seeds and pay for

3001
01:48:43,079 --> 01:48:48,600
you know pay to do his work but

3002
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:50,579
when GW really approached him horror

3003
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,440
Farm was struggling right because it's

3004
01:48:50,579 --> 01:48:55,019
really it's really expensive man when

3005
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:56,939
you start doing science on cannabis I

3006
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:59,280
mean you're spending like 50 100 for a

3007
01:48:56,939 --> 01:49:01,319
lab test so if you're running

3008
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:03,238
you know thousands or even tens of

3009
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:05,698
thousands of plants that gets really

3010
01:49:03,238 --> 01:49:08,158
really expensive really quickly

3011
01:49:05,698 --> 01:49:09,719
and when you're legal your compliance

3012
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,460
costs are huge you have to have security

3013
01:49:09,719 --> 01:49:14,279
you have to have

3014
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:16,859
you know record keeping like it's it's

3015
01:49:14,279 --> 01:49:18,479
not it's not done the way the people in

3016
01:49:16,859 --> 01:49:20,579
the black market do without having all

3017
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,379
these different reporting duties and and

3018
01:49:20,579 --> 01:49:26,359
Regulatory duties

3019
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:28,319
and so when when GW came along

3020
01:49:26,359 --> 01:49:30,960
they offered

3021
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,519
hortifarma Lifeline like it was really a

3022
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,319
Lifeline at that point in time so that

3023
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:36,540
David could keep doing the work

3024
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:38,639
you know he had Staffing costs they had

3025
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:39,779
they had it was running a business when

3026
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,219
you're not making an income and you're

3027
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:43,198
doing research is a really really

3028
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:45,600
difficult thing to do I don't think

3029
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:47,638
people really understand that

3030
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,920
um if you haven't done it but

3031
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:51,659
yeah that's kind of what he was doing

3032
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,579
and um

3033
01:49:51,658 --> 01:49:55,679
because he was doing that and because

3034
01:49:53,579 --> 01:49:57,600
you know that the community's always

3035
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,658
thought a big Pharma they're the evil

3036
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:02,520
people the guys that run GW they like

3037
01:50:00,658 --> 01:50:04,738
helping patients just like anybody else

3038
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:06,239
right where I know a few of the

3039
01:50:04,738 --> 01:50:07,138
scientists work for that company and

3040
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:10,259
they're

3041
01:50:07,139 --> 01:50:12,840
you know I I hear them tell stories that

3042
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:14,460
bring yeah you probably know some people

3043
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,500
that you know they produce weed and they

3044
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:19,198
give it away to a medical patient of one

3045
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:22,618
type or another child that's got Apple

3046
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:24,719
your epilepsy or something and

3047
01:50:22,618 --> 01:50:26,639
you get a lot of Pride from doing that

3048
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:29,819
like there's really kind of no better

3049
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:32,039
feeling than than helping someone with

3050
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:33,420
your work with a plant right like if you

3051
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:35,460
can grow a plant

3052
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:36,779
and take that plant and extract the

3053
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:38,279
flowers or whatever you do make an

3054
01:50:36,779 --> 01:50:39,779
extract that's not the important part

3055
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:42,479
but if you can like bring a plant to

3056
01:50:39,779 --> 01:50:44,698
life and and harvest it and take that

3057
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:47,039
medicine and give it to somebody and it

3058
01:50:44,698 --> 01:50:48,719
really changes their life there's

3059
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:52,039
nothing that feels better than that and

3060
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:55,020
it's like it really is just a completely

3061
01:50:52,039 --> 01:50:57,300
satisfying altruistic thing to do and I

3062
01:50:55,020 --> 01:51:01,260
know that a lot of the research

3063
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:03,179
scientists that work in at GW they kind

3064
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:05,880
of feel the same way as The Growers up

3065
01:51:03,179 --> 01:51:08,039
in California that are growing medicine

3066
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:10,859
for for children with an epilepsy right

3067
01:51:08,039 --> 01:51:12,840
it's it's really altruistic and the

3068
01:51:10,859 --> 01:51:15,359
community

3069
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:20,219
as a whole not everybody but as a whole

3070
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:22,439
has this bias against big Pharma and so

3071
01:51:20,219 --> 01:51:24,600
they look at anything related to do with

3072
01:51:22,439 --> 01:51:26,579
big Pharma as oh you're selling out or

3073
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,539
you're taking our plant and giving it

3074
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:30,059
away

3075
01:51:27,539 --> 01:51:31,560
you know to the man and like I said

3076
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:34,020
earlier to me

3077
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:36,179
these plant genetics are a human

3078
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:37,560
resource that should be accessible to

3079
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:39,179
everybody

3080
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:41,179
right

3081
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:41,179
um

3082
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,460
whether you're with a big company or

3083
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,259
you're a little guy like it doesn't

3084
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,819
matter right

3085
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:49,679
I don't think the big guy should be

3086
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:50,819
stealing from the little guys

3087
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:53,399
but

3088
01:51:50,819 --> 01:51:55,559
I think having access to the tools is

3089
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:57,359
kind of fair game across the board

3090
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:00,539
right you're certainly not going to keep

3091
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:04,259
wheat seeds or corn seeds or potato

3092
01:52:00,539 --> 01:52:06,840
seeds out of anybody's hands right like

3093
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:08,280
if you want to work with a plant as a

3094
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:10,560
human I think that you've got the right

3095
01:52:08,279 --> 01:52:11,819
to go and collect some seeds from

3096
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,320
wherever you can find them and start

3097
01:52:11,819 --> 01:52:15,960
working

3098
01:52:13,319 --> 01:52:17,639
yeah definitely definitely and I I

3099
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:20,399
certainly agree with the sentiment that

3100
01:52:17,639 --> 01:52:22,500
there is a lot of like anti-big Farm a

3101
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:24,479
sentiment in the community and you know

3102
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:26,698
I can understand why in some respects

3103
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:28,500
you know like the the opioid crisis in

3104
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:31,079
America is an obvious thing you could

3105
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:33,539
point at and be uh quite skeptical of

3106
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:34,979
their motives in that regard but I

3107
01:52:33,539 --> 01:52:36,479
understand what you mean where it's like

3108
01:52:34,979 --> 01:52:38,218
I've met a lot of people who work in big

3109
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:39,959
Pharma and a lot of them want the best

3110
01:52:38,219 --> 01:52:42,420
for their patients and they're not doing

3111
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:44,819
it for financially driven reasons and I

3112
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:46,800
I always love how people are like super

3113
01:52:44,819 --> 01:52:48,899
critical of big Pharma but no one ever

3114
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:51,179
has a problem with antibiotics it's like

3115
01:52:48,899 --> 01:52:52,799
we you know it's you know it's like we

3116
01:52:51,179 --> 01:52:54,539
just agree that it's actually being done

3117
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,880
for the good of people but like it does

3118
01:52:54,539 --> 01:52:58,319
cost money to produce them

3119
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,179
yeah well we're getting to the point

3120
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:03,179
though where we have this whole anti

3121
01:53:00,179 --> 01:53:05,520
like anti-vaccine movement now right

3122
01:53:03,179 --> 01:53:08,639
it's like there's we used to take pride

3123
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:11,400
in in having knowledge and now there's a

3124
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:13,679
large segment of certain countries maybe

3125
01:53:11,399 --> 01:53:15,599
nameless that they really take pride in

3126
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:17,579
the ignorance it's like if you're if

3127
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,260
you're an educated person person they're

3128
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:20,939
like oh you're up in your Ivory Tower

3129
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:23,400
you're not in contact with the regular

3130
01:53:20,939 --> 01:53:24,539
the regular man and it's gotten to the

3131
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:26,460
point where they think that you know

3132
01:53:24,539 --> 01:53:28,198
Bill Gates is trying to chip people he's

3133
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:30,118
trying to like

3134
01:53:28,198 --> 01:53:31,979
right and it's like I saw a sign the

3135
01:53:30,118 --> 01:53:34,319
other day it says it was a picture of

3136
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:37,618
Bill Gates or uh they'd put his head on

3137
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:40,139
on someone at a Gates and it said um

3138
01:53:37,618 --> 01:53:42,439
you're not worth microchipping change my

3139
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:44,880
mind right

3140
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:47,579
it's like why would you think that like

3141
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:51,239
the guy's just given away like most of

3142
01:53:47,579 --> 01:53:52,618
his wealth and somehow the conspiracy

3143
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:54,178
folks of the world have turned around to

3144
01:53:52,618 --> 01:53:55,679
oh no he's actually just trying to use

3145
01:53:54,179 --> 01:53:58,079
it to get more money

3146
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,639
it's kind of insane I don't think if you

3147
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:02,238
have any understanding of Science and

3148
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:04,800
virology and vaccines that you know

3149
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:07,559
especially in a coveted world

3150
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:08,820
how you could be anti-vaccine I just I

3151
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:12,620
don't get it

3152
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:13,210
