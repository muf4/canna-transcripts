00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,279
little different we've fast forwarded a

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
little bit into the future I guess my

115
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,279
first question my friend to follow up on

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,800
it uh in in the first installment of the

117
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,638
interview you mentioned that um you know

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,079
that weekend coming you were looking to

119
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,600
jump back on the plant medicines uh has

120
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,800
that has that happened since then what

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,199
was that like if so you know what I I

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,759
would love to say yes yes but life is so

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,560
complex these days and there's so much

124
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,479
going on we've had these we're having

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,439
this bomb cyclone and so I've been doing

126
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,879
a lot of Winter Rising I also have this

127
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,120
these two bags of substrate that just

128
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:18,399
won't colonize so that's also kind of

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,000
putting things on the back burner um so

130
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,359
yeah you know I I have been I have

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,879
started smoking cannabis in small

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,800
amounts and it's been a really I can

133
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,439
it's like a deep old friend like hey you

134
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,720
know it's it's going to be okay it's

135
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,839
cool so I've done that but I haven't

136
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,160
jumped fully in so um we have a little

137
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,239
yurt up top that it's been kind of too

138
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,960
hot this summer and if I can manage to

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,600
pull up a wood stove or something I

140
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,879
think that's going to be like the the

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,039
kind of ceremonial uh Command Center and

142
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,879
so I'll haul up all my sacred items and

143
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,519
I already have some uh Indian rugs up

144
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,680
there and I think that's put in some

145
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,560
cool lights and I think that's going to

146
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,560
be the place where it all goes down but

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,680
not yet right now real world stuff like

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,280
balm Cyclones and weather is taking up

149
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,000

165

167
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,918
Monty's no longer with us which is a

168
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,839
real bummer cuz I think more and more

169
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,198
people are looking back and realizing he

170
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:02,000
just made such phenomenal work yeah what

171
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,080
a character too like he was such the he

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
was such a you know he's so driven he

173
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,318
was such a force and he could be a real

174
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,280
knucklehead sometimes but you had to

175
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,639
love the guy like just for the sheer um

176
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,318
output all those like you know the weed

177
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,879
nerd and uh he was yeah he was such a

178
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,520
unique and Wild guy and you you kind of

179
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,879
you don't really realize what you have

180
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,878
until you until they're gone you know

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,439
it's like yeah yeah I like subcool he

182
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,919
was funny and you know some of the very

183
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,360
first strains that

184
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:36,639
uh that I saved up money to get on uh

185
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,479
was it Heaven staircase and of course I

186
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,800
saved up $500 it took me forever and I

187
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,199
put a order into to Heaven staircase and

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,478
I think I was getting double PE judge I

189
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,400
was getting all these really cool land

190
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,918
races and I got a couple C Chiba strains

191
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,120
and it all went down about a week and a

192
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,719
half after I sent it in and I was just

193
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,639
like okay my money order sitting right

194
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,800
on the table so yeah I mean some of my

195
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,079
first strains that I bought and lost

196
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,840
were were his and yeah you know at breed

197
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,359
Bay we we shared you for a while he was

198
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,878
predominantly on breed Bay so we shared

199
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,520
space on breed Bay and we'd be

200
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,400
diametrically opposed sometimes on

201
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,918
things but I have a massive subcool

202
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,279
collection believe it or not because a

203
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,959
lot of times I wouldn't get paid I would

204
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,279
ask for trade so at some point I don't

205
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,318
really you know I've grown up some of

206
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,158
the older ones but I have so many so I

207
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,320
might get those out to the or throw

208
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:33,679
those into an auction or do something

209
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,519
with them because yeah they need to live

210
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,639
on he there was you know I mean Miss

211
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,879
Jill's still around and she's still a a

212
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,080
driving force and yeah what a what a

213
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,360
great story someone should do like a

214
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,839
mini like a documentary or

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,720
something you know some cool because

216
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920
yeah he was like a sacred clown like a

217
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,560
hyoka like there was magic to him you

218
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,240
know even if sometimes he he did some

219
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,078
really cooky things and and you know got

220
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,079
uh rubbed people the wrong way but you

221
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:03,359
have to love someone that's just so

222
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,439
dynamic in their s and so passionate

223
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,039
about what they

224
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,399
do yeah totally and when I think back I

225
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:15,078
I might be mistaken but I'm I'm almost

226
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,000
certain like the weed nerd sort of

227
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,799
franchise you know cuz there was lots of

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,440
different parts to it uh was sort of my

229
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,879
introduction to cannabis so always got

230
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,600
to give a shout out and and definitely

231
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,600
he was the guy him and the Rev you know

232
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
the two dudes who sort of inspired me to

233
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,278
to go organic so heck even if I didn't

234
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,839
like his genetics which I do like him uh

235
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:37,159
you know he helped me to go organic

236
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,560
which gosh that's got to be one of the

237
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,480
biggest game changers and he kind of got

238
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,479
really people into the Super SL and you

239
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,278
know if he was around today he was like

240
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Flavor driven and like hype driven and

241
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,159
way before everyone kind of caught on to

242
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,799
that you know there wasn't a lot of

243
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,278
people that were always you know back

244
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:00,078
way back it was in the old days it was

245
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:02,078
all about yield and strength and you TPS

246
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:03,879
kind of came a little bit later or you

247
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,719
know turps are great but he was really

248
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:10,078
the one that was pushing these Really T

249
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,440
forward sometimes to a deficit but

250
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,559
always like super flavorful and unique

251
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,640
kind of like especially like on the the

252
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,319
fruits and

253
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,519
tropical uh you know flavors and

254
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,680
stuff yeah definitely I I I've said it

255
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,078
before but I think that there's a good

256
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,479
argument to be made that space dude is

257
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,599
the most proven male in existence so to

258
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,079
speak you know there have been other

259
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,079
Killers throughout history I'm sure some

260
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,159
of the ones that Neville and Sam picked

261
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,919
over the years were up there but in

262
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,679
terms of something we still

263
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,799
have yeah yeah is it still it might be

264
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,239
still around too I know think Jill still

265
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,359
does she still use it and there's even

266
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,959
like controversy on actually what it is

267
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,039
yeah so interestingly Caleb's got it and

268
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:58,919
he's doing a bit of work with Miss Jill

269
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,679
on that cool um and when I asked sub

270
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,559
about that you know I said look when you

271
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,879
sent it to fos it said it was like a c99

272
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,439
back cross like space queen Cross c99 or

273
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,078
something like that I can't remember but

274
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
in the episode I I'm sure I had the

275
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,000
right

276
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:17,200
Intel but um he just said that that was

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,919
that was like someone had just sent in

278
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,360
like a mislabeled cutting or something

279
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:24,838
so he he sort of brushed it off but it's

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,680
interesting because I I have I have

281
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,040
spoke to a few people over the years who

282
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,439
had ran the Remake from Brothers grim

283
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:35,639
and said you know I didn't really get

284
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,200
anything out like space dude wow yeah it

285
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,839
yeah it's it's you know what a good

286
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,800
story always has to have a good

287
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,839
mysterious ending yeah well look to me I

288
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,078
I love space dude that that mango to

289
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,480
penelene sort of thing it uh it really

290
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,958
does it for me some people describe it

291
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,720
as more limey but I you know it's it's

292
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,000
the exact profile of the Chernobyl I'm

293

303
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:23,120
thought was like one of his best works

304
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,360

few yeah you know um I got a few to try

312
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,959

313
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,519

314

Neville's last seeds that he gave out to

320
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,759
all of his friends before he passed and

321
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,399
even though there's not a lot of

322
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,838
information on them there's like six of

323
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,399
them I get a little bit here and there

324
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,519

gift I believe to his friends and I have

326

327
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,599
interesting and I still have some of

328
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,958
those ones that I got on breed Bay with

329
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,079
credit when you know when he came back

330
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,719
and he did like super cush and he did

331
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,879
stuff with contiva and he he put out

332
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,800
some some L you know he put out a fair

333
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,120
amount of lines and then he kind of went

334
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,919
back Into Obscurity again or just

335
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,600
basically I think he was working with

336
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,000
the Australian medical scene I don't

337
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
think he could be connected so much

338
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,720
anymore but there's still a lot of his

339
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,679
work that is kind of always it's like

340
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,120
that Pandora's box or the treasure box

341
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,599
there seems to be always more stuff

342
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,360
coming out you know that's interesting I

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,320
mean kind of on that topic one of the

344
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
really common questions that popped up

345
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,879
on the patreon and one that I wanted to

346
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:05,599
ask is on your Instagram there's been

347
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:09,360
some really nice photos of uh various

348
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,560
hybrids of the sort of more raw stock

349
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,159
that I think a lot of it came from uh

350
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,599
Jade necta

351
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:18,319
Farms oh yeah Jeff Farm yeah yeah

352
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,759
everyone was Keen can you tell us a

353
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,720
little bit more about sort of what you

354
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:26,360
found and and what went along with that

355
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,160
you know it's it's it's kind of like a

356
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,440
cannabis botanical garden and he's in a

357
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,600
a spot way up in the mountains and I

358
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,160
don't know how he does it he's in the

359
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,480
Redwoods but he manages with his whole

360
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,278
team all organic just to create he just

361
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,839
collects all kinds of seeds from all

362
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,639
over the world every year and he just

363
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,600
puts them out he has ones that he uses

364
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,759
specifically for his like uh his uh

365
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,040
olive oil um you know extracts of

366
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,000
cannabis which are pretty pretty amazing

367
00:14:54,039 --> 00:15:00,000
but yeah just stuff that he gets and

368
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,039
some of it is sometimes uh I wonder if

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,679
it's pure and sometimes you're like oh

370
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,480
God yeah like there was a caloa this

371
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,319
time that I saw I think I'll probably

372
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,800
post a picture of that I I last time I

373
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,839
went this year I didn't really take

374
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,519
pictures because I got there kind of

375
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,720
late and the light was feeding but this

376
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,480
Calo is definitely not a hybrid like

377
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,560
this thing is raw like and you know with

378
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,159
Mexican

379
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,439
varieties there's a lot of cartel

380
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,759
influence and there's a lot of I think

381
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,199
at this point a lot of hybridization but

382
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,759
there's still these amazing plans and

383
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,719
like I think I said before it's like

384
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,120
really a lot of these incredible lines

385
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,319
aren't going to come from point of

386
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,959
origin anymore they're going to come out

387
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:44,240
of like like I said your grandpa's stash

388
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:48,318
or uh crazy old Uncle Larry or you know

389
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,680
or little pockets it um people that you

390
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,240
know maybe that have family back in

391
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,479
Mexico oh my grandpa used that he still

392
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,000
grows out in his garden you know it's

393
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:00,159
like these finding larger grows of these

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,078
ants more ants cestal or like

395
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,679
heirloom accessions are getting so

396
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,239
difficult at point of origin unless

397
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,599
they're places like Afghanistan or

398
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,360
places that have kind of a firewall of

399
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,040
war or Strife but really it's like some

400
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,720
of the best old school lines are coming

401
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,799
out of collections they're not coming

402
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,360
out of current stock you know even if

403
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:26,318
you go like me and stray and uh and doc

404
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,600
d we went to Waka and we did a whole

405
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,198
tour and we were getting I think it's

406
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,720
back somewhere on my Instagram but you

407
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,919
can see all of the different lines and

408
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,839
such amazing ones purple ones green ones

409
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:41,360
smoke you know very up electric but they

410
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,600
seem to be morphologically a little bit

411
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,959
too not broadleaf but hybrid that it

412
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,720
seems like maybe at some point they were

413
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,518
um worked with but you know still

414
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,278
there's always those ones that pop up

415
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,120
you know wherever you are and I think

416
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:00,039
the higher you go like maybe in the

417
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,759
Sierra mzka like up higher towards p

418
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:04,038
it seems like the lines are a little bit

419
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,439
more safe but down by the coast with all

420
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:07,919
the surfing and stuff you you know you

421
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,199
can get it but although actually I'm

422
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,919
going to have to uh eat crow and shink

423
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,558
my own ship when I was in mazun in

424
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,520
ziplite a long time ago I got some stuff

425
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:21,318
in mazun that was absolutely incredible

426
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,240
and it was fully just there was no way

427
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:24,918
it had any kind of hybridization it was

428
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,160
just Spears and the thinnest of leaves

429
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,720
and just the most excelsor like high

430
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,679
like and then you know in zipolite I got

431
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,679
the zip and it had it was similar but I

432
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,519
I don't know I mean maybe it just

433
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,640
climatized it was still pretty narrow

434
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,240
Leaf but that mazun like you could you

435
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,520
just saw it and you're like oh gosh this

436
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,400
looks like right out of a time machine

437
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:51,519
so um back to circling back around to

438
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,440
Jeff's Garden yeah in such an incredible

439
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,639
garden and like he does a a shade garden

440
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,200
in in hogga culture that's really cool

441
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,320
and it finishes out he um he's highing

442
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,960
up he doesn't get a lot of bugs but yeah

443
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,319
he has an incredible YouTube channel too

444
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,798
where he bu he shows them all and bio

445
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:10,038
essays them and there's some insane

446
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,359
plants you know Rob and Mojave show up

447
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,240
every year and check it out

448
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,519
um let's see he had this amazing

449
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,919
Filipino I think we called them like uh

450
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:23,519
Purple Dragon Tales which is the most

451
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,280
amazing Buds and like just so you could

452
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,158
tell there they were just straight out

453
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,079
of uh Jurassic Park like straight out of

454
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,880
um Filipino nature

455
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,158
Compton like you know just just a

456
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,320
beautiful beautiful Fox tailing and just

457
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,559
the most epic purple with these kind of

458
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,359
like I don't know like pepperish Berry

459
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:47,399
and just the most floaty like dreamy

460
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:50,038
effect almost a little bit like napali

461
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,798
but not but without the the

462
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:57,359
drive so yes big vote for J nectar's

463
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,200
amazing uh farm and he hopes to someday

464
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,918
kind of create a sanctuary where are

465
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,000
kind of like a place where people can

466
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,960
come and like check out the plants

467
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,640
growing and get to sample them and have

468
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,440
a whole kind of experience and I think

469
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,520
that's really cool I think that the

470
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,880
world deserves that you

471
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:17,679
know 100% it sounds like the he version

472
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,520
of the Tyson cannabis

473
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,480
Ranch yeah I'm pretty sure that's what

474
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,679
his original pitch was you know like

475
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,200
come hang out H some weed see what it's

476
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,000
about but it's like this is the real

477
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,480
deal oh my gosh I mean UCSC what I was

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,480
at they were I was they wanted to do

479
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,839
like a Botanical cannabis botanical

480
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,279
garden and they were talking about it

481
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,519
but it was so long ago I don't know if

482
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:42,399
it's going to really happen and you know

483
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:44,679
there are big massive um UC or like a

484
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,880
university system grows but they're just

485
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,280
field like just they just PL it's just I

486
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
don't know the terminology it's like

487
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,480
field sample or whatever where they just

488
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,159
let everything go and it'll just be all

489
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,120
their sections but it'll be males

490
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,000
females and they're just just letting it

491
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,079
all fly and then checking it out from

492
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,159
there so things are happening you know

493
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:07,439
and it seems like with Thailand too um

494
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,960
you're getting a lot of hype stuff and a

495
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,798
lot of stuff that's you know potentially

496
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,400
airborne and dangerous for hybridization

497
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,400
but there's also a lot of farmers that

498
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,798
are bringing their best old school stuff

499
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200
and there's even um people that are

500
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,918
involved in it you know like there zomia

501
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,880
and I heard that maybe deepo is going to

502
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,280
help out I heard that um you know

503
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,559
there's like a that amazing lady what is

504
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:33,480
it her name Prem Prem she's this uh

505
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,519
woman that's a big Advocate and

506
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,839
supporter of all the like uh old school

507
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,879
like Backwoods farmers and bringing out

508
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:44,759
like old squirrel taals and tie sticks

509
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,320
and really trying to uh Champion the

510
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,960
heirloom Heritage of like southeast Asia

511
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,480
so it I think we have a a bright future

512
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,640
if we can just take it back roots and

513
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,798
everybody just um you know just find

514
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,280
your own personal relationship with can

515
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:05,038
and support the people that are doing

516
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:09,319
that and I mean it's the same thing with

517
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:12,798
um uh I was going to say with growing it

518
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:15,119
it's like you know everybody should be

519
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:19,599
growing it don't rely on the government

520
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,798
don't rely on the uh uh the dispensaries

521
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean I know it's amazing and we all L

522
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:24,679
dispensaries because it's so fun it's

523
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,119
cool it's like a candy shop and they

524
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,880
definitely have a place but if you can

525
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,319
grow it and if you don't Maybe find

526
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,760
someone that does a friend or a farmer

527
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,399
or something maybe if we can get farmers

528
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,480
markets it would be so nice to have it

529
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,320
Go Grassroots so we can kind of support

530
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,440
things from the ground up and you know

531
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,119
there'll always be a place for a big big

532
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,880
egg and and and dispensaries because

533
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,599
it's always nice for the kids to find

534
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,520
the ZaZa and find the things and it's

535
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,759
like 31 Flavors you know it's it's its

536
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,400
own kind of like it's its own experience

537
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,839
in of itself so I don't know I just

538
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,720
encourage people maybe before they give

539
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,079
their power away to all these places

540
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,519
they always say the Cannabis is the

541
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,278
gateway drug not only to the

542
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,240
refrigerator but to gardening and you

543
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,038
know I know people that started growing

544
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,200
cannabis and now they grow tomatoes they

545
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,400
grow peppers like it just never stops

546
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,798
like it's once you realize you can work

547
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
with nature you know on a heart level

548
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,480
and especially with you know

549
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,079
non-hybridized heirloom stuff there's

550
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,759
like a a whole world it's so nourishing

551
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:27,399
it's so like it's the best antistress

552
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,200
oxygen rich like environment that you

553
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,960
can put put yourself into and you know

554
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,798
my hope one day too is all those little

555
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,759
ladies out of the gardens throw some you

556
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:39,440
know feminized autof flowers of CBD rich

557
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,440
like anti-inflammatory things and just

558
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,480
next time you Grandma makes pasta throw

559
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,519
it in to the big pasta bowl and just

560
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,880
have the

561
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:52,079
anti-inflammatory pasta party or even

562
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
like you know like um thca like who

563
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,399
needs to who needs to process it with

564
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,080
heat you know just eat it make like

565
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
chichin Chong that that was that one

566
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,918
movie like this is it was a restaurant

567
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,960
he's like any the waiter brought out

568
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,278
he's like a fine California bud leaf

569
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,120
salad you know with it's like get

570
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,359
creative it's like this is this is it

571
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,278
this is one of the coolest things you

572
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,959
can do on Earth and it's our Birthright

573
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,839
and no one can tell you what you can or

574
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,640
can do with it and that's why I always

575
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,119
you know I got get down I guess a little

576
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:26,640
bit on science but science is a tool and

577
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,678
cannabis is a like spiritual technology

578
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,000
that is inhabiting a you know a plan

579
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,480
body just like we're a spiritual uh

580
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,278
entity having a human experience like

581
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,400
there's a connection there and no matter

582
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,240
what science does finding these markers

583
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,919
and finding all these things and doing

584
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,558
all their stuff like that's beautiful

585
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,200
and amazing for farming molecules and

586
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:50,720
for tracking things but the real magic

587
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,159
is when you inhale and especially if

588
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,919
you're creating what you inhale or your

589
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,600
friends or things or the Creations that

590
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,640
you've done there's a special connection

591
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,480
that from your heart to the plant and

592
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,000
even epigenetics you know people don't

593
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,720
talk about epigenetics enough about

594
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,240
creating seeds and creating strains and

595
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,640
what the inputs are Beyond just but you

596
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,400
know just beyond foods and light but

597
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,240
also music vibration crystals you how

598
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,200
you feel around them like what you do

599
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,558
like you're processing curing you know

600
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,720
pyramids like there's so blue glass myON

601
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,759
glass you know there's so many inputs

602
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,480
that are Beyond just growing you know

603
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:36,359
and the true input really is yourself

604
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,919
and your heart into this system so yeah

605
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,158
I just encourage everybody I don't mean

606
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,278
to get down in science and people will

607
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,640
be like oh well skunk one was you know

608
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:45,200
that was scientific reading that's

609
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,159
natural science that's beautiful that's

610
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
mandelian breeding that's a person

611
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,559
that's so passionate and dedicated to

612
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,919
cannabis that they took this plant that

613
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,398
they found and just grew it and grew it

614
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,919
and grew it through the years without

615
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:00,479
doing huge field things and they came up

616
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,960
with something truly remarkable and

617
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,038
that's their legacy like and that's

618
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,558
that's still Natural Science that's you

619
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,679
know it's I worry about bringing in

620
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,240
anything you have to plug in like you

621
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,559
got to plug in your computer you got to

622
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,159
plug in your phone anything you plug in

623
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,759
I don't know if you need that in

624
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,039
cannabis breeding what you need to do is

625
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,720
plug yourself into it that that's a

626
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:26,558
that's a brilliant answer and and I I

627
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,360
agree for for a number of years I used

628
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:33,319
to take great joy in what I considered

629
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,479
to be producing relatively high quality

630
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,200
Harvest

631
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,000
with what gear that people would laugh

632
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,600
at me for having you know and I I sort

633
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,720
of took a certain sense of pride in that

634
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,079
and and and as you alluded to you know

635
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,399
that old saying the plant's best

636
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:52,240
fertilizer is the gardener Shadow it it

637
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:53,558
pays dividends to spend time with your

638
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,839
plants you know and I talked to my

639
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:57,158
friends about that you know whether you

640
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,240
feel it in like a connection sort of way

641
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,640
or just in a practic cool way I promise

642
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,839
you the more time you spend with your

643
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,399
plans your garden will flourish for it

644
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:07,678
and in that answer you mentioned that

645
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,119
you're not beating up on science and I

646
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,840
think everyone who knows you knows that

647
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,558
you're not that sort of guy anyway but

648
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:15,918
on that topic you also mentioned taking

649
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,440
it back to the roots take me back to

650
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
your roots with uh University you were

651
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,960
mentioning that earlier that it'd be

652
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,759
good to see um universities get involved

653
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,159
I want I want people to hear a bit about

654
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,359
your roots your experience at University

655
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,360
and a bit more about your backstory I I

656
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,639
think it'll help paint a better picture

657
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,079
of sort of how you came to be the Epic B

658
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,679
that we know

659
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:41,558
today yeah this strange and

660
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,038
fascinating uh creature that I am um I

661
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,519
don't know I mean I kind of goes all the

662
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,919
way back

663
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,759
to to when I was you know my mom and my

664
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,720
dad split up um they're hippies kind of

665
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,000
and I split up when I was one so I was

666
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,839
raised by my mom and grandmothers and so

667
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,159
I always had like this deep kind of

668
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,240
feminine influence and my mom was like a

669
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:04,799
really big green thumb she had so many

670
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,000
plants around the house so I always grew

671
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,879
up around plants and as I got older and

672
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,640
older I really got into like different I

673
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,720
was really into like different foods and

674
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,240
like just the world besides where I live

675
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
just really fascinated me we have this

676
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,480
place called CPL it's like this World

677
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,760
Market that has like stuff from all over

678
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,399
the world and I remember my favorite

679
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,398
thing to do was my mom would be like oh

680
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:26,479
we're going to go to cos plus to get

681
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:28,038
something do you want to go and I'd be

682
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,679
like I'd be so down she would just let

683
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:31,240
me loose in that place and I would check

684
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,038
out all the candies I would check out

685
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,399
this I would go all around that store

686
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,158
and that was kind of like my way to to

687
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:41,079
experience the planet and you know as I

688
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,120
got older and older in high school I you

689
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:48,839
know I got kind of influenced by

690
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:51,000
um like classic rock and 60s Punk and

691
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,678
then you know the Grateful Dead I went

692
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,359
to my first Grateful Dead show I think

693
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,880
like in ' 85 I had a bus pass so my mom

694
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,278
was you know back then you could get

695
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,080
away a lot um it wasn't as dangerous

696
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:07,679
like kid on the bus you know who was 15

697
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,480
or 14 13 wasn't a big deal so my mom got

698
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,919
me a bus pass and the things I love to

699
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,399
do was I would look around at the towns

700
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,200
near me and the bus routes and my two

701
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,079
big things were to do would be to find

702
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,319
new like libraries like college or

703
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,079
university libraries and also record

704
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,918
stores because I loved music and I would

705
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,480
collect music and Records so you know I

706
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,240
would take my bus pass and I would go

707
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,880
and I would look go usually would go to

708
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,399
like I would go to UC Irvine or I'd go

709
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,120
to UC Long Beach I find these places I

710
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,719
knew had things and I would find the

711
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:38,119
books that I always would want to read

712
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,440
so i' look at what rare like I was super

713
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,759
influenced by um you know like the world

714
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,720
culture and especially different

715
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,119
religions and uh and so-called like

716
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,720
primitive religions I was super into

717
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:54,038
just different ways of perceiving

718
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,720
reality through the lens of like of of

719
00:28:54,038 --> 00:29:00,440
environment and uh and so you know I

720
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,240
look up books on ethnobotany and magic

721
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,558
and Witchcraft oh and to go back I think

722
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,839
the pivotal moment I probably said this

723
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,278
before is I think one of the pivotal

724
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:12,918
moments in who I became as a human was

725
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:16,038
my mom had a really cool groovy um

726
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,038
boyfriend when I was like five or six

727
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,879
and he had this

728
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,839
um amazing bookshelf with all these cool

729
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,320
books and he was so groovy and he

730
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,879
actually had a health food store with my

731
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:30,879
mom called good enough's natural food um

732
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,480
and and he had this kind of Encyclopedia

733
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,600
britanica called man myth and magic and

734
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,038
it was like 20 volumes of just every

735
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,798
imaginable cool weird thing about magic

736
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,599
and man and um you know the col and

737
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:46,278
Witchcraft Alchemy um plant Sciences

738
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:48,158
like everything you could ever imagine I

739
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,119
would just go to his house I would just

740
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,760
sit there and read those and I actually

741
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,439
a couple years ago I picked up a full

742
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,158
set just to have because it was such

743
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,038
this amazing thing and I really think

744
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,399
that kind of opened me up to these

745
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,278
extreme possibilities on Earth and so

746
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:05,959
but I'll loop back around so you know as

747
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,960
in high school I got really into

748
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,679
psychelic and especially mushrooms uh

749
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,798
was one of my really favorite things to

750
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,440
do I think going to the Grateful Dead

751
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,119
one of the best things for us uh besides

752
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,720
the music and comaraderie and you could

753
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:22,158
still Camp back then was the abundance

754
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,960
of plant medicines you know and I I

755
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:29,840
would always go and pick up my goodies

756
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:33,519
for the until the next tour and and uh

757
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:36,359
you know so there was that and also uh I

758
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,720
got really into eventually into other

759
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,918
kinds of plants so I had the of the

760
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,798
Jungle cataloges I would go I would also

761
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,240
have the Church of the tree of life

762
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,720
cataloges you know all the stuff where

763
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,399
you kind of underground stuff where you

764
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,038
could get um all these amazing plants

765
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,199
and I started to experience with other

766
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,679
plants you know and I've never really

767
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,679
got so much in the Cannabis I kind of

768
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,759
thought it was a little bit like a

769
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,720
peasantry in a way like I was always

770
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,440
finding new weird plants like vong

771
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,600
or like you know I search out these new

772
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,240
experiences and I just got so into it

773
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,798
and then eventually um when I got uh I

774
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,359
don't know if I got my car or I was

775
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:14,038
still on my bus pass but I started going

776
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,879
to like teren mechanic conferences and

777
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,599
going to different meetups and meeting

778
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,120
people and uh talks and then I became

779
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,079
the youngest member of the Albert

780
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,319
Hoffman Society believe it or not I

781
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,480
think I was still only 17 and I used to

782
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,918
go to all other things I don't think

783
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,120
they're around anymore but I got to see

784
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,919
a lot of people like Jonathan a and I

785
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,359
think I saw Christian ratch and all

786
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,600
these different really cool psychedelic

787
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,439
kind of ethnobotanist people and then as

788
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,599
I got older and older I'm like I was so

789
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,240
driven and I really wanted to be an

790
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:48,480
ethnobotanist kind of like Richard Evans

791
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,960
schulties or like Timothy Plowman or

792
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,200
like you know all these guys way Davis

793
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,798
Mark plin all these really cool Roots

794
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,440
like uh no botus but like more on a

795
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,158
religious tip like really trying to

796
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,278
figure out what plants they use to

797
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,720
connect to the Divine or to their

798
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:03,880
ancestors and so I got really jazzed

799
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,399
that me and my friend were going to move

800
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,720
up to Santa Cruz I was going to go to

801
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:13,278
UCSC and do uh ethnobotany and somehow

802
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,679
he got in and I didn't I think he got in

803
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,079
because he he was part Guatemalan which

804
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,840
was Co but and I was a bum that I didn't

805
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,519
get in but it actually sent me on a

806
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,918
whole another trajectory where I got

807
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,278
really involved with the underground

808
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,720
like music scene um you know before I

809
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,558
moved up I had a smart bar in in LA in

810
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,360
San Diego called tribal liquid where I

811
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,798
used I made all these herbal concoctions

812
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,439
and I would sell them at

813
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:42,398
Raves um back in like 89 to 91 and that

814
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,320
was kind of my uh thing and so I got to

815
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,158
do that and then when I moved up you I

816
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,519
went to school I just kind of sunk back

817
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,278
into that and he used to go to free

818
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,679
outdoor parties and I realized I have

819
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,759
this amazing record collection like and

820
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,759
I saw people DJing I'm like why can't I

821
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,359
do that you know and so that's when I

822
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,879
started getting into d DJing and that

823
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,158
was kind of back when there it was

824
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,000
pre-trip hop it was more like acid JZ so

825
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:06,880
what we were doing is we were taking we

826
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,278
were we had this group called spaceship

827
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,880
guia which was a three of us and we were

828
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,440
really pushing the genres we would get

829
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,679
like um hip-hop instrumentals and then

830
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,360
also like drum and bass records and we

831
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,360
pitch down the drum and bass records to

832
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,359
33 and then and then play like real

833
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,479
world like Peter Gabriel like um you

834
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,000
know he had this label that had all

835
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,399
these kind of world music so we would

836
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,638
drop like fullon ragas and different

837
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:31,319
stuff over really fat beats and

838
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:33,079
baselines and that was kind of like

839
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,798
pre-trip po we got known for that and

840
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,398
then we just started having our own

841
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,319
group and we started a magazine and then

842
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,558
we were doing three outdoor parties and

843
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,839
we I did that Forever Until I you know

844
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,638
and then I got started playing in San

845
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,119
Francisco and then I started playing in

846
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:49,879
Canada I think I played at Shambala a

847
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,439
couple times on almost every stage they

848
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,679
had there and that was kind of my life

849
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,360
and then you know going through that

850
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,679
going through that and finally I'm like

851
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,439
I I still want to be an noobist so I

852
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,559
went to Community College and they had a

853
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,558
thing where if you go to the local

854
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,960
College they'll get you right into UCSC

855
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:10,000
so I eventually got into UCSC and

856
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,800
realized right away that ethnobotany

857
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,159
really there was just too much science

858
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,599
like I just couldn't do it I was like an

859
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,919
artist I just really I had a different

860
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,720
mind so I got into uh religious

861
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,440
anthropology with an emphasis on plants

862
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,878
and culture and I was able in that to

863
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,320
have a really cool teacher who um try

864
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:30,838
lowkey Pandy and he really allowed me to

865
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,440
just take it wherever I wanted and for

866
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,398
two semesters I got to do my own

867
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,878
semesters abroad one I did in um in the

868
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:41,440
Himalayas and I wanted to tie in like

869
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,440
sacred plant use and tantric science and

870
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,079
that that was just too hard of a nut to

871
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,440
crack so I just had fun in uh in the

872
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,839
Himalayas and kind of started you know

873
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,480
introduced to Himalayan hash which was a

874
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,838
total Revelation to me I think that's

875
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,599
where I really realized how amazing

876
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,759
cannabis could be you know I didn't

877
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,119
really always put the dots together you

878
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,640
know the very first dot I think it was

879
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,838
in a previous episode you know where

880
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,358
were you first turned on we got some

881
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:09,719
really good gona in B and I remember I

882
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,799
first really got the Cannabis hit when

883
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:14,879
we smoked at these temples in Guatemala

884
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,680
and I realized that just opened up a

885
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,480
completely different portal to reality

886
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,960
like like I saying before like that

887
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,119
natur Nature's Wi-Fi like the spiritual

888
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,440
internet and that's where I really tuned

889
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,960
in but smoking Himalayan hash was truly

890
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,800
one of like that that if anyone gets a

891
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,880
chance to get up into Himalayas like

892
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,960
it's just there's nothing like Himalayan

893
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,680
handrub like it's just so incredible so

894
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,400
to Circle back once again I keep on

895
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:48,000
Losing Myself um yeah the second uh

896
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,318
study abroad um I actually decided to do

897
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,280
my research thesis in the Amazon jungle

898
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:56,400
um and it was going to be the my whole

899
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,960
thesis was on the intersection

900
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,160
between the jungle and the cities like

901
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,920
that point right where the jungles and

902
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:10,799
cities touch and um MSO based iasa thing

903
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,559
where how in the context of iasa and

904
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,079
these

905
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:18,599
incredible um ancient systems how they

906
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,800
converge with these modern encroaching

907
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,200
cities like aidos and PPA I was

908
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,599
primarily in Peru and where this how the

909
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:30,118
ma these magical interfaces how the iasa

910
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,480
would morph and how they would blend

911
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,680
with these kind of like City or like

912
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,559
City jungle shamans would interact and

913
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,919
even how the jungle and the city went

914
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,799
undera and that was kind of my I also

915
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,440
did a little addendum on IAS tourism I

916
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,440
would have never known today like that

917
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,240
was 25 years ago how it's bloomed like I

918
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,599
would have never thought it so many iasa

919
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,919
centers would be going and how uh how

920
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,760
prolific it would be and how much it it

921
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,240
would spread out through Consciousness

922
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,240
so that that's a real eye opener these

923
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,239
days but you know I I went into the

924
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,479
jungle I was there for like five or six

925
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:05,039
weeks I went in the rainy season which I

926
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,920
realize now was probably the dumbest

927
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,440
thing I yeah no one ever goes in the

928
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,400
rainy season so it was quite an

929
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,039
adventure you know I had so many

930
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,039
incredible Adventures on boats and ships

931
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,639
and ship captains and you know we'd have

932
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:23,559
to go way way way in and meeting some of

933
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,358
these amazing amazing deep uh plant

934
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:27,920
people and you know and doing an

935
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,559
apprenticeship and realizing through

936
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,358
iasa that you know I always thought I'd

937
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,159
work blance but I always thought it was

938
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,598
going to be something else I never knew

939
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,440
it was I didn't never thought I was

940
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,480
going to be cannabis was going to be my

941
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,880
thing but you know I had this this

942
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,960
experience in after the IAS in a dream

943
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,640
where it was like the spirit of iasa

944
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,159
said you know I know you're here I know

945
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,318
you're initiating but iasa isn't your

946
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:54,920
plant your plant is back at home your

947
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:57,159
plan is waiting for you and so I didn't

948
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,240
put it two and two together until you

949
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:00,358
know

950
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,358
in the future when I started to really

951
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:05,679
get involved with cannabis and you know

952
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,559
primarily that involvement was also

953
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,318
through DJing and music the entire music

954
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,318
scene in the Bay Area was fueled by

955
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:14,199
cannabis everybody that was a DJ or an

956
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,159
artist or hit rapper and everything

957
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:18,519
everybody subsidized it and all these

958
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,598
free parties with ganja and you know I

959
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:24,000
was the guy that was you know making

960
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,960
bubble has so that that was my thing and

961
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,599
then as I met my previous partner who we

962
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,480
had kids with

963
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,838
um she was a grower and she

964
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,719
really uh was dialed into that and I met

965
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,318
a lot of amazing people through that a

966
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,199
lot of people that I know today and as

967
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:47,239
she stepped out of it when uh she was

968
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,679
pregnant I just dived in head first and

969
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:51,598
I just went berserk like I became a

970
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,679
freak like I just loved everything about

971
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,160
it and got into the seeds and did all

972
00:38:54,679 --> 00:39:02,879
that and you know I and I never stopped

973
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:04,358
so I guess the I guess that swings us up

974
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,079
to date you know I made it out of the

975
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:10,838
Amazon alive um I got back I graduated I

976
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,880
realized that you can't really do much

977
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:17,318
with a religious anthropology degree

978
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:22,800
besides teach or do demographics so I

979
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:25,318
just I pivoted into really following my

980
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,079
passion and following what the plants

981
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:30,000
told me was my destiny and I I guess

982
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,200
that's kind of my background I'm sure I

983
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,280
missed a lot of stuff but that's it in a

984
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:39,000
nutshell wow I uh I always love hearing

985
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,839
that story and even even having heard

986
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,599
most of that before still some bits I uh

987
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,480
I I hadn't heard so that's that's

988
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,920
beautiful to get that backstory and I

989
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
it's it's it's perfect cuz it ties into

990
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,000
the next question which one of the

991
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,960
patron users submited but it's just a

992
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,239
cracker of a question in general and

993
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,000
they sort was saying look I'd be

994
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,399
interested to hear bod's thoughts on

995
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,920
when how who uh was involved in cannabis

996
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,160
first entering in to the Americas

997
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,400
particularly narrow Leaf drug types in

998
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,279
South America there's obviously a few

999
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,240
different theories was it European

1000
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,200
explorers was it slave trade was it pre

1001
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,799
poost Columbus uh a lot of theories out

1002
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:23,960
there but because bod's work with so

1003
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,200
many different nlds I'd be interested to

1004
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,039
hear his

1005
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,519
thoughts yeah I mean

1006
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm going to have to say there's

1007
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,639
definitely a lot of information that

1008
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,119
points to certain sources but there's

1009
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:39,358
also a lot of things that we don't have

1010
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:42,280
the ability to know like definitely I

1011
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,078
think you had a lot of African narrow

1012
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Leaf drug types moving with the the

1013
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,200
slaves you know and uh bringing it with

1014
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,720
them and all these different places

1015
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,519
throughout Brazil you know even Gana

1016
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:58,480
like everywhere seems to have these

1017
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,880
things and it was and equatorial place

1018
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,519
they grew well they worked well they

1019
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,559
were a Panacea I mean there's also some

1020
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,719
of the theories that you know early in

1021
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:12,599
the Americas uh there was these kind of

1022
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:15,358
uh they call them like uh what is it

1023
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,920
snake oil medicines patent medicines all

1024
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,719
these kind of medicines that were people

1025
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,200
were providing the early kind of

1026
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:25,639
a uh drug store concoctions and they

1027
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:30,759
were using like uh kind of

1028
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:34,279
a these in uh import Indian stock there

1029
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,800
you know and I heard that it was hard to

1030
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,680
get the Cannabis over in ships without

1031
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,960
it molding and eventually Park Davis and

1032
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,719
a couple other people that were starting

1033
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,318
to use it um realized that if they

1034
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,279
brought seeds over and planted seeds

1035
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:52,079
they would have a product that you know

1036
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,480
was a lot quicker to ship it wasn't it

1037
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:59,160
wouldn't it would be more prolific it

1038
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,960
would be a lot more uh um you know money

1039
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:05,199
uh it would be a lot less money to have

1040
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,318
it within reach and from what I

1041
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,358
understand I'm still looking for I'm

1042
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,759
sure maybe like snow high or someone has

1043
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:12,759
the documents but I heard that Park

1044
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,079
Davis brought a lot of different strains

1045
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,720
into

1046
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:21,000
Mexico um and that a lot of these

1047
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:22,598
Mexican strains are actually uh a

1048
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,199
climatized

1049
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,760
Indians

1050
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:29,838
and

1051
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,040
um uh from different uh not necessarily

1052
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:35,480
Himalayan but I think a predominant

1053
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:39,639
amount of the stuff produced was uh kind

1054
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:42,199
of near um like a poon job and kind of

1055
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:44,598
these drier Aid places uh where they

1056
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:46,679
would Farm it you know and before that

1057
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,119
up in the stands you also had like

1058
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,838
shinjan and all these like places just

1059
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,720
over the border that were producing

1060
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:57,639
tremendous amounts of hashes so I I've

1061
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:01,000
heard that a lot of these strains in

1062
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:03,558
especially in just Mexico itself where

1063
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,760
there wasn't a lot of uh slaves coming

1064
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,280
in so much

1065
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,240
um the populations were a lot of these

1066
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,359
are escapees of maybe par Davis's stuff

1067
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:15,159
and I'm sure there you know there was

1068
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:17,719
slave ships I know in uh Guatemala

1069
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:21,279
there's the garuna which are a really

1070
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,279
unique uh section of people that were a

1071
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,920
whole I think they were Yuba or they

1072
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,359
were it was a uh it's a whole population

1073
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,680
of uh African Guatemalans where a slave

1074
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:34,838
ship crashed or hit rocks and they all

1075
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:36,759
were kind of tossed out and a bunch of

1076
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:38,519
them survived and they kind of Eder

1077
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,559
breed with the Guatemalans and they have

1078
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,960
a rich culture and I know in that area

1079
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:47,559
um I saw a lot of

1080
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:50,280
uh uh really unique narrow Leaf types

1081
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:52,079
that were distinct from like Colombians

1082
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,200
or the other Mexicans you know they were

1083
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,440
under eradication at that point they

1084
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,439
were trying to get it because it was

1085
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,760
kind of a stronghold for growing but you

1086
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,800
know I would

1087
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,920
say Park you know Park Davis I would say

1088
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,720
definitely Columbus even captains you

1089
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,599
know they needed to grow stuff that they

1090
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,239
could also make sales if they had to get

1091
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,480
their butts out of these places that

1092
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,358
they sailed you know you sale from

1093
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,400
Europe or Spain you come all the way

1094
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,639
here you maybe you lose a sale or two

1095
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,760
you're going to need to grow your hemp

1096
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,000
back sales but I've seen books too I

1097
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,800
think there's a mark Merin book I don't

1098
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,880
know where there's eyewitness accounts

1099
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,519
in the Midwest of people seeing large

1100
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,160
stands of hemp or cannabis and then we

1101
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,318
have to you know then if you want to go

1102
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:38,440
way back there's the you know the mummy

1103
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:40,358
that they did the the um drug testing on

1104
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,720
uh it was quite a controversy for a

1105
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:45,119
while but they had a mummy from Egypt

1106
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:47,959
and they thought hey let's just check it

1107
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,280
let's test it for drugs and it this is

1108
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,599
the mummy had like

1109
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,040
cocaine uh nicotine cannabinoids it had

1110
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,000
all these things showing up stuff that

1111
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,358
they didn't really have in Egypt so I

1112
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,400
think there's

1113
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:05,000
definitely a time where there was a lot

1114
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,960
more trade than we know about and I

1115
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,599
think Columbus was probably one of the

1116
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,440
last people to get here you know

1117
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,760
especially with these OMC heads there's

1118
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,240
there's such this ancient history that

1119
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,960
now we're kind of starting to get an

1120
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,039
inkling of and when we're starting to

1121
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,159
open up these new sites like gockley

1122
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,880
tley and all these Indonesian there's

1123
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:26,078
definitely a high culture that existed

1124
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,640
before our current understanding our

1125
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,359
current Lich or maybe pre flood I but I

1126
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:34,159
believe that the whole planet was turned

1127
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,880
on in a way that there was a lot more

1128
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,239
things going on but I think the stuff

1129
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,720
that we see these days is definitely uh

1130
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:44,118
diasporic like it came from

1131
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,799
people coming from their cultures and

1132
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,318
bringing their things similar to how uh

1133
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,119
there's a big Indian population in

1134
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,000
Jamaica and they brought a lot of their

1135
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,838
strengths from India into Jamaica and a

1136
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,239
lot of Jamaican strains are actually

1137
00:45:53,838 --> 00:46:00,000
climatized Indians so that's kind of my

1138
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:04,519
just on it uh but you know we just don't

1139
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,159
know enough you know and and time and

1140
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:12,280
environment does amazing

1141
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:14,480
things 100% I agree and you know what

1142
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,880
When in Rome we've got another great

1143
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,240
patreon question I'd love to hear bod's

1144
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,920
thoughts on grahe Hancock Billy Carson

1145
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:26,078
ancient civilizations extraterrestrials

1146
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,240
all that good stuff I I'm down like I I

1147
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,280
mean how do you you

1148
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:33,479
control uh you know the society by

1149
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,119
controlling history by controlling

1150
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,318
information I think there's so much more

1151
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,240
that's happened that's going on that

1152
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,159
they people that it's very restricted

1153
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,558
you know there's I think there's some

1154
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,239
kind of system set up to keep a

1155
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:52,760
narrative um so that we are less

1156
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,639
empowered as humans and as people if

1157
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,319
there was this high

1158
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:01,118
high time that's not a good thing to let

1159
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:04,639
out the population that were like this

1160
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,079
this dumb kind of like uh uh leftover

1161
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,239
Society uh that came out of a higher

1162
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,359
Society you know like they're saying

1163
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,759
that the at one point in Egypt a lot of

1164
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,078
the knowledge was lost the people that

1165
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,880
were living there really didn't have so

1166
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:18,839
much of a clue they were just kind of

1167
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,920
running off of older paradigms that

1168
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:23,920
there was actually a higher time in

1169
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,960
Egypt that a lot of these uh these you

1170
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,599
know pyramids all these different things

1171
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,440
uh uh ge ology all the you know

1172
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,599
terraforming all these things were being

1173
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,838
done at a level that we no longer have

1174
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,200
the same in you know you have in South

1175
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,920
America with the NASA lines and all

1176
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:42,919
these pyramids there's

1177
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,280
definitely there's there was a high

1178
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,880
culture and it's pretty obvious to

1179
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,720
people that want to dive into it that

1180
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,240
you know there's so much more to history

1181
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,838
that we don't know and there's so much

1182
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,078
more to our story and there's so much

1183
00:47:53,838 --> 00:48:00,279
more to us you know we we're a product

1184
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:03,039
of something so so complex and

1185
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,319
magnificent and it until we kind of

1186
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,159
realize that until we find these Clues

1187
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:09,838
to kind of awaken us out of this kind of

1188
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:12,920
collectic collective Slumber of

1189
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,239
informational um servitude in prison

1190
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,159
it's like we're not really going to be

1191
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,078
able

1192
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:22,598
to engage with the future because we can

1193
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,760
really create what we want by learn you

1194
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:27,119
know learning from the past to create a

1195
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,240
better future and if our past is

1196
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,720
controlled we're we're going to just be

1197
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:34,598
doing the same old thing so yeah I I'm

1198
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:37,159
down I'm I think Graham Haw Hancock is

1199
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,800
right on uh Billy Carson yeah he's a

1200
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:40,440
little more trippy and I love that

1201
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,920
there's so many of these guys you know

1202
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,280
you know what's funny is like on YouTube

1203
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,119
um you can go around and check out

1204
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,040
different things and I see some wild

1205
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,400
stuff and I have to just suspend belief

1206
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,480
I'm like I don't know this is the

1207
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,720
strangest Planet I've ever been on I

1208
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,798
have no clue what's going on they have

1209
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:58,679
these like soccer moms who are who are

1210
00:48:55,798 --> 00:49:01,960
like channeling the ashtar command or

1211
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,960
pleadians or like and you know it's like

1212
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,039
you know come join our pleadian mother

1213
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,838
circle you know there's so there's so

1214
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,920
much wild stuff going on right now that

1215
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:12,480
I'm not I can't say what's wrong and

1216
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,440
what's right or even if this is

1217
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,719
simulation and whatever you want to do

1218
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:21,480
is what you do I say be who you want to

1219
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:25,439
be and just dig get into whatever you're

1220
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:27,440
into and just make this an

1221
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,838
ecstatic uh

1222
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,838
place of like loving compassion fun and

1223
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:35,039
like you know make this the place where

1224
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:37,159
people come from other systems to see

1225
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:40,838
how we get it done like this you know

1226
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:42,679
this is Earth we may have a spotty past

1227
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:44,679
but we're getting we're getting things

1228
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,358
sorted and we're we turned this place

1229
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:49,358
back into the garden you know I think it

1230
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:52,598
was the Garden at one point and through

1231
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,759
bad choices and maybe people with

1232
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:57,200
Messianic complexes you know I mean look

1233
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,880
at the Aztecs they were jamming and then

1234
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,838
they just started to do way too many

1235
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,318
mushrooms and way too many sacrifices

1236
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:06,279
and I think they tapped into like some

1237
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,798
kind of denic kind of energy in the

1238
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,880
Psychedelic space it's it's like it's

1239
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:12,559
kind of like downtown Kingston or

1240
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,318
something it's like there's loads of

1241
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,960
cool people but there's also you got to

1242
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,400
watch yourself there's a lot of things

1243
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,280
they're willing to take you know for

1244
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,920
take you for your money or take you for

1245
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,319
as in a psychedelic situation I believe

1246
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,159
that you know you have to navigate it

1247
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:29,519
you have to be kind of this war of love

1248
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:31,920
when you go in because there's a lot of

1249
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,119
things going on I think with the Aztec

1250
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,000
you know they think I think they lost

1251
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,880
the pot I think they were tapping

1252
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,280
into something that needed blood and it

1253
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,480
instead of you know with ket quaddle I

1254
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,359
think he eventually came about and he

1255
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,760
decided to stop human sacrifice and they

1256
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,318
sacrificed Flowers and Butterflies so

1257
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,200
it's like on which side of History you

1258
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:54,079
want to be you know so I mean that was a

1259
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:56,239
little bit of a tangent but that's the

1260
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,480
basic kind of my philosophy on it is

1261
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,759
yeah there's a lot that that we don't

1262
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:05,519
know and there's a lot that we can do so

1263
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,760
let's do it completely I agree you know

1264
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,440
the the past is the key to the Future

1265
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,040
and and and the the golden line from in

1266
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,480
there this is the strangest Planet I've

1267
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:17,279
ever been on I have to agree for sure oh

1268
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,599
but can I interject something I just

1269
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,400
realized if people want to really have

1270
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,838
fun did you ever see like the the um

1271
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,680
Ancient Aliens but the Action Bronson

1272
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:28,920
versions where they all get stoned and

1273
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,519
watch Ancient Aliens and comment on it

1274
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,119
like if you want to get like I I love

1275
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,199
crazy stuff like that but when you just

1276
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,960
throw super stoned guys into the mix

1277
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:40,239
like that is a classic experience I

1278
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,519
don't know if you've ever seen that but

1279
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:43,959
I thought that was one of the funniest

1280
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,719
things ever oh my God it's on the list

1281
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,039
now I haven't seen it yeah there's like

1282
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,480
five or 10 episodes like they watch they

1283
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,239
literally watch the best Ancient Aliens

1284
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,159
in they commentary on it the whole time

1285
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:57,759
or they're getting super

1286
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:59,920
blazed all right I got something I can

1287
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,160
watch in bed that's

1288
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,680
good yeah I I love that I mean on that

1289
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:07,279
theme at the end you were talking about

1290
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:10,318
doing too many mushrooms if we scale it

1291
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,400
back a bit one of the first questions I

1292
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,920
asked you answered in saying you were

1293
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,000
you were waiting for your medium to grow

1294
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,798
some mushrooms I assume I wanted to ask

1295
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,400
what are you growing cubensis anything

1296
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:23,719
more exotic and what do you like doing

1297
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,599
with the medicine I I I've actually gone

1298
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,719
to the gym one time and it was uh it was

1299
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,200
interesting it was fun I don't know if

1300
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,318
I'd say do it every time yeah like when

1301
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,118
the micro do accidentally is a macro do

1302
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:37,199
you don't realize it pump and iron that

1303
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,559
was exactly

1304
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:44,199
it that's right you know I um in my past

1305
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,200
I I grew a long long time ago mushrooms

1306
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,838
and then you know it just when I was

1307
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:50,838
doing cannabis it's like I had to you

1308
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:54,159
know I there's things like I don't

1309
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:55,519
really own guns I'm not like anti gun or

1310
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:57,558
anything but there's certain things that

1311
00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:00,599
you shouldn't be doing when you're

1312
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:03,319
growing a lot of ganja and that is

1313
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,559
growing other psychedelics like back

1314
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:07,119
then mushrooms was a big big no no you

1315
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:09,000
know you shouldn't have firearms you

1316
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,960
shouldn't have money counters those

1317
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,480
things that as a peaceful plant person

1318
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,240
you know pumping out a very sketchy crop

1319
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,599
in an urban landscape you don't want to

1320
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,239
do so I took a big long Hiatus until

1321
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,960
covid and you know I was in an area

1322
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:30,558
which it was sanctioned you know Santa

1323
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,119
Cruz County you could mushrooms so you I

1324
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,240
I had some friends in high places we

1325
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:35,798
just did you

1326
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,479
know I hadn't been exposed to some of

1327
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:39,280
the mutants at that point so we were

1328
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,119
getting into just like some of the newer

1329
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,519
stuff like the albinos and some of the

1330
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,318
mutants and now I think this next round

1331
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,239
is just going to be I'm trying out kind

1332
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,838
of like I did when I was young and

1333
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,118
growing cannabis I'm trying out some of

1334
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,239
the hot new strains you know I'm doing

1335
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:57,440
like an albino Bluey Vuitton I'm doing

1336
00:53:54,239 --> 00:54:00,719
these like Snape like star

1337
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,159
um uh what is it star night Apes like uh

1338
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,439
some of the uh

1339
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:07,879
shockd and couple of the like more

1340
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,159
whatever land racy ones you know because

1341
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,400
I used to also collect uh sport prints

1342
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,440
you know I collect sport prints in the

1343
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,079
terai of Nepal down in the jungles uh

1344
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,119
you know in the late 80s early 90s we

1345
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:21,400
did a whole um me and my uh friend Mike

1346
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,119
did this whole Adventure where we

1347
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,400
followed the foot steps of like our Gard

1348
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,318
wasan we went up into the Sierra maitech

1349
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,318
and looked for Salvia and we got to meet

1350
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,838
the Sabinas and we did a lot of mushroom

1351
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:36,480
work up there with different things like

1352
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:38,039
I'm super into I love mushrooms I love

1353
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,559
medicinal mushrooms I love everything

1354
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,599
about them so you know I I don't know if

1355
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,798
it's too cold up here or I'm just maybe

1356
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,760
I got some

1357
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:49,440
bad uh or just really slow culture but

1358
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,440
yeah I'm waiting for my my spawn or

1359
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,880
substrate to colonize so that I can

1360
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,760
fruit it and it's been quite a while so

1361
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,599
if if this doesn't work out I might just

1362
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,040
re re uh colonized but what's going

1363
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:02,880
right now I think that I'm waiting on is

1364
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:04,759
I'm doing some albino tidal waves and

1365
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,599
just some regular old stuff like some

1366
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,920
Classics from the last year or two and

1367
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,280
let's see what was the other one oh

1368
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,920
albino Bluey

1369
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,559
Vuitton wow that sounds a really cool

1370
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,280
and also uh exotic I like it you got the

1371
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,960
Zaza of mushrooms by the sounds of it

1372
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,760
yeah it's not even so exotic it's like

1373
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,920
we're not going into the Super Mutant

1374
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,160
Zone which is what what FAS Fates me and

1375
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,599
which kind of seems to be driving a lot

1376
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,399
of the uh mushroom culture right now you

1377
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,440
know how you know like there's like a

1378
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,079
some amazing people that are doing this

1379
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,599
like AP King Kong and all the people

1380
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,920
like that are also kind of connected

1381
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,920
into our community um so many people are

1382
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,358
just really pushing this and you know

1383
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,838
even the breeding there scientific

1384
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:49,558
breeding and then there's people that

1385
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,519
just mashing up stuff in test tubes

1386
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,720
they're just praying they're getting a

1387
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:55,599
new thing and then with uh fenos

1388
00:55:53,719 --> 00:56:01,078
selection is primarily driven you know

1389
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:03,359
on output and potency and and uh um even

1390
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:04,839
canopy and perfect fruits but there's a

1391
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,078
whole genre that people just searching

1392
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:08,239
for mutants and just the most amazing

1393
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,160
thing things that look like lettuce

1394
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:13,679
string cheese swiss cheese like brains

1395
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,038
like that have incredible potency and

1396
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,639
then you know and with that I think

1397
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:22,240
there's a whole realm of uh of uh you

1398
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:24,879
know people concentrate on psilocybon

1399
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,838
and psilon and bosy and all these you

1400
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,160
know General tryptamines but there's a I

1401
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,159
think there's a lot of other tryptamines

1402
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,679
in some of these varieties that they

1403
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,239
haven't really measured for and that

1404
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,399
gives them their kind of individual

1405
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:39,679
effects and so it's just such a

1406
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,318
fascinating fascinating world you know

1407
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,358
I've also been getting

1408
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:45,358
really back into Cactus I've always

1409
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,639
really been into Cactus but now I never

1410
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:50,639
really popped Cactus seeds because they

1411
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:52,078
take forever so it's fun to Cactus but

1412
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,199
it's like you got to start the year

1413
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,599
before you know but you sprout so many

1414
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:56,879
and then the next year you've got like

1415
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,960
little

1416
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,880
12 inch cactuses so I mean I just love

1417
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,318
planting seeds have everything and yeah

1418
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:07,119
I flip out when that Baker Creek Seed

1419
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:09,480
Company catalog comes out you know with

1420
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,760
all the hybrid strains and like I

1421
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,960
especially like the ones they're getting

1422
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,039
up from like they'll have a little

1423
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,599
section with new African accessions like

1424
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:19,160
Basils from Africa or I love when I was

1425
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,880
in Santa Cruz I love the Japanese stuff

1426
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,598
because all the little Japanese islands

1427
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,039
are kind of like the same general

1428
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:26,838
environment as Santa Cruz kind of hot in

1429
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,799
the summer but kind of balm and a little

1430
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:31,599
bit too humid but Coastal environment

1431
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:35,318
with trees and getting all the weird

1432
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,200
greens and eggplants like I just go nuts

1433
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:40,358
I just love plants and I love seeds and

1434
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:43,399
I just I don't even care if they finish

1435
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:45,759
I just like to check them out like so

1436
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,519
mushrooms spores same thing spores are

1437
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,200
great they can they're one of the only

1438
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,280
things that can can um go through space

1439
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:55,239
travel like I learned that like you know

1440
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,839
how cool is that that spores survive

1441
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,759
space travel so you know I I had a whole

1442
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,759
weird trip where I was like oh my gosh

1443
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,319
what

1444
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:08,000
if uh mushroom spores are terraforming

1445
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:12,599
Technologies from The Source they're

1446
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,960
just like blown out through uh SpaceTime

1447
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:17,440
hitting you inhabitable planets and

1448
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,199
seeding those planets because with you

1449
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,880
know because they're these little mini

1450
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,000
like starships that have the DNA of

1451
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:27,039
fungus and then fungus is one of the

1452
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,280
very first terraformers of these planets

1453
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,039
I love I love your theory yeah I mean

1454
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,079
I'm sure it's not my theory I'm sure

1455
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,480
there many Trippers have done that I'm

1456
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:38,599
sure Paul Stam are all these people it

1457
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,280
it it it's pretty self-explanatory like

1458
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:44,039
why would spores uh be able to move

1459
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,720
through space flight and also you know

1460
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:48,599
why not have something that quickens the

1461
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,439
monkey mind you know and the whole

1462
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:52,519
Terence McKenna the stoned ape like I

1463
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,200
totally believe plants are the reason

1464
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:58,318
why we are who we are and you know and

1465
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,879
and and definitely

1466
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:03,719
communication like I think the spirit

1467
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,760
plants are what kind of taught us to

1468
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:08,358
communicate and I even heard something

1469
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,640
really crazy recently I don't know if

1470
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:14,598
it's true but I heard that every before

1471
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:18,118
this one famous Alchemist uh everybody

1472
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:20,079
read books in their uh out loud no one

1473
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,440
read books in their mind like everybody

1474
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,359
who would read to would always read to

1475
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,679
themselves so whether it was in their

1476
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:27,000
room or to other people and it really

1477
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:28,558
tripped us out I think it was like maybe

1478
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,880
five or 6 hundred years ago there was a

1479
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,640
certain Alchemist who could read in his

1480
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,519
M like basically how we all do it just

1481
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:37,960
read to ourselves and it really threw

1482
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:39,599
everybody for a loop because they're

1483
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,119
like What's this guy doing how does he

1484
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,280
remember all this stuff and it was just

1485
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,880
because he was reading his mine total

1486
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,160
tangent but I just that popped in my

1487
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,519
head because I thought it was so cool

1488
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,480
and then people started to be like oh

1489
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,239
wow you don't have to read with your

1490
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,318
mouth you can read inside your head and

1491
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:58,038
that set off a you know whole another

1492
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:59,880
level P guy to do rooms yeah maybe he

1493
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:02,760
did or maybe you know they used to do a

1494
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,920
lot of uh hashish was a commodity that

1495
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,480
moved through time and space a lot more

1496
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,838
lucratively than we ever you know ever

1497
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,719
thought like it had a it had a

1498
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:14,599
trajectory of its own I think it you

1499
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,000
know you of course we all know about the

1500
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:20,519
silk route and how things traveled along

1501
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,880
that but there was hashish getting into

1502
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,519
Europe to The Alchemist and stuff and

1503
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,000
actually all over you know the

1504
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:29,358
Mediterranean everywhere quite early on

1505
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,239
it was a coveted substance along with

1506
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,558
you know opium and I'm sure many other

1507
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,719
things that we just don't have a

1508
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:38,798
historical record

1509
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:41,118
of yeah totally I I mean all of that

1510
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,079
stuff is so interesting like especially

1511
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,838
all the the history of the Silk Road and

1512
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,160
as you said the stuff we don't have the

1513
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:48,558
history of is probably the most

1514
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:51,279
interesting of it all but while we're on

1515
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,519
the topic what are your thoughts on like

1516
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,480
modern hash and and I guess like the

1517
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,280
Rosen scene the the BHO and all the

1518
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,639
variants where do you where do you feel

1519
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,000
we're at with

1520
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:04,239
that um I mean I think it's just coming

1521
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,920
into its own it's incredible like with

1522
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,479
this they even have like the Pella now

1523
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,000
there's all these natural Technologies I

1524
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,000
love rosing and them you know fresh

1525
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
frozen and pressing out like people are

1526
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,679
finding like it is it's a modernday

1527
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,039
alchemical revolution you know in the

1528
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:23,078
processing temperature like it's

1529
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,400
basically people just getting to tweak

1530
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,559
out as hard as they can to create the

1531
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,760
most

1532
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:32,000
you know the the most fabulous item like

1533
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,799
the most you know everybody I think it's

1534
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,920
like what a noble pursuit to create the

1535
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:40,880
most fabulous like representation of the

1536
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,920
plant it's Tricom head like its gift is

1537
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,480
its head you know it's it's like here it

1538
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,720
is here's here and people doing

1539
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,240
everything they can I mean BHO was our

1540
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:52,118
like kind of like a MacGyver level just

1541
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,239
getting to know that hey we can do this

1542
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:56,798
and then moving into like bubble has and

1543
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:59,118
then and then two Frenchie bringing back

1544
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,480
you know his whole bringing back the old

1545
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,920
school ways you know and then there's so

1546
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,559
much to learn from the old school if we

1547
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,400
just apply it you know people are now

1548
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,839
like you know a lot of cultures would

1549
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,240
Harvest and hang into the winter so that

1550
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:12,000
when they did their processing it was

1551
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,078
super cold out they preserve heads you

1552
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,798
know burying things like some of the

1553
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,720
Afghan they would bury it in you know

1554
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:20,440
like the stomach of a sheep or sheep

1555
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,919
Skinner do these different processing

1556
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,920
techniques and hand hand rubbing is a

1557
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,960
big thing on its own and having kids

1558
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,838
hand rub because they're such you know

1559
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,440
delicate there's so many unique ways

1560
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:36,278
that we're taking to this future but

1561
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,880
this new current like uh Machinery meets

1562
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:41,880
you know like pressing meets cing meets

1563
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,798
you all these instraction Technologies

1564
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,160
and then everybody getting so into it

1565
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:47,239
and like you know things like the ego

1566
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:48,719
clash and it's it's kind of funny that

1567
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:51,798
it's always the same strain like

1568
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:55,078
Skittles winning you think would be a

1569
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:57,000
they people would be pushing it in uh

1570
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:58,640
new directions with flavors but I think

1571
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,719
it's kind of like everybody wants to win

1572
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:02,920
and Skittles is always winning so why

1573
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,879
you who wants to deviate from the winner

1574
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,760
like you know it's like if you have a

1575
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,039
winning hamster breed you don't want to

1576
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,680
be breeding like a hairless hamster or

1577
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,039
something thinking it's super cool do

1578
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:15,440
that makes no sense but you know what

1579
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,119
I'm saying is I think this new hash

1580
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,599
Revolution Is Awesome same as the the

1581
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:23,519
pipc con same as yeah just all these new

1582
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,039
avenues that people are really finding

1583
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:29,759
and finding their their path in it too I

1584
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:33,440
say I say yeah Kudos gho you guys get

1585
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,160
it yeah no totally totally I uh I'm all

1586
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,880
aboard and I I'm interested to see what

1587
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,558
it'll look like and so as a as a more

1588
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,640
general question like where do you see

1589
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,160
the Cannabis culture going in like 5 to

1590
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:47,000
10 years what do you think the landscape

1591
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,598
will look like will we will we still be

1592
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,760
consuming

1593
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:54,278
flour I mean if you it I think we'll

1594
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,839
always be consuming flour

1595
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:58,880
because there's a lot of people that are

1596
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:01,759
just doing what they can to get by and

1597
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,440
use cannabis just to make their end of

1598
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,039
their day better to you know help with

1599
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:11,159
those aches and pains to stay up and

1600
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,680
stay anti- depressed and to uh to get

1601
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:13,960
more into their music their Hobbies

1602
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:15,639
their video games I think there's always

1603
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,798
going to be flower because it's easy to

1604
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:21,278
grow and you know people love flowers is

1605
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:25,239
that um isn't

1606
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:27,679
that uh Luther one of Luther birth Banks

1607
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:30,038
like quote like nature laughs in flowers

1608
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:32,318
like it's just this it's a special thing

1609
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:35,160
and I think in 5 years I don't know I

1610
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,079
guess it depends on legislation too or

1611
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:39,480
how things open up and how creative

1612
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:43,480
people can be I mean there's it can be

1613
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:47,199
very dystopian with just fake TPS and

1614
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,079
and U distillate and people mixing into

1615
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,759
creepy carts and getting them out as

1616
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,119
every flavor underground I mean there's

1617
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,359
always going to be that it's easy it's

1618
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:56,039
cheap I know kids like that you when we

1619
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:59,440
were talking that's about the spray pack

1620
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:02,480
that's I think what I would like to see

1621
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,760
is just total freedom people can do is

1622
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,599
people get into how they want to do it

1623
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,559
and just come up with every imaginable

1624
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,000
really cool thing and you know the best

1625
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:13,079
toys always rise to the top you know

1626
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,079
it's like people are going to make more

1627
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:19,400
and more unique things and the more

1628
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:21,119
novelty and uniqueness the more uh the

1629
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,760
Public's going to want it and the more

1630
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,278
it's going to bolster it and the more

1631
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,599
it's going to kind of encourage that so

1632
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:29,838
I I want to see a dystopian future I

1633
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,359
want to see like a future that has like

1634
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:34,920
infinite cannabis potentials and enough

1635
01:05:32,358 --> 01:05:37,119
potentials so that everybody has a way

1636
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,480
to um provide for themselves but also

1637
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,278
nourish themselves if they want to get

1638
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,798
into cannabis and plants and stuff that

1639
01:05:40,278 --> 01:05:43,119
they can support themselves and their

1640
01:05:41,798 --> 01:05:44,798
family and find their Niche and find

1641
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,079
their passion and create something

1642
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:48,798
unique and new whether it's just making

1643
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:51,278
really good bubble has from a really

1644
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:53,798
special strain that maybe their family

1645
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:58,278
has only had to some kind of wizard

1646
01:05:53,798 --> 01:06:02,519
level like Ros and Pella like um uh you

1647
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:06,079
know 31 flavor swirl unit like just just

1648
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:07,798
getting so uniquely amazing you know

1649
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,240
static Tech

1650
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:12,079
superhero I don't even know just people

1651
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,000
going for it and that's what I really

1652
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,960
want to see so I'm hoping not to see

1653
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,440
pharmaceutical companies and big

1654
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:24,838
growups uh just gross mids uh you know

1655
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:28,838
massive company grow offs and People

1656
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:30,558
Brewing up just to LIT um funky carts

1657
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:32,639
that's not what I want to see I want to

1658
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,519
see people following their heart and

1659
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:37,719
Bliss and making this a really unique

1660
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,798
thing and if that takes people like

1661
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:42,959
giving the middle finger to government

1662
01:06:39,798 --> 01:06:45,119
big business and maybe deciding that

1663
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,720
flower shouldn't be illegal and breaking

1664
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,278
some laws then maybe it's time to break

1665
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:54,000
some laws especially laws that are dumb

1666
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:56,440
and have only been around since you know

1667
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,920
the prohibition days it's like

1668
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,440
this is really yeah it this is where I

1669
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,559
just like especially like putting people

1670
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,760
people in cages for growing or selling

1671
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:07,960
flowers like where where did that like

1672
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:11,760
who is involved in that that probably

1673
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:14,960
one of the most insane myopic and dumb

1674
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:18,079
things I've ever like can wrap my brain

1675
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:21,559
around so no I want people to just

1676
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:23,760
do do the impossible and do it from

1677
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,760
their

1678
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,838
heart yeah to totally totally I I agree

1679
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:32,400
and it's interesting you mention that

1680
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:35,440
because I I can't remember who it was I

1681
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,160
think it was Ed Rosenthal um I I spoke

1682
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,440
to him and I sort of said look you know

1683
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:43,318
people have criticized some of the

1684
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,079
things you've advocated for um L

1685
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:46,480
legalization and he sort of said you

1686
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:48,880
know look at the end of the day though

1687
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,599
like the ultimate metric is like people

1688
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,680
kept out of jail for cannabis and as

1689
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:57,519
much as it's not great like you know you

1690
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:00,719
it it's got to be the ultimate metric

1691
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:03,038
and it's like yeah it is that is true

1692
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,078
and on that topic you know I got two two

1693
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,440
questions for you the first one is you

1694
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,079
know you you spoke about moving forward

1695
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,278
some of the listeners had taken a look

1696
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:14,640
at some of the new lavender lemonade

1697
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:16,279
lines or hybrids you you'd made and they

1698
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:18,198
wanted to know firstly are there any

1699
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:20,159
you're particularly excited for but as a

1700
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:22,119
quick followup one of the listener says

1701
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,639
look there's some cool looking new mums

1702
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:26,278
in the mix that I hadn't really heard of

1703
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:29,000
you know like chai and Frozen and lemons

1704
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,880
and dessert lime can you tell us a

1705
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,119
little bit about some of those mums and

1706
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,640
are there any you're really Keen

1707
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:38,759
about yeah like a lot of those ones are

1708
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,480
ones that I got from um from Haze of

1709
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:42,640
Valley like ones that they really liked

1710
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:45,000
and really and they really dug and you

1711
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:49,199
know and when I uh and when I didn't

1712
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,039
have a grow and I was uh you know I made

1713
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,798
and I needed help making seeds they you

1714
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:56,238
know it's a long story but they were

1715
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:58,960
made in a place that

1716
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:02,919
well I won't get into it but they helped

1717
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:05,239
um make a ra a round of seeds and like

1718
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,679
uh they had so many unique cultivars to

1719
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:09,238
choose from that I threw in some of

1720
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:10,838
theirs as well as mine um because you

1721
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:12,079
know I got to experience some of flower

1722
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:13,759
and I like wow these are really neat

1723
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:15,198
like I always love to see what people

1724
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:18,359
are doing and what all the new neat

1725
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:20,759
things because people are awesome and

1726
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:22,600
cannabis is awesome and cool stuff gets

1727
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:25,039
made and it's easy to like especially

1728
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,640
when you're kind of hermetic like me to

1729
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:28,359
really get a chance to see all these

1730
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,880
things so I I threw in some of the ones

1731
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:31,719
I liked you know and there's also a lot

1732
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,159
of ones that were just stuff that I

1733
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:38,000
never released like chai is actually a

1734
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:40,759
um ass F3 that I just push the ass more

1735
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,560
and more towards the kind of like

1736
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,119
um the I think it was the Hell's Angels

1737
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,319
and it uh you know there's a little bit

1738
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,119
of Hell's Angels in the ass and I I like

1739
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:50,520
to take a lot of my lines and push them

1740
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:52,798
in different directions and kind of use

1741
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,120
them as tools or have them for a rainy

1742
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:55,640
day like I don't usually release them

1743
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,760
because you know when you're doing uh

1744
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,920
you're pushing lines and you're doing FG

1745
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,239
you're usually kind of just doing them

1746
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,800
for yourself and you're maybe you're

1747
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:09,000
just pollinating a small plant or you're

1748
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:12,600
pollinating a branch so um yeah the chai

1749
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,119
is is part of that mandarin orange spice

1750
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,239
uh line that was leased it's a lavender

1751
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:17,599
lemonade and that is a a almost a plant

1752
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:21,279
that was reminded me of kind of like the

1753
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:24,679
white it was really creamy and just the

1754
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:27,679
tiniest bit spicy but mostly just kind

1755
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:30,279
of very very frosty and monotone but I

1756
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:32,520
knew in a hybrid if you searched hard

1757
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:35,000
enough that skunk stuff might come back

1758
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,360
out because it's only like a cross away

1759
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,119
from just you know popping its head back

1760
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,880
in and I know in the mandin orang spice

1761
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:43,800
you'll find once in a while you get a

1762
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,079
really gross kind of like ass throwback

1763
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,640
so you usually get kind of like this

1764
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:50,479
hoppy orange peo te really beautiful

1765
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,880
flowers really good producer really

1766
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:55,279
thick um but once in a while you get a

1767
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,039
stinker so that that's something to look

1768
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:59,238
for and those yeah and then I I mean

1769
01:10:58,039 --> 01:11:00,560
that's the gist I'm trying to think of

1770
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:03,399
some of the other ones I threw in and I

1771
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,440
threw in some of my other like you know

1772
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:06,960
I used to test out a lot of things at

1773
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:08,839
home and so I would always find cool

1774
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,600
stuff and maybe I didn't have any seeds

1775
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,279
so much to release but I would keep them

1776
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,480
around and you know I'd throw them in

1777
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:17,800
and I thought that was kind of fun

1778
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:20,319
because it wasn't a traditional breeding

1779
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:23,119
uh kind of event where I would take a

1780
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,960
you know a a medium size room and put in

1781
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,960
all my favorites and just let one of my

1782
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,719
St standards kind of just do its thing

1783
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,279
like the ad3 or W or Appalachia snow

1784
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:33,800
Lotus any of those bigger populations

1785
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:36,119
there a lot of these new things are

1786
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,600
either special things from other people

1787
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:38,920
or they're kind of special things that I

1788
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,320
collected over

1789
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,199
time beautiful I I love that and look on

1790
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:46,479
the topic of special things you've

1791
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:48,000
collected over time one of our listeners

1792
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,879
says that they were lucky enough to

1793
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,800
score themselves a pack of the akapo

1794
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,159
gold freebies and they uh they just

1795
01:11:53,800 --> 01:12:00,199
wanted to know a little bit backstory on

1796
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:03,399
these ones yeah like I'm really bad um

1797
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:04,678
I'm pretty positive um I always get

1798
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:06,198
everybody especially back in the old

1799
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:09,158
days everybody's handles and stuff I'm

1800
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:11,919
almost positive that it was that was

1801
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:14,839
from liquid kid sorry if it was from

1802
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:17,560
some otherone and those came from his

1803
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:19,760
mentor um what was his mentor's name

1804
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:22,360
like Blackwolf or Dire Wolf it had a

1805
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,560
really cool like old schoolers name I

1806
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:26,599
I'm such I wish I wrote I'm somewhere I

1807
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,400
have this all down but my memory is just

1808
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:32,120
not what the way it used to be even a

1809
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:34,279
year ago and it was his mentors that he

1810
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:37,800
got in a Poco a long time ago and he'd

1811
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:41,279
save for so long and then um I got him

1812
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:44,199
from liquid and there was so cool that

1813
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:46,279
um that I decided oh this is an awesome

1814
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:48,198
line I'm going to do a Repro and try and

1815
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:49,920
save this and it was actually a

1816
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:52,359
gentleman that I knew that was such a

1817
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,079
good guy he actually did I sent him to

1818
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:57,119
him because he's like oh I've always

1819
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:59,439
wanted an AAP old you know he saw that I

1820
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:02,119
was growing him and and what is his name

1821
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:04,279
oh my God he was a great guy and I sorry

1822
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:05,920
everybody um but you're living on

1823
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:08,960
through the strains here there's a story

1824
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,679
to every strain and it's beautiful that

1825
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,639
maybe I'll post it somewhere when I can

1826
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:14,359
get all the information back but he

1827
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,400
always wanted to go on aaok gold and I

1828
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:17,759
was like you know I only have a few

1829
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:19,839
seeds but if you if you do an open

1830
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:23,239
pollination and you give me back a bunch

1831
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,360
for the N project um you're welcome to

1832
01:13:23,238 --> 01:13:27,198
have these so he grew out a bunch bunch

1833
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,319
and he did a great job he had he grew

1834
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:31,479
him around his pool like in Southern

1835
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:33,599
California and he did he had a I think a

1836
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:36,559
couple males and he had about eight

1837
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,199
females and he kept a bunch for himself

1838
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,560
and he sent that me the rest and you

1839
01:13:38,198 --> 01:13:41,879
know one of the lines was slightly

1840
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:43,840
hermaphroditic I still have those seeds

1841
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:47,199
didn't put those into the mix and put

1842
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:49,400
them into packs and gave out tons I

1843
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:52,359
think and Nara I think sold some through

1844
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:54,319
Nara um the Nara project but mostly just

1845
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:55,719
gave them out and then yeah it's

1846
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:58,559
beautiful to see people getting back

1847
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:01,600
into him I know like Mass medical he did

1848
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,159
he did a a Repro um and I think a few

1849
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,679
other people so I mean that's that's

1850
01:14:03,158 --> 01:14:06,759
where I think a lot of these cool people

1851
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,679
want these old school standards is find

1852
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,560
the old Growers find the old people that

1853
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:13,158
have had these lines forever because you

1854
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,880
know it's a snapshot in time in time and

1855
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:19,000
space environment that we don't really

1856
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,719
have the opportunity to uh have anymore

1857
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,439
you know it's like these these are

1858
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:26,279
beautiful it's like a Polaroid of your

1859
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:28,599
uh uh you know your an old family member

1860
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:30,319
in OKO you know get to see them in their

1861
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,039
teenage years all these things it's like

1862
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,439
it's these are

1863
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:36,279
amazing snapshots like these time

1864
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:39,719
machines like and they're interactive

1865
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:42,719
too it's like this is not only a seed

1866
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:45,239
this is an interactive time machine for

1867
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,359
uh a special time in history a special

1868
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:49,519
geographic location history and

1869
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,119
everything that came before like if you

1870
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,280
dig if you go deep enough into these

1871
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:55,800
strains like really open up to them and

1872
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:58,800
just especially if you just get a Mega

1873
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:02,480
Blaze going on and deep dive you can

1874
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:06,320
follow these strains back into almost to

1875
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:07,599
the back to their very origin and to you

1876
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:09,198
know and you'll get these little

1877
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,440
sometimes imprints of people and

1878
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,919
cultures and maybe it's just tripping

1879
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:17,799
out and having fun with your mind but

1880
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:20,840
it's just as real as anything so yeah I

1881
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,480
another once again I'm going Tangy on

1882
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,039
just that but big UPS to all these

1883
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:25,919
people that have brought these old seeds

1884
01:15:24,039 --> 01:15:28,238
into my life and especially AR World

1885
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,639
cool cool strain so yeah that's the

1886
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:34,638
backstory that's epic I hadn't heard any

1887
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:36,719
of that so there you go that's uh dir

1888
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:38,079
wolf okay never mind I'll shut up but it

1889
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,079
it's not it's

1890
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:42,600
something something like that but you

1891
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:44,319
get the gist I get the gist I I I like

1892
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,520
that story that's that's really cool and

1893
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:48,279
and talking about older seeds you know

1894
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:50,000
um another good question we got was in

1895
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:52,559
your opinion you know do you think

1896
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,760
cannabis was really that different in

1897
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,400
the early '90s or is it you know a bit

1898
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:59,600
of Nostalgia about all

1899
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:01,039
varieties um I think it was both you

1900
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,000
know I think we're getting a lot of

1901
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:07,719
import back then and anything grown

1902
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,880
point of origin that has the right Arc

1903
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:12,119
of the Sun the right soil composition

1904
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,800
the right all these parameters you know

1905
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:15,158
these

1906
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,560
strains kind of grew in these locations

1907
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:19,519
and were tended by humans in these areas

1908
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,920
for quite a long time and especially the

1909
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:25,040
ones that were picking for drug types

1910
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,520
you know a drug type selected over a 100

1911
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:29,600
your Span in a certain location with

1912
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,320
everything it needs to express itself to

1913
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,079
its highest and that's getting imported

1914
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:36,639
you know and a lot of these narrow Leafs

1915
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,519
do better when they have time to age or

1916
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:40,880
oppressed and they're coming into the

1917
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,560
states and you're getting tie stick or

1918
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,039
you're getting these different things

1919
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,719
hell yeah it's a a totally different and

1920
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,039
amazing experience it would be the same

1921
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,158
thing as maybe going to Thailand now and

1922
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:52,760
trying some kind of you know tie stick

1923
01:16:51,158 --> 01:16:55,039
or something at their point of origin I

1924
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,600
really think there's something to

1925
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,519
experiencing these heirloom and

1926
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,960
so-called like land race Springs at

1927
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,480
their point of origin because that's

1928
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,719
where they truly shine we can try and

1929
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:07,799
climatize them here and we get or we can

1930
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:10,039
try and replicate indoor environments

1931
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:13,840
that are like it and we can get pretty

1932
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:17,639
close but we never really get the true

1933
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,760
true like it's like you know in its

1934
01:17:17,639 --> 01:17:21,400
native um element you know and that's

1935
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,800
why I think hybrids are so cool is these

1936
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:25,920
are kind of like these futuristic

1937
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:29,279
Creations that have

1938
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,440
um um a little bit of everything that

1939
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,319
unation like you know I talked to like I

1940
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,919
saying Jeff from J Nector he smoked my

1941
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:38,399
um uh space nectar which is like a blue

1942
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,480
dream wook and he's used to smoking

1943
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:41,599
heirlooms all you know all the time all

1944
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,119
these different things from all over and

1945
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,159
he was like wow this is really cool

1946
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,359
really got really introspective was F

1947
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:48,599
with friends it had all these qualities

1948
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:50,439
and I was like you know this is welcome

1949
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,639
to the world of hybrids you know it's

1950
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:54,439
like you sometimes it's just like people

1951
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:56,239
that never smoke heirloom or land race

1952
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:58,638
that has a very specific kind of

1953
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:00,759
morphology and canabo spectrum and

1954
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:03,719
Turpin if you've never smoked those you

1955
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:06,280
never really have get to experience the

1956
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:07,960
specialness of kind of other plants so I

1957
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:09,880
think he it was kind of an aha moment at

1958
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:12,000
least for me and probably for him too

1959
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,840
that wow hybrids also have this really

1960
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,600
special magic it is really this unique

1961
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:19,480
blending so

1962
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:21,600
um that was kind I don't know if I got

1963
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:25,000
too off talk but that yeah that's that's

1964
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,679
how I feel about um yeah these these I

1965
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,079
think there was a big difference back

1966
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:31,600
then and I you know and maybe it wasn't

1967
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:33,920
as potent or maybe we didn't have the

1968
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:38,440
same amount of variety and Spectrum but

1969
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:40,440
we had these really distinct and unique

1970
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:42,279
cultivars that were shaped over long

1971
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:43,599
periods of time with the hands of you

1972
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:46,119
know many I would say many green hands

1973
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,159
like many hands shape these many nights

1974
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:50,800
many days many full moons many rains and

1975
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:52,719
they have like a really they have a

1976
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,520
personality whereas the new hybrids are

1977
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,000
like crazy groovy like hyped up kids

1978
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,679
that kind of can you know especially in

1979
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,399
this day and age with the internet we

1980
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:02,760
have influences from all over the world

1981
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,638
you know you have kids in uh in the

1982
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:09,079
highest towns of like Bolivia making

1983
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:12,239
super dope crazy like electrocumbia or

1984
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:13,600
like mumon or like they have trans baton

1985
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,759
like they have all these new like

1986
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,480
combinations of music because people can

1987
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,320
with their old PC can download these

1988
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:21,839
programs on like you know dark web or

1989
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:25,079
whatever someplace get it for free or

1990
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,319
from a friend or and make a crazy unque

1991
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:29,439
amazing things that that are really true

1992
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:31,279
to their generation and to their because

1993
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,759
we're kind of like you know as a culture

1994
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:36,079
and as a society we're not these like

1995
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,280
sure we you could say oh you're Indian

1996
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:41,198
you're African you're this we're really

1997
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:44,439
like a global you know if you strip down

1998
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:46,319
the melanin you strip down uh you know

1999
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:48,919
body hair whatever else that makes

2000
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,880
people different races or cultures we're

2001
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:54,239
really a like

2002
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,119
Global human and I think in cannabis

2003
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:58,279
it's kind of what we're experiencing now

2004
01:19:56,119 --> 01:20:00,599
and as well as with everything else that

2005
01:19:58,279 --> 01:20:02,439
we can be creative with so to answer the

2006
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,960
question yeah I think it was special and

2007
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:06,559
different and unique and I the good

2008
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,359
thing is now we have this new thing and

2009
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,840
if we're smart and if we really look to

2010
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,439
our elders and we really try not to lose

2011
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,199
these things and also keep these places

2012
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:19,559
that still hold these things clean and

2013
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:21,678
and well um nourished I think we could

2014
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:24,920
have the best of the Both

2015
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:28,520
Worlds The Best of Both Worlds sounds

2016
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:30,880
like exactly what we want really yeahuh

2017
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,960
that's that's brilliant and I I guess as

2018
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,000
as a followup to that you know talking

2019
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,239
about memorable cannabis a really good

2020
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,079
question was what's a plant that has

2021
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:42,959
just really held a spot in your mind

2022
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:44,319
over the years and what was it that made

2023
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,600
it so

2024
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:48,198
memorable let me think I mean I've

2025
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,520
always liked Stevie Wonder mostly just

2026
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:53,119
because it was a snapshot of all of the

2027
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,679
like hypest things of like what is it 20

2028
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:59,279
years ago or something you know was like

2029
01:20:54,679 --> 01:21:02,000
like a it was a sensey star um was a

2030
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:03,679
blueberry Bubba cush Sensei star train

2031
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,198
wreck like it was just the ultimate Mash

2032
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:08,399
was one of my earliest kind of creations

2033
01:21:06,198 --> 01:21:10,359
and it's still like like the only clone

2034
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,158
I hold from when I very first started so

2035
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:15,279
that's cool but some of the old ones we

2036
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:17,000
had one called Kiba which was like a it

2037
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,399
came out of my deep Funk line that used

2038
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,920
a long time ago was called biodiesel

2039
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:23,599
before um it kind of dropped uh before I

2040
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,560
just switched it back to deep Funk and

2041
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,480
it was it was this it was a res Sour

2042
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,679
Diesel IBL deep chunk cross and it had

2043
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:35,079
the most insane F1 Vigor you'd ever seen

2044
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:36,719
a plant it was just insane like I guess

2045
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:38,679
because deep chunk is so in Brad you

2046
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,439
know Rez did a good job of really

2047
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:44,279
pushing those SD lines way down the line

2048
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:47,000
so and it it was the coolest plant it

2049
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:49,599
was just jet black with this beautiful

2050
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,359
milky white tricomes and it was just

2051
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,360
huge and amazing and it just it made

2052
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:57,319
these big cushy nugs and it smelled just

2053
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:59,319
like Cohiba cigars it was like uncanny

2054
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:02,158
and weird and so earthy and it just had

2055
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:04,479
a really kind of like I just felt like

2056
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,920
cha or something smoking it you know it

2057
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:09,119
just really had this vibe to it and we

2058
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,199
you know I think we lost that one maybe

2059
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,158
six years ago I still have some seeds to

2060
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:14,759
kind of go through that was always a

2061
01:22:13,158 --> 01:22:16,519
cool I'm trying to think and like this

2062
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,600
kind of goes back to when asked before

2063
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,120
like what are my favorite strains like I

2064
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,159
was a little dumbstruck when you asked

2065
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:25,238
me because I was like I realized oh my

2066
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:28,839
God I probably have

2067
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:30,959
500 release strains or something and you

2068
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:33,960
know maybe five times that just in the

2069
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,520
fridge unreleased I don't even know and

2070
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,158
I was coming to terms now and I'm like I

2071
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,920
should have said like there's ones that

2072
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:40,638
I really love like I didn't even say

2073
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,000
mother's milk which I think is such an

2074
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:45,800
amazing strain just the turps and just

2075
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,960
the feeling like it's just such a warm

2076
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:50,560
hug like everything's going to be okay

2077
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:52,520
like hi you know Temple was one that I

2078
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,960
just so loved like that was one of my

2079
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:57,800
kind of very first successful kind of

2080
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,639
narrow Leaf style like sativa highs like

2081
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,679
and it was so joyous and laughy and fun

2082
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,319
and it grew so cool and it was like that

2083
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:07,800
perfect Williams Wonder Super Silver

2084
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:09,198
Haze kind of combo um you know when I

2085
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,119
was thinking back all those stashes I

2086
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:14,678
made Boba stash um Lando stash all of

2087
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:18,599
like the Bounty Hunter um series with

2088
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:20,719
all the old La Kush cuts um uh you know

2089
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,480
and the good medicine I love so much

2090
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,600
because that was just I started that

2091
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:27,198
just when they were learning how to test

2092
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,199
CBD and that was when I kind of that was

2093
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:31,000
where I got a little scientific that um

2094
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:32,919
I was really trying to create a CBD

2095
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
breeding mail back when you know that

2096
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:37,399
was I don't even know that was when uh

2097
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,119
SC Labs first open and so I was actually

2098
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:41,319
testing my Mals and I think that was my

2099
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:44,399
kind of my first introduction to science

2100
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:46,039
to make that line um wow and there's

2101
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,319
been so many plants too that just kind

2102
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:50,439
of come up in my garden there's one that

2103
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:52,319
we call graus Madre that still comes up

2104
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:54,439
to this day

2105
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,920
um uh and that's just the volunteer

2106
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:59,039
tears and I had this most amazing last

2107
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,679
time that it happened a few years ago we

2108
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,479
had one called grus mudre and it was

2109
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:05,800
this I think it was like a la A1 or

2110
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:09,399
something but it literally was like

2111
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:11,920
spoton that China Church incense in the

2112
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:14,079
air smell like just classic kind of when

2113
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:18,079
people think of that piffy kind of L

2114
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:20,000
lights Haze and it was I love it and I

2115
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:22,039
lost it I'm hoping still that radio

2116
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,679
Ridge has it but you know they're super

2117
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:26,519
diligent on the Hop PL and so they test

2118
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:28,399
everything and if it even anything's hot

2119
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,239
they instantly smoke it which is good so

2120
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:34,519
hopefully it's still alive and it didn't

2121
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:36,799
reach that fate um I don't know there's

2122
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:39,040
so you know what was one that was really

2123
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,279
cool that I don't really talk about it

2124
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:42,679
was uh this one I made really early on

2125
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:44,920
when I was still selling seeds like on

2126
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:49,639
seed Bay was that we called it the PK

2127
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:52,279
bks SD it was a um Sour Diesel Bubba

2128
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:55,279
Kush cross to Purple Kush it was kind of

2129
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:57,920
this San Francisco Super mesh up and I

2130
01:24:55,279 --> 01:25:01,198
gave that to a friend who moved back to

2131
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,719
Israel before um legalization and it he

2132
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:06,000
started that one of the first companies

2133
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:09,399
there and it became the most um smoked

2134
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,639
grown and U medical cannabis in all of

2135
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:15,039
Israel for a while for like years it was

2136
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:17,679
the number one seller and it was we just

2137
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:21,198
call it PK bksd because it was purple

2138
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,719
kush Bubba Kush Sour Diesel so that kind

2139
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:24,519
of took on that's one of the strains

2140
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,000
that kind of took a life of its own and

2141
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:29,440
who knows what's going on now I'm sure

2142
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,960
they still have it but so those are kind

2143
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:34,439
of some of the ones that that got away

2144
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,920
or that that I really you know that I

2145
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:37,839
have a deep connection to that I kind of

2146
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,639
forget you know and even some I love to

2147
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,279
do like remixes like switch the mothers

2148
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:44,800
and fathers and sometimes the remixes

2149
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:47,840
are better than the releases so there's

2150
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:51,079
been some really cool releases I think

2151
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:53,840
that even some of the Girl Scout cookies

2152
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:55,719
remixes where I use the ogkb instead of

2153
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,279
the know Thin Man or cookies cut those

2154
01:25:55,719 --> 01:25:59,000
came out sometimes way better than the

2155
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:02,639
cookies ones because they were so unique

2156
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:06,238
so that's kind of my take on that

2157
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:09,840
question I love it and uh shout out to

2158
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:11,559
tranquil elephantizer remix I uh oh yeah

2159
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,719
I love that bad boy that was one of the

2160
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:16,320
first trains I grew beautiful stuff oh

2161
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,840
you know what that just reminds me I was

2162
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:19,359
thinking people always ask me like

2163
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,039
what's a good air if I want to start out

2164
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:22,960
on something that's like an heirloom or

2165
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:24,560
a land race or what you know whatever

2166
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,399
you want to call it there's like there's

2167
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,719
a few strains I think if anyone want

2168
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:31,198
just wants to start easy grow you super

2169
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:33,960
unique beautiful really great highs and

2170
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:36,000
just special like you know the Pakistani

2171
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,600
chitrol Kush it's you know I think

2172
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
everybody's pretty much released it like

2173
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,760
Ace and Charlie and CBG and uh what is

2174
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,359
that the other one in Spain like it came

2175
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,719
through Spain they used to have green

2176
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:49,399
fenos too I still have some of those

2177
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:51,000
that's a phenomenal line so easy to grow

2178
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:53,158
it's so beautiful it's a really great

2179
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,319
introduction another one that's made its

2180
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:58,719
way out is that be frog Kashmir aad that

2181
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:01,000
I use in a lot of those probe series you

2182
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:03,118
know the Kashmere it's an amazing plant

2183
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,520
like it's such a cool combination of

2184
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:07,519
like lowland and Highland like coming

2185
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,000
together like you know it has some of

2186
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,080
the traits of that you know kind of like

2187
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,319
Himalayan style it's not in the

2188
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:15,960
Himalayas I think that's a caroom in the

2189
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:18,920
it's in the Pakistani kind of Kashmir uh

2190
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,920
area such amazing like you can tell it's

2191
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:24,880
kind of like it has a little bit of Low

2192
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:27,359
Land kind of that kind of cushy quick

2193
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,719
uh special magical like kind of

2194
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:32,559
harvestable and this kind of high

2195
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:35,198
Himalayan like narrow Leaf Space Age

2196
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,520
like Beauty realm and so anybody ask me

2197
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:38,919
those are two great ones to kind of

2198
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,400
start in on if you want more narrow Leaf

2199
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,639
you know if you want Broad Leaf there's

2200
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:46,839
infinite unique ones to kind of try

2201
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:48,199
these days um but yeah sorry for going

2202
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,600
off on that I just want to throw that in

2203
01:27:48,198 --> 01:27:52,919
there before I forgot I want you to

2204
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,760
throw it in before you forget so it

2205
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,800
works out perfectly did exactly what I

2206
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,440
wanted yeah see we're we're

2207
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,639
telepathically connected through the

2208
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,359
zoom that's exactly it that's exactly it

2209
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,880
I should have asked this earlier but

2210
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:08,439
this one's from a good buddy of mine so

2211
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:10,800
I got to make sure I I do him Justice he

2212
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:14,118
says he's actually uh going to be doing

2213
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:16,480
a trek in Nepal next year and he said

2214
01:28:14,118 --> 01:28:18,158
he'd heard you'd been to the I'm going

2215
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:23,718
to butcher the pronunciation but I'll

2216
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:26,319
try um maniso and the sum Valley is that

2217
01:28:23,719 --> 01:28:29,079
right okay yeah those are areas that's

2218
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:30,759
kind of in between like um langang and

2219
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:32,479
anap Perna like that's a little more

2220
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:34,520
West I've never been in that area so

2221
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:37,118
like that's probably a really cool place

2222
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:39,239
like you know there's places where a lot

2223
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:41,000
of the tracks kind of focus in on and

2224
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:43,718
it's like I think that and you know

2225
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,039
Everest before bank before base camp a

2226
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,920
lot of people fly into base camp they

2227
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:48,560
don't really do the whole Everest track

2228
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,079
like that's really cool and then farther

2229
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,679
west near sakee is I mean sorry farther

2230
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:55,960
east so sake's really cool and then

2231
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:58,118
farther west west um where um kind of

2232
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:00,639
where the uh Communists the maist were

2233
01:28:58,118 --> 01:29:03,039
for a while is a really cool areas but

2234
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,800
yeah that Mano area I I think that's

2235
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:06,719
right that's kind of in between langang

2236
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,480
and and aera I think that would be a

2237
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,079
really killer place to kind of check out

2238
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:11,599
because it's even more off the Beaten

2239
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,719
Track you

2240
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,600
know yeah definitely look it it sounds

2241
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,880
cool I'm jealous and he had a quick

2242
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:22,159
follow-up question which was um are you

2243
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,639
able to elaborate on your LA or napole

2244
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,839
Adventures I know you've done so in the

2245
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:29,159
past so um feel free to just say refer

2246
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:31,159
to that but any specific sort of

2247
01:29:29,158 --> 01:29:34,039
locations in Nepal you think are like a

2248
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:35,599
must for people who go there well I know

2249
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:37,880
there's I mean if people want a little

2250
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,560
Insider tip like if you want to go like

2251
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:42,520
where there's like the super like

2252
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:44,600
wizardy like uh ganja guy that you can

2253
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:46,000
pick up stuff on the trail hopefully the

2254
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:50,159
authorities and npole aren't listening

2255
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,679
to this chitry um which is on the Anapa

2256
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:55,158
circuit if you're going down towards the

2257
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,399
um I believe it's towards the hot

2258
01:29:55,158 --> 01:29:59,638
springs on your left there's a it just

2259
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:01,719
looks like a groovy house maybe ask

2260
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:03,560
people there's a guy that literally has

2261
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:05,560
like the best buds from all over the

2262
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,960
area and kind of knows everything chitri

2263
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,440
is kind of special like I found a lot of

2264
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,840
really cool things just growing out of

2265
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:11,799
the blue like you know some towns you're

2266
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,360
just groovier than others and I think

2267
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,960
it's because this guy kind of had an

2268
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:17,359
influence but there's a dude in chit

2269
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,480
tree that has great stuff I I think the

2270
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:21,039
antier circuit is cool you know it's a

2271
01:30:19,479 --> 01:30:24,079
little bit

2272
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:26,039
uh overrun these days and now I think

2273
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:27,399
theyve ran and now they have a bus line

2274
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:30,079
that goes all the way through which is a

2275
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:31,799
total shame um langang is still a bit

2276
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:34,719
wild it's a little jungly they have

2277
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:37,239
there I think the the Far West might

2278
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,880
have some stuff and you know there's a

2279
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:40,959
lot of commercial areas and you know

2280
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,000
what's really cool is like get down into

2281
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,920
the lowlands too like the terai like Bia

2282
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,319
and then uh chitwan those are like on

2283
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:51,359
the jungly and that's jungly areas that

2284
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:54,639
have the rhinos and the the um you know

2285
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,920
the elephants and all the crazy tall

2286
01:30:54,639 --> 01:31:00,319
grasses they have some really cool

2287
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:03,118
narrow Leaf stuff um that's a really

2288
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:05,238
cool place to look but you know even

2289
01:31:03,118 --> 01:31:06,599
just cat men do meet people try a lot of

2290
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:08,519
different head rubs try a lot of

2291
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,520
different places look for you know the

2292
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:13,760
heads there's you know even I think up

2293
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,679
near doshin Ki which is a famous Kali

2294
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,719
Temple I think there's a lot of really

2295
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,960
kind of tucked back ganja growing back

2296
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:21,480
in there but you sometimes you'll meet

2297
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:23,039
cool people that are just kind of exp

2298
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:24,559
Patriots or people that live in Nepal

2299
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:27,319
and really pick their brain take him out

2300
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,880
for some tea or just take him out for a

2301
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:31,679
Sizzler they call him like it's this

2302
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:34,400
kind of like a it's like Nepali fajitas

2303
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:36,000
you know make friends and like really

2304
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:37,799
check out where these places are coming

2305
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,520
from you know what if you're on the

2306
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,639
trail I'm not saying child labor is cool

2307
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,920
but these are ancient cultures like kids

2308
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:47,000
are usually rub just to make extra money

2309
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,960
kids are rubbing up a storm up and just

2310
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,118
hitting the trail like so many times I'd

2311
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,198
be walking along and this little kid

2312
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:53,960
would kind of roll up and like hey and I

2313
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:55,439
I knew I'm like okay this kid just rubb

2314
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,158
some hash she wants to sell it to me to

2315
01:31:55,439 --> 01:32:00,559
get some candy or something so sometimes

2316
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:03,238
you'll get a really good kid hand rub I

2317
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:05,719
mean it's just out there I mean Nepal's

2318
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:07,198
a great direct from The Source yeah it's

2319
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:08,679
so friendly it's so and you could go

2320
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:12,279
with your family I

2321
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:15,000
mean yeah I would say that you know Sim

2322
01:32:12,279 --> 01:32:16,399
is another kind of like it's in India

2323
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,600
but it's right near Nepal it's a little

2324
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:20,079
less uh off you know it's more off the

2325
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,679
Beaten Track I think they have a lot of

2326
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:24,479
really cool stuff and then you know

2327
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:26,639
that's a great great area the Himalayas

2328
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:28,359
are just so amazing so yeah just get out

2329
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,880
there talk to people find some cool

2330
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:33,158
spots but if you see the guy in chitry

2331
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,800
that looks a little bit Stony you give

2332
01:32:33,158 --> 01:32:38,439
him you know talk to

2333
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,920
him that's amazing everyone needs to

2334
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:44,238
stash that away in a part of their brain

2335
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:47,118
and and use it I uh I was thinking about

2336
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:49,638
it all of like the top five most

2337
01:32:47,118 --> 01:32:52,158
psychedelic plants I've ever tried were

2338
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:53,920
from you with you I want to know what's

2339
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:55,559
the most psychedelic plant you've ever

2340
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,600
ever had or at least in your memory that

2341
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,639
jumps to

2342
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:01,400
mind yeah I don't I mean it has to be

2343
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:04,960
kind of like point of origin I I I don't

2344
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:07,000
know what when I was in Waka when we

2345
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,800
were up in the mountains with the Saina

2346
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,158
family and working up there and with the

2347
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:17,079
c cmir the other big mushroom family

2348
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:18,599
there was this guy who went who uh kind

2349
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:20,639
of was a heron addict and he moved to

2350
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,480
Mexico to kind of get away from it and

2351
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:24,118
he became I don't know if I told a story

2352
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,519
before but he became like he was a

2353
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:27,238
beekeeper he came down and they didn't

2354
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,600
really have the whole beekeeping Vibe

2355
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:29,718
going up in those mountains they didn't

2356
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,280
really know about it and he kind of

2357
01:33:29,719 --> 01:33:33,679
became this teacher of the bee and he

2358
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:35,880
would follow all around and he would

2359
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,399
teach beeping and it really turned

2360
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:40,520
people a lot of these tribal people

2361
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:42,879
there maitech um onto beekeeping so

2362
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:45,080
everyone loved him and he used to have

2363
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,039
like this he had the best stash ever and

2364
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:50,000
I got to try some of his Hawk and gold

2365
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,198
and that stuff it was like i' never

2366
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,880
experienced anything like that was

2367
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:56,399
probably one of the most psychedelic

2368
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:58,600
kind of like true psychedelic it was a

2369
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:00,559
really good W Hawking you know I've

2370
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,960
never been to Colombia I've only been

2371
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,639
Peru and Biv Stu I've never got to try

2372
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,719
like real Santa Marta I mean I've tried

2373
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:09,520
Colombians here and and I've tried

2374
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:10,760
hybrids and they're it's such an amazing

2375
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,600
you can really tell the difference in

2376
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,280
the

2377
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:17,960
effect um and you know I'm trying to

2378
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:21,238
think where else oh my God yes long time

2379
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:22,679
ago I was on kopang Gan you know place

2380
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:23,959
where they have the big full moon

2381
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:25,639
parties and I was staying in the old

2382
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,399
osou Comming that they turned into

2383
01:34:25,639 --> 01:34:30,880
Bungalows and I befriended a guy and I

2384
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,719
got he got me a bud I think that was

2385
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:35,480
though that was probably 25 years ago

2386
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:37,198
this most this butt I didn't even know

2387
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:39,238
what I thought it was like a it was like

2388
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:41,319
a piece of lint that got stuck in

2389
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:43,319
marshmallows or something it was this it

2390
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:45,559
like stuck to the bag I like had to peel

2391
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:48,519
the bag off it was like in some like

2392
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:50,600
plastic wrap it was the most insanely

2393
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:54,360
sticky thing I ever got and I smoked

2394
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:56,199
that and I remember going out under the

2395
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:58,599
moon in front of my Bungalow and just

2396
01:34:56,198 --> 01:35:02,319
floating in the water and just having

2397
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:04,520
the most like epic just like you know

2398
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,960
when you sometimes you smoke and it's it

2399
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:08,360
was almost like a deprivation chamber

2400
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,198
with the moon above me it like I got to

2401
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:12,599
download you know when you just it's

2402
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:14,039
like oh it's something in creation or

2403
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,480
sometime in your life where the source

2404
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:17,439

2415
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,359
was like where I was like oh cool I know

2424
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:58,238
relate in their own way you know as you

2425
01:35:56,198 --> 01:36:00,719
saying that I was sort of thinking to

2426
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:04,079
myself of a similar different but

2427
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:06,198
similar um I love it I love it one of

2428
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:10,000
the things I wanted us to do before we

2429
01:36:06,198 --> 01:36:12,678

this is great this is great you asked me

2433
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,960
because I yeah same time I was a little

2434
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,440
bit like I got a little bit stumped

2435
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,118
because you know when my my mind I don't

2436
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:27,719
know if I'm on the Spectrum or what but

2437
01:36:26,118 --> 01:36:30,000
when someone asks me something my mind

2438
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:32,880
goes like into every

2439
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,039
imaginable like scenario and it doesn't

2440
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,719
always have the best it's like it shoots

2441
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,519
my Consciousness into every possible

2442
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,359
thing not but that doesn't mean my

2443
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,000
Consciousness has enough really to grasp

2444
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:44,559
it back it's just like this thing where

2445
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,840
I kind of go in and and and it and I

2446
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,119
kind of get into everything and then I

2447
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,920
try and bring it back so I got a little

2448
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:52,279
bit uh bam like uh what do they got B

2449
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,840
dazzled so I kind of this time I'm going

2450
01:36:52,279 --> 01:36:55,359
to be like I kind of I'm going to go

2451
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,000
back what I kind of feel like are some

2452
01:36:55,359 --> 01:37:00,519

2564
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:11,000
we didn't know what we were doing we

2565
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,760
just drinking it right down because you

2566
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,399
know we were told you it's a very

2567
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:18,159
feminine and beautiful plant who didn't

2568
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:21,598
like fire it was a very ancient

2569
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:23,839
magical uh moisture feminine being that

2570
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:25,360
it really when people smoke it it kind

2571
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,159
of turns on them

2572
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:30,519
so you know we never knew that so I went

2573
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:33,279
through my whole first Salvia phas not

2574
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:35,560
even really understanding how to utilize

2575
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:38,960
it so back then same with records you

2576
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:40,840
know before cdjs and laptops we had to

2577
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,880
find these records and they were like

2578
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:45,079
magical spells and they would get beat

2579
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,840
up and we couldn't just redownload them

2580
01:41:45,079 --> 01:41:48,479
or we couldn't go to Spotify like it was

2581
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:50,039
such a treasure hunt back then and I

2582
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:52,718
kind of miss that these days and that's

2583
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:55,319
what was so I think what made me so

2584
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,399
stoked on on seed hunting it's so analog

2585
01:41:55,319 --> 01:42:00,479
like getting these seeds like no you

2586
01:41:57,399 --> 01:42:02,960
know I was like sure as I as a DJ

2587
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:05,839
everything turned to memory sticks and

2588
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,118
first it was CJs then memory sticks I

2589
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,960
even thought a long time ago record

2590
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:11,559
compilations were kind of cheating and

2591
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:13,679
now it's all just pretty much

2592
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,679
computerized like it with seeds you're

2593
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:17,639
never it's never I mean maybe someday

2594
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:19,560
it'll be computerized with these new

2595
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:21,719
embryo seeds and all this but really

2596
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:25,599
it's one of the most epic treasure

2597
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:28,359
hunting tweak out trading card like

2598
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:31,319
natural like I can imagine you know

2599
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:33,519
100,000 years ago like full on Chaka

2600
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:35,238
from Land of the Lost like hooking up

2601
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,080
and trading seeds with his buddies a

2602
01:42:35,238 --> 01:42:39,559
couple valleys over like it's ancient

2603
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:42,158
and it's so cool um like you know what I

2604
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:44,360
mean it's like seeds are I know it's

2605
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,839
kind of a pivot but I love to treasure

2606
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:49,799
on and I think seeds are an amazing way

2607
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:53,480
to make friends and trade and dork out

2608
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,679
and have a hobby so

2609
01:42:53,479 --> 01:42:56,439
sorry that's a long one but that's what

2610
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:58,880
I

2611
01:42:56,439 --> 01:43:01,439
mean I couldn't agree more with

just about brings us to the end of it

2646
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:24,079
for this one as always I wanted to ask

2647
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:28,079
anything we've left out

2648
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:31,238
I don't think I mean no I mean I think I

2649
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:34,039
I always want to revise my my if I had a

2650
01:44:31,238 --> 01:44:36,718
time machine like where would I go well

2651
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:39,158
why don't we do it let's say I've got a

2652
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:42,118
time machine for you you can go anywhere

2653
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:44,559
any place anytime presumably to collect

2654
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:47,479
some seeds where you going to go what

2655
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:48,800
are you going to get okay I I I really

2656
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:50,198
thought about this and I think I got

2657
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,000
really stoned I was like where the hell

2658
01:44:50,198 --> 01:44:53,319
do I want to go like like if I had a

2659
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,639
time machine because you know what

2660
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:57,479
cannabis is a time machine especially if

2661
01:44:55,639 --> 01:44:59,440
you know where you want to go if you

2662
01:44:57,479 --> 01:45:02,079
want to go Afghanistan get yourself a

2663
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:05,439
heirloom Afghani get super bit and just

2664
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:07,118
get into it so um I was thinking about

2665
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:09,279
it before you know I did the usual Silk

2666
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:14,198
Road kind of Heyday what you know

2667
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:17,679
whatever 7 1600 1700 I was thinking I

2668
01:45:14,198 --> 01:45:20,319
would like to go back to the whole kind

2669
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:23,560
of Eurasia area especially the

2670
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:27,238
Mediterranean about 400 BC like around

2671
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:30,239
kind of around like Plato era and I

2672
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:32,598
would like to be like this super Elite

2673
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:34,158
uh sax Slinger for all of the

2674
01:45:32,599 --> 01:45:36,360
Mediterranean all those islands all

2675
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:38,399
those like really cool places and like

2676
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:40,559
have a little Entourage and collect and

2677
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,879
we all grew like the most crazy stuff

2678
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,360
are picked it up in our traps from the

2679
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,760
seeds that you know from the seeds that

2680
01:45:44,359 --> 01:45:48,920
we got all over we traded with like you

2681
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:51,560
know the Mongolian Empire and we went to

2682
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,639
Egypt and we hooked them up like we were

2683
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:55,520
Travelers and Seed collectors as young

2684
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:56,679
ones and As We Grew Older we had all

2685
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,040
these lines and we grew them in little

2686
01:45:56,679 --> 01:46:00,719
farms and then we just rolled through

2687
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:02,639
like we took like a maybe like six

2688
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,439
months eight months we started kind of

2689
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:08,719
maybe in turkey or maybe like even like

2690
01:46:06,439 --> 01:46:10,678
Paris or something I I don't Paris

2691
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,560
didn't exist so actually that was kind

2692
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:14,079
of I think that was back in the Mythic

2693
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,400
age or with Mythos and all these

2694
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,559
different so okay let's start in the

2695
01:46:15,399 --> 01:46:21,000
Mediterranean we would start our role in

2696
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,520
the Mediterranean and all the menow and

2697
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,319
all this Creed and all those places and

2698
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:27,800
roll all all the way through to Egypt

2699
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:29,679
and then into Asia just like with the

2700
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:32,960
just a whole crew with just the most

2701
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:34,920
epic plant like just Buds and hash and

2702
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,480
all the kings and queens and everybody

2703
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,480
would always invite us into their courts

2704
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:41,959
and offer the you know finest foods and

2705
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:43,839
cortison and entertainment and it would

2706
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,319
be like the Highlight for every main

2707
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:49,239
city like when we rolled through you

2708
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:53,158
know like our Squad so like there would

2709
01:46:49,238 --> 01:46:55,238
be like songs sang and and you know all

2710
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:57,719
these and people would write these books

2711
01:46:55,238 --> 01:47:00,000
and Praises that yes the squad comes

2712
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:02,599
through and brings the most epic

2713
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,039
mindboggling seeds and strains and

2714
01:47:02,599 --> 01:47:06,679
concentrates and and just a good time we

2715
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:07,840
would have like I think and eventually

2716
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:10,079
it would be kind of like a traveling

2717
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,639
Road Show I think we would get like bars

2718
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:13,399
and musicians from all the places like

2719
01:47:11,639 --> 01:47:15,880
the best musicians from all the

2720
01:47:13,399 --> 01:47:18,960
different cultures we went to and form

2721
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:20,679
