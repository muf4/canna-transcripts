40

welcome to a man who simply needs no

41

introduction a friend of mine and the

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,680
author of what many consider to be the

43
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,199
organic gardener's bible and the man who

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
reminded the world the importance of

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,759
mycorrhizal fungi jeff lowenfels thank

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,359
you so much for joining us today well

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
thank you thank you i guess you know i

48
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,438
got my brand new hat on here you know

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
maybe i could take it off so people i'm

50
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,519
really kind of bald

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
whatever uh anyway yeah hey thanks for

52
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,239
having me uh what fun uh you know this

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
is an amazing technology we have we can

54
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,319
meet from all over the world and you

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,519
know that's just an amazing thing but it

56
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,839
makes sense when you think about it

57
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,920
because microbes are ubiquitous too

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
they're all over the world so i can talk

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
about

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,479
alaskan microbes you can talk about uh

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,360
australian microbes basically we're

62
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,000
talking about the same thing which is

63
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,840
amazing

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
i love it i love it the connections are

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
there far and wide so the first question

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
we like to ask our guests what have you

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,479
been smoking on recently

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,120
well let's see uh a little citrus sap

69
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,079
someone someone gave me uh

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,599
just a just a couple of days ago uh you

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
know when you go around give advice to

72
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,119
people about what to grow and how to

73
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,400
grow things and whatnot sometimes they

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
they give you a little gift here and

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,719
there which is kind of fun uh

76
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,318
but i i really i've really

77
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,280
been smoking

78
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,359
i don't really smoke i vaporize

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,000
flour i have haven't really had a

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
combustion situation with a joint in

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,239
about four or five years because i i

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,000
find it to be much more enjoyable i

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,759
think it's probably a lot healthier if

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
you don't carbonize

85
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,439
the flour but in any case i've been

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,920
doing this you know now that my parents

87
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:11,120
are gone i can say it uh

88
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,878
a long long long time and it's finally

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,158
gotten to the point where

90
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:19,039
the stigma is gone where the

91
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,679
quality has improved where we're not you

92
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,120
know smoking or vaporizing sticks and

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,360
sticks and seeds uh and of course the

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,439
effort to legalize all around the world

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
has just been absolutely phenomenal as

96
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,639
you know so uh it's a it's a new world

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,158
we're living in um i think there there

98
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,119
are a couple of rules we all need to

99
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,798
follow and uh uh some of them we are and

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,439
some of them we aren't and i think i

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,040
think we'll get there but uh uh we we've

102
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,400
got to prevent

103
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:52,079
governments from looking at cannabis

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,158
as the gateway to taxation that it has

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
become in the united states

106
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,719
and

107
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,399
start treating this plant more like a

108
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,158
tomato plant

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
than something else

110
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,079
this is this is a plant that's easy to

111
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,798
grow that everybody can grow

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,560
let's not treat this thing like it's uh

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,719
a fourth branch of government for

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,719
goodness sakes you know it's crazy yeah

115
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,399
yeah okay i'm off my stool

116
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
no i love it and i've definitely got

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
some stuff up that alley i want to jump

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
into but let's just quickly rewind for a

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
minute what was your first experience

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,280
with cannabis

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,879
well i was uh

122
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:31,758
actually uh in college in cambridge uh

123
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,879
massachusetts and uh my brother came

124
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,600
over to me

125
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,639
uh freshman year he was a law student

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
about to graduate and his girlfriend he

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,000
said had just tried to commit suicide

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,560
and he made me promise i would never

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,839
ever smoke cannabis of course we called

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,000
it marijuana back then uh and so i i

131
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,319
went a year while he was off in europe

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
getting a fulbright scholarship and when

133
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,478
he came back i was helping him unpack

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,478
and the first thing out of his suitcase

135
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:05,279
was a gigantic beautiful inlaid

136
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,279
hash pipe that he picked up in morocco

137
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,599
and i said what's this

138
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,918
he said oh oh wait you could buy a can

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
of hash for five dollars in morocco and

140
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,159
i went what

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
you made me not smoke can i have

142
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
marijuana for a year

143
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,799
that was that was it so i went back to

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,439
college uh one of one of my great

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,079
friends uh we just we just got stoned

146
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,000
and i haven't looked back since

147
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,839
fantastic so

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
when let's fast forward a little bit

149
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,038
when was it that you grew your first

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
plant

151
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,360
well let's see i probably first got

152
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,360
stoned about 1967

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,918
68 probably about 1975 i was in law

154
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,240
school at the time

155
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,839
and one of my law professors had a bunch

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,759
of plants that had

157
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,038
uh mealybugs on them

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,720
and uh

159
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,399
she knew i was a gardener she said can

160
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
you do anything with them i said i don't

161
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,359
know about you you know give them to me

162
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,960
and i'll try

163
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
and i did

164
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,638
so the alcohol took care of both me and

165
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,159
the mealybugs on the plants and we we

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,918
did just fine

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
fantastic so

168
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,879
what was it ultimately that kind of

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
stimulated you to write teeming with

170
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,199
microbes

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,360
well i've always been a gardener and uh

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,919
i've been uh in fact

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,000
they tell me i am the longest

174
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,519
running garden columnist in the world

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,959
i've been writing a garden column in

176
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,439
anchorage alaska

177
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,439
since 1977

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,960
every single week i never miss a single

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,319
week because they put your picture in

180
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,599
the paper and they say he's not there

181
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
he'll be back in a couple of weeks and

182
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,479
to me that always said rob his house so

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,680
i always have a column and um

184
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,800
i

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
you know i

186
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,960
wasn't writing for cannabis i was

187
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,918
writing for people in anchorage alaska a

188
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,918
place

189
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,879
not unlike for example i would imagine

190
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,439
perth

191
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,199
where most of the people are new

192
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,439
they've never gardened there they don't

193
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,879
know what can grow there the climate is

194
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,879
different there and so i was sort of the

195
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,879
the the advisors to here's what you can

196
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,399
grow and once a week i wrote a column

197
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,680
and

198
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,519
every now and then i would write a

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
column about tomatoes and tell people

200
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,758
that you know wink wink this is about

201
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,638
tomatoes but it might be about cannabis

202
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,319
as well but i was a chemical head i was

203
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,360
a chemical head for sure

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
uh

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,360
my family had a intricate relationship

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,280
with the founder of miracle grow

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,319
he used to work for my father and my

208
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,119
grandfather and so we we were always big

209
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
into the miracle grow and it wasn't

210
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
until

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,400
oh probably about 1990

212
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,038
uh one of my friends sent me a a picture

213
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,799
of a nematode being strangled by

214
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,399
uh uh a fungal hyphy that was trying to

215
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,759
protect the root it's in the first book

216
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,239
team with microbes and i saw that

217
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,240
and i said oh oh

218
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,519
and i figured out

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,519
that maybe being organic meant something

220
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,680
and maybe these microbes which we were

221
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,478
always trying to get rid of

222
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,199
made a lot of sense and so

223
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,680
i

224
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,960
ended up finding dr elaine ingham

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,079
who is the guru of all things soil food

226
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,598
web as far as i'm concerned and became

227
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,639
quite the disciple let's just put it

228
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,719
that way

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,439
and it's impacted my life ever since

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,158
it's really been quite something

231
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,599
so just to clarify when you were growing

232
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,679
your first plants were you using

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
something like miracle grow or was it in

234
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,199
absolutely

235
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,599
oh sure yeah i was using miracle grow up

236
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
until uh up until i wrote the book

237
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
basically i mean the book came out in

238
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,159
2006. i really started writing the book

239
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,039
in about 19

240
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,519
oh

241
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,439
1998 or so i had to write it a couple of

242
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,600
times because the first time i wrote it

243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,240
i wrote it as a comic book and the

244
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,639
publisher looked at it and said you know

245
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
this may make sense but we don't dumb

246
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,879
books down we we make them smarter so if

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,240
you rewrite this book in more scientific

248
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,320
terms will publish it so they did

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,919
i did and they did and anyway so it

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,240
wasn't it wasn't until about 1998 or 99

251
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,679
that i realized that the miracle grow

252
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,000
system the system of using chemicals was

253
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,519
not the right way to grow plants it

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,720
didn't matter whether it was cannabis a

255
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,639
tomato whether it was a flower vegetable

256
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,360
using using chemicals does not make

257
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,600
sense and of course this was long before

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,600
you know we had greta and other people

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,278
telling us yeah it doesn't make sense

260
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
for other reasons on top of what you

261
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
think so

262
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,320
yeah it was quite something and it was

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,759
quite a turnaround

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,480
i had to

265
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,278
basically admit to my readers that i had

266
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,519
been giving them bad advice for 25 years

267
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,679
and i remember the newspaper ran a

268
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,679
series of ads i wish you could find in

269
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,039
the newspaper boxes and just had my back

270
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,879
my back

271
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,519
and it said you know in two weeks jeff

272
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,000
lonfels is going to turn his back on 25

273
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,919
years of advice and i did thinking that

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,799
all of my readers would abandon me

275
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,838
immediately what i discovered was

276
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,719
there's an incredible thirst for

277
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,279
organics that people

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
want to be organic they don't want to

279
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,799
use chemicals

280
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,040
and it's only because they get forced

281
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,519
into it that they end up i think

282
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,838
succumbing to what we call a new way of

283
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,240
gardening which is actually uh you know

284
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,720
a destructive terrible terrible way of

285
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
growing ruining soil and ruining the

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
life in the soil so

287
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
long long long answer for for a quick

288
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,320
quick question

289
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,838
no they're our favorite type of answers

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
so i've got to ask you you know a

291
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
favorite kind of topic amongst all

292
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,720
organic growers do you remember your

293
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,159
first organic harvest

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,920
um

295
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,278
yes i do because the taste was

296
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,919
completely different

297
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,078
i can taste those chemicals right you

298
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,078
know maybe it's my head maybe not but

299
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,919
but the taste is different and of course

300
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,559
now we know that it's not just you're

301
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,559
not just doing this for the

302
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,838
for the plant you're doing this for the

303
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,919
worker

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
if that may be yourself

305
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,759
and you're doing it for the environment

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,079
as well so it's become become much more

307
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,919
important than just simply growing a

308
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:25,359
plant that tasted

309
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,360
clean and pure and that you knew did not

310
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
contain any of these things that

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,600
probably are not that good for you so

312
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
um yeah i remember and and

313
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,240
i i think that most people do and i

314
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,879
think when most people go into a

315
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,440
supermarket if the price was the same on

316
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:46,879
food they would buy the organic over the

317
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,959
non-organic period

318
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,399
the organization that i belong to of

319
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,000
garden writers

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,200
it's a big national us organization

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,559
i'm sure there's a counterpart in

322
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,079
australia and there is not one of us not

323
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,838
one of us

324
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,039
that isn't organic

325
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,360
nobody

326
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,480
willingly writes an article or does a

327
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,360
television show or a podcast that says

328
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
hey

329
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,800
here's what you need to do go out to

330
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:18,159
your nearest hardware store and find

331
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:20,958
that smelly section and buy that crappy

332
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,679
crap it's chemical and mix it in you

333
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,359
know now the nearest we get to that from

334
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,838
my perspective and you're going to get a

335
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
lot of mail over this one is hydroponics

336
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,639
you know i mean i don't think

337
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,079
hydroponics is the same thing as soil

338
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
either

339
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,799
it's certainly a lot better than

340
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,638
uh

341
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,319
the pesticide herbicide chemical

342
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,680
situation but i i like the idea of good

343
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,560
living soil period

344
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,039
100 i can get down with that so

345
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,638
what was the initial response from the

346
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,240
cannabis community in regards to the

347
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
book did it take off or did it take a

348
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,879
little bit of time before the wheels

349
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
started to turn

350
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,879
well i wasn't really paying attention uh

351
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,959
when the book came out

352
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,679
uh i was

353
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,679
inundated with or and it was

354
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,638
frankly the subject matter not the

355
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,439
writing but the book got great reviews

356
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,919
uh you know uh most important book

357
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,639
written in the past 25 years and maybe

358
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,559
ever hold it you know i mean like

359
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,440
you know

360
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,159
really uh you know i mean and and you

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
know

362
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,639
horticulture all these magazines and

363
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,919
things picked it up and uh big and it

364
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,200
became quite the topic for uh what i

365
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:36,000
call uh the garden club circuit and i

366
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,399
run around the country in canada and i

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,839
gave lectures on how to use microbes to

368
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,720
grow your vegetables and everything else

369
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,199
and i wasn't paying attention to the

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,440
cannabis market frankly

371
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:52,399
because it was underground uh and and it

372
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,760
wasn't as organized as it has become

373
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:59,278
uh it became evident oh

374
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:02,399
probably around 2010

375
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,879
2012 when colorado started to legalize

376
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,879
uh here in the united states

377
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,039
it became evident that this book was

378
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,799
being read by people who grow cannabis

379
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,639
as well

380
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,198
one time i was sitting on an airplane

381
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,399
going to a conference and somebody came

382
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,719
up to me and said

383
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,519
hey i read your book grows the best weed

384
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,440
ever

385
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,198
and i was floored first of all that the

386
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,920
person recognized me

387
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,439
second that the person read the book but

388
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,639
third that you know they were using it

389
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,040
to grow cannabis and now of course uh i

390
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,079
think my publisher has come to realize

391
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:39,519
uh that the cannabis market is quite

392
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,319
large and they read a lot of books in

393
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,078
the cannabis world so um

394
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
it's become a bible and then and then

395
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,479
the other two books that that go with it

396
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,399
it's a tr i call it a trilogy series

397
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
teaming with microbes was the first one

398
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,600
and i really wrote it for dr elaine

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,679
ingham i didn't write it for myself or

400
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
anything else i mean she asked me you

401
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,799
know what could i do to help her and i

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,879
said i could write you a book and so i

403
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,399
wrote the book

404
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,240
teaming with nutrients i wrote for

405
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,919
myself because i was sitting in a

406
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,600
restaurant with my wife

407
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,919
i was looking at a picture of a bunch of

408
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
women eating spaghetti and i said to

409
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,039
myself you know you're you may be

410
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,839
america's longest-running garden

411
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,360
columnist but you don't have any idea

412
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,279
how plants eat

413
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
you know how plants get their food

414
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,838
because that's what that first book told

415
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,599
you

416
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,160
that's how plants get the food but how

417
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,199
do they take it in and what do they do

418
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,399
with it once it gets into their cells

419
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,639
well

420
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,278
that was teeming with nutrients and it

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,639
was to me

422
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,639
sort of a metaphysical

423
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,639
trippy holy crow i mean the numbers of

424
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,278
cells in a single plant

425
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,600
what happens in each individual cell the

426
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:55,679
number there are 10 000 individual

427
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,040
kinds of enzymes in each individual cell

428
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,479
in a plant

429
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:03,360
there are 10 000 of each one maybe i

430
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,440
mean there are gazillions of i mean

431
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
you know and so all of a sudden not only

432
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,079
did i understand how a plant starts to

433
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,240
work and how it gets put to you know

434
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,159
how it works how it eats how it takes

435
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,198
the food in but then i started to

436
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,000
realize wait a minute enzymes

437
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,758
enzymes are proteins

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,919
you know

439
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,240
you know maybe we need this and that

440
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,958
maybe the terpenes are and all of a

441
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,839
sudden you can start to think

442
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,239
like a cannabis plant uh or any other

443
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,160
kind of plant and you know how to take

444
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,919
care of it better when you realize that

445
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:42,719
these enzymes that i just talked about

446
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,479
work best at 74 to 76 degrees oh

447
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
oh okay well maybe now i know what the

448
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,839
right temperature is to grow everything

449
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,239
not just cannabis but uh so yeah it was

450
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,279
a fascinating ride and then and then

451
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,000
after that i was asked to

452
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,720
revise teaming with microbes because

453
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
mycorrhizal fungi were coming onto the

454
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,798
scene when i wrote him with microbes

455
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,558
there were a paragraph on them i mean we

456
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,480
couldn't grow them they couldn't be

457
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,318
duplicated people thought they were

458
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
ubiquitous you know if you've got them

459
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,558
in australia i got them in alaska

460
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,439
so uh

461
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,918
but but that turned out not to be true

462
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,839
and so i revised teaming with microbes

463
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,520
while i was doing that it became very

464
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,918
evident to me that over the next four or

465
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,558
five years there was research going on

466
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,880
that was going to result in a need for a

467
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,639
special book on

468
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,440
just these particular

469
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,840
fungi uh in general and so that that was

470
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
teaming with micros it's not just about

471
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,079
uh um

472
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
uh

473
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,558
mycorrhizal fungi it's about

474
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,679
fungi in general but oh my goodness

475
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,359
gracious when you take a look for

476
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,840
example at the far fires in australia if

477
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,079
those mycorrhizal fungi live you're

478
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,319
going to get trees coming back if they

479
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,558
don't live forget it

480
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,240
those trees are not coming back you're

481
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,879
going to have prairie land well that's

482
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,319
kind of an amazing thing and now we're

483
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
able to grow them we're able to

484
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,439
duplicate them and we're able to use

485
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,200
them in growing specific plants and so

486
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,600
we know which one

487
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,440
is the one that feeds cannabis

488
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,079
and if you use it

489
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,480
your cannabis plant is like no other

490
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,558
cannabis plant you've ever seen so yeah

491
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
so that's the trilogy they're a lot of

492
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,119
fun but they all start with the microbes

493
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,639
yeah what a really comprehensive

494
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,879
overview of them all so i guess the

495
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,759
obvious kind of follow-up question is

496
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,919
your more recent book diy autoflowering

497
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,839
cannabis what was it that stimulated to

498
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,720
do this one

499
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,399
well

500
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,480
you know it's a good question i

501
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
i was influenced by the in on the first

502
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,599
book by a friend of mine tom alexander

503
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:54,319
um he was a very early cannabis grower

504
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,839
during the illegal days uh he helped

505
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,839
coin the term

506
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
sansamiya

507
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
back in the day and

508
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,798
he's the guy that that sent me the

509
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,678
picture of the of the

510
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:12,000
nematode being strangled by the fungus

511
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,120
he and i are very very good friends uh

512
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,679
one day i was at his place in california

513
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,079
and he showed me these these tomato

514
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,080
sized cannabis plants and he said these

515
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,399
are called autoflowering cannabis plants

516
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,000
and they're really kind of cool uh you

517
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,559
know look at these cute little flowers

518
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,440
blah blah blah this was 10 years ago

519
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,319
so

520
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
i

521
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,599
decided to try to grow them and and they

522
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,720
were fun uh nothing spectacular

523
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:41,599
but i live in anchorage alaska and in

524
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,038
anchorage alaska you don't get

525
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,359
days that are shorter than nights until

526
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,640
september 21st

527
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,240
that's about the day of your first frost

528
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
so you're not going to get flowering

529
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,200
cannabis in anchorage alaska unless you

530
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,038
have a light deprivation situation etc

531
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,400
etc but these autoflowers don't have a

532
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,480
photo period they go from seed to flower

533
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,159
based on genetics

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,880
so you end up with a flowering plant

535
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,919
that's harvested after seven to nine

536
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,440
weeks

537
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,960
so i'm thinking again i'm thinking like

538
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,400
australia now in australia in the

539
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,759
capital territory

540
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,080
i guess it's now legal to grow cannabis

541
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,919
if people aren't growing auto flowering

542
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,480
cannabis there they're making the

543
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,880
biggest mistake australians have ever

544
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,360
made they're making the biggest mistakes

545
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,320
since bringing in the toads is that i

546
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,319
don't know if that's i can say that um

547
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,839
because these things grow

548
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,200
from seven to nine weeks to harvest seed

549
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,038
to harvest

550
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,400
that that means you're limited to six

551
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,279
plants well they think they think you're

552
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,159
going to get one or two harvests a year

553
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,839
they don't realize with your autoflowers

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,720
you're going to get

555
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,918
you know so many more but it turns out

556
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,679
that these plants are now better than

557
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,080
indica and sativa and once that happened

558
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,159
i decided it was time to put my

559
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,798
reputation on the line

560
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,159
and and sort of help the autoflower

561
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,079
industry get going uh because

562
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,799
they are so much better than regular

563
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,759
indica sativas with which they're bred

564
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,240
um

565
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,640
so let me list let me list the things i

566
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,159
like about them and and i i should

567
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,038
preface this by saying the book is

568
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,400
called

569
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:36,640
diy autoflowering cannabis

570
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,960
it is not a book for the professional

571
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
grower this is a book for the

572
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,960
professional grower's mother

573
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,880
or brother or aunt or uncle uh it goes

574
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,360
from soup to nuts on cannabis but it

575
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,039
centers around this idea that

576
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,719
we now have a plant that doesn't have an

577
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,440
oral period

578
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,038
that goes from seed to flower based on

579
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,720
genetics that's easy to grow in fact if

580
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,839
you fertilize them

581
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,558
in good soil they won't do well because

582
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:15,119
their soil is too rich

583
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:17,038
they uh are small tomato sized plants

584
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,319
and yet today

585
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,879
not true

586
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,399
four years ago but today

587
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,559
the yield on them per acre is

588
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,960
better than the yield in sativa uh uh

589
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:35,759
indica uh yields unbelievable so um i'm

590
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,600
predicting right here on your show that

591
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,919
in the next five years

592
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,279
nobody will be growing except

593
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,120
occasionally

594
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,678
the bigger plants everybody will be

595
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,000
growing auto flowering cannabis and i

596
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,360
wanted the world to know about it

597
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,119
i believe this is a plant you're going

598
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,519
to be able to get at your local nursery

599
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,879
every spring i believe this is a plant

600
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,119
you're going to be able to buy seeds

601
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,360
from the seed rack you grow it at home

602
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,158
in a five gallon bucket

603
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,719
you reuse the soil you don't have to

604
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,960
spray it with anything it grows so fast

605
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,600
that it grows through cycles where it

606
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,000
would have problems so you know if

607
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,319
there's a bug that wants that plant by

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the time the bug gets settled in the

609
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,000
plant's already grown through the next

610
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,038
stage oh my goodness gracious they

611
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,359
flower after two weeks

612
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,079
so you know this is a terrific terrific

613
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,519
new plant i felt it needed a book this

614
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,639
is again

615
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,359
not a book for the professional and

616
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,600
it's not what i call a cannabis porn

617
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,558
book

618
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,759
we have so many cannabis porn books you

619
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:44,879
know beautiful buds and beautiful colors

620
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,679
and sizes and you know but

621
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,400
but you know this is a how-to for your

622
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,960
mother and if it's legal where she's

623
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,038
growing you should buy her this book get

624
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,360
it on amazon just like the other ones

625
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,919
and and get her some seeds and get her

626
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,918
into this plant because it's a fun fun

627
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,278
plant to grow autoflowers uh you know

628
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,080
it's fun to grow a

629
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,640
sativa in indica it's a hundred times

630
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,960
more fun to grow an autoflower they grow

631
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,200
right before your eyes unbelievable

632
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,200
indoors and outdoors

633
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,440
yeah that's amazing you basically

634
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,440
answered the most of the next question i

635
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,159
was going to ask which was did you kind

636
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,840
of like you know without necessarily

637
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,360
thinking about it right this is

638
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,439
something which would kind of get the

639
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,119
older generations who might be a little

640
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,640
more skeptical and just kind of bridge

641
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,558
that gap for and make it that little bit

642
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,400
easier for him to get into it well

643
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,678
yeah yeah part of my thinking was this

644
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,080
is a book for my mother even though

645
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,360
she's no longer here but uh no this is

646
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,519
the kind of book my mother she was a

647
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,599
gardener she loved to grow things and

648
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,240
she'd try anything new the last time

649
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,240
something new came to america it was the

650
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,480
snap p i don't know if you've got him

651
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,480
down where you are but this the snap p

652
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
came and everybody went nuts for him

653
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
everybody went nuts for him you know

654
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,400
nobody had to write a book about it uh

655
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
unfortunately cannabis has had such a

656
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,759
bad rap

657
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,240
that i that i i think

658
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,440
the book needed to be written because

659
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,440
uh

660
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,679
it deals with the stigma it deals with

661
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,400
why it's illegal it deals with all the

662
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,278
silliness uh but it also introduces

663
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,000
people to the notion of strains and land

664
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,319
races and uh

665
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,880
you know all of those things in fact uh

666
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,278
one of the pictures i've got in there is

667
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,000
a strain they call it here in the united

668
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,079
states the australian bastard

669
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and it's a spectacular looking little

670
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:38,079
plant it's got millions of little leaves

671
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,798
and people are breeding it right now

672
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,158
with autoflowers developing some very

673
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,798
interesting plants from it so uh

674
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,000
it's just a it's fun and i think i think

675
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,079
this is the next tomato uh i don't i

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,839
don't know if where you are tomatoes are

677
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,759
a big hobby plant but but here in the

678
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,240
united states they're the you know

679
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,558
they're the holy grail of gardening you

680
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,960
know to get a fresh tomato and to give

681
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,798
it to your neighbor you know you know is

682
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,600
like where in the sheriff's badge in

683
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,400
town you know i'm a gardener

684
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,399
and so so you know this is this is i

685
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,960
think the next tomato plant it's a lot

686
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,278
of fun to grow and frankly i would say

687
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,600
here here in the states

688
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:23,359
oh maybe a quarter of the growers

689
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,278
commercial growers are now using these

690
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,158
the they've they're replacing the bigger

691
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,519
guys because the yields are bigger it's

692
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,840
hard for people to believe that

693
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,918
particularly people who've used

694
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,480
autoflowers in the past

695
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,480
not the same genetics they used to be

696
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,000
yeah okay so maybe a slightly redundant

697
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,159
question and that you could maybe infer

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
your answer but are you kind of on board

699
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,960
with the no-till movement is that the

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,720
the kind of absolutely absolutely uh

701
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,798
uh

702
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,880
the no-till movement is

703
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:58,240
a part of soil food webby uh thinking uh

704
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,640
if you till

705
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,319
your soil and and i'll relate this to

706
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,919
cannabis in a minute if you till your

707
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,678
soil first of all you're breaking up

708
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,159
that wonderful mycorrhizal fungi which

709
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,519
is described in teaming with fungi uh

710
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,200
your your

711
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,599
when you cut a worm in half you don't

712
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,000
get two worms you get half a dead worm

713
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,038
uh you know two half's a dead worm uh

714
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,960
when you

715
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,919
unless you hit it at the 18th segment in

716
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,319
which case one half might live

717
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,799
when you have bacteria that are up here

718
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,278
you rototill you put them down here

719
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,480
they're supposed to be up here

720
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,398
actinimocities are supposed to be deeper

721
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,558
in the soil not anyway

722
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,158
rototilting is a very very bad thing to

723
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,558
do um

724
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,520
and when you grow cannabis i would go

725
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:44,558
one step further i reuse my soil i'm

726
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,480
regenerative um

727
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,759
i reuse the roots

728
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,880
i leave the i cut the stem

729
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,200
i plant right in the pot without pulling

730
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,720
the plant out that's how much no-till i

731
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,640
believe in

732
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,960
those roots have been putting out extra

733
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
dates into that soil attracting and

734
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,079
feeding the right kind of cannabis

735
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,319
microbes

736
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,879
those roots provide pathways for new

737
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,960
roots to travel down

738
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,760
and by not breaking it up of course

739
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,079
you've left the mycorrhizal fungi that

740
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:20,158
are there in place with spores so that

741
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,278
the plant becomes infected as it grows

742
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,640
into it so yeah no-till i'm really big

743
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,558
on no-till

744
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,240
and and i'm i

745
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:33,200
i love to till it's so much fun

746
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
it's one of it's one of gardening's joys

747
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,360
and yet

748
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,120
it's the worst thing you can do do not

749
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:44,240
rototill after you garden the first time

750
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,918
fine after that never again now why do

751
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,960
people rototill

752
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,679
well this is a this is an interesting uh

753
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,840
thing and it applies to places like like

754
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,600
alaska and uh uh

755
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,839
the united states during the colonial

756
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,278
period australia

757
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,879
new zealand places that were being

758
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,919
settled

759
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,640
during the early 1800s

760
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,720
late 1700s an english

761
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,640
guy

762
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
codified what everybody thought and that

763
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,120
was that plants ate

764
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
soil it's called the eumesterium of

765
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,959
growing and if plants ate soil this guy

766
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,038
said

767
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,960
let's just pulverize it up if we

768
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:29,200
pulverize it up it'll be easier for him

769
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,519
to eat it so he invented rototilling now

770
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,038
in the united states in australia in new

771
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,879
zealand uh in in places where there was

772
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,440
old growth forest and settlers came

773
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,080
they didn't want to grow old growth they

774
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,558
wanted to grow vegetables to eat

775
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:50,158
and so they cut the old growth down

776
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:54,480
and old growth forests are supported by

777
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:58,000
soils that are very heavy in fungi

778
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,240
vegetables like cannabis are supported

779
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,480
by

780
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,200
bacteria based soils some fungi but

781
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,319
mostly bacteria and when you rototill

782
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,159
you convert old-growth soil into

783
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,158
bacteria soil

784
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,240
and once you do it you've got bacteria

785
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,640
soil you don't have to do it again and

786
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,759
again and again and again and again and

787
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,679
we do

788
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,319
and we're losing soil all around the

789
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,360
world as a result it's a bad bad bad

790
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,678
thing to do

791
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:31,119
so uh you should you reuse the soil in

792
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,960
your pots at a minimum just you know

793
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,918
compost it and then reuse it after three

794
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,159
months

795
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,640
but you can grow three four times in the

796
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,760
same pot uh without without changing it

797
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,600
at all

798
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,960
you feed the soil with compost and

799
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,599
compost teas

800
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,159
uh but but you don't rototill

801
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,240
yeah great answer so what's your

802
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,039
thoughts on some of the new quote

803
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,839
organic companies we see coming out that

804
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,558
kind of have these long lasting granular

805
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,158
solutions you put in the soil and water

806
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,240
over time you know have you come across

807
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,840
these and what's your thoughts

808
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,839
yeah it depends on what they're using i

809
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,240
mean you know uh

810
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,798
uh perlite's getting a bad wrap these

811
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,599
days because it doesn't go away uh

812
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,839
people are using a lot more cocoa choir

813
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:20,879
which is a good recyclable product it

814
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,000
can it's porous uh so it's good um

815
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,320
you know the

816
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,159
the companies i worry about are the ones

817
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,839
that use the word organic without any

818
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
certification

819
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,158
uh i don't trust those companies at all

820
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,720
and and organic is a word that people

821
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,399
kick around and regenerative as well uh

822
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,159
you got to have

823
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,000
country standards and they got to be

824
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,799
followed then you know you're getting

825
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,159
something good um there are a lot of new

826
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:48,639
products that people are bringing on

827
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,640
board uh some of them are gmo products

828
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,159
some of them are

829
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,640
[Music]

830
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
made by gmo

831
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,840
products in other words they're not gmo

832
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,119
themselves but they're made by gmo

833
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,879
bacteria so you got to be very careful

834
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:07,119
about what you're using i'm i'm pretty

835
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,720
pure about about the term organics uh

836
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,158
i'm pretty old-fashioned about it as

837
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,720
well now

838
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,000
mycorrhizal fungi wow they never had

839
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,640
that as a when i was a kid uh is organic

840
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,440
uh so yeah so there's there's new things

841
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,080
coming into the organic field uh that

842
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,840
are certainly worth following and and uh

843
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,639
uh

844
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,558
a lot of ipm kind of stuff

845
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,000
you know coming in as well and

846
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,519
fascinating some of the great stuff

847
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,200
that's happening so

848
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,038
very excited about it and the cannabis

849
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,759
field is the field i think that leads it

850
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:42,398
all uh used to be the viticultures

851
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,679
uh not the not the farmers i'm sorry

852
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,079
but now i think it's the cannabis

853
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,880
growers uh really some of the best

854
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,439
gardeners i've ever ever worked with uh

855
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,679
i do advising uh all over the place i've

856
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,558
got a team of people uh you know it

857
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,320
doesn't matter whether you're in

858
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:01,038
colombia mexico alaska canada

859
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,200
you know kansas doesn't matter

860
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,200
if you're growing cannabis there's a way

861
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,000
to do it that's the right way and if

862
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,679
you're open to it wow

863
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,159
really is something else the results are

864
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,600
incredible absolutely incredible so

865
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,519
that's been the best thing about all of

866
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,959
this stuff is that people come up to me

867
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,159
and they and they tell me that they've

868
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,440
converted

869
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,799
uh and that they've never looked back i

870
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,720
go yes

871
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,240
uh because i don't make any money off of

872
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,640
this stuff i can tell you my publisher

873
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,319
might make some but uh you know it's

874
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,600
when somebody writes a letter or you

875
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,599
call up and say you know let's do a

876
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,079
podcast or you know you give me a nice

877
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,959
introduction there uh you know that's

878
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,199
that's what this is all about because

879
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,000
we we've screwed things up

880
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,960
uh i'm you know 70 years old and right

881
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,679
now my my goddess is greta uh you know

882
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,480
we've got to make sure that she gets the

883
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,559
garden and her kids get the garden

884
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,278
period uh and it doesn't matter whether

885
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,960
it's cannabis or tomatoes uh if we if we

886
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,200
don't do it organically

887
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,278
um you know they're not gonna make it

888
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,278
period simple as that

889
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,679
yep the sentiment i can get behind again

890
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,878
it's kind of the theme of my side of the

891
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,280
comments but

892
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,039
a question i'm sure a ton of fans want

893
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,519
to know would you be able to give us a

894
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,039
little basic excuse me would you be able

895
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,559
to give us a little basic rundown of

896
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,480
your growing setup and by that i just

897
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,239
mean what type of amendments do you like

898
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,079
to use when you're doing your soil and

899
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,078
you know do you have um you know just

900
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,480
little things you like to do

901
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,839
sure uh well first of all i travel an

902
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,039
awful lot so

903
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,358
that's one of the nice things about the

904
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,279
autoflowers

905
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,918
is that i can come back and they're done

906
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,440
um so i do a lot of i do a lot of tent

907
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,838
growing in the winter

908
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,280
uh so i've got a nice line tent that

909
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:48,480
i've made myself uh using electrical uh

910
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,879
poles you know that i've

911
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,240
rigged together using the little circuit

912
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,838
socket things you know they fit in

913
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,519
anyway uh

914
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,159
so i've got a tent that grows about four

915
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,559
to six plants and then outdoors uh i

916
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,358
live on i live on eight acres and i i

917
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,358
garden on about three or two or three of

918
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,679
them uh i've got a small outdoor

919
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,440
greenhouse and an indoor greenhouse as

920
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,358
well um

921
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,400
the mix i use is is is based with

922
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:19,679
something called alaska humus

923
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,800
this is a very rich

924
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,559
natural

925
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,640
soil from alaska

926
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,880
in anchorage we have

927
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,879
earthquakes all the time and this soil

928
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,280
has to be removed

929
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,358
80 feet of it and put into landfills

930
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,599
where it's no longer available before

931
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,159
you can build

932
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,440
the giant cabbages that people associate

933
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:44,078
with alaska they're grown in this stuff

934
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,079
in a in an area outside of anchorage

935
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,160
where it's it's you know got a little

936
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,519
six inch layer right down in the root

937
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:54,879
zone uh so it's very very rich rich

938
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,480
a microbiol biological soil in fact dr

939
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,160
elaine once said it has the highest

940
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:04,320
microbiology of any soil she's ever seen

941
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,199
now uh i basically plant in that

942
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,760
with

943
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,399
uh i'll put in some cocoa in it

944
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,119
just for just for good drainage

945
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,519
i'll put a little green sand in it uh

946
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,800
i'll put a little bit of

947
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,480
uh

948
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,440
uh

949
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,559
fish

950
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,200
fish hydrolyzite in it uh but that's

951
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,639
basically it now for most people

952
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,519
good compost

953
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:34,480
is is a good starter because it provides

954
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,320
the indigenous microbes from your own

955
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,240
area these are microbes that are going

956
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,240
to live in your area so the fact that

957
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,439
i'm using alaskan humus and basically

958
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,358
what alaska yumus is is compost uh it

959
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,159
just happens to be from from out in the

960
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,519
wild every summer it thaws every winter

961
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,279
it freezes been going on for ten

962
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,880
thousand years and this is beautiful

963
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
beautiful black

964
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,599
smells delicious

965
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,800
um that's streptomyce that's a

966
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:01,680
streptomycin cell smell that's in there

967
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,200
that's ah beautiful stuff anyway uh

968
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,838
you've got it all over all around the

969
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,879
world but if you don't you make compost

970
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:11,119
and that compost you make on the ground

971
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,920
you don't make it in a machine because

972
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,559
you want indigenous microbes come up

973
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,320
from the soil in the ground and get into

974
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,199
your compost pile

975
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,480
or you make vermicompost

976
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,639
and and uh you put in indigenous soil

977
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,719
into the verma compost bin if you use a

978
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,519
bin vermicompost is terrific because

979
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,480
it's got concentrated uh uh nutrients in

980
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,119
it that that compost doesn't have um

981
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,838
that should be the base for everybody's

982
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,640
everybody's uh grow now if you've got a

983
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,719
big gigantic farm that's hard to do uh

984
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,719
and so you you just have to constantly

985
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,519
make compost you gotta constantly amend

986
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,279
you gotta constantly uh uh you know feed

987
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,920
and take care of stuff and it's

988
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,400
important uh that once you once you get

989
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,280
your soil you keep it alive i use

990
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,119
compost teas and compost extracts a

991
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,640
compost extract is nothing more than

992
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,320
taking compost putting it into a a uh a

993
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,598
cheese cloth

994
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,320
you know

995
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,359
set up and just squeezing it in warm

996
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,079
water

997
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,759
for 15 minutes you end up squeezing out

998
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,320
the microbes you don't multiply them but

999
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,720
you you extract them out and so you feed

1000
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,280
them i always have a layer of compost

1001
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,279
down on the base of my plants

1002
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,119
not on the base but at the base of my

1003
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,320
plants

1004
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,680
and

1005
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,880
once every five or six grows

1006
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,078
i will

1007
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,079
actually dig in

1008
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,000
depending on what the tests show that it

1009
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,400
needs what it needs i use a living mulch

1010
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,480
usually a sweet clover mulch

1011
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,639
which is which is easy to do

1012
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,000
and i test with something that most

1013
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,960
people have never heard of called a

1014
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,039
microbiometer

1015
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,440
i advise this i advise this company

1016
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,679
because once i saw this thing i went

1017
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,838
crazy i've always looked for something

1018
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:05,759
that i could say to people

1019
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:08,559
your product teams with microbes

1020
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,400
buy my seal i'll give you an endorsement

1021
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,000
now how do you do that well you know how

1022
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,358
do you show that something teams with

1023
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,559
microbes you can look it under a

1024
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,239
microscope and everything else but that

1025
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,838
really doesn't tell you anything what

1026
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:22,559
this this does

1027
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:25,519
this tells you the changes in biomass in

1028
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,519
your soil biomass is basically the

1029
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,480
microbes in your soil

1030
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,920
and so

1031
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,920
uh to do a biomass test for most soil

1032
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,280
tests it's

1033
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,680
500

1034
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,200
it takes a month maybe three weeks if

1035
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,960
you're lucky

1036
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,679
this is a test that this woman has

1037
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,920
developed that you use your iphone or

1038
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,519
your your android doesn't matter which

1039
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,920
you use a phone you uh

1040
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,719
you take a sample you

1041
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,880
mix it out in the field in about seven

1042
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,879
to ten minutes and then you do a reading

1043
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,760
right there cost you five bucks

1044
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,640
and it tells you what the biomass is of

1045
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,440
your soil now if you're putting a good

1046
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:10,000
organic fertilizer on your plant

1047
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,480
the biomass increases because the

1048
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,119
microbes go out and eat it up and etc

1049
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,119
and you can tell what's happening to

1050
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,599
your plant what's

1051
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,800
by looking at the microbiometer

1052
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,359
test so if you're a grower you can tell

1053
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,280
when the plant begins to flower the

1054
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:31,519
exudates slow down and you get a lower

1055
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,800
biomass so it's a fascinating new tool

1056
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,440
that's being tested here in the united

1057
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
states uh it's being sold in australia

1058
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,240
actually and you can get it on the web

1059
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,240
go look at the www.microbiometer.com

1060
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,679
fascinating new tool

1061
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,920
and and

1062
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,318
basically if i do a test and i have a

1063
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,800
test that's over about five or six

1064
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:53,838
hundred i don't do anything to my soil

1065
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,318
nothing

1066
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,799
i'll just take the the alaska humus put

1067
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:01,759
a little choir in it for drainage and

1068
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,680
that's it simple as that so it's a very

1069
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,280
interesting new tool that i think is

1070
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,358
going to help people test their soil and

1071
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,040
know what to do with it particularly

1072
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,960
when they're growing cannabis because

1073
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,960
let's face it you know it's not that

1074
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,318
hard a plant to grow

1075
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,318
it's it's a

1076
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,318
plant you can screw up easily but it's

1077
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,679
not that hard to grow if you if you do

1078
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:23,199
it right so yeah brilliant and i i've

1079
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,879
actually bought some of those tests

1080
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,919
myself and i can definitely vouch for

1081
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,200
what you're saying they're very good

1082
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,079
aren't they

1083
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,879
yeah

1084
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,400
it's

1085
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,200
fascinating absolutely fascinating and

1086
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,280
the difference for example i use it in

1087
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,399
in alaska in the spring it tells me when

1088
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,880
spring hits i see it as an increase in

1089
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,358
the biomass when the trees start to drop

1090
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,838
the you know the the extra days start to

1091
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,039
increase that tells me it's time to tell

1092
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,920
my readers

1093
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,559
you're about to be outdoors soon

1094
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
because the trees never never lie

1095
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,719
it's fascinating it's a great new tool

1096
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,800
and great things are happening and

1097
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,318
my understanding is it's even being

1098
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,318
improved so

1099
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,679
i wish i wish i knew who the

1100
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,679
distributors were in australia but

1101
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,598
anyway it's it's a great new tool

1102
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:10,159
yeah fantastic i just wanted to loot

1103
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,680
back quickly to a topic we were talking

1104
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,838
about earlier when you mentioned that

1105
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,399
you're fond of products that have the

1106
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,480
organic certification and whatnot

1107
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,160
are there any that you

1108
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,760
basically recommend to steer clear of

1109
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,159
because in the past and particularly in

1110
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,680
the cannabis industry some of our guests

1111
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,239
including myself have been quite

1112
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,440
skeptical of the omri registration which

1113
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,838
is

1114
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,838
yeah a bit sinister do you think there

1115
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,679
are some that aren't as good as others

1116
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,519
yeah i don't think armory sinister i

1117
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,960
just don't think it's as comprehensive

1118
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:40,318
as it could be

1119
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,960
um

1120
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,719
there is a company that i don't i you

1121
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,119
know that uses the word organic all the

1122
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,199
time i would never touch their lights i

1123
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,200
would never touch their fertilizer i

1124
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,598
would never touch their soil i would

1125
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,960
never listen to the nasty scots guy that

1126
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,599
yells at me and tells me to put the

1127
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
stuff on uh in the in on my lawn in the

1128
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,559
spring and i think you know who i'm

1129
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,000
speaking of

1130
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,199
and i don't like them because they make

1131
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,280
people see

1132
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,838
yeah so you got to be careful omri i'm

1133
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,519
breaking is very simple to get that's

1134
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,318
the problem with it they won't give it

1135
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:15,280
to just anybody but it's too simple to

1136
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,440
get to be very very comfortable uh very

1137
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,519
often it makes sense to actually now

1138
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,679
that we've got the web go on the web and

1139
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,159
contact the companies and and ask for

1140
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,239
the uh they call a manufacturer product

1141
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,559
sheets and and things like that and

1142
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,879
tests and a lot of these companies have

1143
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,719
it uh so i think that's that's

1144
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,640
what you really need to look for find

1145
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,598
one that's good then and stick with it

1146
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,000
um

1147
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,720
and then i i also like i like to go into

1148
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,880
uh nurseries and to grow stores

1149
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,799
and find out what's what are people

1150
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,559
really getting good results from what's

1151
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,720
what makes sense what do you guys like

1152
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,559
you know and i look at it and i smell it

1153
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,399
and i you know i try it

1154
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,679
uh so it's

1155
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,680
fascinating how many new things there

1156
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,199
are out there whoa

1157
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,799
and the big guys are getting in there so

1158
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,598
i i won't mention the name of that

1159
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,839
particular one uh but but i will mention

1160
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,200
bayer uh and you know what they're doing

1161
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,440
now is they're trying to figure out how

1162
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,118
to how to modify a plant so that it'll

1163
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,720
produce its own nitrogen which is a

1164
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,000
great thing

1165
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,199
i'm not i'm not sure how they're going

1166
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,199
to do it

1167
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,318
they're trying to make plants

1168
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,239
uh

1169
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,960
give off the signal that attracts

1170
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,279
mycorrhizal fungi so they can it's you

1171
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,880
know the things that they're doing

1172
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,480
part of me says gee that's interesting

1173
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,318
and maybe it's going to be good but the

1174
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,838
way they go about it may be not good so

1175
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,838
we've got to we just got to keep our

1176
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,000
eyes open and we have to talk to each

1177
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,400
other about this stuff that's why i love

1178
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,079
giving talks i love going to conventions

1179
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,480
uh we have them here in the united

1180
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,119
states all over the place i mean my

1181
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,760
goodness gracious you you know every any

1182
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,640
place that legalizes cannabis ends up

1183
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,280
with

1184
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:52,719
a good conference every other month

1185
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,800
and there are lots of them and and so

1186
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:55,759
it's very interesting to see

1187
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,039
who

1188
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,760
who thrives who doesn't uh who people

1189
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,960
frequent and who they don't and it's

1190
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,560
it's

1191
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,920
the bad guys are getting known out there

1192
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:07,519
pretty pretty well

1193
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,599
yeah

1194
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,759
well that that actually perfectly segues

1195
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,680
into the next question in that we do see

1196
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,560
commercial ag kind of moving into the

1197
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,480
cannabis scene what do you think is a

1198
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,279
role they can play that's not going to

1199
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,559
be the downfall and more importantly do

1200
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,160
you think there's anything that they're

1201
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,838
already currently doing that could be

1202
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,239
brought to the cannabis industry that we

1203
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,480
just haven't adopted yet

1204
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,719
well let me let me let me divide the egg

1205
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,280
thing into two the first is sort of the

1206
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,159
information egg you know the magazines

1207
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,839
oh my god there are a gazillion i'm

1208
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,039
sitting on the floor here

1209
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:46,000
there are gazillion a gazillion

1210
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,159
magazines on cannabis too many and of

1211
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,119
course uh i've written a couple of

1212
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,759
articles that have not been printed

1213
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,440
because i write articles like uh no

1214
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,760
don't use this product don't use that

1215
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,920
product uh you know these are bad people

1216
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,760
anybody associated with glyphosate

1217
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,240
shouldn't be trusted you know that kind

1218
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,520
of and and they won't print them

1219
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:10,959
why because the space has been invaded

1220
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,599
uh and we now know of course that big ag

1221
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,039
and you know and big hydro uh has

1222
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,240
invaded the space and uh so as well as

1223
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,318
big uh

1224
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,559
bad guy good guys you get bad guys as

1225
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,719
well and and that has happened so so the

1226
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,960
informations that you get

1227
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,759
may be wrong in the first place

1228
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,599
and that worries me quite a bit um

1229
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,480
when you pick up a magazine you can't

1230
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,519
trust the advertising

1231
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,119
don't

1232
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,559
don't trust the advertising i don't know

1233
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,640
what else to say

1234
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,480
so that's the first problem

1235
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,799
the second problem of course is that big

1236
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,800
egg

1237
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,400
tends to have

1238
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:51,118
the idea that they're gonna do oils in

1239
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,119
mind uh you know that's they're not

1240
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,599
they're not in it for individual flowers

1241
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,240
yet i don't see

1242
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,640
you know a big tobacco company uh saying

1243
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,479
okay we're gonna make tobacco

1244
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,799
then we're gonna make cannabis joints it

1245
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,599
will come for sure and i'm sure there'll

1246
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,119
be

1247
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,880
cigar companies that'll make blunts

1248
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,079
but right now it seems to me that what

1249
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,960
big egg is interested in is uh being

1250
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,560
able to produce enough leaf

1251
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,519
that they're able to

1252
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:25,838
uh you know make oils out of and waxes

1253
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:27,358
and that kind of stuff and and uh

1254
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,519
i don't i don't know whether that's

1255
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,519
healthy for the industry a i don't mean

1256
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,759
that in terms of lung problems and all

1257
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,759
kinds

1258
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,799
the ability to be able to grow indoors

1259
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,358
in a greenhouse is phenomenal

1260
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,359
the ability to be able to use good

1261
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,480
lighting is phenomenal

1262
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,838
um

1263
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,079
and i think that big egg can bring that

1264
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,838
and

1265
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,440
the

1266
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:55,679
electronic the electronics that they

1267
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,039
have associated with them into the

1268
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,078
cannabis world

1269
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,759
uh i mean you you know as well as i know

1270
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,359
that when someone sits in a tractor

1271
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,839
these days

1272
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,598
it's more like sitting in a living room

1273
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:08,960
than it is you know it's like being in a

1274
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,960
tesla

1275
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,838
television sets and

1276
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,760
satellite navigation and all that kind

1277
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,920
of garbage and stuff and so but you know

1278
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,559
a lot of that stuff probably makes sense

1279
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,039
uh light deprivation new greenhouse

1280
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,760
materials uh the ability to be able to

1281
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,880
control water and save water uh and

1282
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,079
purify uh the ability to be able to

1283
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,838
control

1284
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,519
mildew all that kind of stuff i think

1285
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,799
makes a lot of sense a lot of the

1286
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:39,119
genetic testing uh not associated with

1287
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,039
the cannabis itself but genetic testing

1288
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,358
associated with the

1289
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,639
the diseases and the viruses and the

1290
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,400
bugs uh so the the things that

1291
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,558
that feed it all that kind of stuff is

1292
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,318
going to be helpful and and is being

1293
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,599
applied already so i don't know if that

1294
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,480
answers your question but i think there

1295
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,920
is a lot in big egg i worry they don't

1296
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,559
know what they're doing

1297
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,880
i worry about the little guy

1298
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,720
uh but then i you know i'm always

1299
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,318
reminded about the wine industry and

1300
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,799
that there's always room for the low

1301
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,558
label and the little label and et cetera

1302
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,680
et cetera well

1303
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,319
okay

1304
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,799
but i don't i don't want to see cannabis

1305
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,838
turn into a mass-produced

1306
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,440
uh

1307
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,639
uh chemically sprayed grown

1308
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,480
bad for you

1309
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:28,078
uh item i mean i don't think there's any

1310
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,079
excuse for that and and

1311
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,558
i'm a little bit embarrassed about how

1312
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,519
we've how we've gone about legalization

1313
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,920
because i don't think we've done it the

1314
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,480
right way uh we haven't we haven't

1315
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,680
looked at this from any other any other

1316
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,838
way then

1317
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,440
uh we need

1318
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:44,960
we need to convince governments and the

1319
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,358
only way to convince governments is with

1320
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,280
money taxation that was the wrong way to

1321
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,920
go about it so

1322
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,599
that was way off track no it was it was

1323
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,760
perfect and i want to even follow that

1324
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,359
up with a kind of a complex issue we

1325
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,480
haven't been able to dive into too much

1326
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,960
in the past but i think you're going to

1327
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,240
be perfect for it so we know for a fact

1328
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,920
that there are companies out there such

1329
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,159
as molecular farms and their parent

1330
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,639
companies who are genetically modifying

1331
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,399
cannabis specifically to do things like

1332
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,480
so that every plant is expressing the

1333
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,400
exact same phenotype same height and

1334
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,079
everything so the idea is that like they

1335
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,599
can be perfectly harvested by like a

1336
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,400
combine in the field that's just going

1337
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,318
to optimize to pick them all the fear is

1338
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,160
that one of the things they're doing is

1339
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,400
modifying the terpene profiles so that

1340
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:28,239
for example there's zero immersing

1341
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,800
and the fear is that these are such

1342
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,318
genetically dominant plants that if they

1343
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,079
do hermaphrodite which you hope they

1344
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:35,519
wouldn't but if they do and there's a

1345
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,359
big field of this

1346
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,079
if that pollen were to get into some

1347
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,920
regular stock it would essentially wipe

1348
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,880
out the gene for say mercene in this

1349
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,960
situation and over time you know worst

1350
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,559
case scenario has man gone too far we

1351
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,240
could lose certain things do you think

1352
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,079
that's a realistic fear or it's a bit of

1353
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,000
paranoia

1354
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,599
well i think it is a fear i think i

1355
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,599
think there's some realism to it i mean

1356
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,480
people in oregon for example worry about

1357
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,800
hemp

1358
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,960
you know the the the pollen from hemp

1359
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,280
uh getting onto the pollen from count

1360
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,760
you know to a to a medical cannabis farm

1361
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,119
etc etc and it can be a problem so i

1362
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,119
think we have to we

1363
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,039
we you know we treated this thing so

1364
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,720
badly for so long you know that there

1365
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,480
aren't enough lines of communication so

1366
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,318
we can talk about these things and kind

1367
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,440
of kind of make it work out but yeah i

1368
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:20,880
think there's a i think there's a

1369
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,119
potential problem we just have to pay

1370
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,318
attention to it and we have to have

1371
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,119
control of it

1372
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:27,838
not

1373
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,640
government that's interested in money we

1374
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:33,199
shouldn't care about the money we should

1375
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:36,000
care about the health and the impact on

1376
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:38,078
ourselves in the environment that's got

1377
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,039
to be number one when it comes to

1378
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,280
cannabis let's not fall into the trap

1379
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:46,400
where it's just money talks because

1380
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,079
that's what happens as we know uh

1381
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,960
and and

1382
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:53,599
the idea of genetic genetic modification

1383
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,440
it may turn out right now i i think the

1384
00:51:53,599 --> 00:52:00,480
jury is is out uh in terms of part of

1385
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,119
the genetic modification pro issue but i

1386
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,199
think the jury is right on on the market

1387
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,358
genetic modification is being used so

1388
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:08,719
that they can spray the plant with a

1389
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,279
pesticide

1390
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,519
then it's absolutely no way

1391
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,200
if it's being used to make the plant a

1392
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:20,480
better plant and you can control it

1393
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:22,799
than possibly but even then i'm not sure

1394
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,199
i'm just not sure uh

1395
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,960
you know for years and years and years

1396
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,519
and centuries and centuries and

1397
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,599
centuries we've been able to breed this

1398
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,519
plant the way we want to with regular

1399
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,559
breathing methods

1400
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,719
what's wrong with that

1401
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,040
exactly until we can figure it out until

1402
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,799
we can figure it out let's not screw

1403
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,759
things up

1404
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,039
that's that's the scary thing yeah so

1405
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,280
last little question on the kind of

1406
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,599
legal side of things recently we've

1407
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,640
heard the sentiment that 215 in

1408
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,800
california was maybe not the best idea

1409
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,799
what legal changes would you like to see

1410
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,400
to kind of create a more conducive

1411
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,240
environment for the cannabis market to

1412
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,079
thrive for all growers not just the big

1413
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,679
ones

1414
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,880
it's a that's a really difficult

1415
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,039
question well

1416
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,680
now i always say this is an alaskan the

1417
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:14,318
first thing is no bill gets passed using

1418
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:17,598
the word marijuana

1419
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:19,119
this this is a word that i cannot stand

1420
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,519
and i don't think anybody who ever

1421
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,358
touches cannabis should ever use because

1422
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:26,559
in the united states

1423
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,960
this is a word that was drenched up by a

1424
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,400
guy named harry enslinger harry

1425
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:35,280
enslinger was head of the tobacco and

1426
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,920
and uh alcohol administration when

1427
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,519
prohibition was ending and he went oh

1428
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,559
what am i going to do and what are my

1429
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:47,119
people going to do and he's the guy that

1430
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,720
started the worldwide paranoia over the

1431
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:53,119
the use of

1432
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:54,799
cannabis which he called marijuana so

1433
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,480
when you use the word marijuana you're

1434
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,559
putting a uh

1435
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,838
you're putting a statue up to harry

1436
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:05,359
inslinger harry ainslinger caused

1437
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:07,279
australia bolivia colombia

1438
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,119
london

1439
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,839
you know ottawa

1440
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,800
pass these draconian terrible terrible

1441
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:14,078
laws

1442
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,200
so the first thing i would do is make

1443
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,800
sure that everybody uses the word

1444
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,519
cannabis that's what this plant is it's

1445
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,480
cannabis i know marijuana is a word in

1446
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:25,039
spanish that was used once

1447
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,199
but not very often um

1448
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,400
i would i would uh

1449
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,759
uh

1450
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:35,519
reduce the taxation element i think this

1451
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,520
has just become way out of hand

1452
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,440
i would definitely in the united states

1453
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,599
we have a serious problem where where

1454
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,079
the this disproportionate number of of

1455
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,838
minority citizens

1456
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,119
have been put away as a result of

1457
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,199
cannabis

1458
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,920
problems in the past the prohibition and

1459
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,919
i i would uh have laws that give an

1460
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,318
advantage uh

1461
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,639
to to uh minorities that have been

1462
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,759
impacted for a certain period of time

1463
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:05,039
um

1464
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,319
and and

1465
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:09,199
beyond that i don't have enough

1466
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:12,159
expertise but i know the system's broken

1467
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,759
i know that in california there is a

1468
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,239
wild

1469
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,520
wicked uh you know

1470
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,519
illegal market and it's very viable

1471
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:23,358
and it's and it's very healthy

1472
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,519
and so i think i think

1473
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,798
the fact that that exists tells me that

1474
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,798
the law

1475
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,059
failed um

1476
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,358
we got a terrible problem in

1477
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:35,199
[Music]

1478
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,279
alaska that i think most other places

1479
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,919
have there's way too many restrictions

1480
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,839
on this plant way too many restrictions

1481
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,880
it's just a plant

1482
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,639
if you grow it next to a school so

1483
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,880
what

1484
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:52,879
that's just the way it is uh if you grow

1485
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:55,039
it next to a church sorry uh it's just a

1486
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,480
plant i mean there was a period of time

1487
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:59,279
when people in the united states thought

1488
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,119
that tomato plant was poisonous

1489
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,480
uh and and you know you couldn't eat a

1490
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,119
tomato plant

1491
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,719
this is just a plant folks and and as

1492
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,039
such we need to start treating it like a

1493
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,679
plant uh if we need to get a little bit

1494
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:14,000
of taxation okay i can understand that

1495
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:15,279
but so far we've seen that crime rates

1496
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,519
have gone down

1497
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,280
drawer grates among teenagers has gone

1498
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,039
down

1499
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,599
there's probably been an increase in

1500
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,880
driving uh i would imagine although i

1501
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,039
don't know whether whether that's

1502
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,720
necessarily bad but if it is

1503
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,119
then let's do a little bit of taxation

1504
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:34,639
so we can we can ameliorate that a

1505
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:37,200
little bit um but goodness gracious this

1506
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,039
is not the b wall answer to ever this is

1507
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,000
this is not going to pay for my health

1508
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:43,519
care uh it just shouldn't it's not so we

1509
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,119
need to treat we need to treat the plant

1510
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,960
like a plant we need to have laws to

1511
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,240
treat the plant like a plant

1512
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,519
not like this is some kind of a

1513
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,598
syndicate

1514
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:55,039
we need to be very careful that we don't

1515
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,400
give licenses just to a few

1516
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,279
which which a couple of states in the

1517
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,079
united states have done um you know we

1518
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,119
just we just got to pay attention so

1519
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,680
i don't know

1520
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,400
uh it's a wide open thing i'm i'm too

1521
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:10,480
old to but i am so thankful that it is

1522
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,358
legal in so many places in the united

1523
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,199
states

1524
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,480
and and it will be around the world no

1525
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,399
question

1526
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,679
yeah it seems like the the tides are

1527
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,039
turning so

1528
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,440
for the next section we're just going to

1529
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,400
jump on to some fan submitted questions

1530
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,000
so

1531
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,559
just some more kind of short ones i

1532
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,199
think so first question is

1533
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,760
do you know if plants release root

1534
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:34,879
exudates if they're being fed salts or

1535
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,760
in a hydro environment

1536
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,240
uh

1537
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,960
they might but they might not

1538
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,919
they put the extra dates out in response

1539
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:46,318
to a need and if they're being fed then

1540
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,559
they don't need to waste their synthetic

1541
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,880
their photosynthetic energy to produce

1542
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:54,079
the extra dates in a hydro environment

1543
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,480
you can get uh you can get extra dates

1544
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,519
uh but you don't get nearly as many uh

1545
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480
and they of course they don't have any

1546
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,280
purpose

1547
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,000
uh so you know that's you don't want

1548
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,119
them

1549
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,599
yeah

1550
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,200
so next one looks like from a reader

1551
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,039
who's maybe read your new book they've

1552
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:10,639
said do you have a favorite

1553
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:14,558
autoflowering company and do you have

1554
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:18,879
any tips for training auto flowers

1555
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:20,559
well i like mafesto genetics

1556
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,798
yeah they're they're a good you know

1557
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,599
international company

1558
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,280
they really have some terrific seeds uh

1559
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,400
and boy oh boy are they on top of their

1560
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,160
genetics as far as training what i think

1561
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,160
i'm coming to the conclusion is that

1562
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,199
it's it's best not to train

1563
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:36,399
um

1564
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:37,679
i don't i i

1565
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,200
i

1566
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:40,639
i wish that the

1567
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,838
people like mafesto and they're getting

1568
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,358
much better at it would would tell you

1569
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:47,039
this is a plant that should be pinched

1570
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,318
or this is a plant that should not be

1571
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:52,880
pinched um but other you know other than

1572
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:55,279
pinching i i think that training is is

1573
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,680
really counterproductive

1574
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,839
uh and even in pinching i don't think i

1575
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,679
don't think really

1576
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,679
that much

1577
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,639
yeah so let me answer don't train your

1578
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,558
plants

1579
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,920
after the after the first grow if it

1580
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,519
looks like it could it could have been

1581
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,838
go ahead and do it

1582
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,280
yeah yeah great answer so and i've tried

1583
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,599
i've tried it all i mean i've tried

1584
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,798
tying them down and pinching and

1585
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,680
you know squeeze and all i can you know

1586
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:21,358
it's

1587
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,159
yeah i spread the stuff out a little bit

1588
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:26,078
but you know these are such a great easy

1589
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,519
plants to grow

1590
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,720
and they're so fast they don't need very

1591
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,000
much training

1592
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,598
yeah definitely

1593
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,400
so next question kind of similarly

1594
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,318
related

1595
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,838
have you ever noticed an increased

1596
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,318
prevalence of intersex traits in

1597
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:41,199
autoflowers or have you noticed what

1598
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:44,318
some describe as a common terpene

1599
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,318
amongst autoflowers

1600
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,798
um

1601
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:50,639
yes and no

1602
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:52,400
if you get different different growers

1603
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,199
you get different terpene profiles for

1604
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,240
sure

1605
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:57,838
um i i think some of the the smaller

1606
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,239
newer growers

1607
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,159
are using a smaller gene pool and so

1608
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,679
they don't have quite the quite the uh

1609
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,838
that's one of the reasons why i like

1610
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,759
mafesto i like the big guys

1611
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:09,119
i don't you know i love mephesto don't

1612
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,960
get me wrong i think they're terrific

1613
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,358
people but there's also a thing called

1614
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,880
autoflowering.net

1615
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,679
which i think people might want to go on

1616
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,838
to uh which has lists a lot of different

1617
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:22,480
growers a lot of different different

1618
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:25,199
things uh and and and you can find them

1619
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,880
as well but you tend to get

1620
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:28,798
yeah you tend to get kind of the same

1621
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,358
out of the same grower i i think that

1622
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,280
may be true um

1623
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,838
i haven't i haven't really grown enough

1624
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,680
to really know that whether that's uh

1625
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,000
but i got to tell you what i got was

1626
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,199
good enough i couldn't complain yummy

1627
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,599
yummy

1628
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,118
yeah fantastic i'm a huge fan of the

1629
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,200
festo as well

1630
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,039
so next question this one i should have

1631
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:50,318
asked so very near and dear to my heart

1632
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:51,519
is this is how i actually found out

1633
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,358
about your book

1634
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:55,119
what do you think about the revs true

1635
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,639
living organics

1636
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,119
oh i like it

1637
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,719
yeah i know uh

1638
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,599
i met him i met him when he was a young

1639
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,598
kid

1640
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,200
that's not true but uh yeah i know

1641
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,160
there's a there are a lot of great books

1642
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:10,399
out there uh and and i think it's

1643
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:14,000
important that people get a good library

1644
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,760
uh of different kinds of books uh and

1645
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and and refer to them as as many times

1646
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,520
as they possibly can yeah there's the

1647
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,440
the the

1648
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:22,798
the library field is

1649
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,280
i mean the cannabis field is getting

1650
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:29,199
incredible again i tend to stay away

1651
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,200
from the from the pornographic

1652
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:34,318
good answer so

1653
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,160
recently we've seen a lot of discussion

1654
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,798
around the topic of defoliation and i

1655
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,920
think you've said in the past your

1656
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:42,960
anti-defoliation would you mind giving

1657
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,639
us an explanation as to why you are that

1658
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,880
well two reasons

1659
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,798
one is if you've got a good light

1660
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,119
you want to have as many light receivers

1661
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,880
as you possibly can period

1662
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,039
and every one of those fan leafs that

1663
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,160
you're taking off your plant because you

1664
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,680
think you're getting better air

1665
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:02,558
circulation is a is a factory of

1666
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,159
thousands of gazillions

1667
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,480
you know of chloroplasts that are

1668
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,798
feeding your plant and so it's just

1669
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,798
counterproductive to remove those unless

1670
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:14,880
you absolutely have to move your fan

1671
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:18,000
get a different air system

1672
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,160
but do not take off

1673
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
leafs now if you've got a really good

1674
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,399
light set up

1675
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,440
you're way ahead by leaving those those

1676
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,440
leaves on

1677
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,679
if you're like and if you've got a lousy

1678
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,200
light set up you're way ahead by leaving

1679
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:32,399
those lease

1680
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,118
they're just

1681
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,798
factories you want to have as many as

1682
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,440
you possibly can

1683
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,358
yeah great answer so next one is a

1684
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,200
really good question in my opinion have

1685
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,719
you ever considered getting your books

1686
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,000
turned into audio books and would you

1687
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:49,679
consider doing the voice if so

1688
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,599
i'm not sure i could pronounce all the

1689
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,519
words for goodness sakes yeah i mean i

1690
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:57,440
would i would certainly consider it but

1691
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:58,400
i'd rather have it in spanish or chinese

1692
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,200
uh

1693
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,680
yeah

1694
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,439
it's it's in electronic versions but

1695
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:04,719
it's not in audio

1696
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,798
i don't you know i don't know what that

1697
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:09,199
process is i'd have to ask my

1698
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,719
my uh my publisher uh

1699
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,480
i don't know whether whether they do

1700
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,078
that stuff but yeah i would certainly do

1701
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,199
that i don't think you'd want my voice i

1702
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,720
think you'd want uh let's get some

1703
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,798
some really

1704
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,679
you know somebody really good

1705
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:25,038
jimbalushi i don't

1706
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,798
great great

1707
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,480
um so

1708
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,719
have you been keeping up to date with

1709
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,159
any of the new lighting technology and

1710
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,318
if so have you got any thoughts on the

1711
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,399
new plasma lights

1712
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:40,159
yeah i love plasma lights

1713
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,519
i advise a company uh called

1714
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:46,399
second song light on demand

1715
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:48,960
it's it's just incredible the plasma

1716
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,400
lights are phenomenal the old days you

1717
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,760
used to have to have two different kinds

1718
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,240
of plasma lights

1719
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,640
one for flowering one for vegging not

1720
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,639
anymore uh and this particular light

1721
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,078
that i'm that i'm interested in it

1722
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,358
weighs about

1723
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:06,960
i don't know 10 to 15 pounds

1724
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:11,199
and it doesn't put out any heat it uses

1725
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:13,679
about half the electrical output wattage

1726
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:16,719
um it is

1727
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:20,000
the cat's meow and it grows the finest

1728
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:21,439
cannabis you have ever ever ever ever

1729
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,400
seen uh

1730
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,639
just spectacular and and

1731
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,559
i can't wait i don't i don't have one

1732
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:31,440
yet but i want one so i can grow my

1733
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,079
autoflowers uh autoflowers by the way

1734
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,119
i'd like to keep mine on a 24 hour 24

1735
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,119
hour light cycle uh when you go 24 hour

1736
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:43,280
light cycle with a plasma light

1737
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,760
auto autoflowers holy cromolo you get a

1738
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:48,160
yield like you cannot believe and the

1739
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,520
tastes though though the

1740
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:55,118
uh i mean my god it's just incredible

1741
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,679
it's just unbelievable so uh yeah i i

1742
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:00,640
like plasma lights an awful lot

1743
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:02,318
they last a very long time the thing

1744
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,159
that that people don't realize when they

1745
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,358
buy an led light

1746
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,440
they break

1747
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:10,798
they don't last forever

1748
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,798
they end up in the landfill

1749
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,119
these these plasma lights are a little

1750
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,880
bit more expensive uh and again i would

1751
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,240
i would highly uh encourage people to

1752
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,640
take a look at the second sun knowing

1753
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:24,318
that i i do advise these guys this is

1754
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:25,759
this is the light

1755
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:27,519
it is the sun

1756
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,599
and and uh

1757
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:32,639
you know there's no substitute what we

1758
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,400
do as growers very often is we try to

1759
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,798
skimp

1760
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,079
okay now normally you're growing a plant

1761
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,358
outdoors that's where it's supposed to

1762
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,960
grow under good sunlight the last thing

1763
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,920
in the world you want to skimp is your

1764
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,960
light

1765
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,200
and people do that and they shouldn't

1766
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,039
just a terrible thing growing cannabis

1767
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,798
is a three-legged stool

1768
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,559
and if you want to grow good cannabis

1769
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,400
you have to have good genetics that's a

1770
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,200
given you've got to have good soil from

1771
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,599
my perspective it's got to be a healthy

1772
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:03,038
healthy living soil and the third thing

1773
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,440
is you've got to have good lights if

1774
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:08,480
you've got those three things you can't

1775
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,838
fail to grow good good cannabis

1776
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,440
great answer

1777
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,920
so last question from our little fan

1778
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,318
submitted ones is what type of things do

1779
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,079
you like to to do to get rid of bugs

1780
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:19,838
like for example if you had russet mites

1781
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,119
what might you do to help get rid of

1782
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:22,960
them

1783
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,960
yeah i'm a big believer first of all if

1784
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,920
you're if you're a commercial grower you

1785
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,559
have got to have on call

1786
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,240
an ipm specialist simple as simple as

1787
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,160
that if you don't have an ipm specialist

1788
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,639
you're crazy i can never pronounce the

1789
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:40,879
names of any of these things uh but i'm

1790
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:43,440
a big big believer in ipm uh when you

1791
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,519
when you start out however with a good

1792
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,000
healthy soil

1793
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:50,719
the opportunity for the soil food web to

1794
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,280
start taking out your problems uh

1795
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:55,838
on its own is increased

1796
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,920
many many many many times

1797
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:59,440
but russet mites yeah russet mites is

1798
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,358
one of those things what did i hear

1799
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,079
about rusted mice rusted mites were

1800
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:06,078
sprayed in the united states by

1801
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,039
one of the utilities this is the rover

1802
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:11,920
utility companies in order to kill the

1803
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,240
vegetation underneath the wires

1804
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,280
wait a minute uh you mean those rusted

1805
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:20,959
mites in california all come from and

1806
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:24,319
people have it like crazy uh

1807
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,000
if you can use uv lights you know that

1808
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,798
kind of stuff i always like to do that

1809
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,199
kind of stuff you want to out compete

1810
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,838
you want to know what life cycle stages

1811
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,598
the the problem is is going to go

1812
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:38,558
through and you want to find something

1813
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,838
in the soil food web medicine chest that

1814
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:43,359
out competes that guy for a space for

1815
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:45,358
food

1816
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:46,719

1817
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,679
that it doesn't like

1818
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:52,798
there's something out there for anything

1819
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:55,598
but the best place to go is is get on

1820
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,798
the web right away and contact an ipm

1821
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,559

because they know what they're doing and

1823
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,119
chances are that whoever you're

1824
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,598
contacting he that he or she has already

1825

your neighbors and everybody else

1827

you have so

1829

a brilliant answer so on to our last two

1832
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,880
or three questions before we wrap it up

1833
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,639
so

1834
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,640

but german poison that's without

1859
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,318
question my favorite

1860
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,278
very good answer so on the other end of

1861
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:23,279
the spectrum what is the least memorable

1862
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,279
or the way that least impressed you

1863
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,000
well you know that would have to be the

1864
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,920
weed from the very very first time

1865
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,560
very very first time i got stoned my

1866
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:36,158
good friend jeremy platt and i we must

1867
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,960
have gone through 30 40 pipes full

1868
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:41,838
before we finally got stoned because

1869
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,359
back in 1970 let's see what was that oh

1870
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,119
my god

1871
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,319
1968

1872
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:47,838
ah

1873
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,880
there you

1874
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:52,960
uh this was right before thai sticks and

1875
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,359
all sorts of great weeds started coming

1876
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,119
into the united states from vietnam uh

1877
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:59,359
but boy the early weed was terrible

1878
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,359
stuff terrible stuff

1879
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,639
awful never want to go back to that

1880
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,519
again

1881
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,760
sticks and seeds

1882
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,760
headaches common sense for those who

1883
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,920
have never tried it yeah

1884
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,760
uh so if you were sent to a desert

1885
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,279
island you could only have two or three

1886
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,840
strains with you which ones would you

1887
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,840
want to take

1888
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:23,039
well i think i'd probably take uh

1889
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,119
i would depending on whether i was

1890
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,960
limited to autoflowers or not

1891
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:29,039
anything you want

1892
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,719
i would take i would have to take a

1893
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,039
couple of regular plants to do some

1894
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,640
breeding so i would want to have uh

1895
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,560
because i think it's probably a pretty

1896
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,199
quick grower

1897
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,679
i think blue dream is very good very

1898
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,839
good easy grower

1899
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,719

all it all turns out to be good and you

1911
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,960
know again if you grow your cannabis

1912
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:20,399
organically and you provide those

1913
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,920
necessary elements that go into those

1914
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:24,479
terrific

1915
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,239
enzymes that are in your plant

1916
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:30,559
those 10 000 individual enzymes of which

1917
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:33,839
there are a thousand of each are going

1918

1919
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,840
that's that's just all it really takes

1920
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,400
this is such a wonderful hobby

1921
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,960

01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:01,759
want and you can get some humus from

1929
